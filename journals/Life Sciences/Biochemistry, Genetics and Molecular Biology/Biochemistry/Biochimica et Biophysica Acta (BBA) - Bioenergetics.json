     "abstract": "Up to half of the cellular energy gets lost owing to membrane proton leakage. The permeability of lipid bilayers to protons is by several orders of magnitude higher than to other cations, which implies efficient proton-specific passages. The nature of these passages remains obscure. By combining experimental measurements of proton flow across phosphatidylcholine vesicles, steered molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of phosphatidylcholine bilayers and kinetic modelling, we have analyzed whether protons could pass between opposite phospholipid molecules when they sporadically converge. The MD simulations showed that each time, when the phosphorus atoms of the two phosphatidylcholine molecules got closer than 1.6\u202fnm, the eight oxygen atoms of their ester linkages could form a transmembrane \u2018oxygen passage\u2019 along which several water molecules aligned into a water wire. Proton permeability along such water wires would be limited by rearrangement of oxygen atoms, which could explain the experimentally shown independence of the proton permeability of pH, H2O/D2O substitution, and membrane dipole potential. We suggest that protons can cross lipid bilayers by moving along short, self-sustaining water wires supported by oxygen atoms of lipid ester linkages.",

     "abstract": "The \u03b3 subunit located at the center of ATP synthase (FOF1) plays critical roles in catalysis. Escherichia coli mutant with Pro substitution of the \u03b3 subunit residue \u03b3Leu218, which are located the rotor shaft near the c subunit ring, decreased NADH-driven ATP synthesis activity and ATP hydrolysis-dependent H+ transport of membranes to ~60% and ~40% of the wild type, respectively, without affecting FOF1 assembly. Consistently, the mutant was defective in growth by oxidative phosphorylation, indicating that energy coupling is impaired by the mutation. The \u03b5 subunit conformations in the \u03b3Leu218Pro mutant enzyme were investigated by cross-linking between cysteine residues introduced into both the \u03b5 subunit (\u03b5Cys118 and \u03b5Cys134, in the second helix and the hook segment, respectively) and the \u03b3 subunit (\u03b3Cys99 and \u03b3Cys260, located in the globular domain and the carboxyl-terminal helix, respectively). In the presence of ADP, the two \u03b3260 and \u03b5134 cysteine residues formed a disulfide bond in both the \u03b3Leu218Pro mutant and the wild type, indicating that the hook segment of \u03b5 subunit penetrates into the \u03b13\u03b23-ring along with the \u03b3 subunits in both enzymes. However, \u03b3260/\u03b5134 cross-linking in the \u03b3Leu218Pro mutant decreased significantly in the presence of ATP, whereas this effect was small in the wild type. These results suggested that the \u03b3 subunit carboxyl-terminal helix containing \u03b3Leu218 is involved in the conformation of the \u03b5 subunit hook region during ATP hydrolysis and, therefore, is required for energy coupling in FOF1.",

     "abstract": "In angiosperms, cyclic electron transport (CET) around photosystem I (PSI) consists of two pathways, depending on PGR5/PGRL1 proteins and the chloroplast NDH complex. In single mutants defective in chloroplast NDH, photosynthetic electron transport is only slightly affected at low light intensity, but in double mutants impaired in both CET pathways photosynthesis and plant growth are severely affected. The question is whether this strong mutant phenotype observed in double mutants can be simply explained by the additive effect of defects in both CET pathways. In this study, we used the weak mutant allele of pgr5-2 for the background of double mutants to avoid possible problems caused by the secondary effects due to the strong mutant phenotype. In two double mutants, crr2-2 pgr5-2 and ndhs-1 pgr5-2, the plant growth was unaffected and linear electron transport was only slightly affected. However, NPQ induction was more severely impaired in the double mutants than in the pgr5-2 single mutant. A similar trend was observed in the size of the proton motive force. Despite the slight reduction in photosystem II parameters, PSI parameters were severely affected in the pgr5-2 single mutant, the phenotype that was further enhanced by adding the NDH defects. Despite the lack of \u2206pH-dependent regulation at the cytochrome b6f complex (donor-side regulation of PSI), the plastoquinone pool was more reduced in the double mutants than in the pgr5-2 single mutants. This phenotype suggests that both PGR5/PGRL1- and NDH-dependent CET contribute to supply sufficient acceptors from PSI by balancing the ATP/NADPH production ratio.",

Although we have recently determined the crystal structure of Trypanosoma brucei AOX (TAO) in the presence and absence of ascofuranone (AF) derivatives (which are potent mixed type inhibitors) the mechanism by which ubiquinol and dioxygen binds to TAO remain inconclusive. In this article, ferulenol was identified as the first competitive inhibitor of AOX which has been used to probe the binding of ubiquinol. Surface plasmon resonance reveals that AF is a quasi-irreversible inhibitor of TAO whilst ferulenol binding is completely reversible. The structure of the TAO-ferulenol complex, determined at 2.7\u202f\u00c5, provided insights into ubiquinol binding and has also identified a potential dioxygen molecule bound in a side-on conformation to the diiron center for the first time.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "The regulation of photosystem I (PSI) redox state under fluctuating light was investigated for four species using P700 measurement and electrochromic shift analysis. Species included the angiosperms Camellia japonica, Bletilla striata and Arabidopsis thaliana and the fern Cyrtomium fortunei. For the first seconds after transition from low to high light, all species showed relatively low levels of the proton gradient (\u0394pH) across the thylakoid membranes. At this moment, PSI was highly oxidized in C. japonica and C. fortunei but was over-reduced in B. striata and A. thaliana. In B. striata and A. thaliana, the redox state of PSI was largely dependent on \u0394pH. In contrast, the rapid oxidation of P700 in C. japonica was relatively independent of \u0394pH, but was mainly dependent on the outflow of electrons to O2 via the water-water cycle. In the fern C. fortunei, PSI redox state was rapidly regulated by the fast photo-reduction of O2 rather than the \u0394pH. These results indicate that mechanisms regulating PSI redox state under fluctuating light differ greatly between species. We propose that the water-water cycle is an important mechanism regulating the PSI redox state in angiosperms.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) is highly abundant in rapidly proliferating cells that utilize aerobic glycolysis, such as stem cells, cancer cells, and cells of the immune system. However, the function of UCP2 has been a longstanding conundrum. Considering the strict regulation and unusually short life time of the protein, we propose that UCP2 acts as a \u201csignaling protein\u201d under nutrient shortage in cancer cells. We reveal that glutamine shortage induces the rapid and reversible downregulation of UCP2, decrease of the metabolic activity and proliferation of neuroblastoma cells, that are regulated by glutamine per se but not by glutamine metabolism. Our findings indicate a very rapid (within 1\u202fh) metabolic adaptation that allows the cell to survive by either shifting its metabolism to the use of the alternative fuel glutamine or going into a reversible, more quiescent state. The results imply that UCP2 facilitates glutamine utilization as an energetic fuel source, thereby providing metabolic flexibility during glucose shortage. The targeting UCP2 by drugs to intervene with cancer cell metabolism may represent a new strategy for treatment of cancers resistant to other therapies.",

     "abstract": "Molybdoenzymes are ubiquitous in living organisms and catalyze, for most of them, oxidation-reduction reactions using a large range of substrates. Periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapAB) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides catalyzes the 2-electron reduction of nitrate into nitrite. Its active site is a Mo bis-(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide), or Mo-bisPGD, found in most prokaryotic molybdoenzymes. A [4Fe-4S] cluster and two c-type hemes form an intramolecular electron transfer chain that deliver electrons to the active site. Lysine 56 is a highly conserved amino acid which connects, through hydrogen-bonds, the [4Fe-4S] center to one of the pyranopterin ligands of the Mo-cofactor. This residue was proposed to be involved in the intramolecular electron transfer, either defining an electron transfer pathway between the two redox cofactors, and/or modulating their redox properties.In this work, we investigated the role of this lysine by combining site-directed mutagenesis, activity assays, redox titrations, EPR and HYSCORE spectroscopies. Removal of a positively-charged residue at position 56 strongly decreased the redox potential of the [4Fe-4S] cluster at pH\u202f8 by 230\u202fmV to 400\u202fmV in the K56H and K56M mutants, respectively, thus affecting the kinetics of electron transfer from the hemes to the [4Fe-4S] center up to 5 orders of magnitude. This effect was partly reversed at acidic pH in the K56H mutant likely due to protonation of the imidazole ring of the histidine. Overall, our study demonstrates the critical role of a charged residue from the second coordination sphere in tuning the reduction potential of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in RsNapAB and related molybdoenzymes.",

They likely evolved before becoming the effector (quenching) domain of the modular Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). The number of discrete HCP families\u2014at least nine\u2014suggests they are involved in multiple distinct functions. Here we report the 1.7\u202f\u00c5 crystal structure of HCP2, one of the most widespread HCPs found in nature, from the chromatically acclimating cyanobacterium Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7601. By purifying HCP2 from the native source we are able to identify its natively-bound carotenoid, which is exclusively canthaxanthin. In solution, HCP2 is a monomer with an absorbance maximum of 530\u202fnm. However, the HCP2 crystals have a maximum absorbance at 548\u202fnm, which is accounted by the stacking of the \u03b21 rings of the carotenoid in the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Our results demonstrate how HCPs provide a valuable system to study carotenoid-protein interactions and their spectroscopic implications, and contribute to efforts to understand the functional roles of this large, newly discovered family of pigment proteins, which to-date remain enigmatic.",

It is described to be complementary to the linear electron flow and essential for photosynthesis. However, despite many efforts aimed to characterize CEF, its pathway and its regulation modes remain equivocal, and its physiological significance is still not clear. Here we use novel spectroscopic to measure the rate of CEF at the onset of light in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The initial redox state of the photosynthetic chain or the oxygen concentration do not modify the initial maximal rate of CEF (60 electrons per second per PSI) but rather strongly influence its duration. Neither the maximal rate nor the duration of CEF are different in the pgrl1 mutant compared to the wild type, disqualifying PGRL1 as the ferredoxin-plastoquinone oxidoreductase involved in the CEF mechanism.",

From the later part of the previous century, pump\u2013probe and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy provided an impressive amount of information. Being simple to grasp, these methods are well-understood and widely used by the photosynthesis research community. In the last fifteen years, two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy was developed. It has significant advantages over other methods, in particular higher temporal resolution available and higher signal-to-noise ratio. Even though it provides considerable opportunities in research, both its experimental realization and theoretical description are rather complicated, making it somewhat difficult to understand and apply. This makes an unfortunate gap in the community, with spectroscopy experts being able to use the technique, but sometimes lacking the relevant biological knowledge, while biologists having that knowledge are dubious about 2D spectroscopy due to the complexity of the approach. This publication is an attempt to fill this gap by providing an accessible introduction to the concepts, principles and possible applications of the 2D spectroscopy, aimed at the biologically trained members of the photosynthesis research community.",

However, when the complexes are allowed to disassemble into trimers in low phosphate (50\u202fmM) buffer, differences are clearly observed. The fluorescence properties of intact or disassembled phycobilisomes from cells grown in low intensity white light are unresponsive to variation in phosphate concentration. This antenna complex was further studied in detail with application of femtosecond time-resolved absorption at room temperature.

     "abstract": "The monomeric chlorophyll, ChlD1, which is located between the PD1PD2 chlorophyll pair and the pheophytin, PheoD1, is the longest wavelength chlorophyll in the heart of Photosystem II and is thought to be the primary electron donor. Its central Mg2+ is liganded to a water molecule that is H-bonded to D1/T179. Here, two site-directed mutants, D1/T179H and D1/T179V, were made in the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus elongatus, and characterized by a range of biophysical techniques. The Mn4CaO5 cluster in the water-splitting site is fully active in both mutants. Changes in thermoluminescence indicate that i) radiative recombination occurs via the repopulation of *ChlD1 itself; ii) non-radiative charge recombination reactions appeared to be faster in the T179H-PSII; and iii) the properties of PD1PD2 were unaffected by this mutation, and consequently iv) the immediate precursor state of the radiative excited state is the ChlD1+PheoD1\u2212 radical pair. Chlorophyll bleaching due to high intensity illumination correlated with the amount of 1O2 generated. Comparison of the bleaching spectra with the electrochromic shifts attributed to ChlD1 upon QA\u2212 formation, indicates that in the T179H-PSII and in the WT*3-PSII, the ChlD1 itself is the chlorophyll that is first damaged by 1O2, whereas in the T179V-PSII a more red chlorophyll is damaged, the identity of which is discussed. Thus, ChlD1 appears to be one of the primary damage site in recombination-mediated photoinhibition. Finally, changes in the absorption of ChlD1 very likely contribute to the well-known electrochromic shifts observed at ~430\u202fnm during the S-state cycle.",

Here, we performed a thorough investigation of effects of usnic acid and its analogues on artificial planar bilayer lipid membrane (BLM), rat liver mitochondria and bacteria. Surprisingly enough, all of the three hydroxyl groups of UA appeared to be involved in its proton-shuttling activity on BLM. We ascribed this fact to an ability of UA to form complexes with calcium ions, aiding it in cycling protons across the membrane. Actually, the addition of calcium ions markedly stimulated the UA-induced electrical current across BLM. By using the calcium ionophore A23187, we proved the involvement of calcium ions in the UA uncoupling action on isolated rat liver mitochondria. The calcium-chelating property of UA was demonstrated here by the method of extracting metal ions into a hydrophobic phase. Modification of any of the hydroxyl groups in UA dramatically reduced not only the UA-induced current across BLM and the UA-mediated calcium extraction, but also the uncoupling activity of UA in mitochondria and the inhibiting effect of UA on the growth of Bacillus subtilis. The ability of UA to cause dissipation of membrane potential in isolated liver mitochondria and bacterial cells was shown here for the first time. In view of the data obtained, the protonophoric activity of UA is considered to make a significant contribution to its antibacterial action.",

In the presence of divalent metal ions (e.g. Cd2+) or in some (\u201cproton transfer\u201d) mutants (L210DN/M17DN or L213DN), the proton delivery to QB\u2212 is made rate limiting and the properties of the proton pathway can be directly examined. We found that small weak acids and buffers in large concentrations (up to 1\u202fM) were able to rescue the severely impaired proton transfer capability differently depending on the location of the defects: lesions at the protein surface (proton gate H126H/H128H\u202f+\u202fCd2+), beneath the surface (M17DN\u202f+\u202fCd2+, L210DN/M17DN) or deep inside the protein (L213DN) could be completely, partially or to very small extent recovered, respectively. Small zwitterionic acids (azide/hydrazoic acid) and buffers (tricine) proved to be highly effective rescuers consistent with their enhanced binding affinity and access to any of the proton acceptors (including QB\u2212 itself) in the pathway. As a consequence, back titration of the protons at L212Glu could be observed as a pH-dependence of the rate constant of the charge recombination in the presence of azide or formate. Model calculations support the collective influence of the acid cluster on the change of the protonation states upon extension of the cluster with the bound small acid. In proton transfer mutants, the rescuing agents decreased the free energy of activation together with their enthalpic and entropic components. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that they function as protein-penetrating protonophores delivering protons into the chain and select dominating paths out of many alternate routes.

Synthesis of [NiFe] hydrogenases involves a complex series of biochemical reactions to assemble protein subunits and metallic cofactors required for enzyme function. A final step in this biosynthetic pathway is the processing of a C-terminal tail (CTT) from its large subunit, thus allowing proper insertion of nickel in the unique NiFe(CN)2CO cofactor present in these enzymes. In silico modelling and Molecular Dynamics (MD) analyses of processed vs. unprocessed forms of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae (Rlv) hydrogenase large subunit HupL showed that its CTT (residues 582-596) is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that likely provides the required flexibility to the protein for the final steps of proteolytic maturation. Prediction of pKa values of ionizable side chains in both forms of the enzyme's large subunit also revealed that the presence of the CTT strongly modify the protonation state of some key residues around the active site. Furthermore, MD simulations and mutant analyses revealed that two glutamate residues (E27 in the N-terminal region and E589 inside the CTT) likely contribute to the process of nickel incorporation into the enzyme. Computational analysis also revealed structural details on the interaction of Rlv hydrogenase LSU with the endoprotease HupD responsible for the removal of CTT.",

At least two light-driven mechanisms of excited energy quenching in phycobilisomes have been identified: the dominant mechanism in many strains of cyanobacteria depends on the orange carotenoid protein (OCP), while the second mechanism is intrinsically available to a phycobilisome and is possibly activated faster than the former. Recent single molecule spectroscopy studies have shown that far-red (FR) emission states are related to the OCP-dependent mechanism and it was proposed that the second mechanism may involve similar states. In this study, we examined the dynamics of simultaneously measured emission spectra and intensities from a large set of individual phycobilisome complexes from Synechocystis PCC 6803. Our results suggest a direct relationship between FR spectral states and thermal energy dissipating states and can be explained by a single phycobilin pigment in the phycobilisome core acting as the site of both quenching and FR emission likely due to the presence of a charge-transfer state. Our experimental method provides a means to accurately resolve the fluorescence lifetimes and spectra of the FR states, which enabled us to quantify a kinetic model that reproduces most of the experimentally determined properties of the FR states.",

Extending the absorption cross section of isolated RC through covalent functionalization with ad-hoc synthesized artificial antennas is a successful strategy to outperform the efficiency of the pristine photoenzyme under visible light excitation. Here we report a new heptamethine cyanine antenna that, upon covalent binding to RC, forms a biohybrid (hCyN7-RC) which, under white light excitation, has doubled photoconversion efficiency versus the bare photoenzyme. The artificial antenna hCyN7 successfully meets appropriate optical properties, i.e. peak position of absorption and emission maximum in the visible and NIR region respectively, large Stokes shift, and high fluorescence quantum yield, required for improving the efficiency of the biohybrid in the production of the charge-separated state in the RC. The kinetics of energy transfer and charge separation of hCyN7-RC studied via ultrafast visible and IR spectroscopies are here presented. The antenna transfers energy to RC chromophores within <10\u202fps and the rate of QA reduction is doubled compared to the native RC. These experiments further demonstrate hCyN7-RC, besides being an extremely efficient white light photoconverter, fully retains the charge separation mechanism and integrity of the native RC photoenzyme, thus allowing to envisage its suitability as biohybrid material in bioinspired systems for solar energy conversion.",

Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), specific for these tissues, is the key factor for heat production. Recent molecular aspects of UCP1 structure provide support for the fatty acid cycling model of coupling, i.e. when UCP1 expels fatty acid anions in a uniport mode from the matrix, while uncoupling. Protonophoretic function is ensured by return of the protonated fatty acid to the matrix independent of UCP1. This mechanism is advantageous for mitochondrial uncoupling and compatible with heat production in a pro-thermogenic environment, such as BAT. It must still be verified whether posttranslational modification of UCP1, such as sulfenylation of Cys253, linked to redox activity, promotes UCP1 activity. BAT biogenesis and UCP1 expression, has also been linked to the pro-oxidant state of mitochondria, further endorsing a redox signalling link promoting an establishment of pro-thermogenic state.

When MgADP is bound without phosphate in the catalytic site, the enzyme lapses into an inactive state with MgADP trapped.In chloroplasts and mitochondria, as well as in most bacteria, phosphate prevents MgADP inhibition. However, in Escherichia coli ATP synthase ADP-inhibition is relatively weak and phosphate does not prevent it but seems to enhance it.We found that a single amino acid residue in subunit \u03b2 is responsible for these features of E. coli enzyme. Mutation \u03b2L249Q significantly enhanced ADP-inhibition in E. coli ATP synthase, increased the extent of ATP hydrolysis stimulation by sulfite, and rendered the ADP-inhibition sensitive to phosphate in the same manner as observed in FOF1 from mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most aerobic\\photosynthetic bacteria.",

Eleven (out of twelve) ion-coordinating residues are highly conserved among eukaryotic and prokaryotic NCXs, whereas in NCLX, nine (out of twelve) ion-coordinating residues are different. Consequently, NCXs exhibit high selectivity for Na+ and Ca2+, whereas NCLX can exchange Ca2+ with either Na+ or Li+. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and physiological relevance remain unresolved. Here, we analyzed the NCX_Mj-derived mutant NCLX_Mj (with nine substituted residues) imitating the ion selectivity of NCLX. Site-directed fluorescent labeling and ion flux assays revealed the nearly symmetric accessibility of ions to the extracellular and cytosolic vestibules in NCLX_Mj (Kint\u202f=\u202f0.8\u20131.4), whereas the extracellular vestibule is predominantly accessible to ions (Kint\u202f=\u202f0.1\u20130.2) in NCX_Mj. HDX-MS (hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass-spectrometry) identified symmetrically rigidified core helix segments in NCLX_Mj, whereas the matching structural elements are asymmetrically rigidified in NCX_Mj. The HDX-MS analyses of ion-induced conformational changes and the mutational effects on ion fluxes revealed that the \u201cCa2+-site\u201d (SCa) of NCLX_Mj binds Na+, Li+, or Ca2+, whereas one or more additional Na+/Li+ sites of NCLX_Mj are incompatible with the Na+ sites (Sext and Sint) of NCX_Mj. Thus, the replacement of ion-coordinating residues in NCLX_Mj alters not only the ion selectivity of NCLX_Mj, but also the capacity and affinity for Na+/Li+ (but not for Ca2+) binding, bidirectional ion-accessibility, the response of the ion-exchange to membrane potential changes, and more. These structure-controlled functional features could be relevant for differential contributions of NCX and NCLX to Ca2+ homeostasis in distinct sub-cellular compartments.",

Our models show distinct structural and dynamic similarities to the core architecture of the bacterial and mammalian respiratory complex I. We identify putative plastoquinone-binding sites that are coupled by an electrostatic wire to the proton pumping elements in the membrane domain of the enzyme. Molecular simulations suggest that the NDH-1L isoform undergoes large-scale hydration changes that support proton-pumping within antiporter-like subunits, whereas the terminal subunit of the NDH-1MS isoform lacks such structural motifs.

We then adjusted the B800 site and systematically assessed the binding of non-native pigments. We find that Arg\u221210 of the LH2 \u03b2 polypeptide plays a crucial role in binding specificity, by providing a hydrogen-bond to the 3-acetyl group of native and non-native pigments. Reconstituted LH2 complexes harbouring the series of (B)Chls were examined by transient absorption and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopies. Although slowed 10-fold to ~6\u202fps, energy transfer from Chl\u202fa to B850 BChl\u202fa remained highly efficient. We measured faster energy-transfer time constants for Chl\u202fd (3.5\u202fps) and Chl\u202ff (2.7\u202fps), which have red-shifted absorption maxima compared to Chl\u202fa. BChl\u202fb, red-shifted from the native BChl\u202fa, gave extremely rapid (\u22640.1\u202fps) transfer.

A number of species are known to employ mainly a unique class of LHC containing red-shifted chlorophyll a (Chl a) forms absorbing above 690\u202fnm. This appears to be an adaptation to shaded habitats. Here we present a detailed investigation of excitation energy flow in the red-shifted light-harvesting antenna of eustigmatophyte Trachydiscus minutus using time-resolved fluorescence and ultrafast transient absorption measurements. The main carotenoid in the complex is violaxanthin, hence this LHC is labeled the red-violaxanthin-Chl a protein, rVCP. Both the carotenoid-to-Chl a energy transfer and excitation dynamics within the Chl a manifold were studied and compared to the related antenna complex, VCP, that lacks the red-Chl a. Two spectrally defined carotenoid pools were identified in the red antenna, contributing to energy transfer to Chl a, mostly via S2 and hot S1 states. Also, Chl a triplet quenching by carotenoids is documented. Two separate pools of red-shifted Chl a were resolved, one is likely formed by excitonically coupled Chl a molecules.

Spectral and functional characteristics of photosynthetic membranes revealed numerous similarities of the effects of \u03b1-particles and space flight, which both interrupted excitation energy transfer from phycobilisomes to the photosystems and significantly reduced the concentration of phycobiliproteins. Although photosynthetic activity was severely suppressed, the effect was reversible, and the cells could rapidly recover from the stress.

I\u2212-bound MrHR undergoes a photocycle but lacks the intermediates after L, suggesting that, in the Cl\u2212-pumping photocycle, Cl\u2212 moves to the cytoplasmic (CP) channel during L decay. A photocycle similar to that of the I\u2212-bound form was also observed for a mutant of the Asp200 residue, which is superconserved and assumed to be deprotonated in most microbial rhodopsins. This residue is probably close to the Cl\u2212-binding site and the protonated Schiff base, in which a chromophore retinal binds to a specific Lys residue. However, the D200N mutation affected neither the Cl\u2212-binding affinity nor the absorption spectrum, but completely eliminated the Cl\u2212-pumping function. Thus, the Asp200 residue probably protonates in the dark state but deprotonates during the photocycle. Indeed, a H+ release was detected for photolyzed MrHR by using an indium\u2011tin oxide electrode, which acts as a good time-resolved pH sensor. This H+ release disappeared in the I\u2212-bound form of the wild-type and Cl\u2212-bound form of the D200N mutant.

     "abstract": "During the millions of years of evolution, photosynthetic organisms have adapted to almost all terrestrial and aquatic habitats, although some environments are obviously more suitable for photosynthesis than others. Photosynthetic organisms living in low-light conditions require on the one hand a large light-harvesting apparatus to absorb as many photons as possible. On the other hand, the excitation trapping time scales with the size of the light-harvesting system, and the longer the distance over which the formed excitations have to be transferred, the larger the probability to lose excitations. Therefore a compromise between photon capture efficiency and excitation trapping efficiency needs to be found. Here we report results on the whole cells of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum. Its efficiency of excitation energy transfer and charge separation enables the organism to live in environments with very low illumination. Using fluorescence measurements with picosecond resolution, we estimate that despite a rather large size and complex composition of its light-harvesting apparatus, the quantum efficiency of its photochemistry is around ~87% at 20\u202f\u00b0C, ~83% at 45\u202f\u00b0C, and about ~81% at 77\u202fK when part of the excitation energy is trapped by low-energy bacteriochlorophyll a molecules. The data are evaluated using target analysis, which provides further insight into the functional organization of the low-light adapted photosynthetic apparatus.",

     "abstract": "The phycobilisome (PBS) is a giant highly-structured pigment-protein antenna of cyanobacteria and red algae. PBS is composed of the phycobiliproteins and several linker polypeptides. The large core-membrane linker protein (LCM or ApcE) influences many features and functions of PBS and consists of several domains including the chromophorylated PB-domain. Being homologous to the phycobiliprotein \u03b1-subunits this domain includes a so-called PB-loop insertion whose functions are still unknown. We have created the photoautotrophic mutant strain of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 with lacking PB-loop. Using various spectral techniques we have demonstrated that this mutation does not destroy the PBS integrity and the internal PBS excitation energy transfer pathways. At the same time, the deletion of the PB-loop leads to the decrease of connectivity between the PBS and thylakoid membrane and to the compensatory increase of the relative photosystem II content. Mutation provokes the violation of the thylakoid membranes arrangement, the inability to perform state transitions, and diminishing of the OCP-dependent non-photochemical PBS quenching. In essence, even such a minute mutation of the PBS polypeptide component, like the PB-loop deletion, becomes important for the concerted function of the photosynthetic apparatus.",

     "abstract": "The ubihydroquinone:cytochrome (cyt) c oxidoreductase (or cyt bc1) is an important enzyme for photosynthesis and respiration. In bacteria like Rhodobacter capsulatus, this membrane complex has three subunits, the iron\u2011sulfur protein (ISP) with its Fe2S2 cluster, cyt c1 and cyt b, forming two catalytic domains, the Qo (hydroquinone (QH2) oxidation) and Qi (quinone (Q) reduction) sites. At the Qo site, the electron transfer pathways originating from QH2 oxidation are known, but their associated proton release routes are less well defined. Earlier, we demonstrated that the His291 of cyt b is important for this latter process. In this work, using the bacterial cyt bc1 and site directed mutagenesis, we show that Lys329 of cyt b is also critical for electron and proton transfer at the Qo site. Of the mutants examined, Lys329Arg was photosynthesis proficient and had quasi-wild type cyt bc1 activity. In contrast, the Lys329Ala and Lys329Asp were photosynthesis-impaired and contained defective but assembled cyt bc1. In particular, the bifurcated electron transfer and associated proton(s) release reactions occurring during QH2 oxidation were drastically impaired in Lys329Asp mutant. Furthermore, in silico docking studies showed that in this mutant the location and the H-bonding network around the Fe2S2 cluster of ISP on cyt b surface was different than the wild type enzyme. Based on these experimental findings and theoretical considerations, we propose that the presence of a positive charge at position 329 of cyt b is critical for efficient electron transfer and proton release for QH2 oxidation at the Qo site of cyt bc1.",

     "abstract": "ESR from Exiguobacterium sibiricum is a retinal protein which functions as a proton pump. Unusual feature of ESR is that a lysine residue is present at a site for the internal proton donor, which in other proton pumps is a carboxylic residue. Replacement of Lys96 with alanine slows reprotonation of the Schiff base by two orders of magnitude, indicating that Lys96 and interacting water molecules function as internal proton donor to the Schiff base. In this work we examined time resolved generation of light-induced electric potential \u0394\u03a8 by the K96A mutant reconstituted into proteoliposomes. We found that the \u0394\u03a8 component, which accompanied reprotonation of the Schiff base in wild type ESR, was not only slowed but also decreased greatly in the mutant, and negative phase appeared at high pH. This indicates a higher probability of back reactions in ESR than in bacteriorhodopsin since no negative components have been observed in homologous mutants of BR, D96N and D96A. The higher rate of back reactions in ESR is probably caused by different arrangement of the proton acceptor site compared to that in BR and different sequence of proton release and uptake. Addition of sodium azide, which substitutes for the internal proton donor, restores both the rate and amplitude of the \u0394\u03a8 components related to the Schiff base reprotonation in the K96A mutant. This indicates that overall proton transport results from competition of forward and reverse reactions, and emphasizes the importance of internal donor for high efficiency and directionality of H+ transfer.",

The Epsilonproteobacterium Wolinella succinogenes uses the copper-containing octahaem cytochrome c sulfite reductase MccA to respire sulfite. MccA is encoded by the first gene of the mcc gene cluster, whose transcription is apparently induced by the two-component regulatory system MccRS. It has been proposed that the iron\u2011sulfur protein MccC, the putative quinol dehydrogenase MccD, the copper chaperone MccL as well as menaquinone-6 (MK6) and/or 8-methylmenaquinone-6 (8-MMK6) are involved in the electron transport chain of W. succinogenes sulfite respiration. Here, non-polar W. succinogenes mutants were constructed that lacked MccC, MccD, MccL or the 8-MMK6-producing MK6 methyltransferase MqnK. Each mutant possessed a frameshift-corrected mccR gene, thus inducing mcc expression in the presence of a mixture of fumarate and sulfite as terminal electron acceptors. Under these conditions, growth by sulfite respiration of cells lacking MccA, MccC or MccD was found to be abolished. However, cells lacking MccL or 8-MMK6 still coupled formate oxidation to sulfite reduction and grew by sulfite respiration to some extent. The results indicate that MccR, MccC, MccD, MccL and 8-MMK6 are essential or significant components of W. succinogenes sulfite respiration.",

     "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is the most abundant protein of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) where it regulates transport of ions and metabolites in and out of the organelle. VDAC function is extensively studied in a lipid bilayer system that allows conductance monitoring of reconstituted channels under applied voltage. The process of switching from a high-conductance state, open to metabolites, to a variety of low-conducting states, which excludes metabolite transport, is termed voltage gating and the mechanism remains poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated the involvement of the membrane-solvated residue E73 in the gating process through \u03b2-barrel destabilization. However, there has been no direct experimental evidence of E73 involvement in VDAC1 voltage gating. Here, using electrophysiology measurements, we exclude the involvement of E73 in murine VDAC1 (mVDAC1) voltage gating process. With an established protocol of assessing voltage gating of VDACs reconstituted into planar lipid membranes, we definitively show that mVDAC1 gating properties do not change when E73 is replaced by either a glutamine or an alanine. We further demonstrate that cholesterol has no effect on mVDAC1 gating characteristics, though it was shown that E73 is coordinating residue in the cholesterol binding site. In contrast, we found a pronounced gating effect based on the charge of the phospholipid headgroup, where the positive charge stimulates and negative charge suppresses gating. These findings call for critical evaluation of the existing models of VDAC gating and contribute to our understanding of VDAC's role in control of MOM permeability and regulation of mitochondrial respiration and metabolism.",

This situation is especially pronounced in Photosystem I (PSI) containing red shifted chlorophylls (red Chls) with the excitation energy much lower than the primary donor. The present study was conducted to clarify light-harvesting dynamics of PSI isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 by using single-molecule spectroscopy at liquid\u2011nitrogen temperatures. Fluorescence emission at around 720\u202fnm from the red Chls in single PSI trimers was monitored at 80\u2013100\u202fK. Intermittent variations in the emission intensities, so-called blinking, were frequently observed. Its time scale lay in several tens of seconds. The blinking amplitude depended on the redox state of the phylloquinone (A1). Electrochromic shifts of Chls induced by the negative charge on A1 were calculated based on the X-ray crystallographic structure. A Chl molecule, Chl-A839 (numbering according to PDB 5OY0), bound near A1 was found to have a large electrochromic shift. This Chl has strong exciton coupling with neighboring Chl (A838) whose site energy was predicted to be determined by interaction with an arginine residue (ArgF84) [Adolphs et al., 2010]. A possible scenario of the blinking was proposed. Conformational fluctuations of ArgF84 seesaw the excitation-energy of Chl-A838, which perturbs the branching ratio of excitation-energy between the red Chl and the cationic form of P700 as a quencher. The electrochromic shift of Chl-A839 enhances the effect of the conformation dynamics of ArgF84.",

We show that divalent cations have an important influence on optimal pigment organisation and thus also on maintaining membrane appression. Thereby, monovalent cations are far less effective.

We previously showed that an equivalent thereof in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (aL237R) severely impairs subunit a assembly/stability and decreases by >90% the rate of mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Herein we identified three spontaneous first-site intragenic suppressors (aR237M, aR237T and aR237S) that fully restore ATP synthase assembly. However, mitochondrial ATP synthesis rate was only partially recovered (40\u201350% vs wild type yeast). In light of recently described high-resolution yeast ATP synthase structures, the detrimental consequences of the aL237R change can be explained by steric and electrostatic hindrance with the universally conserved subunit a arginine residue (aR176) that is essential to FO activity. aL237 together with three other nearby hydrophobic residues have been proposed to prevent ion shortage between two physically separated hydrophilic pockets within the FO.

The limited available redox free energy requires the proton pumps to operate close to equilibrium in order to maintain a high \u0394P, which in turn is needed to maintain a high phosphorylation potential. Current biochemical assays measure complex activities far from equilibrium and so shed little light on their function under physiological conditions. Here we combine absorption spectroscopy of the ETC hemes, NADH fluorescence spectroscopy and oxygen consumption to simultaneously measure the redox potential of the intermediate redox pools, the components of \u0394P and the electron flux in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages. We confirm that complex I and III operate near equilibrium and quantify the linear relationship between flux and disequilibrium as a metric of their function under physiological conditions. In addition, we quantify the dependence of complex IV turnover on \u0394P and the redox potential of cytochrome c to determine the complex IV driving force and find that the turnover is proportional to this driving force. This form of quantification is a more relevant metric of ETC function than standard biochemical assays and can be used to study the effect of mutations in either mitochondrial or nuclear genome affecting mitochondrial function, post-translation changes, different subunit isoforms, as well as the effect of pharmaceuticals on ETC function.",

The V185 of the D1 protein has been shown to be an important amino acid in PSII function (Dilbeck et al. Biochemistry 52 (2013) 6824\u20136833). Here, we have studied its role by making a V185T site-directed mutant in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. The properties of the V185T-PSII have been compared to those of the WT*3-PSII by using EPR spectroscopy, polarography, thermoluminescence and time-resolved UV\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy.

The V185 contributes to the stabilization of S2 into the low spin (LS), S\u202f=\u202f1/2, configuration. Indeed, in the V185T mutant a high proportion of S2 exhibits a high spin (HS), S\u202f=\u202f5/2, configuration.

Instead, in WT*3-PSII, a proton release kinetically much faster than the S2LSTyrZ\u202f\u2192\u202fS3TyrZ transition was observed and we propose that it occurs in the S2LSTyrZ\u202f\u2192\u202fS2HSTyrZ intermediate step before the S2HSTyrZ\u202f\u2192\u202fS3TyrZ transition occurs. The dramatic slowdown of the S3TyrZ\u202f\u2192\u202fS0TyrZ transition in the V185T mutant does not originate from a structural modification of the Mn4CaO5 cluster since the spin S\u202f=\u202f3\u202fS3 EPR signal is not modified in the mutant. More probably, it is indicative of the strong implication of V185 in the tuning of an efficient relaxation processes of the H-bond network and/or of the protein.",

     "abstract": "Plants show complex responses to abiotic stress while, the effect of the stress combinations can be different to those seen when each stress is applied individually. Here, we report on the effects of salt and/or cadmium on photosynthetic apparatus of Thellungiella salsuginea. Our results showed a considerable reduction of plant growth with some symptoms of toxicity, especially with cadmium treatment. The structural integrity of both photosystems (PSI and PSII) was mostly maintained under salt stress. Cadmium induced a considerable decrease of both PSI and PSII quantum yields and the electron transport rate ETR(I) and ETR(II) paralleled by an increase of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). In addition, cadmium alone affects the rate of primary photochemistry by an increase of fluorescence at O-J phase and also the photo-electrochemical quenching at J-I phase. A positive L-band appeared with (Cd) treatment as an indicator of lower PSII connectivity, and a positive K-band reflecting the imbalance in number of electrons at donor and acceptor side. In continuity to our previous studies which showed that NaCl supply reduced Cd2+ uptake and limited its accumulation in shoot of divers halophyte species, here as a consequence, we demonstrated the NaCl-induced enhancement effect of Cd2+ toxicity on the PSII activity by maintaining the photosynthetic electron transport chain as evidenced by the differences in \u03c8O, \u03c6Eo, ABS/RC and TR0/RC and by improvement of performance index PI(ABS), especially after short time of treatment. A significant decrease of LHCII, D1 and CP47 amounts was detected under (Cd) treatment. However, NaCl supply alleviates the Cd2+ effect on protein abundance including LHCII and PSII core complex (D1 and CP47).",

Forward and backward electron transfer rates from A1A\u2212 and A1B\u2212 to FX, and charge recombination rates from A0\u2212, A1B\u2212, A1A\u2212, FX\u2212, and [FA/FB]\u2212 to P700+ were measured in P700\u2013FA/FB complexes, P700\u2013FX cores, and P700\u2013A1 cores, both in liquid and in a trehalose glassy matrix at 11% humidity. By comparing CONTIN-resolved kinetic events over 6 orders of time in increasingly simplified versions of PS I at 480\u202fnm, a wavelength that reports primarily A1A\u2212/A1B\u2212 oxidation, and over 9 orders of time at 830\u202fnm, a wavelength that reports P700+ reduction and A0\u2212 oxidation, assignments could be made for nearly all of the resolved kinetic phases. Trehalose-embedded PS I samples demonstrated partially arrested forward electron transfer. The fractions of complexes in which electron transfer did not proceed beyond A0, A1 and FX were 53%, 16% and 22%, respectively, with only 10% of electrons reaching the terminal FA/FB clusters. The ~10\u202f\u03bcs and ~150\u202f\u03bcs components in both liquid and trehalose-embedded PS I were assigned to recombination between A1B\u2212 and P700+ and between A1A\u2212 and P700+, respectively. The kinetics and amplitudes of these resolved kinetic phases in liquid and trehalose-embedded PS I samples could be well-fitted by a kinetic model that allowed us to calculate the asymmetrical contribution of the A1A\u2212 and A1B\u2212 quinones to the electrochromic signal at 480\u202fnm.

     "abstract": "The genome of the sulfate-reducing and anaerobic bacterium Desulfovibrio fructosovorans encodes different hydrogenases. Among them is Hnd, a tetrameric cytoplasmic [FeFe] hydrogenase that has previously been described as an NADP-specific enzyme (Malki et al., 1995). In this study, we purified and characterized a recombinant Strep-tagged form of Hnd and demonstrated that it is an electron-bifurcating enzyme. Flavin-based electron-bifurcation is a mechanism that couples an exergonic redox reaction to an endergonic one allowing energy conservation in anaerobic microorganisms. One of the three ferredoxins of the bacterium, that was named FdxB, was also purified and characterized. It contains a low-potential (Em\u202f=\u202f\u2212450\u202fmV) [4Fe4S] cluster. We found that Hnd was not able to reduce NADP+, and that it catalyzes the simultaneous reduction of FdxB and NAD+. Moreover, Hnd is the first electron-bifurcating hydrogenase that retains activity when purified aerobically due to formation of an inactive state of its catalytic site protecting against O2 damage (Hinact). Hnd is highly active with the artificial redox partner (methyl viologen) and can perform the electron-bifurcation reaction to oxidize H2 with a specific activity of 10\u202f\u03bcmol of NADH/min/mg of enzyme. Surprisingly, the ratio between NADH and reduced FdxB varies over the reaction with a decreasing amount of FdxB reduced per NADH produced, indicating a more complex mechanism than previously described. We proposed a new mechanistic model in which the ferredoxin is recycled at the hydrogenase catalytic subunit.",

In AEM, ethanol-induced pore opening, as indicated by the release of calcein and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, can be inhibited by CsA, by Cpr3 deficiency, and by the antioxidant glutathione. Notably, the pore opening is inhibited, when mitochondria are preloaded by EGTA or Fluo3 to chelate matrix Ca2+, or are pretreated with 4-Br A23187 to extract matrix Ca2+, prior to agar-embedding, or when pore opening is induced in the presence of EGTA; opened pores are re-closed by sequential treatment with CsA, 4-Br A23187 plus EGTA and NADH, indicating endogenous matrix Ca2+ involvement. CsA also inhibits the pore opening with low conductance triggered by exogenous Ca2+ transport with ETH129. In AEC, the treatment of tert-butylhydroperoxide, a pro-oxidant that triggers transient pore opening in high conductance in AEM, induces yeast death, which is also dependent on CsA and Cpr3. Furthermore, AEMs from mutants lacking three ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) isoforms and with defective ATP synthase dimerization exhibit high and low conductance pore openings with CsA sensitivity, respectively. Collectively, these data show that the yeast PTP is regulated by Cpr3, endogenous matrix Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species, and that it is involved in yeast death; furthermore, ATP synthase dimers play a key role in CsA-sensitive pore formation, while AACs are dispensable.",

     "abstract": "The heme\u2011copper oxidases (HCuOs) are terminal components of the respiratory chain, catalyzing oxygen reduction coupled to the generation of a proton motive force. The C-family HCuOs, found in many pathogenic bacteria under low oxygen tension, utilize a single proton uptake pathway to deliver protons both for O2 reduction and for proton pumping. This pathway, called the KC-pathway, starts at Glu-49P in the accessory subunit CcoP, and connects into the catalytic subunit CcoN via the polar residues Tyr-(Y)-227, Asn (N)-293, Ser (S)-244, Tyr (Y)-321 and internal water molecules, and continues to the active site. However, although the residues are known to be functionally important, little is known about the mechanism and dynamics of proton transfer in the KC-pathway. Here, we studied variants of Y227, N293 and Y321. Our results show that in the N293L variant, proton-coupled electron transfer is slowed during single-turnover oxygen reduction, and moreover it shows a pH dependence that is not observed in wildtype. This suggests that there is a shift in the pKa of an internal proton donor into an experimentally accessible range, from >10 in wildtype to ~8.8 in N293L. Furthermore, we show that there are distinct roles for the conserved Y321 and Y227. In Y321F, proton uptake from bulk solution is greatly impaired, whereas Y227F shows wildtype-like rates and retains ~50% turnover activity. These tyrosines have evolutionary counterparts in the K-pathway of B-family HCuOs, but they do not have the same roles, indicating diversity in the proton transfer dynamics in the HCuO superfamily.",

By subtracting a (P700+A1\u2212\u202f\u2212\u202fP700A1) FTIR difference spectrum for PSI with the native phylloquinone (PhQ) incorporated from corresponding spectra for PSI with different benzoquinones (BQs) incorporated, FTIR double difference spectra are produced, that display bands associated with vibrational modes of the quinones, without interference from features associated with protein vibrational modes.Molecular models for BQs involved in asymmetric hydrogen bonding were constructed and used in vibrational mode frequency calculations. The calculated data were used to aid in the interpretation and assignment of bands in the experimental spectra. We show that the calculations capture the general trends found in the experimental spectra.By comparing four different FTIR double difference spectra we are able to verify unambiguously bands associated with phyllosemiquinone in PSI at 1495 and 1415\u202fcm\u22121. We also resolve a previously unrecognized band of phyllosemiquinone at 1476\u202fcm\u22121 that calculations suggest is due in part to a C4 \u2212 \u20db O stretching mode.For PSI with PQ incorporated, calculations and experiment taken together indicate that the C1 \u2212 \u20db O and C4 \u2212 \u20db O vibrational modes of the semiquinone give rise to bands at 1487 and 1444\u202fcm\u22121, respectively.

In addition, some species of CcO can also reduce NO to N2O and water while others cannot. Here, the mechanism for NO-reduction in CcO is investigated using quantum mechanical calculations. Comparison is made to the corresponding reaction in a \u201ctrue\u201d cytochrome c-dependent NO reductase (cNOR). The calculations show that in cNOR, where the reduction potentials are low, the toxic NO molecules are rapidly reduced, while the higher reduction potentials in CcO lead to a slower or even impossible reaction, consistent with experimental observations. In both enzymes the reaction is initiated by addition of two NO molecules to the reduced active site, forming a hyponitrite intermediate. In cNOR, N2O can then be formed using only the active-site electrons. In contrast, in CcO, one proton-coupled reduction step most likely has to occur before N2O can be formed, and furthermore, proton transfer is most likely rate-limiting. This can explain why different CcO species with the same heme a3-Cu active site differ with respect to NO reduction efficiency, since they have a varying number and/or properties of proton channels. Finally, the calculations also indicate that a conserved active site valine plays a role in reducing the rate of NO reduction in CcO.",

We demonstrated by in vitro approaches that PPTC7 is a bona fide protein phosphatase that dephosphorylates the human COQ7. Expression modulation experiments determined that human PPTC7 dictates cellular CoQ10 content. Using two different approaches (PPTC7 over-expression and caloric restriction), we demonstrated that PPTC7 facilitates and improves the human cell adaptation to respiratory conditions.

Here two members of this family, Ymc2p from S. cerevisiae and BOU from Arabidopsis, have been thoroughly characterized. These proteins were overproduced in bacteria and reconstituted into liposomes. Their transport properties and kinetic parameters demonstrate that Ymc2p and BOU transport glutamate, and to a much lesser extent L-homocysteinesulfinate, but not other amino acids and many other tested metabolites. Transport catalyzed by both carriers was saturable, inhibited by mercuric chloride and dependent on the proton gradient across the proteoliposomal membrane. The growth phenotype of S. cerevisiae cells lacking the genes ymc2 and agc1, which encodes the only other S. cerevisiae carrier capable to transport glutamate besides aspartate, was fully complemented by expressing Ymc2p, Agc1p or BOU. Mitochondrial extracts derived from ymc2\u0394agc1\u0394 cells, reconstituted into liposomes, exhibited no glutamate transport at variance with wild-type, ymc2\u0394 and agc1\u0394 cells, showing that S. cerevisiae cells grown in the presence of acetate do not contain additional mitochondrial transporters for glutamate besides Ymc2p and Agc1p. Furthermore, mitochondria isolated from wild-type, ymc2\u0394 and agc1\u0394 strains, but not from the double mutant ymc2\u0394agc1\u0394 strain, swell in isosmotic ammonium glutamate showing that glutamate is transported by Ymc2p and Agc1p together with a H+.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c Oxidase (CcO) reduces O2, the terminal electron acceptor, to water in the aerobic, respiratory electron transport chain. The energy released by O2 reductions is stored by removing eight protons from the high pH, N-side, of the membrane with four used for chemistry in the active site and four pumped to the low pH, P-side. The proton transfers must occur along controllable proton pathways that prevent energy dissipating movement towards the N-side. The CcO N-side has well established D- and K-channels to deliver protons to the protein interior. The P-side has a buried core of hydrogen-bonded protonatable residues designated the Proton Loading Site cluster (PLS cluster) and many protonatable residues on the P-side surface, providing no obvious unique exit. Hydrogen bond pathways were identified in Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectories of Rb. sphaeroides CcO prepared in the PR state with the heme a3 propionate and Glu286 in different protonation states. Grand Canonical Monte Carlo sampling of water locations, polar proton positions and residue protonation states in trajectory snapshots identify a limited number of water mediated, proton paths from PLS cluster to the surface via a (P-exit) cluster of residues. Key P-exit residues include His93, Ser168, Thr100 and Asn96. The hydrogen bonds between PLS cluster and P-exit clusters are mediated by a water wire in a cavity centered near Thr100, whose hydration can be interrupted by a hydrophobic pair, Leu255B (near CuA) and Ile99. Connections between the D channel and PLS via Glu286 are controlled by a second, variably hydrated cavity.Cytochrome C oxidase plays a crucial role in cellular respiration and energy generation. It reduces O2 to water and uses the released free energy to move protons across mitochondrial and bacterial cell membranes adding to the essential electrochemical gradient. Energy storage requires that protons are taken up from the high pH, N-side and released to the low pH, P-side of the membrane.

Many studies have investigated the functions of Y185, but its underlying mechanism during the bR photocycle remains unclear. To address this research gap, in situ two-dimensional (2D) magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) of specifically labelled bR, combined with light-induced transient absorption change measurements, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements, titration analysis and site-directed mutagenesis, was used to elucidate the functional roles of Y185 during the bR photocycle in the native membrane environment. Different interaction modes were identified between Y185 and the Ret chromophore in the dark-adapted (inactive) state and M (active) state, indicating that Y185 may serve as a rotamer switch maintaining the protein dynamics, and plays an important role in the efficient proton-pumping mechanism in the bR purple membrane.",

Metabolic redox dynamics were determined in the cytosol of living cells with high time resolution under biotechnologically relevant conditions, i.e. with high cell density and high aeration. Analytical boundary conditions for reliable analysis were determined, and perturbations in C-, N- or O- availability had marked impact on the cytosolic NADH/NAD+ ratio. NAD redox dynamics could be manipulated in lines inducibly expressing a water-forming NADH oxidase as a synthetic reductant sink.

In Pisum sativum, the leaf includes two main photosynthetic parts, the basal stipules and the leaflets. Since the stipules are less efficient in carbon fixation than leaflets, the adjustments of the thylakoid system, which safeguard the photosynthetic membrane against photodamage, were analysed. As compared to leaflets, the stipules experienced a decay in PSII photochemical activity. The supramolecular organization of photosystems in stipules showed a more conspicuous accumulation of large PSII-LHCII supercomplexes in the grana, but also a tendency to retain the PSI-LHCI-LHCII state transition complex and the PSI-LHCI-PSII-LHCII megacomplexes probably located at the interface between appressed and stroma-exposed membranes. As a consequence, stipules had a lower capacity to perform state transitions and the overall thylakoid architecture was less structurally flexible and ordered than in leaflets. Yet, stipules proved to be quite efficient in regulating the redox state of the electron transport chain and more capable of inducing NPQ than leaflets. It is proposed that, in spite of a relatively static thylakoid arrangement, LHCII interaction with both photosystems in megacomplexes can contribute to a regulated electron flow.",

Artifact-free H/D isotope effects on both PSII primary charge separation and water oxidation yields were determined as a function of flash rate from chlorophyll-a variable fluorescence yields. Intact lichens could be reversibly dehydrated/re-hydrated with H2O/D2O repeatedly without loss of O2 evolution, unlike all isolated PSII preparations. Above a threshold flash rate, PSII charge separation decreases sharply in both D2O and H2O, reflecting loss of excitation migration and capture by PSII. Changes in H/D coordinates further slow charge separation in D2O (\u221223% at 120\u202fHz), attributed to reoxidation of the primary acceptor QA\u2212. At intermediate flash rates (5\u201350\u202fHz) D2O decreases water oxidation efficiency (O2 evolution) by \u22122\u20135%. No significant isotopic difference is observed at slow flash rates (<5\u202fHz) where charge recombination dominates. Slower D2O diffusion, changes in hydrogen bonding networks, and shifts in the pKa's of ionizable residues may all contribute to these systematic variations of H/D isotope effects.

We have developed a new time-resolved infrared facility by introducing a flow system for transferring highly concentrated and thus viscous protein solution to a thin (50\u202f\u03bcm) flow cell equipped in a highly sensitive IR spectrometer constructed with the femtosecond mid-IR pulse laser with spectral width of 350\u202fcm\u22121 as an IR white light source equipped with multi-channel MCT detector. This facility equipped with O2 supply system enables the sub-millisecond time scale infrared measurements of the O2 reduction coupled with proton pumping by bovine cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) initiated by CO-flash photolysis in the COOH (1725\u20131770\u202fcm\u22121) region with the accuracy of about 10\u202f\u03bcO.D. under the background O.D. of 1. The facility identifies a band intensity change at ~1744\u202fcm\u22121 assignable to protonation of a carboxyl group coupled with a single electron transfer to the O2 reduction center within 1\u202fms after initiation of the reaction. The results suggest that the facility detects protonation of a single carboxyl group included in large proteins like as CcO (210\u202fkDa). The present facility sensitively identifies also polarity changes in COOH group by detecting shifts of the bands near 1750\u202fcm\u22121 and 1760\u202fcm\u22121, without significant intensity changes. These findings show the performance of this facility sufficiently high for providing crucial information for understanding the proton transferring mechanisms of protein carboxyl groups.",

The His-tagged enzyme is both structurally and functionally very similar to non-tagged cNOR. We were also able to express and purify cNOR from the structural genes norCB only, in absence of the accessory genes norQDEF. The produced protein is a stable NorCB complex containing all hemes and it can bind gaseous ligands (CO) to heme b3, but it is catalytically inactive. We show that this deficient cNOR lacks the non-heme iron cofactor FeB. Mutational analysis of the nor gene cluster revealed that it is the norQ and norD genes that are essential to form functional cNOR. NorQ belongs to the family of MoxR P-loop AAA+ ATPases, which are in general considered to facilitate enzyme activation processes often involving metal insertion. Our data indicates that NorQ and NorD work together in order to facilitate non-heme Fe insertion. This is noteworthy since in many cases Fe cofactor binding occurs spontaneously.

The relative amounts of excitation energy arriving at the RCs of photosystem I (PSI) and II (PSII) depend on the spectral composition of the light. To balance the excitations in both photosystems, cyanobacteria perform state transitions to equilibrate the excitation energy. They go to state I if PSI is preferentially excited, for example after illumination with blue light (light I), and to state II after illumination with green-orange light (light II) or after dark adaptation. In this study, we performed 77-K time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy on wild-type Synechococcus elongatus 7942 cells to measure how state transitions affect excitation energy transfer to PSI and PSII in different light conditions and to test the various models that have been proposed in literature. The time-resolved spectra show that the PSII core is quenched in state II and that this is not due to a change in excitation energy transfer from PSII to PSI (spill-over), either direct or indirect via phycobilisomes.",

Under high light, the immature leaves displayed high levels of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and P700 oxidation ratio, and higher values for proton motive force (pmf) and proton gradient (\u0394pH) across the thylakoid membranes but lower values for the activity of chloroplastic ATP synthase (gH+) than the mature leaves. Furthermore, gH+ was significantly and positively correlated with CO2 assimilation rate and linear electron flow (LEF), but negatively correlated with pmf and \u0394pH. \u0394pH was significantly correlated with LEF and the P700 oxidation ratio. These results indicated that gH+ was regulated to match photosynthetic capacity during leaf maturation, and the formation of pmf and \u0394pH was predominantly regulated by the alterations in gH+. In the immature leaves, the high steady-state \u0394pH increased lumen acidification, which, in turn, stimulated photoprotection for the photosynthetic apparatus via NPQ induction and photosynthetic control.

     "abstract": "Light-Harvesting Complex II (LHCII) is a chlorophyll-protein antenna complex that efficiently absorbs solar energy and transfers electronic excited states to photosystems I and II. Under excess light intensity LHCII can adopt a photoprotective state in which excitation energy is safely dissipated as heat, a process known as Non-Photochemical Quenching (NPQ). In vivo NPQ is triggered by combinatorial factors including transmembrane \u0394pH, PsbS protein and LHCII-bound zeaxanthin, leading to dramatically shortened LHCII fluorescence lifetimes. In vitro, LHCII in detergent solution or in proteoliposomes can reversibly adopt an NPQ-like state, via manipulation of detergent/protein ratio, lipid/protein ratio, pH or pressure. Previous spectroscopic investigations revealed changes in exciton dynamics and protein conformation that accompany quenching, however, LHCII-LHCII interactions have not been extensively studied. Here, we correlated fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) of trimeric LHCII adsorbed to mica substrates and manipulated the environment to cause varying degrees of quenching. AFM showed that LHCII self-assembled onto mica forming 2D-aggregates (25\u2013150\u202fnm width). FLIM determined that LHCII in these aggregates were in a quenched state, with much lower fluorescence lifetimes (~0.25\u202fns) compared to free LHCII in solution (2.2\u20133.9\u202fns). LHCII-LHCII interactions were disrupted by thylakoid lipids or phospholipids, leading to intermediate fluorescent lifetimes (0.6\u20130.9\u202fns). To our knowledge, this is the first in vitro correlation of nanoscale membrane imaging with LHCII quenching. Our findings suggest that lipids could play a key role in modulating the extent of LHCII-LHCII interactions within the thylakoid membrane and so the propensity for NPQ activation.",

Study of P700 oxidoreduction transients in dark-acclimated \u0394flv1/\u0394flv3 mutant under the action of successive white light pulses separated by dark intervals of various durations indicated that the delayed oxidation of P700 was determined by light activation of electron transport on the acceptor side of PSI. We show that the light-induced redox transients of chlorophyll P700 in dark-acclimated \u0394flv1/\u0394flv3 proceed within 2\u202fmin, as opposed to 1\u20133\u202fs in the wild type, and comprise a series of kinetic stages. The release of rate-limiting steps was eliminated by iodoacetamide, an inhibitor of Calvin cycle enzymes. Conversely, the creation with methyl viologen of a bypass electron flow to O2 accelerated P700 oxidation and made its extent comparable to that in the wild-type cells. The lack of major sinks for linear electron flow in iodoacetamide-treated \u0394flv1/\u0394flv3 mutant, in which O2- and CO2-dependent electron flows were impaired, facilitated cyclic electron flow, which was evident from the decreased steady-state oxidation of P700 and from rapid dark reduction of P700 during and after illumination with far-red light.

Mutagenesis of this Cys residue to a Gly opens an exchangeable coordination site to a corner iron atom that can be chemically rescued by an external thiolate ligand. This ligand can be subsequently displaced by mass action using a dithiol molecular wire to tether two redox active proteins. We intend to apply this technique to tethering Photosystem I to ferredoxin sulfite reductase (FdSiR), an enzyme that catalyzes the six-electron reduction of sulfite to hydrogen sulfite and nitrite to ammonia. The enzyme contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster and a siroheme active site.

However, the CCM remains poorly understood, especially in regards to the enigmatic CO2-hydration enzymes which couple photosynthetically generated redox energy to the hydration of CO2 to bicarbonate. This CO2-hydration reaction is catalysed by specialized forms of NDH-1 thylakoid membrane complexes that contain phylogenetically unique extrinsic proteins that appear to couple CO2 hydration to NDH-1 proton pumping. The development of the first molecular genetic system to probe structure-function relationships of this important enzyme system is described. A CO2-hydration deficient strain was constructed as a recipient for DNA constructs containing different forms of the CO2-hydration system. This was tested by introducing a construct to an ectopic location that gives constitutive expression, rather than native inducible expression, of the ndhF3-ndhD3-cupA-cupS, (cupA operon) encoding high affinity CO2-hydration complex, NDH-13. Uptake assays show the restoration of high affinity for CO2 uptake, but demonstrate that the CupA complex can drive only modest uptake fluxes, underlining the importance of its tandem operation with the CupB-containing complex NDH-14, the complementary high flux, low affinity CO2 hydration system. Experiments with the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, ethoxyzolamide, indicate that the NDH-13 complex is strongly inhibited, yet the remaining NDH-14 activity in the wild-type is less so, suggesting structural differences between the low affinity and high affinity CO2\u2013hydration systems.

     "abstract": "The present work reports reactions of plastoquinol (PQH2-9) and plastoquinone (PQ-9) in organic solvents and summarizes the literature to understand similar reactions in thylakoids. In thylakoids, PQH2-9 is oxidized by the cytochrome b6/f complex (Cyt b6/f) but some PQH2-9 is also oxidized by reactions in which oxygen acts as an electron acceptor and is converted to reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, PQH2-9 reacts with ROS. Light enhances oxygen-dependent oxidation of PQH2-9. We examined the oxidation of PQH2-9 via dismutation of PQH2-9 and PQ-9 and scavenging of the superoxide anion radical (O2\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by PQH2-9. Oxidation of PQH2-9 via dismutation to semiquinone was slow and independent of pH in organic solvents and in solvent/buffer systems, suggesting that intramembraneous oxidation of PQH2-9 in darkness mainly proceeds via reactions catalyzed by the plastid terminal oxidase and cytochrome b559. In the light, oxidation of PQH2-9 by singlet oxygen and by O2\u2212 formed in PSI contribute significantly. In addition, Cyt b6/f forms H2O2 with a PQH2-9 dependent mechanism. Measurements of the reaction of O2\u2212 with PQH2-9 and PQ-9 in acetonitrile showed that O2\u2212 oxidizes PQH2-9, forming PQ-9 and several PQ-9-derived products. The rate constant of the reaction between PQH2-9 and O2\u2212 was found to be 104\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121. H2O2 was found to oxidize PQH2-9 to PQ-9, but failed to oxidize all PQH2-9, suggesting that the oxidation of PQH2-9 by H2O2 proceeds via deprotonation mechanisms producing PQH\u2212-9, PQ2\u2212-9 and the protonated hydrogen peroxide cation, H3O2+.",

A detailed electrochemical characterization of OmcF was performed for the first time, allowing attaining kinetics and thermodynamic data. The heterogeneous electron transfer rate constant was determined at pH\u202f7 (0.16\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.01\u202fcm\u202fs\u22121) indicating that the protein displays high electron transfer efficiency compared to other monoheme cytochromes. The pH dependence of the redox potential indicates that the protein has an important redox-Bohr effect in the physiological pH range for G. sulfurreducens growth. The analysis of the structures of OmcF allowed us to assign the redox-Bohr centre to the side chain of His47 residue and its pKa values in the reduced and oxidized states were determined (pKox\u202f=\u202f6.73; pKred\u202f=\u202f7.55). The enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs free energy associated with the redox transaction were calculated, pointing the reduced form of the cytochrome as the most favourable. The data obtained indicate that G. sulfurreducens cells evolved to warrant a down-hill electron transfer from the periplasm to the outer-membrane associated cytochrome OmcF.",

Therefore, proteomic and kinetomic analyses were carried out of the mitochondrial (i) NADPH producing and (ii) GSH/GSSG recycling enzymes associated to oxidative stress management. The protein contents of the eight enzymes analyzed were similar or even higher in AS-30D rat hepatoma mitochondria (HepM) than in rat liver (RLM) and rat heart (RHM) mitochondria, suggesting that the NADPH/GSH/ROS pathway was fully functional in cancer mitochondria.The Vmax values of IDH-2 were much greater than those of GDH, TH and ME, suggesting that IDH-2 is the predominant NADPH producer in the three mitochondrial types; in fact, the GDH reverse reaction was favored. The Vmax values of GR and GPx were lower in HepM than in RLM, suggesting that the oxidative stress management is compromised in cancer mitochondria. The Km values of IDH-2, GR and GPx were all similar among the different mitochondrial types.Kinetic modeling revealed that the oxidative stress management was mainly controlled by GR, GPx and IDH. Modeling and experimentation also revealed that, due to their higher IDH-2 activity and lower GPx activity presumably by acetylation, HepM (i) showed higher steady-state NADPH levels; (ii) required greater peroxide concentrations to achieve reliable steady-state fluxes and metabolite concentration; and (iii) endured higher peroxide concentrations without collapsing their GSH/GSSG ratios. Then, to specifically prompt lower GSH/GSSG ratios under oxidative stress thus compromising cancer mitochondria functioning, GPx should be re-activated.",

     "abstract": "Transient absorption spectroscopy has been applied to investigate the energy dissipation mechanisms in the nonameric fucoxanthin-chlorophyll-a,c-binding protein FCPb of the centric diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana. FCPb complexes in their unquenched state were compared with those in two types of quenching environments, namely aggregation-induced quenching by detergent removal, and clustering via incorporation into liposomes. Applying global and target analysis, in combination with a fluorescence lifetime study and annihilation calculations, we were able to resolve two quenching channels in FCPb that involve chlorophyll-a pigments for FCPb exposed to both quenching environments. The fast quenching channel operates on a timescale of tens of picoseconds and exhibits similar spectral signatures as the unquenched state. The slower quenching channel operates on a timescale of tens to hundreds of picoseconds, depending on the degree of quenching, and is characterized by enhanced population of low-energy states between 680 and 710\u202fnm. The results indicate that FCPb is, in principle, able to function as a dissipater of excess energy and can do this in vitro even more efficiently than the homologous FCPa complex, the sole complex involved in fast photoprotection in these organisms. This indicates that when a complex displays photoprotection-related spectral signatures in vitro it does not imply that the complex participates in photoprotection in vivo. We suggest that FCPa is favored over FCPb as the sole energy-regulating complex in diatoms because its composition can more easily establish the balance between light-harvesting and quenching required for efficient photoprotection.",

Redox titration of Cyt b559 in different types of PS II membrane preparations was performed and revealed that (1) alteration of redox titration curve of Cyt b559 upon treatment of a sample is not specific to the type of treatment; (2) each value of RHP defines the individual shape of the redox titration curve; (3) population of Cyt b559 may exist in several stable forms with multicomponent redox pattern: three types of three-component redox pattern and one type of two-component redox pattern as well as in the form with a single Em; (4) transformation of Cyt b559 proceeds as successive conversion between the stable forms with multicomponent redox pattern; (5) upon harsh treatments, Cyt b559 abruptly converts into the state with a single Em which value is intermediate between the Em values of the two lower potential forms. Analysis of the data using the model of Cyt b559-quinone redox interaction revealed that diminution of RHP in a range from 80 to 10% reflects a shift in redox equilibrium between the heme group of Cyt b559 and the interacting quinone, due to a gradual decrease of 90\u202fmV in Em of the heme group at the virtually unchanged Em of the quinone component.",

Because of its sensitivity to antimycin A, PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 5 (PGR5)/PGR5-like Photosynthetic Phenotype 1 (PGRL1)-dependent CEF has been considered identical to the CEF of Arnon et al. However, this conclusion still needs additional supportive evidence, mainly because of the absence of definitive methods of evaluating CEF activity. In this study, we revisited the classical method of monitoring cyclic phosphorylation in ruptured chloroplasts to characterize two Arabidopsis mutants: pgr5, which is defective in antimycin A-sensitive CEF, and chlororespiratory reduction 2-1 (crr2-1), which is defective in chloroplast NDH-dependent CEF. We observed a significant reduction in CEF-dependent pmf formation and consequently ATP synthesis in the pgr5 mutant, although LEF-dependent pmf formation and ATP synthesis were not impaired at photosynthetic photon flux densities below 130\u202f\u03bcmol\u202fm\u22122\u202fs\u22121. In contrast, the contribution of chloroplast NDH complex to pmf formation and ATP synthesis was not significant. Antimycin A partially inhibited CEF-dependent pmf formation, although there may be further inhibition sites.

In order to observe energy transfer from the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) protein to the reaction center (RC), FMO was directly excited at ~800\u202fnm in transient absorption experiments. However, interpretation of the results is complicated by the spectral overlap between FMO and the RC. The availability of the Y16F FMO mutant, whose absorption spectrum is drastically different from that of the WT, has enabled the selection of spectral regions where either only FMO or the RC contributes. The application of a directed kinetic modeling approach, or target analysis, revealed the various decay and energy transfer pathways within the pigment-protein complexes.

Currently, crystal structures of these complexes are available for thermophilic prokaryotic cyanobacteria. The mega-Dalton trimeric PSI complex from thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus elongatus, was solved at 2.5\u202f\u00c5 resolution with X-ray crystallography. That structure revealed the positions of 12 protein subunits (PsaA-F, PsaI-M, and PsaX) and 127 cofactors.Although mesophilic organisms perform most of the world's photosynthesis, no well-resolved trimeric structure of a mesophilic organism exists. Our research model for a mesophilic cyanobacterium was Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. This study aimed to obtain well-resolved crystal structures of [1] a monomeric PSI with all subunits, [2] a trimeric PSI with a reduced number of subunits, and [3] the full, trimeric wild-type PSI complex. We only partially succeeded with the first two structures, but we successfully produced the trimeric PSI structure at 2.5\u202f\u00c5 resolution. This structure was comparable to that of the thermophilic species, but we provided more detail. The PSI trimeric supercomplex consisted of 33 protein subunits, 72 carotenoids, 285 chlorophyll a molecules, 51 lipids, 9 iron-sulfur clusters, 6 plastoquinones, 6 putative calcium ions, and over 870 water molecules.This study showed that the structure of the PSI in Synechocystis sp.

     "abstract": "Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence is the process by which excess light energy is harmlessly dissipated within the photosynthetic membrane. The fastest component of NPQ, known as energy-dependent quenching (qE), occurs within minutes, but the site and mechanism of qE remain of great debate. Here, the chlorophyll fluorescence of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) plants was compared to mutants lacking all minor antenna complexes (NoM). Upon illumination, NoM exhibits altered chlorophyll fluorescence quenching induction (i.e. from the dark-adapted state) characterised by three different stages: (i) a fast quenching component, (ii) transient fluorescence recovery and (iii) a second quenching component. The initial fast quenching component originates in light harvesting complex II (LHCII) trimers and is dependent upon PsbS and the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane (\u0394pH). Transient fluorescence recovery is likely to occur in both WT and NoM plants, but it cannot be overcome in NoM due to impaired \u0394pH formation and a reduced zeaxanthin synthesis rate. Moreover, an enhanced fluorescence emission peak at ~679\u202fnm in NoM plants indicates detachment of LHCII trimers from the bulk antenna system, which could also contribute to the transient fluorescence recovery. Finally, the second quenching component is triggered by both \u0394pH and PsbS and enhanced by zeaxanthin synthesis. This study indicates that minor antenna complexes are not essential for qE, but reveals their importance in electron stransport, \u0394pH formation and zeaxanthin synthesis.",

     "abstract": "In natural variable environments, plants rapidly adjust photosynthesis for optimum balance between photochemistry and photoprotection. These adjustments mainly occur via changes in their proton motive force (pmf). Recent studies based on time resolved analysis of the Electro Chromic Signal (ECS) bandshift of photosynthetic pigments in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have suggested an active role of ion fluxes across the thylakoid membranes in the regulation of the pmf. Among the different channels and transporters possibly involved in this phenomenon, we previously identified the TPK3 potassium channel. Plants silenced for TPK3 expression displayed light stress signatures, with reduced Non Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) capacity and sustained anthocyanin accumulation, even at moderate intensities. In this work we re-examined the role of this protein in pmf regulation, starting from the observation that both TPK3 knock-down (TPK3 KD) and WT plants display enhanced anthocyanin accumulation in the light under certain growth conditions, especially in old leaves. We thus compared the pmf features of young \u201cgreen\u201d (without anthocyanins) and old \u201cred\u201d (with anthocyanins) leaves in both genotypes using a global fit analysis of the ECS. We found that the differences in the ECS profile measured between the two genotypes reflect not only differences in TPK3 expression level, but also a modified photosynthetic activity of stressed red leaves, which are present in a larger amounts in the TPK3 KD plants.",

Q123 is located between the two regions, and plays an important role for the pump function, which was implicated by functional, spectroscopic, X-ray crystallographic and computational studies.

To gain the detailed structural information around Q123, here we compared light-induced difference Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra at 77\u202fK between the wild-type (WT) and mutant proteins of KR2, such as Q123A, Q123V, and S64A. The obtained spectra were very similar between WT and these mutants, whereas the observed mutation effects enabled us to identify vibrations of the hydrogen-bonding network at the Q123 and S64 region. This is unique for KR2, not for the corresponding mutations in a light-driven proton-pump bacteriorhodopsin (BR).

One of these factors (Rcf1) has been shown to interact with complexes III (cyt. bc1) and IV (cytochrome c oxidase, CytcO) of the respiratory chain and to modulate the activity of the latter. Here, we investigated the effect of deleting Rcf1 on the functionality of CytcO, purified using a protein C-tag on core subunit 1 (Cox1). Specifically, we measured the kinetics of ligand binding to the CytcO catalytic site, the O2-reduction activity and changes in light absorption spectra. We found that upon removal of Rcf1 a fraction of the CytcO is incorrectly assembled with structural changes at the catalytic site. The data indicate that Rcf1 modulates the assembly and activity of CytcO by shifting the equilibrium of structural sub-states toward the fully active, intact form.",

     "abstract": "The superfamily of heme\u2011copper oxidoreductases (HCOs) include both NO and O2 reductases. Nitric oxide reductases (NORs) are bacterial membrane enzymes that catalyze an intermediate step of denitrification by reducing nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N2O). They are structurally similar to heme\u2011copper oxygen reductases (HCOs), which reduce O2 to water. The experimentally observed apparent bimolecular rate constant of NO delivery to the deeply buried catalytic site of NORs was previously reported to approach the diffusion-controlled limit (108\u2013109\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121). Using the crystal structure of cytochrome-c dependent NOR (cNOR) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we employed several protocols of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which include flooding simulations of NO molecules, implicit ligand sampling and umbrella sampling simulations, to elucidate how NO in solution accesses the catalytic site of this cNOR. The results show that NO partitions into the membrane, enters the enzyme from the lipid bilayer and diffuses to the catalytic site via a hydrophobic tunnel that is resolved in the crystal structures. This is similar to what has been found for O2 diffusion through the closely related O2 reductases. The apparent second order rate constant approximated using the simulation data is ~5\u202f\u00d7\u202f108\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121, which is optimized by the dynamics of the amino acid side chains lining in the tunnel. It is concluded that both NO and O2 reductases utilize well defined hydrophobic tunnels to assure that substrate diffusion to the buried catalytic sites is not rate limiting under physiological conditions.",

H2S is also highly toxic since it is able to inhibit heme cooper oxygen reductases, preventing oxidative phosphorylation. Due to the fact that it can both inhibit and feed the respiratory chain, the immediate role of H2S on energy metabolism crucially relies on its bioavailability, meaning that studying the central players involved in the H2S homeostasis is key for understanding sulfide metabolism.Two different enzymes with sulfide oxidation activity (sulfide dehydrogenases) are known: flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase (FCSD), a sulfide:cytochrome c oxidoreductase; and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR).In this work we performed a thorough bioinformatic study of SQRs and FCSDs and integrated all published data.

It is a multi-step reaction involving: i) electron transfer from quinol bound at the catalytic Qo site to the Rieske iron-sulfur ([2Fe-2S]) cluster, ii) large-scale movement of a domain containing [2Fe-2S] cluster (ISP-HD) towards cytochrome c1, iii) reduction of cytochrome c1 by reduced [2Fe-2S] cluster, iv) reduction of cytochrome c by cytochrome c1.In this work, to examine this multi-step reaction we introduced various types of barriers for electron transfer within the chain of [2Fe-2S] cluster, cytochrome c1 and cytochrome c. The barriers included: impediment in the motion of ISP-HD, uphill electron transfer from [2Fe-2S] cluster to heme c1 of cytochrome c1, and impediment in the catalytic quinol oxidation. The barriers were introduced separately or in various combinations and their effects on enzymatic activity of cytochrome bc1 were compared. This analysis revealed significant degree of functional flexibility allowing the cofactor chains to accommodate certain structural and/or redox potential changes without losing overall electron and proton transfers capabilities. In some cases inhibitory effects compensated one another to improve/restore the function. The results support an equilibrium model in which a random oscillation of ISP-HD between the Qo site and cytochrome c1 helps maintaining redox equilibrium between all cofactors of the chain. We propose a new concept in which independence of the dynamics of the Qo site substrate and the motion of ISP-HD is one of the elements supporting this equilibrium and also is a potential factor limiting the overall catalytic rate.",

In bacteria and mitochondria, two natural inhibitor proteins, namely the \u03b5 and IF1 subunits, prevent the wasteful CCW F1FO-ATPase activity by blocking \u03b3 rotation at the \u03b1DP/\u03b2DP/\u03b3 interface of the F1 portion. In Paracoccus denitrificans and related \u03b1-proteobacteria, we discovered a different natural F1-ATPase inhibitor named \u03b6. Here we revise the functional and structural data showing that this novel \u03b6 subunit, although being different to \u03b5 and IF1, it also binds to the \u03b1DP/\u03b2DP/\u03b3 interface of the F1 of P. denitrificans. \u03b6 shifts its N-terminal inhibitory domain from an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPr) to an \u03b1-helix when inserted in the \u03b1DP/\u03b2DP/\u03b3 interface. We showed for the first time the key role of a natural ATP synthase inhibitor by the distinctive phenotype of a \u0394\u03b6 knockout mutant in P. denitrificans. \u03b6 blocks exclusively the CCW F1FO-ATPase rotation without affecting the CW-F1FO-ATP synthase turnover, confirming that \u03b6 is important for respiratory bacterial growth by working as a unidirectional pawl-ratchet PdF1FO-ATPase inhibitor, thus preventing the wasteful consumption of cellular ATP. In summary, \u03b6 is a useful model that mimics mitochondrial IF1 but in \u03b1-proteobacteria. The structural, functional, and endosymbiotic evolutionary implications of this \u03b6 inhibitor are discussed to shed light on the natural control mechanisms of the three natural inhibitor proteins (\u03b5, \u03b6, and IF1) of this unique ATP synthase nanomotor, essential for life.",

Moreover, the enzyme can hydrolyze ATP to turn the rotor in the opposite direction and generate pmf. The direction of net catalysis, i.e. synthesis or hydrolysis of ATP, depends on the cell's bioenergetic conditions.

     "abstract": "Enzymes in the respiratory chain are increasingly seen as potential targets against multi-drug resistance of human pathogens and cancerous cells. However, a detailed understanding of the mechanism and specificity determinants of known inhibitors is still lacking. Oligomycin, for example, has been known to be an inhibitor of the membrane motor of the mitochondrial ATP synthase for over five decades, and yet little is known about its mode of action at the molecular level. In a recent breakthrough, a crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae c-subunit ring with bound oligomycin revealed the inhibitor docked on the outer face of the proton-binding sites, deep into the transmembrane region. However, the structure of the complex was obtained in an organic solvent rather than detergent or a lipid bilayer, and therefore it has been unclear whether this mode of recognition is physiologically relevant. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to address this question and gain insights into the mechanism of oligomycin inhibition. Our findings lead us to propose that oligomycin naturally partitions into the lipid/water interface, and that in this environment the inhibitor can indeed bind to any of the c-ring proton-carrying sites that are exposed to the membrane, thereby becoming an integral component of the proton-coordinating network. As the c-ring rotates within the membrane, driven either by downhill proton permeation or ATP hydrolysis, one of the protonated, oligomycin-bound sites eventually reaches the subunit-a interface and halts the rotary mechanism of the enzyme.",

However, the mechanosensitivity of mitoBKCa channels was variable with some channels exhibiting no mechanosensitivity. We detected the expression of mechanosensitive BKCa-STREX exon in U-87 MG cells and hypotesize, based on previous studies demonstrating the presence of multiple BKCa splice variants that variable mechanosensitivity of mitoBKCa could be the result of the presence of diverse BKCa isoforms in mitochondria of U-87 MG cells.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism plays a central role in insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells. Generation of protonmotive force and ATP synthesis from glucose-originated pyruvate are critical steps in the canonical pathway of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Mitochondrial metabolism is intertwined with pathways that are thought to amplify insulin secretion with mechanisms distinct from the canonical pathway, and the relative importance of these two pathways is controversial. Here I show that glucose-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) hyperpolarization is necessary for, and predicts, the rate of insulin secretion in primary cultured human beta-cells. When glucose concentration is elevated, increased metabolism results in a substantial MMP hyperpolarization, as well as in increased rates of ATP synthesis and turnover marked by faster cell respiration. Using modular kinetic analysis I explored what properties of cellular energy metabolism enable a large glucose-induced change in MMP in human beta-cells. I found that an ATP-dependent pathway activates glucose or substrate oxidation, acting as a positive feedback in energy metabolism. This activation mechanism is essential for concomitant fast respiration and high MMP, and for a high magnitude glucose-induced MMP hyperpolarization and therefore for insulin secretion.",

Shorter F1\u03b1 interdistances reflected cristae width decrease upon GSIS, since such repositioning of F1\u03b1 correlated to average 20\u202fnm and 15\u202fnm cristae width at 0 and 3\u202fmM glucose, and 9\u202fnm or 8\u202fnm after higher glucose simulating GSIS (11, 20\u202fmM glucose, respectively).

Germline mutations that hyperactivate the RAS pathway have been discovered and linked to human developmental disorders that are known as RASopathies. Individuals with RASopathies, which are estimated to affect approximately 1/1000 human birth, share many overlapping characteristics, including cardiac malformations, short stature, neurocognitive impairment, craniofacial dysmorphy, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormalities, hypotonia and a predisposition to developing cancer.

Various mechanisms adjust mitochondrial activity according to physiological needs. The cAMP-PKA signaling emerged in recent years as a direct and powerful mean to regulate mitochondrial functions. Multiple evidence demonstrates that such pathway can be triggered from cytosol or directly within mitochondria. Notably, specific anchor proteins target PKA to mitochondria whereas enzymes necessary for generation and degradation of cAMP are found directly in these organelles. Mitochondrial PKA targets proteins localized in different compartments of mitochondria, and related to various functions. Alterations of mitochondrial cAMP-PKA signaling affect the development of several physiopathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has repeatedly been reported associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MS), as have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) tRNA and duplication mutations and mtDNA haplogroup lineages. We identified 19 Taiwanese T2DM and MS pedigrees from Taiwan, with putative matrilineal transmission, one of which harbored the pathogenic mtDNA tRNALeu(UUR) nucleotide (nt) 3243A>G mutation on the N9a3 haplogroup background. We then recruited three independent Taiwanese cohorts, two from Taipei (N\u202f=\u202f498, mean age 52 and N\u202f=\u202f1002, mean age 44) and one from a non-urban environment (N\u202f=\u202f501, mean age 57). All three cohorts were assessed for an array of metabolic parameters, their mtDNA haplogroups determined, and the haplogroups correlated with T2DM/MS phenotypes. Logistic regression analysis revealed that mtDNA haplogroups D5, F4, and N9a conferred T2DM protection, while haplogroups F4 and N9a were risk factors for hypertension (HTN), and F4 was a risk factor for obesity (OB). Additionally, the 5263C>T (ND2 A165V) variant commonly associated with F4 was associated with hypertension (HTN). Cybrids were prepared with macro-haplogroup N (defined by variants m.ND3 10398A (114T) and m.ATP6 8701A (59T)) haplogroups B4 and F1 mtDNAs and from macro-haplogroup M (variants m.ND3 10398G (114A) and m.ATP6 8701G (59A)) haplogroup M9 mtDNAs. Additionally, haplogroup B4 and F1 cybrids were prepared with and without the mtDNA variant in ND1 3394T>C (Y30H) reported to be associated with T2DM. Assay of mitochondria complex I in these cybrids revealed that macro-haplogroup N cybrids had lower activity than M cybrids, that haplogroup F cybrids had lower activity than B4 cybrids, and that the ND1 3394T>C (Y30H) variant reduced complex I on both the B4 and F1 background but with very different cumulative effects. These data support the hypothesis that functional mtDNA variants may contribute to the risk of developing T2DM and MS.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX, respiratory chain complex IV), contributes to ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Clinical presentation of COX deficiency is heterogeneous ranging from mild to severe neuromuscular diseases. Anemia is among the symptoms and we have previously reported Fanconi anemia like features in COX4-1 deficiency, suggesting genomic instability and our preliminary results detected nuclear double stranded DNA breaks (DSB). We now quantified the DSB by phospho histone H2AX Ser139 staining of COX4-1 and COX6B1 deficient fibroblasts (225% and 215% of normal, respectively) and confirmed their occurrence by neutral comet assay. We further explored the mechanism of DNA damage by studying normal fibroblasts treated with micromolar concentrations of cyanide (KCN). Present results demonstrate elevated nuclear DSB in cells treated with 50\u202f\u03bcM KCN for 24\u202fh (170% of normal) in high-glucose medium conditions where ROS and ATP remain normal, although Glutathione content was partially decreased. In glucose-free and serum-free medium, where growth is hampered, DSB were not elevated. Additionally we demonstrate the benefit of nicotinamide riboside (NR) which ameliorated DSB in COX4-1, COX6B1 and KCN treated cells (130%, 154% and 87% of normal cells, respectively). Conversely a negative effect of a poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) inhibitor was found. Although additional investigation is needed, our findings raise the possibility that the pathomechanism of COX deficiency and possibly also in other OXPHOS defects, include nuclear DNA damage resulting from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) deficit combined with a replicative state, rather than oxidative stress and energy depletion.",

     "abstract": "Idebenone is a hydrophilic short-chain coenzyme (Co) Q analogue, which has been used as a potential bypass of defective complex I in both Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and OPA1-dependent Dominant Optic Atrophy. Based on its potential antioxidant effects, it has also been tested in degenerative disorders such as Friedreich's ataxia, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Idebenone is rapidly modified but the biological effects of its metabolites have been characterized only partially. Here we have studied the effects of quinones generated during in vivo metabolism of idebenone with specific emphasis on 6-(9-carboxynonyl)-2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (QS10). QS10 partially restored respiration in cells deficient of complex I or of CoQ without inducing the mitochondrial permeability transition, a detrimental effect of idebenone that may offset its potential benefits [Giorgio et al. (2012) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1817: 363\u2013369]. Remarkably, respiration was largely rotenone-insensitive in complex I deficient cells and rotenone-sensitive in CoQ deficient cells. These findings indicate that, like idebenone, QS10 can provide a bypass to defective complex I; and that, unlike idebenone, QS10 can partially replace endogenous CoQ. In zebrafish (Danio rerio) treated with rotenone, QS10 was more effective than idebenone in allowing partial recovery of respiration (to 40% and 20% of the basal respiration of untreated embryos, respectively) and allowing zebrafish survival (80% surviving embryos at 60\u202fh post-fertilization, a time point at which all rotenone-treated embryos otherwise died). We conclude that QS10 is potentially more active than idebenone in the treatment of diseases caused by complex I defects, and that it could also be used in CoQ deficiencies of genetic and acquired origin.",

     "abstract": "Provision of NAD+ for oxidative decarboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA by the ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (KGDHC) is critical for maintained operation of succinyl-CoA ligase yielding high-energy phosphates, a process known as mitochondrial substrate-level phosphorylation (mSLP). We have shown previously that when NADH oxidation by complex I is inhibited by rotenone or anoxia, mitochondrial diaphorases yield NAD+, provided that suitable quinones are present (Kiss G et al., FASEB J 2014, 28:1682). This allows for KGDHC reaction to proceed and as an extension of this, mSLP. NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme exhibiting diaphorase activity. Here, by using Nqo1\u2212/\u2212 and WT littermate mice we show that in rotenone-treated, isolated liver mitochondria 2-methoxy-1,4-naphtoquinone (MNQ) is preferentially reduced by matrix Nqo1 yielding NAD+ to KGDHC, supporting mSLP. This process was sensitive to inhibition by specific diaphorase inhibitors. Reduction of idebenone and its analogues MRQ-20 and MRQ-56, menadione, mitoquinone and duroquinone were unaffected by genetic disruption of the Nqo1 gene. The results allow for the conclusions that i) MNQ is a Nqo1-preferred substrate, and ii) in the presence of suitable quinones, mitochondrially-localized diaphorases other than Nqo1 support NADH oxidation when complex I is inhibited. Our work confirms that complex I bypass can occur by quinones reduced by intramitochondrial diaphorases oxidizing NADH, ultimately supporting mSLP. Finally, it may help to elucidate structure-activity relationships of redox-active quinones with diaphorase enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Based on the fact that traumatic brain injury is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction we aimed at localization of mitochondrial defect and attempted to correct it by thiamine.Interventional controlled experimental animal study was used. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to lateral fluid percussion traumatic brain injury. Thiamine was administered 1\u202fh prior to trauma; cortex was extracted for analysis 4\u202fh and 3\u202fd after trauma.Increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1) by 4\u202fh was accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial respiration with glutamate but neither with pyruvate nor succinate. Assays of TCA cycle flux-limiting 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC) and functionally linked enzymes (glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme) indicated that only OGDHC activity was decreased. Application of the OGDHC coenzyme precursor thiamine rescued the activity of OGDHC and restored mitochondrial respiration. These effects were not mediated by changes in the expression of the OGDHC sub-units (E1k and E3), suggesting post-translational mechanism of thiamine effects. By the third day after TBI, thiamine treatment also decreased expression of TNF-R1. Specific markers of unfolded protein response did not change in response to thiamine.Our data point to OGDHC as a major site of damage in mitochondria upon traumatic brain injury, which is associated with neuroinflammation and can be corrected by thiamine. Further studies are required to evaluate the pathological impact of these findings in clinical settings.",

The following could be concluded from our studies by using hOGDHc and hOADHc assembled from their individually expressed components in vitro: (i) Different substrate preferences (kcat/Km) were displayed by the two complexes even though they share the same dihydrolipoyl succinyltransferase (hE2o) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (hE3) components; (ii) Different binding modes were in evidence for the binary hE1o-hE2o and hE1a-hE2o subcomplexes according to fluorescence titrations using site-specifically labeled hE2o-derived proteins; (iii) Similarly to hE1o, the hE1a also forms the ThDP-enamine radical from 2-oxoadipate (electron paramagnetic resonance detection) in the oxidative half reaction; (iv) Both complexes produced superoxide/H2O2 from O2 in the reductive half reaction suggesting that hE1o, and hE1a (within their complexes) could both be sources of reactive oxygen species generation in mitochondria from 2-oxoglutarate and 2-oxoadipate, respectively; (v) Based on our findings, we speculate that hE2o can serve as a trans-glutarylase, in addition to being a trans-succinylase, a role suggested by others; (vi) The glutaryl-CoA produced by hOADHc inhibits hE1o, as does succinyl-CoA, suggesting a regulatory cross-talk between the two complexes on the different metabolic pathways.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is incompletely coupled, since protons translocated to the intermembrane space by specific respiratory complexes of the electron transport chain can return to the mitochondrial matrix independently of the ATP synthase \u2014a process known as proton leak\u2014 generating heat instead of ATP. Proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane increases the respiration rate and decreases the electrochemical proton gradient (\u0394p), and is an important mechanism for energy dissipation that accounts for up to 25% of the basal metabolic rate. It is well established that mitochondrial superoxide production is steeply dependent on \u0394p in isolated mitochondria and, correspondingly, mitochondrial uncoupling has been identified as a cytoprotective strategy under conditions of oxidative stress, including diabetes, drug-resistance in tumor cells, ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury or aging. Mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are able to lower the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and are involved in the control of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. There is strong evidence that UCP2 and UCP3, the UCP1 homologues expressed in the heart, protect against mitochondrial oxidative damage by reducing the production of ROS. This review first analyzes the relationship between mitochondrial proton leak and ROS generation, and then focuses on the cardioprotective role of chemical uncoupling and uncoupling mediated by UCPs. This includes their protective effects against cardiac IR, a condition known to increase ROS production, and their roles in modulating cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis.",

The large GTPase optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) is identified as a core component of inner membrane (IM) fusion. OPA1 exists as the membrane-anchored L-OPA1 and the proteolytically cleavage soluble S-OPA1. Recently, we showed that OPA1 and mitochondria-localized lipid cardiolipin (CL) cooperate in heterotypic IM fusion [Ban et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 19 (2017) 856\u2013863]. We reconstituted an in vitro membrane fusion reaction using purified human L-OPA1 and S-OPA1 expressed in silkworm and found that L-OPA1 on one side of the membrane and CL on the other side were sufficient for mitochondrial fusion. L-OPA1 is the major fusion-prone factor in heterotypic fusion. However, the role of S-OPA1 remains unknown as S-OPA1 promoted L-OPA1-dependent heterotypic membrane fusion and homotypic CL-containing membrane fusion, but S-OPA1 alone was not sufficient for heterotypic membrane fusion. L-OPA1- and CL-mediated heterotypic mitochondrial fusion was confirmed in living cells, but tafazzin (Taz1), the causal gene product of Barth syndrome, was not essential for mitochondrial fusion. Taz1-dependent CL maturation might have other roles in the remodeling of mitochondrial DNA nucleoids.",

Relevant to this, hypoxia is known to drive succinate accumulation and release into the extracellular milieu. The metabolic alterations associated with succinate release during inflammation and under hypoxia are poorly understood. Data are presented showing that Mycoplasma arginini infection of VM-M3 cancer cells enhances the Warburg effect associated with succinate production in mitochondria and eventual release into the extracellular milieu. We investigated how succinate production and release was related to the changes of other soluble metabolites, including itaconate and 2-HG. Furthermore, we found that hypoxia alone could induce succinate release from the VM-M3 cells and that this could occur in the absence of glucose-driven lactate production. Our results elucidate metabolic pathways responsible for succinate accumulation and release in cancer cells, thus identifying potential targets involved in both inflammation and hypoxia.

In addition, BMF metabolically inhibited mitochondrial respiration (OXPHOS) and fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Importantly, BMF did not show the same toxic side-effects in normal fibroblasts that were observed with statins.

This data verified the presence of the 602\u202fnm form in the \u03b1-band, revealed a similar shift of heme a in the Soret-band and ruled out the reversal of calcium binding as the origin of the blue shift. The 602\u202fnm form was found to be stabilized at high pH or by binding of azide, which is known to blue shift the \u03b1-band of heme a. Azide also stabilized the 602\u202fnm form in the living cells. It is concluded there is a form of cytochrome oxidase in which heme a undergoes a blue shift to a 602\u202fnm form and that redox titrations can be successfully performed in living cells where the oxidase operates in its authentic environment and in the presence of a proton motive force.",

Previous spectrophotometric studies using the purified cytochrome bc1 complex from Pythium sp. showed that Ametoctradin binds to the Qo-site of the enzyme. However, as modeling studies suggested a binding mode like that of the substrate ubiquinol, the possibility for a dual Qo- and Qi-site binding mode was left open.In this work, binding studies and enzyme assays with mitochondrial membrane preparations from Pythium sp. and an S. cerevisiae strain with a modified Qi-site were used to investigate further the binding mode of Ametoctradin. The results obtained argue that the compound could bind to both the Qo- and Qi-sites of the cytochrome bc1 complex and that its position or binding pose in the Qi-site differs from that of Cyazofamid and Amisulbrom, the two Qi-site-targeting, anti-oomycetes compounds. Furthermore, the data support the argument that Ametoctradin prefers binding to the reduced cytochrome bc1 complex. Thus, Ametoctradin has an unusual binding mode and further studies with this compound may offer the opportunity to better understand the catalytic cycle of the cytochrome bc1 complex.",

No other native heme proteins are known to have glutamic acid axial ligands. In this work, site-directed mutagenesis is used to probe the roles of these glutamic acids, E445 and E99 in the E. coli enzyme. It is concluded that neither glutamate is a strong ligand to the heme Fe and they are not the major determinates of heme binding to the protein. Although very important, neither glutamate is absolutely essential for catalytic function. The close interactions between the three hemes in cyt bd result in highly cooperative properties. For example, mutation of E445, which is near heme d, has its greatest effects on the properties of heme b595 and heme b558. It is concluded that 1) O2 binds to the hydrophilic side of heme d and displaces E445; 2) E445 forms a salt bridge with R448 within the O2 binding pocket, and both residues play a role to stabilize oxygenated states of heme d during catalysis; 3) E445 and E99 are each protonated accompanying electron transfer to heme d and heme b595, respectively; 4) All protons used to generate water within the heme d active site come from the cytoplasm and are delivered through a channel that must include internal water molecules to assist proton transfer: [cytoplasm]\u202f\u2192\u202fE107\u202f\u2192\u202fE99 (heme b595)\u202f\u2192\u202fE445 (heme d)\u202f\u2192\u202foxygenated heme d.",

Here we report that Sit4p is also involved in post-translational regulation of mitochondrial proteins and identified 9 potential targets. One of these, the ATP synthase (FoF1 complex) beta subunit Atp2p, was characterized and two phosphorylation sites, T124 and T317, were identified. Expression of Atp2p-T124 or T317 phosphoresistant versions in sit4\u0394 cells decreased Atp2p phosphorylation confirming these as Sit4p-regulated sites. Moreover, Sit4p and Atp2p interacted both physically and genetically. Mimicking phosphorylation at T124 or T317 increased Atp2p levels, resulting in higher abundance/activity of ATP synthase. Similar changes were observed in sit4\u0394 cells in which Atp2p is endogenously more phosphorylated. Expression of Atp2-T124 or T317 phosphomimetics also increased mitochondrial respiration and ATP levels and extended yeast lifespan. These results suggest that Sit4p-mediated dephosphorylation of Atp2p-T124/T317 downregulates Atp2p alongside with ATP synthase and mitochondrial function. Combination of transcriptional with post-translational regulation during fermentative growth may allow for a more efficient Sit4p repression of mitochondrial respiration.",

We previously identified a mutation in the mitochondrial MT-ATP6 gene (m.8969G>A) in a 14-year-old Chinese female who developed an isolated nephropathy followed by brain and muscle problems. This mutation replaces a highly conserved serine residue into asparagine at amino acid position 148 of the membrane-embedded subunit a of ATP synthase. We showed that an equivalent of this mutation in yeast (aS175N) prevents FO-mediated proton translocation. Herein we identified four first-site intragenic suppressors (aN175D, aN175K, aN175I, and aN175T), which, in light of a recently published atomic structure of yeast FO indicates that the detrimental consequences of the original mutation result from the establishment of hydrogen bonds between aN175 and a nearby glutamate residue (aE172) that was proposed to be critical for the exit of protons from the ATP synthase towards the mitochondrial matrix. Interestingly also, we found that the aS175N mutation can be suppressed by second-site suppressors (aP12S, aI171F, aI171N, aI239F, and aI200M), of which some are very distantly located (by 20\u201330\u202f\u00c5) from the original mutation. The possibility to compensate through long-range effects the aS175N mutation is an interesting observation that holds promise for the development of therapeutic molecules.",

In the refolded N89\u202fL variant PCP (N89\u202fL-RFPCP) a significant part of the intensity on the long wavelength side of the absorption spectrum is shifted to shorter wavelengths due to a significant change in the Per-614 site energy. Since Per-614 has been shown to be the main chlorophyll (Chl) triplet quencher in the protein, and the relative geometry of pigments is not affected by the mutation as verified by X-ray crystallography, this variant is ideally suited to study the dependence of the triplet-triplet energy transfer (TTET) mechanism on the pigment site energy. By using a combination of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR), pulse Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and Electron Nuclear DOuble Resonance (ENDOR) we found that PCP maintains the efficient Per-614-to-Chl-a TTET despite the change of Per-614 local energy.

The reduced form of AQDS (AH2QDS) can also be used as energy source by G. sulfurreducens. Such bidirectional utilization of humic substances confers competitive advantages to these bacteria in Fe(III) enriched environments. Previous studies have shown that the triheme cytochrome PpcA from G. sulfurreducens has a bifunctional behavior toward the humic substance analogue. It can reduce AQDS but the protein can also be reduced by AH2QDS. Using stopped-flow kinetic measurements we were able to demonstrate that other periplasmic members of the PpcA-family in G. sulfurreducens (PpcB, PpcD and PpcE) also showed the same behavior. The extent of the electron transfer is thermodynamically controlled favoring the reduction of the cytochromes. NMR spectra recorded for 13C,15N-enriched samples in the presence increasing amounts of AQDS showed perturbations in the chemical shift signals of the cytochromes. The chemical shift perturbations on cytochromes backbone NH and 1H heme methyl signals were used to map their interaction regions with AQDS, showing that each protein forms a low-affinity binding complex through well-defined positive surface regions in the vicinity of heme IV (PpcB, PpcD and PpcE) and I (PpcE). Docking calculations performed using NMR chemical shift perturbations allowed modeling the interactions between AQDS and each cytochrome at a molecular level. Overall, the results obtained provided important structural-functional relationships to rationalize the microbial respiration of humic substances in G. sulfurreducens.",

However, investigation into the regulatory non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanism, which dissipates excess energy in high light, has led to several conflicting models. It is generally accepted that the major photosystem II antenna protein, LHCII, is the site of NPQ, although the minor antenna complexes (CP24/26/29) are also proposed as alternative/additional NPQ sites. LHCII crystals were shown to exhibit the short excitation lifetime and several spectral signatures of the quenched state. Subsequent structure-based models showed that this quenching could be explained by slow energy trapping by the carotenoids, in line with one of the proposed models. Using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) we show that the crystal structure of CP29 corresponds to a strongly quenched conformation. Using a structure-based theoretical model we show that this quenching may be explained by the same slow, carotenoid-mediated quenching mechanism present in LHCII crystals.",

     "abstract": "In changing light conditions, photosynthetic organisms develop different strategies to maintain a fine balance between light harvesting, photochemistry, and photoprotection. One of the most widespread photoprotective mechanisms consists in the dissipation of excess light energy in the form of heat in the photosystem II antenna, which participates to the Non Photochemical Quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence. It is tightly related to the reversible epoxidation of xanthophyll pigments, catalyzed by the two enzymes, the violaxanthin deepoxidase and the zeaxanthin epoxidase. In Phaeomonas sp. (Pinguiophyte, Stramenopiles), we show that the regulation of the heat dissipation process is different from that of the green lineage: the NPQ is strictly proportional to the amount of the xanthophyll pigment zeaxanthin and the xanthophyll cycle enzymes are differently regulated. The violaxanthin deepoxidase is already active in the dark, because of a low luminal pH, and the zeaxanthin epoxidase shows a maximal activity under moderate light conditions, being almost inactive in the dark and under high light. This light-dependency mirrors the one of NPQ: Phaeomonas sp. displays a large NPQ in the dark as well as under high light, which recovers under moderate light. Our results pinpoint zeaxanthin epoxidase activity as the prime regulator of NPQ in Phaeomonas sp. and therefore challenge the deepoxidase-regulated xanthophyll cycle dogma.",

Using a strain of Rba. sphaeroides that produces BChl bP, where P is phytyl, rather than the native BChl aP, we deleted bchF, a gene that encodes an enzyme responsible for the hydration of the C3-vinyl group of a precursor of BChls. This led to the production of BChl gP. Next, the crtE gene was deleted, thereby producing BChl g carrying a THF (tetrahydrofarnesol) moiety. Additionally, the bchGRs gene from Rba. sphaeroides was replaced with bchGHm from Hba. modesticaldum. To prevent reduction of the tail, bchP was deleted, which yielded BChl gF.

We identified different partial processes of the Qo-site reaction, isolated through use of specific inhibitors, and correlated proton release with electron transfer processes by spectrophotometric measurement of cytochromes or electrochromic response. In the presence of myxothiazol or azoxystrobin, the proton release observed reflected oxidation of the Rieske iron\u2011sulfur protein. In the absence of Qo-site inhibitors, the pH change measured represented the convolution of this proton release with release of protons on turnover of the Qo-site, involving formation of the ES-complex and oxidation of the semiquinone intermediate. Turnover also regenerated the reduced iron-sulfur protein, available for further oxidation on a second turnover. Proton release was well-matched with the rate limiting step on oxidation of QH2 on both turnovers. However, a minor lag in proton release found at pH\u202f7 but not at pH\u202f8 might suggest that a process linked to rapid proton release on oxidation of the intermediate semiquinone involves a group with a pK in that range.",

However, sex differences in brain MPT modulation have not yet been explored. Here, we show that mitochondria isolated from female mouse forebrain have a lower calcium threshold for MPT than male mitochondria, and that this sex difference depends on the MPT regulator cyclophilin D (CypD). We also demonstrate that an estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2) antagonist inhibits MPT and knockout of ER\u03b2 decreases the sensitivity of mitochondria to the CypD inhibitor, cyclosporine A. These results suggest a functional relationship between ER\u03b2 and CypD in modulating brain MPT. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation studies identify several ER\u03b2 binding partners in mitochondria. Among these, we investigate the mitochondrial ATPase as a putative site of MPT regulation by ER\u03b2. We find that previously described interaction between the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring subunit of ATPase (OSCP) and CypD is decreased by ER\u03b2 knockout, suggesting that ER\u03b2 modulates MPT by regulating CypD interaction with OSCP. Functionally, in primary neurons and hippocampal slice cultures, modulation of ER\u03b2 has protective effects against glutamate toxicity and oxygen glucose deprivation, respectively. Taken together, these results reveal a novel pathway of brain MPT regulation by ER\u03b2 that could contribute to sex differences in ischemic brain injury and neurodegeneration.",

In the last decades most of the data about this association came from studies in yeasts, mammals and plants, and information is scarce in other lineages. Here we studied the supramolecular association of the F1FO-ATP synthase (complex V) and the respiratory complexes I, III and IV of the colorless alga Polytomella sp. with an approach that involves solubilization using mild detergents, n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside (DDM) or digitonin, followed by separation of native protein complexes by electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), after which we identified oligomeric forms of complex V (mainly V2 and V4) and different respiratory supercomplexes (I/IV6, I/III4, I/IV). In addition, purification/reconstitution of the supercomplexes by anion exchange chromatography was also performed. The data show that these complexes have the ability to strongly associate with each other and form DDM-stable macromolecular structures. The stable V4 ATPase oligomer was observed by electron-microscopy and the association of the respiratory complexes in the so-called \u201crespirasome\u201d was able to perform in-vitro oxygen consumption.",

In this study, we show that a wild-type respiratory competent yeast strain at stationary phase is characterized by a decreased oxidative capacity, as seen by a reduction in the amount of assembled COX and by a decrease in protein levels of several COX assembly factors. In contrast, loss of assembled COX results in the decreased abundance of many mitochondrial proteins at stationary phase, which is likely due to decreased membrane potential and changes in mitophagy. In addition to an altered mitochondrial proteome, COX assembly mutants display unexpected changes in markers of cellular oxidative stress at stationary phase. Our results suggest that mitochondria may not be a major source of reactive oxygen species at stationary phase in cells lacking an intact respiratory chain.",

     "abstract": "Dimeric cytochromes bc are central components of photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains. In their catalytic core, four hemes b connect four quinone (Q) binding sites. Two of these sites, Qi sites, reduce quinone to quinol (QH2) in a step-wise reaction, involving a stable semiquinone intermediate (SQi). However, the interaction of the SQi with the adjacent hemes remains largely unexplored. Here, by revealing the existence of two populations of SQi differing in paramagnetic relaxation, we present a new mechanistic insight into this interaction. Benefiting from a clear separation of these SQi species in mutants with a changed redox midpoint potential of hemes b, we identified that the fast-relaxing SQi (SQiF) corresponds to the form magnetically coupled with the oxidized heme bH (the heme b adjacent to the Qi site), while the slow-relaxing SQi (SQiS) reflects the form present alongside the reduced (and diamagnetic) heme bH. This so far unreported SQiF calls for a reinvestigation of the thermodynamic properties of SQi and the Qi site. The existence of SQiF in the native enzyme reveals a possibility of an extended electron equilibration within the dimer, involving all four hemes b and both Qi sites. This substantiates the predicted earlier electron transfer acting to sweep the b-chain of reduced hemes b to diminish generation of reactive oxygen species by cytochrome bc1. In analogy to the Qi site, we anticipate that the quinone binding sites in other enzymes may contain yet undetected semiquinones which interact magnetically with oxidized hemes upon progress of catalytic reactions.",

The activity of this channel was inhibited by a complex of ATP/Mg2+ and activated by potassium channel openers such as diazoxide or BMS 191095.

The influence of substances modulating ATP-regulated potassium channel activity on oxygen consumption and membrane potential of isolated fibroblast mitochondria was also studied. Additionally, the potassium channel opener diazoxide lowered the amount of superoxide formed in isolated fibroblast mitochondria. Using reverse transcriptase-PCR, we found an mRNA transcript for the KCNJ1(ROMK) channel. The presence of ROMK protein was observed in the inner mitochondrial membrane fraction.

The \u03b3 subunit, which is the rotary shaft of F1 motor, is composed of N-terminal and C-terminal helices domains, and a protruding Rossman-fold domain located between the two major helices parts. The N-terminal and C-terminal helices domains of \u03b3 assemble into an antiparallel coiled-coil structure, and are almost embedded into the stator ring composed of \u03b13\u03b23 hexamer of the F1 molecule.

To understand the structure\u2013function relationship of the \u03b3 subunit, we prepared a mutant F1-ATP synthase of a thermophilic cyanobacterium, Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1, in which the \u03b3 subunit is split into N-terminal \u03b1-helix along with the inserted sequence and the remaining C-terminal part. The obtained mutant showed higher ATP-hydrolysis activities than those containing the wild-type \u03b3. Contrary to our expectation, the complexes containing the split \u03b3 subunits were mostly devoid of the C-terminal helix. We further investigated the effect of post-assembly cleavage of the \u03b3 subunit. We demonstrate that insertion of the nick between two helices of the \u03b3 subunit imparts resistance to ADP inhibition, and the C-terminal \u03b1-helix is dispensable for ATP-hydrolysis activity and plays a crucial role in the assembly of F1-ATP synthase.",

Despite extensive studies, the mechanism by which the activity of this enormous, ca. 1\u202fMDa, redox-coupled proton pump is regulated still remains unclear. Recent structural studies (Zhu et al., Nature 2016; Fiedorczuk et al., Nature 2016) resolved complex I in different conformations connected to the active-to-deactive (A/D) transition that regulate complex I activity in several species. Based on anisotropic network models (ANM) and principal component analysis (PCA), we identify here transitions between experimentally resolved structures of the mammalian complex I as low-frequency collective motions of the enzyme, highlighting similarities and differences between the bacterial and mammalian enzymes. Despite the reduced complexity of the smaller bacterial enzyme, our results suggest that the global dynamics of complex I is overall conserved. We further probe how the supernumerary subunits could be involved in the modulation of the A/D-transition, and show that in particular the 42\u202fkDa and B13 subunits affect the global motions of the mammalian enzyme.",

This process is essential for the elimination of the cytotoxic NO that is produced from nitrite (NO2\u2212) during microbial denitrification. A structure-guided mutagenesis of NOR is required to elucidate the mechanism for NOR-catalyzed NO reduction. We have already solved the crystal structure of cytochrome c-dependent NOR (cNOR) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this study, we then constructed its expression system using cNOR-gene deficient and wild-type strains for further functional study. Characterizing the variants of the five conserved Glu residues located around the heme/non-heme iron active center allowed us to establish how the anaerobic growth rate of cNOR-deficient strains expressing cNOR variants correlates with the in vitro enzymatic activity of the variants. Since bacterial strains require active cNOR to eliminate cytotoxic NO and to survive under denitrification conditions, the anaerobic growth rate of a strain with a cNOR variant is a good indicator of NO decomposition capability of the variants and a marker for the screening of functionally important residues without protein purification. Using this in vivo screening system, we examined the residues lining the putative proton transfer pathways for NO reduction in cNOR, and found that the catalytic protons are likely transferred through the Glu57 located at the periplasmic protein surface. The homologous cNOR expression system developed here is an invaluable tool for facile identification of crucial residues in vivo, and for further in vitro functional and structural studies.",

     "abstract": "In Photosystem II (PSII), the Mn4CaO5-cluster of the active site advances through five sequential oxidation states (S0 to S4) before water is oxidized and O2 is generated. Here, we have studied the transition between the low spin (LS) and high spin (HS) configurations of S2 using EPR spectroscopy, quantum chemical calculations using Density Functional Theory (DFT), and time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The EPR experiments show that the equilibrium between S2LS and S2HS is pH dependent, with a pKa\u202f\u2248\u202f8.3 (n\u202f\u2248\u202f4) for the native Mn4CaO5 and pKa\u202f\u2248\u202f7.5 (n\u202f\u2248\u202f1) for Mn4SrO5. The DFT results suggest that exchanging Ca with Sr modifies the electronic structure of several titratable groups within the active site, including groups that are not direct ligands to Ca/Sr, e.g., W1/W2, Asp61, His332 and His337. This is consistent with the complex modification of the pKa upon the Ca/Sr exchange. EPR also showed that NH3 addition reversed the effect of high pH, NH3-S2LS being present at all pH values studied. Absorption spectroscopy indicates that NH3 is no longer bound in the S3TyrZ state, consistent with EPR data showing minor or no NH3-induced modification of S3 and S0. In both Ca-PSII and Sr-PSII, S2HS was capable of advancing to S3 at low temperature (198\u202fK). This is an experimental demonstration that the S2LS is formed first and advances to S3 via the S2HS state without detectable intermediates. We discuss the nature of the changes occurring in the S2LS to S2HS transition which allow the S2HS to S3 transition to occur below 200\u202fK. This work also provides a protocol for generating S3 in concentrated samples without the need for saturating flashes.",

Experiments were carried out at room temperature and 77\u202fK to reveal temperature dependence of energy transfer. At both temperatures, the ultrafast (<100\u202ffs) energy transfer channel from the fucoxanthin S2 state is active and is complemented by the second pathway via the combined S1/ICT state. The S1/ICT-Chl a pathway has two channels, the fast one characterized by sub-picosecond energy transfer, and slow having time constants of 4.5\u202fps at room temperature and 6.6\u202fps at 77\u202fK. The overall energy transfer via the S1/ICT is faster at 77\u202fK, because the fast component gains amplitude upon lowering the temperature. The pump-dump-probe regime, with the dump pulse centered in the spectral region of ICT stimulated emission at 950\u202fnm and applied at 2\u202fps after excitation, proved that the S1 and ICT states of fucoxanthin in FCP are individual, yet coupled entities.

Our previous studies showed that mutation or deficiency of \u03b5 subunit markedly decreased the content of ATP synthase, which was otherwise functionaly and structuraly normal. Interestingly, it led to accumulation of subunit c aggregates, suggesting the role of the \u03b5 subunit in assembly of individual enzyme domains. In the present study we focused on the role of subunits \u03b3 and \u03b4. Using shRNA knockdown in human HEK293 cells, the protein levels of \u03b3 and \u03b4 were decreased to 30% and 10% of control levels, respectively. The content of the assembled ATP synthase decreased in accordance with the levels of the silenced subunits, which was also the case for most structural subunits. In contrast, the hydrophobic c subunit was increased to 130% or 180%, respectively and most of it was detected as aggregates of 150\u2013400\u202fkDa by 2D PAGE. In addition the IF1 protein was upregulated to 195% and 300% of control levels. Both \u03b3 and \u03b4 subunits silenced cells displayed decreased ATP synthase function - lowered rate of ADP-stimulated respiration, a two-fold increased sensitivity of respiration to inhibitor oligomycin, and impaired utilization of mitochondrial membrane potential for ADP phosphorylation. In summary, similar phenotype of \u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b5 subunit deficiencies suggest uniform requirement for assembled central stalk as driver of the c-oligomer attachment in the assembly process of mammalian ATP synthase.",

The cyanobacterial photoprotection system uniquely relies on the functioning of the photoactive orange carotenoid protein (OCP) that under intense illumination provides fluorescence quenching of the light-harvesting antenna complexes, phycobilisomes. The recently identified fluorescence recovery protein (FRP) binds to the photoactivated OCP and accelerates its relaxation into the basal form, completing the regulatory circle. The molecular mechanism of FRP functioning is largely controversial. Moreover, since the available knowledge has mainly been gained from studying Synechocystis proteins, the cross-species conservation of the FRP mechanism remains unexplored. Besides phylogenetic analysis, we performed a detailed structural-functional analysis of two selected low-homology FRPs by comparing them with Synechocystis FRP (SynFRP).

Oxygen producing photosynthesis uniquely employs manganese ions as rapid electron donors. Introducing this attribute to anoxygenic photosynthesis may identify evolutionary intermediates and provide insights to the energetics of biological water oxidation. This work presents effective environmental methods that substantially and simultaneously tune the redox potentials of manganese ions and the cofactors of a photosynthetic enzyme from native anoxygenic bacteria without the necessity of genetic modification or synthesis. A spontaneous coordination with bis-tris propane lowered the redox potential of the manganese (II) to manganese (III) transition to an unusually low value (~400\u202fmV) at pH\u202f9.4 and allowed its binding to the bacterial reaction center. Binding to a novel buried binding site elevated the redox potential of the primary electron donor, a dimer of bacteriochlorophylls, by up to 92\u202fmV also at pH\u202f9.4 and facilitated the electron transfer that is able to compete with the wasteful charge recombination. These events impaired the function of the natural electron donor and made BTP-coordinated manganese a viable model for an evolutionary alternative.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (COX), complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, is comprised of 14 structural subunits, several prosthetic groups and metal cofactors, among which copper. Its biosynthesis involves a number of ancillary proteins, encoded by the COX-assembly genes that are required for the stabilization and membrane insertion of the nascent polypeptides, the synthesis of the prosthetic groups, and the delivery of the metal cofactors, in particular of copper. Recently, a modular model for COX assembly has been proposed, based on the sequential incorporation of different assembly modules formed by specific subunits.We have cloned and characterized the human homologue of yeast COX16. We show that human COX16 encodes a small mitochondrial transmembrane protein that faces the intermembrane space and is highly expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Its knockdown in C. elegans produces COX deficiency, and its ablation in HEK293 cells impairs COX assembly. Interestingly, COX16 knockout cells retain significant COX activity, suggesting that the function of COX16 is partially redundant.Analysis of steady-state levels of COX subunits and of assembly intermediates by Blue-Native gels shows a pattern similar to that reported in cells lacking COX18, suggesting that COX16 is required for the formation of the COX2 subassembly module. Moreover, COX16 co-immunoprecipitates with COX2. Finally, we found that copper supplementation increases COX activity and restores normal steady state levels of COX subunits in COX16 knockout cells, indicating that, even in the absence of a canonical copper binding motif, COX16 could be involved in copper delivery to COX2.",

X-ray-structure-based rational design and the allocation of specific interaction residues by NMR-analysis led to the construction of Fd- and FNR-mutants, which in appropriate combination enabled an about 18-fold enhanced electron flow from Fd to HydA1 (in competition with equimolar amounts of FNR) in in vitro assays. The negative impact of these mutations on the Fd-FNR electron transport which indirectly facilitates H2 production (with a contribution of \u226442% by FNR variants and \u226423% by Fd-variants) and the direct positive impact on the Fd-HydA1 electron transport (\u226423% by Fd-mutants) provide an excellent basis for the construction of a hydrogen-producing design cell and the study of photosynthetic efficiency-optimization with cyanobacteria.",

The isoform yVDAC2 is currently understudied with respect to the best known yVDAC1. Yet, since the discovery, the function of yVDAC2 was unclear, leading to the hypothesis that it might be devoid of a channel function. In this work we have elucidated, by bioinformatics modeling and electrophysiological analysis, the functional activity of yVDAC2. The conformation of yVDAC2 and, for comparison, of yVDAC1 were modeled using a multiple template approach involving mouse, human and zebrafish structures and both showed to arrange the sequences as the typical 19-stranded VDAC \u03b2-barrel. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that yVDAC2, in comparison with yVDAC1, has a different number of permeation paths of potassium and chloride ions. yVDAC2 protein was over-expressed in the S. cerevisiae cells depleted of functional yVDAC1 (\u0394por1 mutant) and, after purification, it was reconstituted in artificial membranes (planar lipid bilayer (PLB) system). The protein displayed channel-forming activity and the calculated conductance, voltage-dependence and ion selectivity values were similar to those of yVDAC1 and other members of VDAC family.

PBS consists of two domains: central core and peripheral rods assembled of disc-shaped phycobiliprotein aggregates and linker polypeptides. The study of the PBS architecture is hindered due to the lack of the data on the structure of the large ApcE-linker also called LCM. ApcE participates in the PBS core stabilization, PBS anchoring to the photosynthetic membrane, transfer of the light energy to chlorophyll, and, very probably, the interaction with the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) during the non-photochemical PBS quenching. We have constructed the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant lacking 235 N-terminal amino acids of the chromophorylated PBLCM domain of ApcE. The altered fluorescence characteristics of the mutant PBSs indicate that the energy transfer to the terminal emitters within the mutant PBS is largely disturbed. The PBSs of the mutant become unable to attach to the thylakoid membrane, which correlates with the identified absence of the energy transfer from the PBSs to the photosystem II. At the same time, the energy transfer from the PBS to the photosystem I was registered in the mutant cells and seems to occur due to the small cylindrical CpcG2-PBSs formation in addition to the conventional PBSs. In contrast to the wild type Synechocystis, the OCP-mediated non-photochemical PBS quenching was not registered in the mutant cells. Thus, the PBLCM domain takes part in formation of the OCP binding site in the PBS.",

     "publication date": "04-2018",
     "abstract": "It is known, that the multi-subunit complex of photosystem II (PSII) and some of its single proteins exhibit carbonic anhydrase activity. Previously, we have shown that PSII depletion of HCO3\u2212/CO2 as well as the suppression of carbonic anhydrase activity of PSII by a known inhibitor of \u03b1\u2011carbonic anhydrases, acetazolamide (AZM), was accompanied by a decrease of electron transport rate on the PSII donor side. It was concluded that carbonic anhydrase activity was required for maximum photosynthetic activity of PSII but it was not excluded that AZM may have two independent mechanisms of action on PSII: specific and nonspecific. To investigate directly the specific influence of carbonic anhydrase inhibition on the photosynthetic activity in PSII we used another known inhibitor of \u03b1\u2011carbonic anhydrase, trifluoromethanesulfonamide (TFMSA), which molecular structure and physicochemical properties are quite different from those of AZM. In this work, we show for the first time that TFMSA inhibits PSII carbonic anhydrase activity and decreases rates of both the photo-induced changes of chlorophyll fluorescence yield and the photosynthetic oxygen evolution. The inhibitory effect of TFMSA on PSII photosynthetic activity was revealed only in the medium depleted of HCO3\u2212/CO2. Addition of exogenous HCO3\u2212 or PSII electron donors led to disappearance of the TFMSA inhibitory effect on the electron transport in PSII, indicating that TFMSA inhibition site was located on the PSII donor side. These results show the specificity of TFMSA action on carbonic anhydrase and photosynthetic activities of PSII. In this work, we discuss the necessity of carbonic anhydrase activity for the maximum effectiveness of electron transport on the donor side of PSII.",

The coriobacterial model organism Adlercreutzia equolifaciens was used to investigate the enzymology of DMMK biosynthesis. A HemN-like class C radical S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (MenK2) from A. equolifaciens was produced in Wolinella succinogenes or Escherichia coli cells and found to methylate MK specifically at position C-7. In combination with a previously described MK methyltransferase (MqnK/MenK) dedicated to MK methylation at C-8, 7,8-DMMK6 was produced in W. succinogenes. The position of the two methyl groups was confirmed by two-dimensional NMR and midpoint redox potentials of 7-MMK6, 8-MMK6 and 7,8-DMMK6 were determined by cyclic voltammetry. A phylogenetic tree of MenK, MenK2 and HemN proteins revealed a Coriobacteriia-specific MenK2 clade. Using chimeric A. equolifaciens MenK/MenK2 proteins produced in E. coli it was shown that the combined linker and HemN domains determined the site-specificity of methylation. The results suggest that the use of MenK2 as a biomarker allows predicting the ability of DMMK synthesis in microbial species.",

Optical spectra of WTM and the L122Q mutant (where leucine 122 near BChl 8 is replaced with glutamine) are compared to WTI FMO. We show that WTM and L122Q samples are mixtures of two subpopulations of proteins, most likely induced by protein conformational changes during the isolation/purification procedures. Absorption, emission, and HB spectra of WTM and L122Q mutant are very similar, in which the low-energy trap (revealed by the nonresonant HB spectra) shifts to higher energies as a function of fluence, supporting a mixture model. No fluence-dependent shift is observed in the WTI FMO trimers. New Hamiltonians are provided for WTI and WTD proteins. Resonant HB spectra show that the internal energy relaxation times in the WTM and L122Q mutant are similar, and depend on excitation frequency. Fast average relaxation times (excited state lifetimes) are observed for burning into the main broad absorption band near 805\u00a0nm. Burning at longer wavelengths reveals slower total dephasing times. No resonant bleach is observed at \u03bbB\u00a0\u2264\u00a0803\u00a0nm, implying much faster (femtosecond) energy relaxation in this spectral range in agreement with 2D electronic spectroscopy frequency maps.",

Biological light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) efficiently absorbs in the blue and red spectral domains. Therefore, hybrid complexes of these two structures may be promising candidates for photovoltaic applications. Previous measurements had shown that LHCII bound to QD can transfer its excitation energy to the latter, as indicated by the fluorescence emissions of LHCII and QD being quenched and sensitized, respectively. In the presence of methyl viologen (MV), both fluorescence emissions are quenched, indicating an additional electron transfer process from QDs to MV. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirmed this notion and showed that electron transfer from QDs to MV is much faster than fluorescence energy transfer between LHCII and QD. The action spectrum of MV reduction by LHCII-QD complexes reflected the LHCII absorption spectrum, showing that light absorbed by LHCII and transferred to QDs increased the efficiency of MV reduction by QDs. Under continuous illumination, at least 28 turnovers were observed for the MV reduction. Presumably, the holes in QD cores were filled by a reducing agent in the reaction solution or by the dihydrolipoic-acid coating of the QDs.

Moreover, complex II stimulation was associated with SDHA subunit tyrosine phosphorylation. Despite the lack of detectable hydrogen peroxide production, up-regulation of the levels of mitochondrial antioxidant defenses revealed a significant redox unbalance. This effect was also supported by the finding that treatment with N-acetylcysteine dampened the complex II stimulation, SDHA subunit tyrosine phosphorylation, and levels of antioxidant enzymes. In the absence of complex III, the cellular amount of succinate, but not fumarate, was markedly increased, indicating that enhanced activity of complex II is hampered due to the blockage of respiratory electron flow. Thus, we propose that complex II phosphorylation and stimulation of its activity represent a molecular mechanism triggered by perturbation of mitochondrial redox homeostasis due to severe dysfunction of respiratory complexes. Depending on the site and nature of the damage, complex II stimulation can either bypass the energetic deficit as an efficient compensatory mechanism, or be ineffectual, leaving cells to rely on glycolysis for survival.",

The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) of P. falciparum is one source of such potential targets because enzymes, such as L-malate:quinone oxidoreductase (PfMQO), in this pathway are absent humans. PfMQO catalyzes the oxidation of L-malate to oxaloacetate and the simultaneous reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. It is a membrane protein, involved in three pathways (ETC, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the fumarate cycle) and has been shown to be essential for parasite survival, at least, in the intra-erythrocytic asexual stage. These findings indicate that PfMQO would be a valuable drug target for development of antimalarial with novel mechanism of action. Up to this point in time, difficulty in producing active recombinant mitochondrial MQO has hampered biochemical characterization and targeted drug discovery with MQO. Here we report for the first time recombinant PfMQO overexpressed in bacterial membrane and the first biochemical study. Furthermore, about 113 compounds, consisting of ubiquinone binding site inhibitors and antiparasitic agents, were screened resulting in the discovery of ferulenol as a potent PfMQO inhibitor. Finally, ferulenol was shown to inhibit parasite growth and showed strong synergism in combination with atovaquone, a well-described anti-malarial and bc1 complex inhibitor.",

     "abstract": "Microglia are highly dynamic cells in the brain. Their functional diversity and phenotypic versatility brought microglial energy metabolism into the focus of research. Although it is known that microenvironmental cues shape microglial phenotype, their bioenergetic response to local nutrient availability remains unclear.In the present study effects of energy substrates on the oxidative and glycolytic metabolism of primary \u2013 and BV-2 microglial cells were investigated. Cellular oxygen consumption, glycolytic activity, the levels of intracellular ATP/ADP, autophagy, mTOR phosphorylation, apoptosis and cell viability were measured in the absence of nutrients or in the presence of physiological energy substrates: glutamine, glucose, lactate, pyruvate or ketone bodies.All of the oxidative energy metabolites increased the rate of basal and maximal respiration. However, the addition of glucose decreased microglial oxidative metabolism and glycolytic activity was enhanced. Increased ATP/ADP ratio and cell viability, activation of the mTOR and reduction of autophagic activity were observed in glutamine-supplemented media. Moreover, moderate and transient oxidation of ketone bodies was highly enhanced by glutamine, suggesting that anaplerosis of the TCA-cycle could stimulate ketone body oxidation.It is concluded that microglia show high metabolic plasticity and utilize a wide range of substrates. Among them glutamine is the most efficient metabolite. To our knowledge these data provide the first account of microglial direct metabolic response to nutrients under short-term starvation and demonstrate that microglia exhibit versatile metabolic machinery. Our finding that microglia have a distinct bioenergetic profile provides a critical foundation for specifying microglial contributions to brain energy metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Intracytoplasmic vesicles (chromatophores) in the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides represent a minimal structural and functional unit for absorbing photons and utilising their energy for the generation of ATP. The cytochrome bc1 complex (cytbc1) is one of the four major components of the chromatophore alongside the reaction centre-light harvesting 1-PufX core complex (RC-LH1-PufX), the light-harvesting 2 complex (LH2), and ATP synthase. Although the membrane organisation of these complexes is known, their local lipid environments have not been investigated. Here we utilise poly(styrene-alt-maleic acid) (SMA) co-polymers as a tool to simultaneously determine the local lipid environments of the RC-LH1-PufX, LH2 and cytbc1 complexes. SMA has previously been reported to effectively solubilise complexes in lipid-rich membrane regions whilst leaving lipid-poor ordered protein arrays intact. Here we show that SMA solubilises cytbc1 complexes with an efficiency of nearly 70%, whereas solubilisation of RC-LH1-PufX and LH2 was only 10% and 22% respectively. This high susceptibility of cytbc1 to SMA solubilisation is consistent with this complex residing in a locally lipid-rich region. SMA solubilised cytbc1 complexes retain their native dimeric structure and co-purify with 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 phospholipids from the chromatophore membrane. We extended this approach to the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, and show that the cytochrome b6f complex (cytb6f) and Photosystem II (PSII) complexes are susceptible to SMA solubilisation, suggesting they also reside in lipid-rich environments. Thus, lipid-rich membrane regions could be a general requirement for cytbc1/cytb6f complexes, providing a favourable local solvent to promote rapid quinol/quinone binding and release at the Q0 and Qi sites.",

The time-dependent cellular fluorescence spectrum has been measured, while having previously exposed the cells to different conditions that affect respiratory activity. The analysis method used allows the detected signal to be decomposed in a few components that are then assigned to functional emitting species. Additionally, we have worked out a minimal mathematical model consisting of sensible postulated species to interpret the recorded data. We conclude that the following two functional complexes play a major role: a phycobilisome antenna complex coupled to a PSII dimer with either two or no closed reaction centers.

Variable temperature variable field (VTVH) Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD) spectra in PSII of Thermosynochococcus (T.) vulcanus for each S-state are reported. These spectra, along with assignments, provide a new window into the electronic and magnetic structure of Mn4CaO5. VTVH MCD spectra taken in the S2 state provide a clear g\u00a0=\u00a02, S\u00a0=\u00a01/2 paramagnetic characteristic, which is entirely consistent with that known by EPR. The three features, seen as positive (+) at 749\u00a0nm, negative (\u2212) at 773\u00a0nm and (+) at 808\u00a0nm are assigned as 4A\u00a0\u2192\u00a02E spin-flips within the d3 configuration of the Mn(IV) centres present. This assignment is supported by comparison(s) to spin-flips seen in a range of Mn(IV) materials. S3 exhibits a more intense (\u2212) MCD peak at 764\u00a0nm and has a stronger MCD saturation characteristic. This S3 MCD saturation behaviour can be accurately modelled using parameters taken directly from analyses of EPR spectra. We see no evidence for Mn(III) d-d absorption in the near-IR of any S-state. We suggest that Mn(IV)-based absorption may be responsible for the well-known near-IR induced changes induced in S2 EPR spectra of T. vulcanus and not Mn(III)-based, as has been commonly assumed. Through an analysis of the nephelauxetic effect, the excitation energy of S-state dependent spin-flips seen may help identify coordination characteristics and changes at each Mn(IV).

     "abstract": "The physiological role of the mitochondrial ATP synthase complex is to generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Indeed, the enzyme can reverse its activity and hydrolyze ATP under ischemic conditions, as shown in isolated mitochondria and in mammalian heart and liver. However, what occurs when cancer cells experience hypoxia or anoxia has not been well explored. In the present study, we investigated the bioenergetics of cancer cells under hypoxic/anoxic conditions with particular emphasis on ATP synthase, and the conditions driving it to work in reverse. In this context, we further examined the role exerted by its endogenous inhibitor factor, IF1, that it is overexpressed in cancer cells. Metabolic and bioenergetic analysis of cancer cells exposed to severe hypoxia (down to 0.1% O2) unexpectedly showed that \u0394\u03c8m is preserved independently of the presence of IF1 and that ATP synthase still phosphorylates ADP though at a much lower rate than in normoxia. However, when we induced an anoxia-mimicking condition by collapsing \u0394\u03bc\u0397+ with the FCCP uncoupler, the IF1-silenced clones only reversed the ATP synthase activity hydrolyzing ATP in order to reconstitute the electrochemical proton gradient. Notably, in cancer cells IF1 overexpression fully prevents ATP synthase hydrolytic activity activation under uncoupling conditions. Therefore, our results suggest that IF1 overexpression promotes cancer cells survival under temporary anoxic conditions by preserving cellular ATP despite mitochondria dysfunction.",

In membranes obtained from the strain that only expresses cytochrome bd-I a great ROS overproduction was observed in the presence of microcin J25.

The identity and function of helix W have remained unknown for over 13\u00a0years; here we use a combination of biochemistry, mass spectrometry, molecular genetics and electron microscopy to identify this protein as RPA4402 in Rps. palustris CGA009. Protein W shares key conserved sequence features with PufX homologs, and although a deletion mutant was able to grow under photosynthetic conditions with no discernible phenotype, we show that a tagged version of protein W pulls down the RC-LH1 complex.

So far, most of the FTIR studies of the reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis have been performed using isolated photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) preparations, which, however, could be modified during isolation procedures. In this study, we developed a methodology to evaluate the photosynthetic activities of thylakoids using FTIR spectroscopy. FTIR difference spectra upon successive flashes using thylakoids from spinach exhibited signals typical of the S-state cycle at the Mn4CaO5 cluster and QB reactions in PSII with period-four and -two oscillations, respectively. Similar measurement in the presence of an artificial quinone as an exogenous electron acceptor showed features specific to the S-state cycle. Simulations of the oscillation patterns provided the quantum efficiencies of the S-state cycle and electron transfer in PSII. Moreover, FTIR measurement under continuous illumination on thylakoids in the presence of DCMU showed signals due to QA reduction and P700 oxidation simultaneously. From the relative amplitudes of marker bands of QA\u2212 and P700+, the molar ratio of photoactive PSII and PSI centers in thylakoids was estimated.

     "abstract": "One of the less understood parts of the catalytic cycle of cytochrome bc1/b6f complexes is the mechanism of electronic bifurcation occurring within the hydroquinone oxidation site (Qo site). Several models describing this mechanism invoke a phenomenon of formation of an unstable semiquinone. Recent studies with isolated cytochrome bc1 or b6f revealed that a relatively stable semiquinone spin-coupled to the reduced Rieske cluster (SQ-FeS) is generated at the Qo site during the oxidation of ubi- or plastohydroquinone analogs under conditions of continuous turnover. Here, we identified the EPR transition of SQ-FeS formed upon oxidation of ubihydroquinone in native photosynthetic membranes from purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. We observed a significant amount of SQ-FeS generated when the antimycin-inhibited enzyme experiences conditions of non-equilibrium caused by the continuous light activation of the reaction center. We also noted that SQ-FeS cannot be detected under equilibrium redox titrations in dark. The non-equilibrium redox titrations of SQ-FeS indicate that this center has a higher apparent redox midpoint potential when compared to the redox midpoint potential of the quinone pool. This suggests that SQ-FeS is stabilized, which corroborates a recently proposed mechanism in which the SQ-FeS state is metastable and functions to safely hold electrons at the local energy minimum during the oxidation of ubihydroquinone and limits superoxide formation. Our results open new possibilities to study the formation and properties of this state in cytochromes bc under close to physiological conditions in which non-equilibrium is attained by the light activation of bacterial reaction centers or photosystems.",

     "abstract": "Large assemblies of respiratory chain complexes, known as supercomplexes, are present in the mitochondrial membrane in mammals and yeast, as well as in some bacterial membranes. The formation of supercomplexes is thought to contribute to efficient electron transfer, stabilization of each enzyme complex, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this study, mitochondria from various organisms were solubilized with digitonin, and then the solubilized complexes were separated by blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE). The results revealed a supercomplex consisting of complexes I, III, and IV in mitochondria from bovine and porcine heart, and a supercomplex consisting primarily of complexes I and III in mitochondria from mouse heart and liver. However, supercomplexes were barely detectable in Drosophila flight-muscle mitochondria, and only dimeric complex V was present. Drosophila mitochondria exhibited the highest rates of oxygen consumption and NADH oxidation, and the concentrations of the electron carriers, cytochrome c and quinone were higher than in other species. Respiratory chain complexes were tightly packed in the mitochondrial membrane containing abundant phosphatidylethanolamine with the fatty acid palmitoleic acid (C16:1), which is relatively high oxidation-resistant as compared to poly-unsaturated fatty acid. These properties presumably allow efficient electron transfer in Drosophila. These findings reveal the existence of a new mechanism of biological adaptation independent of supercomplex formation.",

     "abstract": "Missense mutations of the human mitochondrial citrate carrier, encoded by the SLC25A1 gene, lead to an autosomal recessive neurometabolic disorder characterised by neonatal-onset encephalopathy with severe muscular weakness, intractable seizures, respiratory distress, and lack of psychomotor development, often resulting in early death. Here, we have measured the effect of all twelve known pathogenic mutations on the transport activity. The results show that nine mutations abolish transport of citrate completely, whereas the other three reduce the transport rate by >\u00a070%, indicating that impaired citrate transport is the most likely primary cause of the disease. Some mutations may be detrimental to the structure of the carrier, whereas others may impair key functional elements, such as the substrate binding site and the salt bridge network on the matrix side of the carrier. To understand the consequences of impaired citrate transport on metabolism, the substrate specificity was also determined, showing that the human citrate carrier predominantly transports citrate, isocitrate, cis-aconitate, phosphoenolpyruvate and malate. Although D-2- and L-2 hydroxyglutaric aciduria is a metabolic hallmark of the disease, it is unlikely that the citrate carrier plays a significant role in the removal of hydroxyglutarate from the cytosol for oxidation to oxoglutarate in the mitochondrial matrix. In contrast, computer simulations of central metabolism predict that the export of citrate from the mitochondrion cannot be fully compensated by other pathways, restricting the cytosolic production of acetyl-CoA that is required for the synthesis of lipids, sterols, dolichols and ubiquinone, which in turn explains the severe disease phenotypes.",

Here we present the first biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of an NAD+-reducing [NiFe]\u2011hydrogenase that sustains catalytic activity at high temperatures and in the presence of O2, which usually acts as an inhibitor. We isolated and sequenced the four structural genes, hoxFUYH, encoding the soluble NAD+-reducing [NiFe]\u2011hydrogenase (SH) from the thermophilic betaproteobacterium, Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus TH-1T (Ht). The HtSH was recombinantly overproduced in a hydrogenase-free mutant of the well-studied, H2-oxidizing betaproteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16 (Re). The enzyme was purified and characterized with various biochemical and spectroscopic techniques. Highest H2-mediated NAD+ reduction activity was observed at 80\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a06.5, and catalytic activity was found to be sustained at low O2 concentrations. Infrared spectroscopic analyses revealed a spectral pattern for as-isolated HtSH that is remarkably different from those of the closely related ReSH and other [NiFe]\u2011hydrogenases. This indicates an unusual configuration of the oxidized catalytic center in HtSH. Complementary electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopic analyses revealed spectral signatures similar to related NAD+-reducing [NiFe]\u2011hydrogenases. This study lays the groundwork for structural and functional analyses of the HtSH as well as application of this enzyme for H2-driven cofactor recycling under oxic conditions at elevated temperatures.",

Assay of the SorT Mo centre catalytic competency in the absence of SorU showed that substitutions in the central arginine (R78Q, R78K and R78M mutations) only moderately altered SorT catalytic properties, except for R78M which caused significant reduction in SorT activity. The substitutions also altered the Mo-centre redox potentials (MoVI/V potential lowered by ca. 60\u201380\u00a0mV). However, all Arg78 mutations significantly impaired the ability of SorT to transfer electrons to SorU, where activities were reduced 17 to 46-fold compared to SorTWT, precluding determination of kinetic parameters. This was accompanied by the observation of conformational changes in both the introduced Gln and Lys residues in the crystal structure of the enzymes. Taking into account data collected by others on related SOE mutations we propose that the formation and maintenance of an electron transfer complex between the Mo centre and electron accepting heme groups is the main function of the central arginine, and that the reduced turnover and increases in KMsulfite are caused by the inefficient operation of the oxidative half reaction of the catalytic cycle in enzymes carrying these mutations.",

They bind a cofactor (H-cluster) comprising a four-iron and a diiron unit with three carbon monoxide (CO) and two cyanide (CN\u2212) ligands. Hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) binding at the H-cluster was studied in the C169A variant of [FeFe]-hydrogenase HYDA1, in comparison to the active oxidized (Hox) and CO-inhibited (Hox-CO) species in wildtype enzyme. 57Fe labeling of the diiron site was achieved by in vitro maturation with a synthetic cofactor analogue.

The axial ligand to the central Mg2\u00a0+ of the ec2A and ec2B chlorophylls is a water molecule that is also H-bonded to a nearby Asn residue. Here, we investigate the importance of this interaction for charge separation by converting each of the Asn residues to a Leu in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, and studying the energy and electron transfer using time-resolved optical and EPR spectroscopy. Nanosecond transient absorbance measurements of the PhQ to FX electron transfer show that in both species, the PsaA-N604L mutation (near ec2B) results in a ~\u00a050% reduction in the amount of electron transfer in the B-branch, while the PsaB-N591L mutation (near ec2A) results in a ~\u00a070% reduction in the amount of electron transfer in the A-branch. A diminished quantum yield of P700+\u00a0PhQ\u2212 is also observed in ultrafast optical experiments, but the lower yield does not appear to be a consequence of charge recombination in the nanosecond or microsecond timescales. The most significant finding is that the yield of electron transfer in the unaffected branch did not increase to compensate for the lower yield in the affected branch. Hence, each branch of the reaction center appears to operate independently of the other in carrying out light-induced charge separation.",

In its reduced form, NADH is a ubiquitous cellular electron donor. NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/NADH ratio have long been known to control the activity of several oxidoreductase enzymes. More recently, enzymes outside those participating directly in redox control have been identified that sense these dinucleotides, including the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein deacylases. In this review, we highlight examples of non-redox enzymes that are controlled by NAD+, NADH, or NAD+/NADH. In particular, we focus on the sirtuin family and assess the current evidence that the sirtuin enzymes sense these dinucleotides and discuss the biological conditions under which this might occur; we conclude that sirtuins sense NAD+, but neither NADH nor the ratio. Finally, we identify future studies that might be informative to further interrogate physiological and pathophysiological changes in NAD+ and NADH, as well as enzymes like sirtuins that sense and respond to redox changes in the cell.",

The Mn-proteins were shown to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide into molecular oxygen. The loss of hydrogen peroxide was dependent upon the concentration of protein with bound Mn, with the proteins containing multiple Mn-clusters showing greater activity. Using an oxygen sensor, the oxygen concentration was found to increase with a rate up to 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM/min, which was dependent upon the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and the Mn-protein. In addition, the Mn-proteins were shown to serve as electron donors to bacterial reaction centers using optical spectroscopy. Similar binding of the Mn-proteins to reaction centers was observed with an average dissociation constant of 2.3\u00a0\u03bcM. The Mn-proteins with three metal centers were more effective at this electron transfer reaction than the Mn-proteins with one or two metal centers.

Although mitochondrial ROS release is influenced by \u2206\u03a8mt and respiratory state, the relationship between these properties remains controversial primarily because they have not been measured simultaneously. We developed a multiparametric method for probing mitochondrial function that allowed precise characterization of the temporal relationship between ROS, \u2206\u03a8mt and respiration. We uncovered a previously unknown spontaneous ROS spike \u2013 termed mitochondrial transition ROS spike (mTRS) \u2013 associated with re-polarization of \u2206\u03a8mt that occurs at the transition between mitochondrial energy states. Pharmacological inhibition of complex CI (CI), nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) and antioxidant system significantly decreased the ability of mitochondria to exhibit mTRS. NADH levels followed a similar trend to that of ROS during the mTRS, providing a link between CI and NNT in mTRS regulation. We show that (i) mTRS is enhanced by simultaneous activation of CI and complex II (CII); (ii) CI is the principal origin of mTRS; (iii) NNT regulates mTRS via NADH- and \u2206\u03a8mt-dependent mechanisms; (iv) mTRS is not a pH spike; and (v), mTRS changes in amplitude under stress conditions and its occurrence can be a signature of mitochondrial health.

Especially under high light, oxygen can be reduced and forms reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can oxidize CF1Fo among various other biomolecules. Mutation of the conserved ROS targets resulted in a tolerant enzyme, suggesting that ROS might play a regulatory role. The mutations had several side effects in vitro, including disturbance of the ATPase redox regulation [F. Buchert et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 1817 (2012) 2038\u20132048].

At physiological value of ionic strength, the inhibition can be observed at any turnover number of CcO, rather than only at low TN (<\u00a010\u00a0s\u22121) as found previously. The inhibition requires partially oxidized state of cytochrome c and is favored by high ionic strength with a sharp transition at 0.1\u20130.2\u00a0M.

To image and monitor intracellular ATP level without cell breakage, biological and chemical sensors were developed in the last years. Here, we have internalized a rhodamine-based sensor RSL+ into living cells and monitored the mitochondrial ATP levels in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts. To evaluate the robustness of the sensor we imaged the changes of the mitochondrial ATP levels under non-physiological conditions upon incubation with FCCP, oligomycin, azide, deoxyglucose or phosphoenolpyruvate; all compounds that interfere with ATP homeostasis of the cell. The ATP sensor allowed us to determine the mitochondrial ATP levels in human skin fibroblasts where we observe a similar amount of ATP compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We propose the RSL+ to be a valuable tool for the assessment of mitochondrial dysfunction in human cells derived from mitochondrial OXPHOS patients and for basic studies on bioenergetics metabolism.",

     "abstract": "The desert microalga Chlorella ohadii was reported to grow at extreme light intensities with minimal photoinhibition, tolerate frequent de/re-hydrations, yet minimally employs antenna-based non-photochemical quenching for photoprotection. Here we investigate the molecular mechanisms by measuring Photosystem II charge separation yield (chlorophyll variable fluorescence, Fv/Fm) and flash-induced O2 yield to measure the contributions from both linear (PSII-LEF) and cyclic (PSII-CEF) electron flow within PSII. Cells grow increasingly faster at higher light intensities (\u03bcE/m2/s) from low (20) to high (200) to extreme (2000) by escalating photoprotection via shifting from PSII-LEF to PSII-CEF. This shifts PSII charge separation from plastoquinone reduction (PSII-LEF) to plastoquinol oxidation (PSII-CEF), here postulated to enable proton gradient and ATP generation that powers photoprotection. Low light-grown cells have unusually small antennae (332 Chl/PSII), use mainly PSII-LEF (95%) and convert 40% of PSII charge separations into O2 (a high O2 quantum yield of 0.06\u00a0mol/mol PSII/flash). High light-grown cells have smaller antenna and lower PSII-LEF (63%). Extreme light-grown cells have only 42 Chl/PSII (no LHCII antenna), minimal PSII-LEF (10%), and grow faster than any known phototroph (doubling time 1.3\u00a0h). Adding a synthetic quinone in excess to supplement the PQ pool fully uncouples PSII-CEF from its natural regulation and produces maximum PSII-LEF. Upon dark adaptation PSII-LEF rapidly reverts to PSII-CEF, a transient protection mechanism to conserve water and minimize the cost of antenna biosynthesis. The capacity of the electron acceptor pool (plastoquinone pool), and the characteristic times for exchange of (PQH2)B with PQpool and reoxidation of (PQH2)pool were determined.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial NO-reductases (NOR) belong to the heme-copper oxidase (HCuO) superfamily, in which most members are O2-reducing, proton-pumping enzymes. This study is one in a series aiming to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of the HCuOs, including the mechanisms for cellular energy conservation. One approach towards this goal is to compare the mechanisms for the different types of HCuOs, cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and NOR, reducing the two substrates O2 and NO. Specifically in this study, we describe the mechanism for oxygen reduction in cytochrome c dependent NOR (cNOR). Hybrid density functional calculations were performed on large cluster models of the cNOR binuclear active site. Our results are used, together with published experimental information, to construct a free energy profile for the entire catalytic cycle. Although the overall reaction is quite exergonic, we show that during the reduction of molecular oxygen in cNOR, two of the reduction steps are endergonic with high barriers for proton uptake, which is in contrast to oxygen reduction in CcO, where all reduction steps are exergonic. This difference between the two enzymes is suggested to be important for their differing capabilities for energy conservation. An additional result from this study is that at least three of the four reduction steps are initiated by proton transfer to the active site, which is in contrast to CcO, where electrons always arrive before the protons to the active site. The roles of the non-heme metal ion and the redox-active tyrosine in the active site are also discussed.",

The absorbance in the red edge of PS I absorption spectrum has an unusual exponential dependence on wavelength. The cutoff of short wavelength components of 760\u00a0nm pulse allows direct excitation of reaction center chlorophyll molecules without involvement of light-harvesting antenna. The transient spectrum manifests the features of the primary ion-radical pair P700+\u00a0A0\u2212 at time delay <\u00a0180\u00a0fs, followed by formation of the secondary pair P700+\u00a0A1\u2212 with a characteristic time of 26\u00a0ps. The obtained data are rationalized in the framework of adiabatic three-state model that includes the chlorophyll dimer P700 and two symmetrically arranged nearest chlorophyll molecules of A0. The arrangement of chlorophylls results in strong electronic coupling between P700 and A0. Excitation in the maximum of P700 absorption generates electronic states with the highest contribution from P700*, whereas excitation in the far-red edge predominantly generates charge transfer state P700+\u00a0A0\u2212 in both branches of redox-cofactors. The three-level model accounts for a flat-bottomed potential surface of the excited state and adiabatic character of electron transfer between P700 and A0, providing a microscopic explanation of the ultrafast formation of P700+\u00a0A0\u2212 and exponential decline of PS I absorption.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier catalyses the equimolar exchange of adenosine di- and tri-phosphates. It operates by an alternating access mechanism in which a single substrate-binding site is made available either to the mitochondrial matrix or the intermembrane space through conformational changes. These changes are prevented in the absence of substrate by a large energy barrier due to the need for sequential disruption and formation of a matrix and cytoplasmic salt bridge network that are located on either side of the central cavity. In analogy to enzyme catalysis, substrate lowers the energy barrier by binding tighter in the intermediate state. Here we provide an in-silico kinetic model that captures the free energy profile of these conformational changes and treats the carrier as a nanomachine moving stochastically from the matrix to cytoplasmic conformation under the influence of thermal energy. The model reproduces the dependency of experimentally determined kcat and KM values on the cytoplasmic network strength with good quantitative accuracy, implying that it captures the transport mechanism and can provide a framework to understand the structure-function relationships of this class of transporter. The results show that maximum transport occurs when the interaction energies of the cytoplasmic network, matrix network and substrate binding are approximately equal such that the energy barrier is minimized. Consequently, the model predicts that there will be other interactions in addition to those of the cytoplasmic network that stabilise the matrix conformation of the ADP/ATP carrier.",

The rapid phase reflects electron redistribution between CuA and heme b. The slow phase includes electron redistribution from both CuA and heme b to heme a3, and electrogenic proton transfer coupled to reduction of heme a3. The distance of proton translocation corresponds to uptake of a proton from the inner water phase into the binuclear center where heme a3 is reduced, but there is no proton pumping and no reduction of CuB. Single-electron reduction of the oxidized \u201cunrelaxed\u201d state (OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0EH transition) is accompanied by electrogenic reduction of the heme b/heme a3 pair by CuA in a \u201cfast\u201d phase (~\u00a022\u00a0\u03bcs) and transfer of protons in \u201cmiddle\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d electrogenic phases (~\u00a00.185\u00a0ms and ~\u00a00.78\u00a0ms) coupled to electron redistribution from the heme b/heme a3 pair to the CuB site. The \u201cmiddle\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d electrogenic phases seem to be associated with transfer of protons to the proton-loading site (PLS) of the proton pump, but when all injected electrons reach CuB the electronic charge appears to be compensated by back-leakage of the protons from the PLS into the binuclear site. Thus proton pumping occurs only to the extent of ~\u00a00.1 H+/e\u2212, probably due to the formed membrane potential in the experiment.",

The LH1 antenna of mesophilic species of phototrophic bacteria such as Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides does not possess such properties. We have engineered calcium-ion binding into the LH1 antenna of Rba. sphaeroides by progressively modifying the native LH1 polypeptides with sequences from Tch. tepidum. We show that acquisition of the C-terminal domains from LH1 \u03b1 and \u03b2 of Tch. tepidum is sufficient to activate calcium-ion binding and the extent of red-shifting increases with the proportion of Tch. tepidum sequence incorporated. However, full exchange of the LH1 polypeptides with those of Tch. tepidum results in misassembled core complexes. Isolated \u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptides from our most successful mutant were reconstituted in vitro with BChl a to form an LH1-type complex, which was stabilised 3-fold by calcium-ions. Additionally, carotenoid specificity was changed from spheroidene found in Rba. sphaeroides to spirilloxanthin found in Tch. tepidum, with the latter enhancing in vitro formation of LH1. These data show that the C-terminal LH1 \u03b1/\u03b2 domains of Tch. tepidum behave autonomously, and are able to transmit calcium-ion induced conformational changes to BChls bound to the rest of a foreign antenna complex. Thus, elements of foreign antenna complexes, such as calcium-ion binding and blue/red switching of absorption, can be ported into Rhodobacter sphaeroides using careful design processes.",

The architecture of the pigments, chlorophylls, and carotenoids bound to each LHC is responsible for the efficient excitation energy transfer resulting in photochemistry. So far, the only LHC studied in depth was LHCII, the most abundant membrane protein of plants, while less information was available for the other antennae. In particular, despite the availability of the structure of CP29 obtained at near atomic resolution in 2011 (Pan et al., 2011), the mismatch in pigment content and spectroscopic properties between CP29 in solution and in the crystal has hampered the possibility to use the structure to interpret the experimental data. In this work, we purified CP29 and its larger assembly (CP29-LHCII-CP24) from the membrane in very mild conditions using a His-tag, and we have studied their pigment binding and spectroscopic properties. In addition, we have performed mutation analysis in vivo to obtain mutants of CP29 lacking individual chlorophylls. The peculiar properties of this antenna support its role in directing the energy flow from the external antennae to the reaction center.",

In this way, these enzymes also contribute to the regeneration of NAD+, allowing several metabolic pathways to proceed. As for the other members of the two-Dinucleotide Binding Domains Flavoprotein (tDBDF) superfamily, the enzymatic mechanism of NDH-2s is still little explored and elusive.In this work we addressed the role of the conserved glutamate 172 (E172) residue in the enzymatic mechanism of NDH-2 from Staphylococcus aureus. We aimed to test our earlier hypothesis that E172 plays a key role in proton transfer to allow the protonation of the quinone. For this we performed a complete biochemical characterization of the enzyme's variants E172A, E172Q and E172S. Our steady state kinetic measurements show a clear decrease in the overall reaction rate, and our substrate interaction studies indicate the binding of the two substrates is also affected by these mutations. Interestingly our fast kinetic results show quinone reduction is more affected than NADH oxidation. We have also determined the X-ray crystal structure of the E172S mutant (2.55\u00a0\u01fa) and compared it with the structure of the wild type (2.32\u00a0\u01fa).

     "abstract": "The structural polymorphism of the oxygen-evolving complex is of great significance to photosynthetic water oxidation. Employing density functional theory calculations, we have made further advisement on the interconversion mechanism of O5 transfer in the S2 state, mainly focusing on the potentiality of multi-state reactivity and spin transitions. Then, O5 protonation is proven impossible in S2 for irreversibility of the interconversion, which serves as an auxiliary judgment for the protonation state of O5 in S1. Besides, the structural polymorphism could also be archived by alternative mechanisms involving Mn3 ligand exchange, one of which with Mn3(III) makes sense to substrate water exchange in S2, although being irresponsible for the derivations of the observed EPR signals. During the water exchange, high-spin states would prevail to facilitate electron transfer between the ferromagnetically coupled Mn centers. In addition, water exchange in S1 could account for the closed-cubane structure as the initial form entering S2 at cryogenic temperatures. With regard to water oxidation, the structural flexibility and variability in both S2 and S3 guarantee smooth W2-O5 coupling in S4, according to the substrate assignments from water exchange kinetics. Within this theoretical framework, the new XFEL findings on S1-S3 can be readily rationalized. Finally, an alternative mechanistic scenario for OO bond formation with \u00b7OH radical near O4 is presented, followed by water binding to the pivot Mn4(III) from O4 side during S4-S0. This may diversify the substrate sources combined with the Ca channel in water delivery for the forthcoming S-cycle.",

Here we report the molecular structure of FoxE, the putative terminal iron oxidase of Rhodobacter ferrooxidans SW2. This protein is organized as a trimer with two hemes and a disulfide bridge per monomer. The distance between hemes, their solvent exposure and the surface electrostatics ensure a controlled electron transfer rate. They also guarantee segregation between electron capture from ferrous iron and electron release to downstream acceptors, which do not favor the precipitation of ferric iron.

These four distinct states are PSII in the quenched or unquenched state, and with its reaction center either open or closed depending upon the reduction of the QA site. With this method we can describe the dynamics of the NPQ induction and recovery as well as quantify the percentage of photoinactivated RC throughout the measurement. We show that after one cycle of quenching followed by a period of recovery, approximately 8\u20139% of the RC are photoinactivated, after two cycles of illumination this number becomes 15-17%. The recovery from the quenching appeared with rates of (50\u00a0s)\u2212\u00a01 and (1\u00a0h)\u2212\u00a01. The new analysis method presented here is flexible, allowing it to be applied to any type of PAM fluorometry protocol. The method allows to quantitatively compare qualitatively different PAM curves on the basis of statistically relevant fitting parameters and to quantify quenching dynamics and photoinactivation. Moreover, the results presented here demonstrate that the analysis of a single PAM fluorometry quenching experiment can already provide information on the relative quantum yield of the four different states of PSII for the intact chloroplasts - something no other form of spectroscopy could provide in a single measurement.",

Results show that oxidation of arsenite at the active site is extremely fast with a rate of >\u00a04000\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and reduction of the electron acceptor is rate-limiting. An AioB-F108A mutation results in increased activity with the artificial electron acceptor DCPIP and decreased activity with cytochrome c, which in the latter as demonstrated by ITC is not due to an effect on the protein-protein interaction but instead to an effect on electron transfer. These results provide further support that the AioB F108 is important in electron transfer between the Rieske subunit and cytochrome c and its absence in the arsenite oxidases from the Betaproteobacteria may explain the inability of these enzymes to use this electron acceptor.",

In addition, microarray analysis of an OmcF-deficient mutant revealed that many of the genes with decreased transcript level were those whose expression is up-regulated in cells grown with a graphite electrode as electron acceptor, suggesting that OmcF also regulates the electron transfer to electrode surfaces and the concomitant electricity production by G. sulfurreducens in microbial fuel cells. 15N,13C\u2013labeled OmcF was produced and NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the solution structure of the protein in the fully reduced state and the pH-dependent conformational changes. In addition, 15N relaxation NMR experiments were used to characterize the overall and internal backbone dynamics of OmcF. The structure obtained is well-defined, with an average pairwise root mean square deviation of 0.37\u00a0\u00c5 for the backbone atoms and 0.98\u00a0\u00c5 for all heavy atoms. For the first time a solution structure and the protein motions were determined for an outer membrane cytochrome from G. sulfurreducens, which constitutes an important step to understand the extracellular electron transfer mechanism in Geobacter cells.",

     "abstract": "Heterocyst is a nitrogen-fixing cell differentiated from a cell for oxygen-evolving photosynthesis (vegetative cell) in some filamentous cyanobacteria when fixed nitrogen (e.g., ammonia and nitrate) is limited. Heterocysts appear at multiple separated positions in a single filament with an interval of 10\u201320 cells in some genera (including Anabaena variabilis). In other genera, a single heterocyst appears only at the basal terminal in a filament (including Rivularia M-261). Such morphological diversity may necessitate different properties of heterocysts. However, possible differences in heterocysts have largely remained unexplored due to the minority of heterocysts among major vegetative cells. Here, we have applied spectroscopic microscopy to Rivularia and A. variabilis to analyze their thylakoid membranes in individual cells. Absorption and fluorescence spectral imaging enabled us to estimate concentrations and interconnections of key photosynthetic components like photosystem I (PSI), photosystem II (PSII) and subunits of light-harvesting phycobilisome including phycocyanin (PC). The concentration of PC in heterocysts of Rivularia is far higher than that of A. variabilis. Fluorescence quantum yield of PC in Rivularia heterocysts was found to be virtually the same as those in its vegetative cells, while fluorescence quantum yield of PC in A. variabilis heterocysts was enhanced in comparison with its vegetative cells. PSI concentration in the thylakoid membranes of heterocysts seems to remain nearly the same as those of the vegetative cells in both the species. The average stoichiometric ratio between PSI monomer and PC hexamer in Rivularia heterocysts is estimated to be about 1:1.",

     "abstract": "Previously suggested antioxidant mechanisms for mitochondria-targeted plastoquinone SkQ1 included: i) ion-pairing of cationic SkQ1+ with free fatty acid anions resulting in uncoupling; ii) SkQ1H2 ability to interact with lipoperoxyl radical; iii) interference with electron flow at the inner ubiquinone (Q) binding site of Complex III (Qi), involving the reduction of SkQ1 to SkQ1H2 by ubiquinol. We elucidated SkQ1 antioxidant properties by confocal fluorescence semi-quantification of mitochondrial superoxide (Jm) and cytosolic H2O2 (Jc) release rates in HepG2 cells. Only in glycolytic cells, SkQ1 prevented the rotenone-induced enhancement of Jm and Jc but not basal releases without rotenone. The effect ceased in glutaminolytic aglycemic cells, in which the redox parameter NAD(P)H/FAD increased after rotenone in contrast to its decrease in glycolytic cells. Autofluorescence decay indicated decreased NADPH/NADH ratios with rotenone in both metabolic modes. SkQ1 did not increase cell respiration and diminished Jm established high by antimycin or myxothiazol but not by stigmatellin. The revealed SkQ1 antioxidant modes reflect its reduction to SkQ1H2 at Complex I IQ or Complex III Qi site. Both reductions diminish electron diversions to oxygen thus attenuating superoxide formation. Resulting SkQ1H2 oxidizes back to SkQ1at the second (flavin) Complex I site, previously indicated for MitoQ10. Regeneration proceeds only at lower NAD(P)H/FAD in glycolytic cells. In contrast, cyclic SkQ1 reduction/SkQ1H2 oxidation does not substantiate antioxidant activity in intact cells in the absence of oxidative stress (neither pro-oxidant activity, representing a great advantage). A targeted delivery to oxidative-stressed tissues is suggested for the effective antioxidant therapy based on SkQ1.",

     "abstract": "The molecular mechanism of proton pumping by heme-copper oxidases (HCO) has intrigued the scientific community since it was first proposed. We have recently reported a novel technology that enables the continuous characterisation of proton transport activity of a HCO and ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli, cytochrome bo3, for hundreds of seconds on the single enzyme level (Li et al. J Am Chem Soc 137 (2015) 16055\u201316063). Here, we have extended these studies by additional experiments and analyses of the proton transfer rate as a function of proteoliposome size and pH at the N- and P-side of single HCOs. Proton transport activity of cytochrome bo3 was found to decrease with increased curvature of the membrane. Furthermore, proton uptake at the N-side (proton entrance) was insensitive to pH between pH\u00a06.4\u20138.4, while proton release at the P-side had an optimum pH of ~\u00a07.4, suggesting that the pH optimum is related to proton release from the proton exit site. Our previous single-enzyme experiments identified rare, long-lived conformation states of cytochrome bo3 where protons leak back under turn-over conditions. Here, we analyzed and found that ~\u00a023% of cytochrome bo3 proteoliposomes show \u0394pH half-lives below 50\u00a0s after stopping turnover, while only ~\u00a05% of the proteoliposomes containing a non-pumping mutant, E286C cytochrome bo3 exhibit such fast decays. These single-enzyme results confirm our model in which HCO exhibit heterogeneous pumping rates and can adopt rare leak states in which protons are able to rapidly flow back.",

In this study, we examined electrostatic interaction of Psb31 with PSII complexes isolated from the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis. Positive or negative charges of isolated Psb31 proteins were modified with N-succinimidyl propionate (NSP) or glycine methyl ester (GME), respectively, resulting in formation of uncharged groups. NSP-modified Psb31 did not bind to PSII with a concomitant increase in NSP concentration, whereas GME-modified Psb31 clearly bound to PSII with retention of oxygen-evolving activity, indicating that positive charges of Lys residues and the N-terminus on the surface of Psb31 are involved in electrostatic interactions with PSII intrinsic proteins. Mass spectrometry analysis of NSP-modified Psb31 and sequence comparisons of Psb31 from C. gracilis with other chromophyte algae led to identification of three Lys residues as possible binding sites to PSII. Based on these findings, together with our previous cross-linking study in diatom PSII and a red algal PSII structure, we discuss binding properties of Psb31 with PSII core proteins.",

     "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) is the main pathway for inorganic ions and metabolites through the mitochondrial outer membrane. Studies recently demonstrated that membrane lipids regulate its function. It remains, however, unclear how this regulation takes place. In this study, we show that phospholipids are key regulators of Phaseolus VDAC function and, furthermore, that the salt concentration modulates this regulation. Both selectivity and voltage dependence of Phaseolus VDAC are very sensitive to a change in the lipid polar head from PC to PE. Interestingly enough, this dependence is observed only at low salt concentration. Furthermore, significant changes in VDAC functional properties also occur with the gradual methylation of the PE group pointing to the role of subtle chemical variations in the lipid head group. The dependence of PcVDAC gating upon the introduction of a small mole fraction of PE in a PC bilayer has prompted us to propose the existence of a specific interaction site for PE on the outer surface of PcVDAC.Eventually, comparative modeling and molecular dynamics simulations suggest a potential mechanism to get insight into the anion selectivity enhancement of PcVDAC observed in PE relative to PC.",

     "abstract": "In bacterial photosynthesis reaction center-light-harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) complexes trap absorbed solar energy by generating a charge separated state. Subsequent electron and proton transfers form a quinol, destined to diffuse to the cytochrome bc1 complex. In bacteria such as Rhodobacter (Rba.) sphaeroides and Rba. capsulatus the PufX polypeptide creates a channel for quinone/quinol traffic across the LH1 complex that surrounds the RC, and it is therefore essential for photosynthetic growth. PufX also plays a key role in dimerization of the RC-LH1-PufX core complex, and the structure of the Rba. sphaeroides complex shows that the PufX C-terminus, particularly the region from X49-X53, likely mediates association of core monomers. To investigate this putative interaction we analysed mutations PufX R49L, PufX R53L, PufX R49/53L and PufX G52L by measuring photosynthetic growth, fractionation of detergent-solubilised membranes, formation of 2-D crystals and electron microscopy. We show that these mutations do not affect assembly of PufX within the core or photosynthetic growth but they do prevent dimerization, consistent with predictions from the RC-LH1-PufX structure. We obtained low resolution structures of monomeric core complexes with and without PufX, using electron microscopy of negatively stained single particles and 3D reconstruction; the monomeric complex with PufX corresponds to one half of the dimer structure whereas LH1 completely encloses the RC if the gene encoding PufX is deleted. On the basis of the insights gained from these mutagenesis and structural analyses we propose a sequence for assembly of the dimeric RC-LH1-PufX complex.",

By subtracting spectra for PSI with phylloquinone incorporated from spectra for PSI with menadione incorporated a (menadione - phylloquinone) double difference spectrum was constructed. In the double difference spectrum bands associated with protein vibrational modes effectively cancel, and the bands in the spectrum are primarily associated with the neutral and reduced states of the two quinones in the A1 binding site.To aid in the assignment of bands in the experimental double difference spectrum, a double difference spectrum was calculated using three-layer ONIOM methods. The calculated and experimental spectra agree well, allowing unambiguous band assignments to be made. The ONIOM calculations show that both quinones in the A1 binding site are similarly oriented, with only a single hydrogen bond between the C4\u00a0=\u00a0O quinone carbonyl group and the backbone NH group of a leucine residue.

In particular, metabolic and energetic changes have been observed in cancer cells even before the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, but have been neglected for a long time. Instead, during the past 20\u00a0years a renaissance of the study of tumor metabolism has led to a revised and more accurate sight of the metabolic landscape of cancer cells. In this scenario, genetic, biochemical and clinical evidences place mitochondria as key actors in cancer metabolic restructuring, not only because there are energy and biosynthetic intermediates manufacturers, but also because occurrence of mutations in metabolic enzymes encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA has been associated to different types of cancer.

A number of paradoxes render these clinical entities interesting from the translational research point of view. Most oncocytic tumors are generally metabolically constrained due to the impaired respiratory capacity and lack of the ability to respond to hypoxia, yet they maintain features that allow them to strive and persist in an indolent form. Their unique molecular and metabolic characteristics are an object of investigation that may reveal novel ways for therapeutic strategies based on metabolic targeting. With this aim in mind, we here examine the current knowledge on oncocytomas and delve into the molecular causes and consequences that revolve around the oncocytic phenotype, to understand whether we can learn to design therapies from the dissection of benign neoplasms.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of many diseases. The retrograde signaling initiated by dysfunctional mitochondria can bring about global changes in gene expression that alters cell morphology and function. Typically, this is attributed to disruption of important mitochondrial functions, such as ATP production, integration of metabolism, calcium homeostasis and regulation of apoptosis. Recent studies showed that in addition to these factors, mitochondrial dynamics might play an important role in stress signaling. Normal mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles whose size, shape and network are controlled by cell physiology. Defective mitochondrial dynamics play important roles in human diseases. Mitochondrial DNA defects and defective mitochondrial function have been reported in many cancers. Recent studies show that increased mitochondrial fission is a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. In this paper, we have explored the current understanding of the role of mitochondrial dynamics in pathologies. We present new data on mitochondrial dynamics and dysfunction to illustrate a causal link between mitochondrial DNA defects, excessive fission, mitochondrial retrograde signaling and cancer progression.

Some key proteins and molecular pathways implicated in cell death have been analyzed, whereas others are still being actively researched; therefore, an increasing number of cellular compartments and organelles are being implicated in cell death and cancer. Here, we discuss the mitochondria and subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that interact with mitochondria, the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs), which have been identified as critical hubs in the regulation of cell death and tumor growth. MAMs-dependent calcium (Ca2+) release from the ER allows selective Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondria. The perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis in cancer cells is correlated with sustained cell proliferation and the inhibition of cell death through the modulation of Ca2+ signaling.

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) largely originating in the mitochondria play essential roles in the metabolic and (epi)genetic reprogramming of cancer cell evolution towards more aggressive phenotypes. Recent studies have indicated that the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD2) may promote tumor progression by serving as a source of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). H2O2 is a form of ROS that is particularly active as a redox agent affecting cell signaling due to its ability to freely diffuse out of the mitochondria and alter redox active amino acid residues on regulatory proteins. Therefore, there is likely a dichotomy whereas SOD2 can be considered a protective antioxidant, as well as a pro-oxidant during cancer progression, with these effects depending on the accumulation and detoxification of H2O2. Glutathione peroxidase-1 GPX1, is a selenium-dependent scavenger of H2O2 which partitions between the mitochondria and the cytosol. Epidemiologic studies indicated that allelic variations in the SOD2 and GPX1 genes alter the distribution and relative concentrations of SOD2 and GPX1 in mitochondria, thereby affecting the dynamic between the production and elimination of H2O2. Experimental and epidemiological evidence supporting a conflicting role of SOD2 in tumor biology, and epidemiological evidence that SOD2 and GPX1 can interact to affect cancer risk and progression indicated that it is the net accumulation of mitochondrial H2O2 (mtH2O2) resulting from of the balance between the activities SOD2 and anti-oxidants such as GPX1 that determines whether SOD2 prevents or promotes oncogenesis. In this review, research supporting the idea that GPX1 is a gatekeeper restraining the oncogenic power of mitochondrial ROS generated by SOD2 is presented.

Various aspects of altered mitochondrial function have been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, including mitochondrial dysfunction, a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis, and dysregulation of mitophagy. Mitophagy is a highly specific quality control process which eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial turnover, and is involved in the adaptation to nutrient stress by controlling mitochondrial mass. The dysregulation of mitochondrial turnover has both a positive and negative role in cancer. This review will begin with a basic overview of the molecular mechanisms of mitophagy, and highlight recent trends in mitophagy from cancer studies. We will conclude this review by discussing areas of research in normal mitophagy that have yet to be explored in the context of cancer such as mitochondrial proteases, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response, and mitokine action.

     "abstract": "Cancer cells undergo major changes in energy and biosynthetic metabolism. One of them is the Warburg effect, in which pyruvate is used for fermentation rather for oxidative phosphorylation. Another major one is their increased reliance on glutamine, which helps to replenish the pool of Krebs cycle metabolites used for other purposes, such as amino acid or lipid biosynthesis. Mitochondria are central to these alterations, as the biochemical pathways linking these processes run through these organelles. Two membranes, an outer and inner membrane, surround mitochondria, the latter being impermeable to most organic compounds. Therefore, a large number of transport proteins are needed to link the biochemical pathways of the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix. Since the transport steps are relatively slow, it is expected that many of these transport steps are altered when cells become cancerous. In this review, changes in expression and regulation of these transport proteins are discussed as well as the role of the transported substrates.

     "abstract": "Acquisition of the endosymbiotic ancestor of mitochondria was a critical event in eukaryote evolution. Mitochondria offered an unparalleled source of metabolic energy through oxidative phosphorylation and allowed the development of multicellular life. However, as molecular oxygen had become the terminal electron acceptor in most eukaryotic cells, the electron transport chain proved to be the largest intracellular source of superoxide, contributing to macromolecular injury, aging, and cancer. Hence, the \u2018contract of endosymbiosis\u2019 represents a compromise between the possibilities and perils of multicellular life. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs), a group of the solute carrier family of transporters, may remove some of the physiologic constraints that link mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis by mediating inducible proton leak and limiting oxidative cell injury. This important property makes UCPs an ancient partner in the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells. Efforts are underway to explore the therapeutic opportunities stemming from the intriguing relationship of UCPs and cancer.

     "abstract": "The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a pore located at the outer membrane of the mitochondrion. It allows the entry and exit of numerous ions and metabolites between the cytosol and the mitochondrion. Flux through the pore occurs in an active way: first, it depends on the open or closed state and second, on the negative or positive charges of the different ion species passing through the pore. The flux of essential metabolites, such as ATP, determines the functioning of the mitochondria to a noxious stimulus. Moreover, VDAC acts as a platform for many proteins and in so doing supports glycolysis and prevents apoptosis by interacting with hexokinase, or members of the Bcl-2 family, respectively. VDAC is thus involved in the choice the cells make to survive or die, which is particularly relevant to cancer cells. For these reasons, VDAC has become a potential therapeutic target to fight cancer but also other diseases in which mitochondrial metabolism is modified.

     "abstract": "The search for new drugs capable of blocking the metabolic vulnerabilities of human tumors has now entered the clinical evaluation stage, but several projects already failed in phase I or phase II. In particular, very promising in vitro studies could not be translated in vivo at preclinical stage and beyond. This was the case for most glycolysis inhibitors that demonstrated systemic toxicity. A more recent example is the inhibition of glutamine catabolism in lung adenocarcinoma that failed in vivo despite a strong addiction of several cancer cell lines to glutamine in vitro. Such contradictory findings raised several questions concerning the optimization of drug discovery strategies in the field of cancer metabolism. For instance, the cell culture models in 2D or 3D might already show strong limitations to mimic the tumor micro- and macro-environment. The microenvironment of tumors is composed of cancer cells of variegated metabolic profiles, supporting local metabolic exchanges and symbiosis, but also of immune cells and stroma that further interact with and reshape cancer cell metabolism. The macroenvironment includes the different tissues of the organism, capable of exchanging signals and fueling the tumor \u2018a distance\u2019. Moreover, most metabolic targets were identified from their increased expression in tumor transcriptomic studies, or from targeted analyses looking at the metabolic impact of particular oncogenes or tumor suppressors on selected metabolic pathways. Still, very few targets were identified from in vivo analyses of tumor metabolism in patients because such studies are difficult and adequate imaging methods are only currently being developed for that purpose. For instance, perfusion of patients with [13C]-glucose allows deciphering the metabolomics of tumors and opens a new area in the search for effective targets. Metabolic imaging with positron emission tomography and other techniques that do not involve [13C] can also be used to evaluate tumor metabolism and to follow the efficiency of a treatment at a preclinical or clinical stage. Relevant descriptors of tumor metabolism are now required to better stratify patients for the development of personalized metabolic medicine.In this review, we discuss the current limitations in basic research and drug discovery in the field of cancer metabolism to foster the need for more clinically relevant target identification and validation. We discuss the design of adapted drug screening assays and compound efficacy evaluation methods for the discovery of innovative anti-cancer therapeutic approaches at the level of tumor energetics.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria, known for more than a century as the energy powerhouse of a cell, represent key intracellular signaling hub that are emerging as important determinants of several aspects of cancer development and progression, including metabolic reprogramming, acquisition of metastatic capability, and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. The majority of cancer cells harbors somatic mutations in the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and/or alterations in the mtDNA content, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Decreased mtDNA content is also detected in tumor-initiating cells, a subpopulation of cancer cells that are believed to play an integral role in cancer recurrence following chemotherapy. Although mutations in mitochondrial genes are common in cancer cells, they do not shut down completely the mitochondrial energy metabolism and functionality. Instead, they promote rewiring of the bioenergetics and biosynthetic profile of a cancer cell through a mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling activated by \u201cdysfunctional\u201d mitochondria that results in changes in transcription and/or activity of cancer-related genes and signaling pathways. Different cancer cell types may undergo different bioenergetic changes, some to more glycolytic and some to more oxidative. These different metabolic signatures may coexist within the same tumor mass (intra-tumor heterogeneity). In this review we describe the current understanding of mitochondrial dysfunction in the context of cancer chemoresistance with special attention to the role of mtDNA alterations. We put emphasis on potential therapeutic strategies targeting different metabolic events specific to cancer cells, including glycolysis, glutaminolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the retrograde signaling, to prevent chemoresistance. We also highlight novel genome-editing strategies aimed at \u201ccorrecting\u201d mtDNA defects in cancer cells. We conclude on the importance of considering intratumor metabolic heterogeneity to develop effective metabolism-based cancer therapy that can overcome chemoresistance.

In order to improve the sensitivity of tumors cells to radiation therapy, tumor hypoxia may theoretically be alleviated by increasing the oxygen delivery or by decreasing the oxygen consumption by tumor cells. Mathematical modelling suggested that decreasing the oxygen consumption should be more efficient than increasing oxygen delivery in order to alleviate tumor hypoxia. In this paper, we review several promising strategies targeting the mitochondrial respiration for which alleviation of tumor hypoxia and increase in sensitivity to irradiation have been demonstrated. Because the translation of these approaches into the clinical arena requires the use of pharmacodynamics biomarkers able to identify shift in oxygen consumption and tumor oxygenation, we also discuss the relative merits of imaging biomarkers (Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance) that may be used for therapeutic guidance.

The recent discovery that mutations in key mitochondrial enzymes play a causal role in tumorigenesis suggested that dysregulation of metabolism could also be a driver of tumorigenesis. These mutations induce profound adaptive metabolic alterations that are a prerequisite for the survival of the mutated cells. Because these metabolic events are specific to cancer cells, they offer an opportunity to develop new therapies that specifically target tumour cells without affecting healthy tissue.

Inhibition was reversed by the reducing agent dithioerythritol, indicating a reaction mechanism based on nitrosylation of Cys residues of the CACT.

     "abstract": "Fast turnover of ferredoxin/Fd reduction by photosystem-I/PSI requires that it dissociates rapidly after it has been reduced by PSI:Fd intracomplex electron transfer. The rate constants of Fd dissociation from PSI have been determined by flash-absorption spectroscopy with different combinations of cyanobacterial PSIs and Fds, and different redox states of Fd and of the terminal PSI acceptor (FAFB). Newly obtained values were derived firstly from the fact that the dissociation constant between PSI and redox-inactive gallium-substituted Fd increases upon (FAFB) reduction and secondly from the characterization and elucidation of a kinetic phase following intracomplex Fd reduction to binding of oxidized Fd to PSI, a process which is rate-limited by the foregoing dissociation of reduced Fd from PSI. By reference to the complex with oxidized partners, dissociation rate constants were found to increase moderately with (FAFB) single reduction and by about one order of magnitude after electron transfer from (FAFB)\u2212 to Fd, therefore favoring turnover of Fd reduction by PSI. With Thermosynechococcus elongatus partners, values of 270, 730 and >\u00a010000\u00a0s\u22121 were thus determined for (FAFB)Fdoxidized, (FAFB)\u2212\u00a0Fdoxidized and (FAFB)Fdreduced, respectively. Moreover, assuming a conservative upper limit for the association rate constant between reduced Fd and PSI, a significant negative shift of the Fd midpoint potential upon binding to PSI has been calculated (< \u221260\u00a0mV for Thermosynechococcus elongatus). From the present state of knowledge, the question is still open whether this redox shift is compatible with a large (>\u00a010) equilibrium constant for intracomplex reduction of Fd from (FAFB)\u2212.",

Various xanthophyll biosynthesis mutants were used to investigate the specific role of these xanthophylls. Our spectroscopic results revealed specific structural changes manifested in altered pigment-pigment or pigment-protein interactions within PSI complex in the absence of zeaxanthin and echinenone. These structural modifications of the complexes seem to destabilize the PSI trimeric complexes and eventually result in an increased propensity for monomerization. Our results clearly demonstrate that xanthophylls are important for the fine-tuning of the PSI trimer structure. These xanthophylls could be part of the complex or be embedded in the membrane in the vicinity of PSI.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial ATP dependent matrix protease, Lon, is involved in the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA nucleoids and degradation of abnormal or misfolded proteins. The Lon protease regulates mitochondrial Tfam (mitochondrial transcription factor A) level and thus modulates mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content. We have previously shown that hypoxic stress induces the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) subunits I, IVi1, and Vb and a time-dependent reduction of these subunits in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages subjected to hypoxia and rabbit hearts subjected to ischemia/reperfusion. Here, we show that Lon is involved in the preferential turnover of phosphorylated CcO subunits under hypoxic/ischemic stress. Induction of Lon protease occurs at 6 to 12 h of hypoxia and this increase coincides with lower CcO subunit contents. Over-expression of flag-tagged wild type and phosphorylation site mutant Vb and IVi1 subunits (S40A and T52A, respectively) caused marked degradation of wild type protein under hypoxia while the mutant proteins were relatively resistant. Furthermore, the recombinant purified Lon protease degraded the phosphorylated IVi1 and Vb subunits, while the phosphorylation-site mutant proteins were resistant to degradation. 3D structural modeling shows that the phosphorylation sites are exposed to the matrix compartment, accessible to matrix PKA and Lon protease. Hypoxic stress did not alter CcO subunit levels in Lon depleted cells, confirming its role in CcO turnover. Our results therefore suggest that Lon preferentially degrades the phosphorylated subunits of CcO and plays a role in the regulation of CcO activity in hypoxia and ischemia/reperfusion injury.",

The analysis of the fluorescence emission spectra of dark-adapted and quenched samples as a function of the detection temperature in the 280\u201380\u00a0K interval, indicates that Chlorophyll spectral forms having maximal emission in the 700\u2013702\u00a0nm and 705\u2013710\u00a0nm ranges gain relative intensity in concomitance with the establishment of irreversible light-induced quenching, acting thereby as spectroscopic markers. The relative enhancement of the 700\u2013702\u00a0nm and 705\u2013710\u00a0nm forms emission could be due either to an increase of their stoichiometric abundance or to their intrinsically low fluorescence quantum yields. These two factors, that can also coexist, need to be promoted by light-induced alterations in chromophore-protein as well as chromophore-chromophore interactions. The bands centred at about 701 and 706\u00a0nm are also observed in the PSII core complex, suggesting their, at least partial, localisation in proximity to the reaction centre, and the occurrence of light-induced conformational changes in the core subunits.",

In this work, we studied the mechanisms of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), the fast response to high light stress, in Nannochloropsis gaditana by \u201clocking\u201d the cells in six different states during quenching activation and relaxation. Combining biochemical analysis with time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we correlated each NPQ state with the presence of two well-known NPQ components: de-epoxidized xanthophylls and stress-related antenna proteins (LHCXs). We demonstrated that after exposure to strong light, the rapid quenching that takes place in the antennas of both photosystems was associated with the presence of LHCXs. At later stages, quenching occurs mainly in the antennas of PSII and correlates with the amount of de-epoxidised xanthophylls. We also observed changes in the distribution of excitation energy between photosystems, which suggests redistribution of excitation between photosystems as part of the photo-protective strategy. A multistep model for NPQ induction and relaxation in N. gaditana is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Tyrosine D (TyrD) is an auxiliary redox active tyrosine residue in photosystem II (PSII). The mechanism of TyrD oxidation was investigated by EPR spectroscopy, flash-induced fluorescence decay and thermoluminescence measurements in PSII enriched membranes from spinach. PSII membranes were chemically treated with 3\u00a0mM ascorbate and 1\u00a0mM diaminodurene and subsequent washing, leading to the complete reduction of TyrD. TyrD oxidation kinetics and competing recombination reactions were measured after a single saturating flash in the absence and presence of DCMU (inhibitor of the QB-site) in the pH range of 4.7\u20138.5. Two kinetic phases of TyrD oxidation were observed by the time resolved EPR spectroscopy \u2013 the fast phase (msec-sec time range) and the pH dependent slow phase (tens of seconds time range). In the presence of DCMU, TyrD oxidation kinetics was monophasic in the entire pH range, i.e. only the fast kinetics was observed. The results obtained from the fluorescence and thermoluminescence analysis show that when forward electron transport is blocked in the presence of DCMU, the S2QA\u2212 recombination outcompetes the slow phase of TyrD oxidation by the S2 state. Modelling of the whole complex of these electron transfer events associated with TyrD oxidation fitted very well with our experimental data. Based on these data, structural information and theoretical considerations we confirm our assignment of the fast and slow oxidation kinetics to two populations of PSII centers with different water positions (proximal and distal) in the TyrD vicinity.",

However, complex interrelationships between mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS), mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and Ca2\u00a0+ are not completely understood. Using human carcinoma cells, we further highlight biphasic ROS dynamics: - gradual mitoROS increase followed by mitoROS flash. Also, we demonstrate heterogeneity in rates of mitoROS generation and flash initiation time. Comparing mitochondrial and near-extra-mitochondrial signals, we show that mechanisms of mitoROS flashes in single mitochondria, linked to mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (\u0394\u03a8m collapse) and calcium sparks, may involve flash triggering by certain levels of external ROS released from the same mitochondria. In addition, mitochondria-mitochondria interactions can produce wave propagations of mitoROS flashes and \u0394\u03a8m collapses in cancer cells similar to phenomena of ROS-induced ROS release (RIRR). Our data suggest that in cancer cells RIRR, activation of mitoROS flashes and mitochondrial depolarization may involve participation of extramitochondrial-ROS produced either by individual mitochondria and/or by neighboring mitochondria. This could represent general mechanisms in ROS-ROS signaling with suggested role in both mitochondrial and cellular physiology and signaling.",

The precise role of specific amino acid residues at this complex binding interface remains a key open question. Here, we address this question by carrying out extensive bioinformatics analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of PsbO proteins with mutations at the binding interface. We find that PsbO proteins from cyanobacteria vs. plants have specific preferences for the number and composition of charged amino acid residues that may ensure that PsbO proteins avoid aggregation and expose long unstructured loops for binding to photosystem II. A cluster of conserved charged groups with dynamic hydrogen bonds provides PsbO with structural plasticity at the binding interface with photosystem II.",

SKCa agonists protected isolated hearts and mitochondria against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury; SKCa antagonists worsened IR injury. Intravenous infusion of a SKCa channel agonist/antagonist, respectively, in intact rats was effective in reducing/enhancing regional infarct size induced by coronary artery occlusion. Localization of SK3 in mitochondria was evidenced by Western blot of inner mitochondrial membrane, immunocytochemical staining of cardiomyocytes, and immunogold labeling of isolated mitochondria. We identified a SK3 splice variant in guinea pig (SK3.1, aka SK3a) and human ventricular cells (SK3.2) by amplifying mRNA, and show mitochondrial expression in mouse atrial tumor cells (HL-1) by transfection with full length and truncated SK3.1 protein. We found that the N-terminus is not required for mitochondrial trafficking but the C-terminus beyond the Ca2+ calmodulin binding domain is required for Ca2+ sensing to induce mK+ influx and/or promote mitochondrial localization. In isolated guinea pig mitochondria and in SK3 overexpressed HL-1 cells, mK+ influx was driven by adding CaCl2. Moreover, there was a greater fall in membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and enhanced cell death with simulated cell injury after silencing SK3.1 with siRNA. Although SKCa channel opening protects the heart and mitochondria against IR injury, the mechanism for favorable bioenergetics effects resulting from SKCa channel opening remains unclear.

The fitting coefficient \u03c1 measures excitation transfer from closed PSII to remaining open PSII upon illumination, which could theoretically generate a progressive increase in \u03c3PSII for the remaining open PSII. To investigate how \u03c1 responds to illumination we grew marine phytoplankters with diverse antenna structures (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, Ostreococcus and Thalassiosira pseudonana) under limiting or saturating growth light. Initial \u03c1 varied with growth light in Synechococcus and Thalassiosira. With increasing actinic illumination PSII closed progressively and \u03c1 decreased for all four taxa, in a pattern explicable as an exponential decay of \u03c1 with increasing distance between remaining open PSII reaction centers. This light-dependent down-regulation of \u03c1 allows the four phytoplankters to limit the effect of increasing light upon \u03c3PSII. The four structurally distinct taxa showed, however, distinct rates of response of \u03c1 to PSII closure, likely reflecting differences in the spacing or orientation among their PSII centers. Following saturating illumination recovery of \u03c1 in darkness coincided directly with PSII re-opening in Prochlorococcus. Even after PSII had re-opened in Synechococcus a transition to State II slowed dark recovery of \u03c1. In Ostreococcus sustained NPQ slowed dark recovery of \u03c1. In Thalassiosira dark recovery of \u03c1 was slowed, possibly by a light-induced change in PSII spacing. These patterns of \u03c1 versus PSII closure are thus a convenient probe of comparative PSII spacings.",

In vitro and in vivo methods demonstrated that saturated, monounsaturated lipids and xanthophylls may stabilize the trimerization of Photosystem I (PSI). Fluorescence induction and oxygen-evolving activity measurements revealed increased light sensitivity of RO cells compared to those of the WT. ROAD showed a robust increase in light susceptibility and reduced recovery capability, especially at moderate low (ML) and moderate high (MH) temperatures, indicating a cooperative effect of xanthophylls and polyunsaturated lipids.

The recent discovery of new members of this family with unusual properties demonstrates, however, the versatility of this class of proteins. Changes in their ligand set lead to drastic variation in their metal site geometry and in the resulting spectroscopic and redox features. In our work, we report the identification of the copper ligands in the recently discovered cupredoxin AcoP. We show that even though AcoP possesses a classical copper ligand set, it has a highly perturbed copper center. In depth studies of mutant's properties suggest a high degree of constraint existing in the copper center of the wild type protein and even the addition of exogenous ligands does not lead to the reconstitution of the initial copper center. Not only the chemical nature of the axial ligand but also constraints brought by its covalent binding to the protein backbone might be critical to maintain a green copper site with high redox potential. This work illustrates the importance of experimentally dissecting the molecular diversity of cupredoxins to determine the molecular determinants responsible for their copper center geometry and redox potential.",

     "abstract": "The cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase is one of three respiratory oxygen reductases in the aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli. The generally accepted model of catalysis assumes that cyt bo3 contains two distinct ubiquinol binding sites: (i) a low affinity (QL) site which is the traditional substrate binding site; and (ii) a high affinity (QH) site where a \u201cpermanently\u201d bound quinone acts as a cofactor, taking two electrons from the substrate quinol and passing them one-by-one to the heme b component of the enzyme which, in turn, transfers them to the heme o3/CuB active site. Whereas the residues at the QH site are well defined, the location of the QL site remains unknown. The published X-ray structure does not contain quinone, and substantial amounts of the protein are missing as well. A recent bioinformatics study by Bossis et al. [Biochem J. (2014) 461, 305\u2013314] identified a sequence motif G163EFX3GWX2Y173 as the likely QL site in the family of related quinol oxidases. In the current work, this was tested by site-directed mutagenesis. The results show that these residues are not important for catalytic function and do not define the QL substrate binding site.",

     "abstract": "Photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) work in series to drive oxygenic photosynthesis. The two photosystems have different absorption spectra, therefore changes in light quality can lead to imbalanced excitation of the photosystems and a loss in photosynthetic efficiency. In a short-term adaptation response termed state transitions, excitation energy is directed to the light-limited photosystem. In higher plants a special pool of LHCII antennae, which can be associated with either PSI or PSII, participates in these state transitions. It is known that one LHCII antenna can associate with the PsaH site of PSI. However, membrane fractions were recently isolated in which multiple LHCII antennae appear to transfer energy to PSI. We have used time-resolved fluorescence-streak camera measurements to investigate the energy transfer rates and efficiency in these membrane fractions. Our data show that energy transfer from LHCII to PSI is relatively slow. Nevertheless, the trapping efficiency in supercomplexes of PSI with ~\u00a02.4 LHCIIs attached is 94%. The absorption cross section of PSI can thus be increased with ~\u00a065% without having significant loss in quantum efficiency. Comparison of the fluorescence dynamics of PSI-LHCII complexes, isolated in a detergent or located in their native membrane environment, indicates that the environment influences the excitation energy transfer rates in these complexes. This demonstrates the importance of studying membrane protein complexes in their natural environment.",

LHCSR3 has been shown to act as a quencher when associated with the Photosystem II supercomplex and to respond to pH changes, but the mechanism of quenching has not been elucidated yet. In this work we have studied the interaction between LHCSR3 and Photosystem II C2S2 supercomplexes by single particle electron microscopy. It was found that LHCSR3 predominantly binds at three different positions and that the CP26 subunit and the LHCII trimer of C2S2 supercomplexes are involved in binding, while we could not find evidences for a direct association of LHCSR3 with the PSII core. At all three locations LHCSR3 is present almost exclusively as a dimer.",

The cytoplasmic streaming, being particularly fast in characean internodes, distributes the exported metabolites from brightly illuminated cell spots to light-limited regions, which is evident from the transient increase in chlorophyll fluorescence of shaded areas in response to illumination of distant cell regions situated upstream the liquid flow. It is not yet known whether long-distance communications between anchored chloroplasts are interfered by pH banding that commonly arises in characean internodes under the action of continuous or fluctuating light. In this study, microfluorometry, pH-microsensors, and local illumination were combined to examine long-distance transport and subsequent reentry of photosynthetic metabolites, including triose phosphates, into chloroplasts of cell regions producing external alkaline and acid bands. The lateral transmission of metabolic signals between distant chloroplasts was found to operate effectively in cell areas underlying acid zones but was almost fully blocked under alkaline zones. The rates of linear electron flow in chloroplasts of these regions were nearly equal under dim background light, but differed substantially at high light when availability of CO2, rather than irradiance, was the rate-limiting factor. Different productions of assimilates by chloroplasts underlying CO2-sufficient acid and CO2-deficient alkaline zones were a cause for contrasting manifestations of long-distance transport of photosynthetic metabolites. Nonuniform cytoplasmic pH in cells exhibiting pH bands might contribute to different activities of metabolic translocators under high and low pH zones.",

The energy released during catalysis is coupled to the active translocation of protons across the membrane, which contributes to the establishment of an electrochemical gradient that is used for ATP synthesis. The distinctive C-type (or cbb3) cytochrome c oxidases, which are mostly present in proteobacteria, exhibit a number of unique structural and functional features, including high catalytic activity at low oxygen concentrations. At the moment, the functioning mechanism of C-type oxidases, in particular the proton transfer/pumping mechanism presumably via a single proton channel, is still poorly understood. In this work we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and continuum electrostatics calculations to obtain atomic-level insights into the hydration and dynamics of a cbb3 oxidase. We provide the details of the water dynamics and proton transfer pathways for both the \u201cchemical\u201d and \u201cpumped\u201d protons, and show that formation of protonic connections is strongly affected by the protonation state of key residues, namely H243, E323 and H337.",

The vBOF was constrained to fit the measured cellular carbohydrate/protein content under different light intensities. iSyp821 provides rigorous agreement with experimentally measured cell growth rates and inorganic carbon uptake rates as a function of light intensity. iSyp821 predicts two observed metabolic transitions that occur as light intensity increases: 1) from PSI-cyclic to linear electron flow (greater redox energy), and 2) from carbon allocation as proteins (growth) to carbohydrates (energy storage) mode. iSyp821 predicts photoautotrophic carbon flux into 1) a hybrid gluconeogenesis-pentose phosphate (PP) pathway that produces glycogen by an alternative pathway than conventional gluconeogenesis, and 2) the photorespiration pathway to synthesize the essential amino acid, glycine. Quantitative fluxes through both pathways were verified experimentally by following the kinetics of formation of 13C metabolites from 13CO2 fixation. iSyp821 was modified to include changes in gene products (enzymes) from experimentally measured transcriptomic data and applied to estimate changes in concentrations of metabolites arising from nutrient stress. Using this strategy, we found that iSyp821 correctly predicts the observed redistribution pattern of carbon products under nitrogen depletion, including decreased rates of CO2 uptake, amino acid synthesis, and increased rates of glycogen and lipid synthesis.",

The FMO antenna complex has historically been used as a model system for energy transfer due to the water-soluble nature of the protein, its stability at room temperature, as well as the availability of high-resolution structural data. Eight FMO mutants were constructed with changes in the environment of each of the bacteriochlorophyll a pigments found within each monomer of the homotrimeric FMO complex. Our results reveal multiple changes in low temperature absorption, as well as room temperature CD in each mutant compared to the wild-type FMO complex. These datasets were subsequently used to model the site energies of each pigment in the FMO complex by employing three different Hamiltonians from the literature. This enabled a basic approximation of the site energy shifts imparted on each pigment by the changed amino acid residue. These simulations suggest that, while the three Hamiltonians used in this work provide good fits to the wild-type FMO absorption spectrum, further efforts are required to obtain good fits to the mutant minus wild-type absorption difference spectra. This demonstrates that the use of FMO mutants can be a valuable tool to refine and iterate the current models of energy transfer in this system.",

     "abstract": "To deal with fluctuating light condition, cyanobacteria have developed a photoprotective mechanism which, under high light conditions, decreases the energy arriving at the photochemical centers. It relies on a photoswitch, the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Once photoactivated, OCP binds to the light harvesting antenna, the phycobilisome (PBS), and triggers the thermal dissipation of the excess energy absorbed. Deactivation of the photoprotective mechanism requires the intervention of a third partner, the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP). FRP by interacting with the photoactivated OCP accelerates its conversion to the non-active form and its detachment from the phycobilisome. We have studied the interaction of FRP with free and phycobilisome-bound OCP. Several OCP variants were constructed and characterized. In this article we show that OCP amino acid F299 is essential and D220 important for OCP deactivation mediated by FRP. Mutations of these amino acids did not affect FRP activity as helper to detach OCP from phycobilisomes. In addition, while mutated R60L FRP is inactive on OCP deactivation, its activity on the detachment of the OCP from the phycobilisomes is not affected. Thus, our results demonstrate that FRP has two distinct activities: it accelerates OCP detachment from phycobilisomes and then it helps deactivation of the OCP. They also suggest that different OCP and FRP amino acids could be involved in these two activities.",

     "abstract": "The structure of phycobiliproteins of the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina was investigated in buffer solution at physiological temperatures, i.e. under the same conditions applied in spectroscopic experiments, using small angle neutron scattering. The scattering data of intact phycobiliproteins in buffer solution containing phosphate can be well described using a cylindrical shape with a length of about 225\u00a0\u00c5 and a diameter of approximately 100\u00a0\u00c5. This finding is qualitatively consistent with earlier electron microscopy studies reporting a rod-like shape of the phycobiliproteins with a length of about 250 (M. Chen et al., FEBS Letters 583, 2009, 2535) or 300\u00a0\u00c5 (J. Marquart et al., FEBS Letters 410, 1997, 428). In contrast, phycobiliproteins dissolved in buffer lacking phosphate revealed a splitting of the rods into cylindrical subunits with a height of 28\u00a0\u00c5 only, but also a pronounced sample aggregation. Complementary small angle neutron and X-ray scattering experiments on phycocyanin suggest that the cylindrical subunits may represent either trimeric phycocyanin or trimeric allophycocyanin. Our findings are in agreement with the assumption that a phycobiliprotein rod with a total height of about 225\u00a0\u00c5 can accommodate seven trimeric phycocyanin subunits and one trimeric allophycocyanin subunit, each of which having a height of about 28\u00a0\u00c5.

Here we reported the biochemical, structural, and molecular dynamics simulation study of the C-phycocyanin from Arctic cyanobacterial strain Pseudanabaena sp. LW0831. We characterized the phycobilisome components of LW0831 and obtained their gene sequences. Compared to the mesophilic counterpart from Arthrospira platensis (Ar-C-PC), LW0831 C-phycocyanin (Ps-C-PC) has a decreased thermostability (\u2206\u00a0Tm of \u2212\u00a016\u00a0\u00b0C), one of the typical features of cold-adapted enzymes. To uncover its structural basis, we resolved the crystal structure of Ps-C-PC 1 at 2.04\u00a0\u00c5. Consistent with the decrease in thermostability, comparative structural analyses revealed decreased intra-trimer and inter-trimer interactions in Ps-C-PC 1, compared to Ar-C-PC. However, comparative molecular dynamics simulations indicated that Ps-C-PC 1 shows similar flexibilities to Ar-C-PC for both the (\u03b1\u03b2)3 trimer and (\u03b1\u03b2)6 hexamer. Therefore, the optimization mode is clearly different from cold-adapted enzymes, which usually have increased flexibilities. Detailed analyses demonstrated different optimization modes for the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits and it was revealed that hydrophobic interactions are key to this difference, though salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, and surface hydrophobicity are also involved.

Despite the enormous progress made studying its structure and function in recent years, potential regulatory roles of its accessory subunits remained largely unresolved. Complex I gene NDUFV3, which occurs in metazoa, contains an extra exon that is only present in vertebrates and thereby evolutionary even younger than the rest of the gene. Alternative splicing of this extra exon gives rise to a short NDUFV3-S and a long NDUFV3-L protein isoform. Complexome profiling revealed that the two NDUFV3 isoforms are constituents of the multi-subunit complex I. Further mass spectrometric analyses of complex I from different murine and bovine tissues showed a tissue-specific expression pattern of NDUFV3-S and NDUFV3-L. Hence, NDUFV3-S was identified as the only isoform in heart and skeletal muscle, whereas in liver, brain, and lung NDUFV3-L was expressed as the dominant isoform, together with NDUFV3-S present in all tissues analyzed. Thus, we identified NDUFV3 as the first out of 30 accessory subunits of complex I present in vertebrate- and tissue-specific isoforms. Interestingly, the tissue-specific expression pattern of NDUFV3-S and NDUFV3-L isoforms was paralleled by changes in kinetic parameters, especially the substrate affinity of complex I. This may indicate a regulatory role of the NDUFV3 isoforms in different vertebrate tissues.",

The current model of diatom NPQ mechanism involves two quenching sites, one of which detaches from photosystem II reaction centres (RCIIs) and aggregates into oligomeric complexes. Here we addressed how antenna reorganisation controls NPQ kinetics in P. tricornutum cells grown under continuous light (CL) and IL. Overall, IL acclimation induced: (i) reorganisation of chloroplasts, containing greater pigment pools without a strongly enhanced operation of the xanthophyll cycle, and (ii) \u2018super NPQ\u2019 causing a remarkable reduction of the chlorophyll excited state lifetime at Fm\u2032. Regardless of different levels of NPQ formed in both culture conditions, its dark recovery was rapid and similar fractions of their antenna uncoupled (~\u00a050%). Although antenna detachment relieved excitation pressure, it provided a minor protective contribution equivalent to NPQ\u00a0~\u00a01, while the largest NPQ was 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 (CL) and 13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 (IL). The PSII cross-section decrease took place only at relatively low NPQ values, beyond which the cross-section remained constant whilst NPQ continued to rise.

In Pseudomonas stutzeri ZoBell, two tandemly organized cbb3-operons encode the isoforms Cbb3-1 and Cbb3-2 both possessing subunits CcoN, CcoO and CcoP. However, only the cbb3-2 operon contains an additional ccoQ gene. CcoQ consists of 62 amino acids and is predicted to possess one transmembrane spanning helix. The physiological role of CcoQ was investigated based on a CcoQ-deletion mutant and wild-type Cbb3-2 crystals not containing subunit CcoQ. Cbb3-2 isolated from the deletion mutant is inactive and appears as a dispersed band on blue native-PAGE gels. Surprisingly, in the absence of ccoQ, Cbb3-1 also shows a strongly reduced activity. Our data suggest that CcoQ primarily functions as an assembly factor for Cbb3-2 but is also required for correct assembly of Cbb3-1. In contrast, once correctly assembled, Cbb3-1 and Cbb3-2 possess a full enzymatic activity even in the absence of CcoQ.",

     "abstract": "In photosynthesis, electron transport-coupled proton movement initiates the formation of the light-induced electric potential difference, \u0394\u03a8, across the thylakoid membrane (TM). Ions are transported across the TM to counterbalance the charge of protons accumulated in the lumen. The objective of this work is to construct range of mathematical models for simulation of \u0394\u03a8, using the transition state rate theory (TSRT) for description of movement of ions through the channels. The TSRT considers either single-ion (TSRT-SI) or multi-ion occupancy (TSRT-MI) in the channels. Movement of ions through the channel pore is described by means of energy barriers and binding sites; ions move in and out of vacant sites with rate constants that depend on the barrier heights and well depths, as well as on the interionic repulsion in TSRT-MI model. Three energy motifs are used to describe the TSRT-SI model: two-barrier one-site (2B1S), three-barrier two-site (3B2S), and four-barrier three-site (4B3S). The 3B2S energy motif is used for the TSRT-MI model. The accumulation of cations due to the TM surface negative fixed charges is also taken into account. A model employing the electro-diffusion theory instead of the TSRT is constructed for comparison. The dual wavelength transmittance signal (\u0394A515-560\u00a0nm) measuring the electrochromic shift (ECS) provides a proxy for experimental light-induced \u0394\u03a8. The simulated \u0394\u03a8 traces qualitatively agree with the measured ECS traces. The models can simulate different channel conducting regimes and assess their impact on \u0394\u03a8. The ionic flux coupling in the TSRT-MI model suggests that an increase in the internal or external K+ concentration may block the outward or the inward Mg2+ current, respectively.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents spectroscopic investigations of IsiA, a chlorophyll a-binding membrane protein produced by cyanobacteria grown in iron-deficient environments. IsiA, if associated with photosystem I, supports photosystem I in light harvesting by efficiently transferring excitation energy. However, if separated from photosystem I, IsiA exhibits considerable excitation quenching observed as a substantial reduction of protein-bound chlorophyll a fluorescence lifetime. Previous spectroscopic studies suggested that carotenoids are involved in excitation energy dissipation and in addition play a second role in this antenna complex by supporting chlorophyll a in light harvesting by absorbing in the spectral range inaccessible for chlorophyll a and transferring excitation to chlorophylls. However, this investigation does not support these proposed roles of carotenoids in this light harvesting protein. This study shows that carotenoids do not transfer excitation energy to chlorophyll a. In addition, our investigations do not support the hypothesis that carotenoids are quenchers of the excited state of chlorophyll a in this protein complex. We propose that quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence in IsiA is maintained by pigment-protein interaction via electron transfer from an excited chlorophyll a to a cysteine residue, an excitation quenching mechanism that was recently proposed to regulate the light harvesting capabilities of the bacteriochlorophyll a-containing Fenna-Mathews-Olson protein from green sulfur bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis is driven by photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). In plants the number of chlorophylls of PSI versus PSII is adjusted to the light irradiance spectrum. On a timescale of days, this is regulated at the level of protein concentration. Instead, on a timescale of minutes, it is regulated by the dynamic association of light-harvesting complex II with either PSI or PSII. Thus far very diverse values have been reported for the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio, ranging from 0.54 to 1.4. The methods used require the isolation of chloroplasts and are time consuming. We present a fluorescence lifetime imaging approach that quantifies the PSI/PSII Chl ratio of chloroplasts directly in their natural leaf environment. In wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants, grown under white light, the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio appeared to be 0.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 at the adaxial side and 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 at the abaxial side of the leaf. When these plants were acclimated to far red light for several days the PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratio decreased by more than a factor of 3 to compensate for the ineffective far red light absorption of PSII. This shows how plants optimize their light-harvesting capacity to the specific light conditions they encounter. Zooming in on single chloroplasts inside the leaf allowed to study the grana/stroma membrane network and their PSI/PSII chlorophyll ratios. The developed method will be useful to study dynamic processes in chloroplasts in intact leaves which involve changes in the grana and the stroma membranes such as state transitions.",

Several accessory factors are essential for assembling the two copper sites CuA and CuZ, and for maintaining the activity. In particular, the deletion of either the transmembrane iron-sulfur flavoprotein NosR or the periplasmic protein NosX, a member of the ApbE family, abolishes N2O respiration. Here we demonstrate through biochemical and structural studies that the ApbE protein from Pseudomonas stutzeri, where the nosX gene is absent, is a monomeric FAD-binding protein that can serve as the flavin donor for NosR maturation via covalent flavinylation of a threonine residue. The flavin transfer reaction proceeds both in vivo and in vitro to generate post-translationally modified NosR with covalently bound FMN. Only FAD can act as substrate and the reaction requires a divalent cation, preferably Mg2\u00a0+ that was also present in the crystal structure. In addition, the reaction is species-specific to a certain extent.",

The propionic acids of heme a3 have been proposed to act as a proton loading site (PLS) in the proton pumping pathway, yet this proposal could not be verified by experimental data so far. We have set up an experiment where the redox states of the two hemes in CcO can be controlled via external electrical potential. Surface enhanced resonance Raman (SERR) spectroscopy was applied to simultaneously monitor the redox state of the hemes and the protonation state of the heme propionates. Simulated spectra based on QM/MM calculations were used to assign the resonant enhanced CH2 twisting modes of the propionates to the protonation state of the individual heme a and heme a3 propionates respectively. The comparison between calculated and measured H2OD2O difference spectra allowed a sound band assignment. In the fully reduced enzyme at least three of the four heme propionates were found to be protonated whereas in the presence of a reduced heme a and an oxidized heme a3 only protonation of one heme a3 propionates was observed. Our data supports the postulated scenario where the heme a3 propionates are involved in the proton pathway.",

     "abstract": "Bovine heart mitochondrial respiratory complex II generates ROS, mostly as superoxide, at the rate of about 20% of that detected during simultaneous operation of complex I and II when oxidation of ubiquinol is prevented by myxothiazol. ROS generating activity at different fumarate/succinate concentrations ratio implies that an enzyme component with a midpoint potential 40\u00a0mV more positive than that of fumarate/succinate couple is the donor for one-electron reduction of oxygen. This suggests that the iron-sulfur cluster(s) is(are) involved in superoxide formation. Complex II-mediated ROS production exhibits a maximum at low (about 50\u00a0\u03bcM) succinate concentration and gradually declines to zero activity upon further increase of the substrate. This phenomenology is explained and kinetically modeled to suggest a ping-pong mechanism of ROS generating activity where only dicarboxylate free reduced enzyme is oxidized by oxygen. The succinate:quinone reductase activity catalyzed by purified succinate:ubiquinone reductase also exhibits a ping-pong mechanism where only dicarboxylate free enzyme is oxidized by added quinone. Together these data suggest long distance interaction between the succinate (fumarate) binding and ubiquinone (ubiquinol) reactive sites.",

This is currently explained by coherent coupling of the excited state electronic wavepacket with local vibrational nuclear modes, facilitating efficient cross-over at a conical intersection onto the photoproduct energy surface. The 9-cis counterpart of rhodopsin, dubbed isorhodopsin, has a much lower quantum yield (0.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03), which, however, can be markedly enhanced by modification of the retinal chromophore (7,8-dihydro and 9-cyclopropyl derivatives). The coherent coupling in the excited state is promoted by torsional skeletal and coupled HOOP vibrational modes, in combination with a twisted conformation around the isomerization region. Since such torsion will strongly enhance the infrared intensity of coupled HOOP modes, we investigated FTIR difference spectra of rhodopsin, isorhodopsin and several analog pigments in the spectral range of isolated and coupled HCCH wags. As a result we propose that the coupled HOOP signature in these retinal pigments correlates with the distribution of torsion over counteracting segments in the retinylidene polyene chain. As such the HOOP signature can act as an indicator for the photoisomerization efficiency, and can explain the higher quantum yield of the 7,8-dihydro and 9-cyclopropyl-isorhodopsin analogs.",

In vitro, we show that the PspA-domain of IM30 is vital for stability/folding and oligomer formation of IM30 as well as for IM30-triggered membrane fusion. In contrast, the IM30 C-terminal domain is involved in and necessary to stabilize defined contacts to negatively charged membrane surfaces, and to modulate the IM30-induced membrane fusion activity.

Although its biosynthetic pathway is conserved across the three domains of life, the subcellular localization of the eukaryotic biosynthetic enzymes and the mechanism behind the cytosolic and mitochondrial CoA pools compartmentalization are still under debate. In humans, the transport of CoA across the inner mitochondrial membrane has been ascribed to two related genes, SLC25A16 and SLC25A42 whereas in D. melanogaster genome only one gene is present, CG4241, phylogenetically closer to SLC25A42. CG4241 encodes two alternatively spliced isoforms, dPCoAC-A and dPCoAC-B. Both isoforms were expressed in Escherichia coli, but only dPCoAC-A was successfully reconstituted into liposomes, where transported dPCoA and, to a lesser extent, ADP and dADP but not CoA, which was a powerful competitive inhibitor. The expression of both isoforms in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking the endogenous putative mitochondrial CoA carrier restored the growth on respiratory carbon sources and the mitochondrial levels of CoA. The results reported here and the proposed subcellular localization of some of the enzymes of the fruit fly CoA biosynthetic pathway, suggest that dPCoA may be synthesized and phosphorylated to CoA in the matrix, but it can also be transported by dPCoAC to the cytosol, where it may be phosphorylated to CoA by the monofunctional dPCoA kinase. Thus, dPCoAC may connect the cytosolic and mitochondrial reactions of the CoA biosynthetic pathway without allowing the two CoA pools to get in contact.",

We observed assembly of complex I which lacked only subunit NUYM and retained weak interaction with assembly factor N7BML (human NDUFAF2). Absence of NUYM caused distortion of iron sulfur clusters of the electron input domain leading to decreased complex I activity and increased release of reactive oxygen species. We conclude that NUYM has an important stabilizing function for the electron input module of complex I and is essential for proper complex I function.",

     "abstract": "Kinetic methods used to investigate electron and proton transfer within cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) are often based on the use of light to dissociate small ligands, such as CO, thereby initiating the reaction. Studies of intact mitochondria using these methods require identification of proteins that may bind CO and determination of the ligand-binding kinetics. In the present study we have investigated the kinetics of CO-ligand binding to S. cerevisiae mitochondria and cellular extracts. The data indicate that CO binds to two proteins, CytcO and a (yeast) flavohemoglobin (yHb). The latter has been shown previously to reside in both the cell cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we found that yHb resides also in the intermembrane space and binds CO in its reduced state. As observed previously, we found that the yHb population in the mitochondrial matrix binds CO, but only after removal of the inner membrane. The mitochondrial yHb (in both the intermembrane space and the matrix) recombines with CO with \u03c4\u00a0\u2245\u00a0270\u00a0ms, which is significantly slower than observed with the cytosolic yHb (main component \u03c4\u00a0\u2245\u00a01.3\u00a0ms).

Phycol. 42 233\u2013242) were compared for photosynthetic light harvesting and for oxygen evolution activity. Both chloroplasts and kleptoplasts emit chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence peaking at 683\u00a0nm (F683) at 277\u00a0K and at 689 (F689) at 77\u00a0K. Second derivative analysis of the F689 band at 77\u00a0K revealed two individual contributions centered at 683\u00a0nm (Fi-683) and at 689 (Fi-689). Using the p-nitrothiophenol (p-NTP) treatment of Kobayashi et al. (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 423 (1976) 80\u201390) to differentiate between Photosystem (PS) II and I fluorescence emissions, we could identify PS II as the origin of Fi-683 and PS I as the origin of Fi-689. Both emissions could be excited not only by Chl a-selective light (436\u00a0nm) but also by mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs)-selective light (345\u00a0nm). This suggests that a fraction of MAAs must be proximal to Chls a and, therefore, located within the plastids. On the basis of second derivative fluorescence spectra at 77\u00a0K, of p-NTP resolved fluorescence spectra, as well as of PSII-driven oxygen evolution activities, PS II appears substantially less active (~\u00a01/5) in dinoflagellate kleptoplasts than in P. antarctica chloroplasts. We suggest that a diminished role of PS II, a known source of reactive oxygen species, and a diminished dependence on nucleus-encoded light-harvesting proteins, due to supplementary light-harvesting by MAAs, may account for the extraordinary longevity of RSD kleptoplasts.",

     "abstract": "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) belong to the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family and mediate regulated proton leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Free fatty acids, aldehydes such as hydroxynonenal, and retinoids activate UCPs. However, there are some controversies about the effective action of retinoids and aldehydes alone; thus, only free fatty acids are commonly accepted positive effectors of UCPs. Purine nucleotides such as GTP inhibit UCP-mediated mitochondrial proton leak. In turn, membranous coenzyme Q may play a role as a redox state-dependent metabolic sensor that modulates the complete activation/inhibition of UCPs. Such regulation has been observed for UCPs in microorganisms, plant and animal UCP1 homologues, and UCP1 in mammalian brown adipose tissue. The origin of UCPs is still under debate, but UCP homologues have been identified in all systematic groups of eukaryotes. Despite the differing levels of amino acid/DNA sequence similarities, functional studies in unicellular and multicellular organisms, from amoebae to mammals, suggest that the mechanistic regulation of UCP activity is evolutionarily well conserved. This review focuses on the regulatory feedback loops of UCPs involving free fatty acids, aldehydes, retinoids, purine nucleotides, and coenzyme Q (particularly its reduction level), which may derive from the early stages of evolution as UCP first emerged.",

Here we demonstrate that our recently described W288A mutant of the Synechocystis OCP (hereinafter called OCPW288A) is a fully functional analogue of the OCPR form which is capable of constitutive PBs fluorescence quenching in vitro with no need of photoactivation. This PBs quenching effect is abolished in the presence of FRP, which interacts with OCPW288A with micromolar affinity and an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1, unexpectedly, implying dissociation of the FRP dimers.

Assembly of PSI into supercomplexes with light harvesting complex (LHC) II, cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) or NAD(P)H dehydrogenase complex (NDH) has been proposed as a means for regulating photosynthesis. However, structural details about the binding positions in plant PSI are lacking. We analyzed large data sets of electron microscopy single particle projections of supercomplexes obtained from the stroma membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana. By single particle analysis, we established the binding position of Cytb6f at the antenna side of PSI. The rectangular-shaped Cytb6f dimer binds at the side where Lhca1 is located. The complex binds with its short side rather than its long side to PSI, which may explain why these supercomplexes are difficult to purify and easily disrupted. Refined analysis of the interaction between PSI and the NDH complex indicates that in total up to 6 copies of PSI can arrange with one NDH complex. Most PSI-NDH supercomplexes appeared to have 1\u20133 PSI copies associated. Finally, the PSI-LHCII supercomplex was found to bind an additional LHCII trimer at two positions on the LHCI side in Arabidopsis. The organization of PSI, either in a complex with NDH or with Cytb6f, may improve regulation of electron transport by the control of binding partners and distances in small domains.",

Even though this domain is not essential for ATP synthesis activity, there is evidence for its involvement in the coupling mechanism of the pump. Recently, it was proposed that coupling of the ATP synthase can vary as a function of ADP and Pi concentration. In the present work, we have explored the possible role of the \u03b5CTD in this ADP- and Pi-dependent coupling, by examining an \u03b5CTD-lacking mutant of Escherichia coli. We show that the loss of Pi-dependent coupling can be observed also in the \u03b5CTD-less mutant, but the effects of Pi on both proton pumping and ATP hydrolysis were much weaker in the mutant than in the wild-type. We also show that the \u03b5CTD strongly influences the binding of ADP to a very tight binding site (half-maximal effect\u00a0\u2248\u00a01\u00a0nM); binding at this site induces higher coupling in EFOF1 and increases responses to Pi.

It required a higher light intensity for the saturation of photosynthesis and displayed a greater per chlorophyll light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution than the wild type. The Chl antenna size of the photosystems in the tla4 mutant was only about 65% of that measured in the wild type. Molecular genetic analysis revealed that a single plasmid DNA insertion disrupted two genes on chromosome 11 of the mutant. A complementation study identified the \u201cchloroplast signal recognition particle 54\u201d gene (CpSRP54), as the lesion causing the tla4 phenotype. Disruption of this gene resulted in partial failure to assemble and, therefore, lower levels of light-harvesting Chl-binding proteins in the C. reinhardtii thylakoids. A comparative in silico 3-D structure-modeling analysis revealed that the M-domain of the CpSRP54 of C. reinhardtii possesses a more extended finger loop structure, due to different amino acid composition, as compared to that of the Arabidopsis CpSRP54. The work demonstrated that CpSRP54 deletion in microalgae can serve to generate tla mutants with a markedly smaller photosystem Chl antenna size, improved solar energy conversion efficiency, and photosynthetic productivity in high-density cultures under bright sunlight conditions.",

In both cases, the estimated effective photochemical trapping time was in the 15\u201325\u00a0ps range, i.e. twice as fast as higher plants. In contrast to green phototrophs, the trapping time was rather constant across the whole emission spectrum. The weak wavelength dependence was attributed to the limited presence of long-wavelength emitting chlorophylls, as verified by low temperature spectroscopy. As the trapping kinetics of C. velia PSI were barely distinguishable from those of P. tricornutum PSI, it was concluded that the scission of PsaA protein had no significant impact on the overall PSI functionality.

Here we evaluate the effects of TPP-IOA on oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria and on mitochondrial function in live cells. We demonstrate that, at concentrations similar to those required to achieve inhibition of cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation in isolated mitochondria. In live SH-SY5Y cells, TPP-IOA partially collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential, caused extensive fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, and decreased apparent mitochondrial abundance within 3\u00a0h of exposure. Many cultured cell lines rely primarily on aerobic glycolysis, potentially making them less sensitive to small molecules disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. We therefore determined the anti-apoptotic efficacy of TPP-IOA in SH-SY5Y cells growing in glucose or in galactose, the latter of which increases reliance on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP supply. The anti-apoptotic activity of TPP-IOA that was observed in glucose media was not seen in galactose media. It therefore appears that, at concentrations required to inhibit cytochrome c peroxidase activity, TPP-IOA perturbs oxidative phosphorylation. In light of these data it is predicted that potential future therapeutic applications of TPP-IOA will be restricted to highly glycolytic cell types with limited reliance on oxidative phosphorylation.",

Its versatile metabolism makes R. eutropha an attractive host for biotechnological applications, including H2-driven production of biodegradable polymers and hydrocarbons. H2 oxidation by R. eutropha takes place in the presence of O2 and is mediated by four hydrogenases, which represent ideal model systems for both biohydrogen production and H2 utilization. The so-called soluble hydrogenase (SH) couples reversibly H2 oxidation with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH and has already been applied successfully in vitro and in vivo for cofactor regeneration. Thus, the interaction of the SH with the cellular NADH/NAD+ pool is of major interest. In this work, we applied the fluorescent biosensor Peredox to measure the [NADH]:[NAD+] ratio in R. eutropha cells under different metabolic conditions. The results suggest that the sensor operates close to saturation level, indicating a rather high [NADH]:[NAD+] ratio in aerobically grown R. eutropha cells.

Despite progress with water-soluble proteins, the challenge of programming self-assembly of integral membrane proteins into non-native macromolecular architectures remains largely unexplored. In this work it is shown that the assembly of dimers, trimers or tetramers of the naturally monomeric purple bacterial reaction centre can be directed by augmentation with an \u03b1-helical peptide that self-associates into extra-membrane coiled-coil bundle. Despite this induced oligomerisation the assembled reaction centres displayed normal spectroscopic properties, implying preserved structural and functional integrity. Mixing of two reaction centres modified with mutually complementary \u03b1-helical peptides enabled the assembly of heterodimers in vitro, pointing to a generic strategy for assembling hetero-oligomeric complexes from diverse modified or synthetic components. Addition of two coiled-coil peptides per reaction centre monomer was also tolerated despite the challenge presented to the pigment-protein assembly machinery of introducing multiple self-associating sequences. These findings point to a generalised approach where oligomers or longer range assemblies of multiple light harvesting and/or redox proteins can be constructed in a manner that can be genetically-encoded, enabling the construction of new, designed bioenergetic systems in vivo or in vitro.",

In this study of the enzyme from Escherichia coli, subunit N, containing one of the sites, was targeted. Pairs of cysteine residues were introduced into neighboring \u03b1-helices along the proposed proton pathways. In an effort to constrain conformational changes that might occur during proton translocation, we attempted to form disulfide bonds or methanethiosulfonate bridges between two engineered cysteine residues. Cysteine modification was inferred by the inability of PEG-maleimide to shift the electrophoretic mobility of subunit N, which will occur upon reaction with free sulfhydryl groups. After the cross-linking treatment, NADH oxidase and NADH-driven proton translocation were measured. Ten different pairs of cysteine residues showed evidence of cross-linking. The most significant loss of enzyme activity was seen for residues near the essential Lys 395. This residue is positioned between the proposed proton half-channel to the periplasm and the horizontal connection through subunit N, and is also near the essential Glu 144 of subunit M.

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic thylakoid membranes contain the protein machinery to convert sunlight in chemical energy and regulate this process in changing environmental conditions via interplay between lipid, protein and xanthophyll molecular constituents. This work addresses the molecular effects of zeaxanthin accumulation in thylakoids, which occurs in native systems under high light conditions through the conversion of the xanthophyll violaxanthin into zeaxanthin via the so called xanthophyll cycle. We applied biosynthetic isotope labeling and 13C solid-state NMR spectroscopy to simultaneously probe the conformational dynamics of protein, lipid and xanthophyll constituents of thylakoids isolated from wild type (cw15) and npq2 mutant of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, that accumulates zeaxanthin constitutively. Results show differential dynamics of wild type and npq2 thylakoids. Ordered-phase lipids have reduced mobility and mobile-phase lipids have enlarged dynamics in npq2 membranes, together spanning a broader dynamical range. The fraction of ordered lipids is much larger than the fraction of mobile lipids, which explains why zeaxanthin appears to cause overall reduction of thylakoid membrane fluidity. In addition to the ordered lipids, also the xanthophylls and a subset of protein sites in npq2 thylakoids have reduced conformational dynamics. Our work demonstrates the applicability of solid-state NMR spectroscopy for obtaining a microscopic picture of different membrane constituents simultaneously, inside native, heterogeneous membranes.",

     "abstract": "Plants are permanently exposed to rapidly changing environments, therefore it is evident that they had to evolve mechanisms enabling them to dynamically adapt to such fluctuations. Here we study how plants can be trained to enhance their photoprotection and elaborate on the concept of the short-term illumination memory in Arabidopsis thaliana. By monitoring fluorescence emission dynamics we systematically observe the extent of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) after previous light exposure to recognise and quantify the memory effect. We propose a simplified mathematical model of photosynthesis that includes the key components required for NPQ activation, which allows us to quantify the contribution to photoprotection by those components. Due to its reduced complexity, our model can be easily applied to study similar behavioural changes in other species, which we demonstrate by adapting it to the shadow-tolerant plant Epipremnum aureum. Our results indicate that a basic mechanism of short-term light memory is preserved. The slow component, accumulation of zeaxanthin, accounts for the amount of memory remaining after relaxation in darkness, while the fast one, antenna protonation, increases quenching efficiency. With our combined theoretical and experimental approach we provide a unifying framework describing common principles of key photoprotective mechanisms across species in general, mathematical terms.",

     "abstract": "Plants harvest photons for photosynthesis using light-harvesting complexes (LHCs)-an array of chlorophyll proteins that can reversibly switch from harvesting to energy-dissipation mode to prevent over-excitation and damage of the photosynthetic apparatus. In unicellular algae and lower plants this process requires the LHCSR proteins which senses over-acidification of the lumen trough protonatable residues exposed to the thylakoid lumen to activate quenching reactions. Further activation is provided by replacement of the violaxanthin ligand with its de-epoxidized product, zeaxanthin, also induced by excess light. We have produced the ppLHCSR1 protein from Physcomitrella patens by over-expression in tobacco and purified it in either its violaxanthin- or the zeaxanthin-binding form with the aim of analyzing their spectroscopic properties at either neutral or acidic pH. Using femtosecond spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the energy dissipation is achieved by two distinct quenching mechanism which are both activated by low pH. The first is present in both ppLHCSR1-Vio and ppLHCSR1-Zea and is characterized by 30\u201340\u00a0ps time constant. The spectrum of the quenching product is reminiscent of a carotenoid radical cation, suggesting that the pH-induced quenching mechanism is likely electron transfer from the carotenoid to the excited Chl a. In addition, a second quenching channel populating the S1 state of carotenoid via energy transfer from Chl is found exclusively in the ppLHCSR1-Zea at pH\u00a05. These results provide proof of principle that more than one quenching mechanism may operate in the LHC superfamily and also help understanding the photoprotective role of LHCSR proteins and the evolution of LHC antennae.",

While PetC1 and PetC2 have been identified as alternative subunits of the cytochrome b6f complex (b6f), PetC3 was localized exclusively within the plasma membrane. The spatial separation of PetC3 from the photosynthetic and respiratory protein complexes raises doubt in its involvement in bioenergetic electron transfer.Here we report a detailed structural and functional characterization of the cyanobacterial PetC3 protein family indicating that PetC3 is not a component of the b6f and the photosynthetic electron transport as implied by gene annotation. Instead PetC3 has a distinct function in cell envelope homeostasis. Especially proteomic analysis shows that deletion of petC3 in Synechocystis PCC 6803 primarily affects cell envelope proteins including many nutrient transport systems. Therefore, the observed downregulation in the photosynthetic electron transport \u2013 mainly caused by photosystem 2 inactivation \u2013 might constitute a stress adaptation. Comprehensive in silico sequence analyses revealed that PetC3 proteins are periplasmic lipoproteins tethered to the plasma membrane with a subclass consisting of soluble periplasmic proteins, i.e. their N-terminal domain is inconsistent with their integration into the b6f. For the first time, the structure of PetC3 was determined by X-ray crystallography at an atomic resolution revealing significant high similarities to non-b6f Rieske subunits in contrast to PetC1.These results suggest that PetC3 affects processes in the periplasmic compartment that only indirectly influence photosynthetic electron transport. For this reason, we suggest to rename \u201cPhotosynthetic electron transport Chain 3\u201d (PetC3) proteins as \u201cperiplasmic Rieske proteins\u201d (Prp).",

Their binuclear active site comprises a high-spin heme b3 associated with a CuB center. The protein also contains one low-spin heme b and 3 hemes c. We address here the redox properties of cbb3 oxidases from three organisms, Rhodobacter sphaeroides, Vibrio cholerae and Pseudomonas stutzeri by means of electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques.

Although the genes of ActRs are widely spread among freshwater bacterioplankton, there are no prior data on their functional expression in native cell membranes. Here, we demonstrate ActR phototrophy in the native actinobacterium. Genome analysis showed that Candidatus Rhodoluna planktonica, a freshwater actinobacterium, encodes one microbial rhodopsin (RpActR) belonging to the ActR family. Reflecting the functional expression of RpActR, illumination induced the acidification of the actinobacterial cell suspension and then elevated the ATP content inside the cells. The photochemistry of RpActR was also examined using heterologously expressed RpActR in Escherichia coli membranes. The purified RpActR showed \u03bbmax at 534\u00a0nm and underwent a photocycle characterized by the very fast formation of M intermediate. The subsequent intermediate, named P620, could be assigned to the O intermediate in other H+ pumps. In contrast to conventional O, the accumulation of P620 remains prominent, even at high pH. Flash-induced absorbance changes suggested that there exists only one kind of photocycle at any pH. However, above pH\u00a07, RpActR shows heterogeneity in the H+ transfer sequences: one first captures H+ and then releases it during the formation and decay of P620, while the other first releases H+ prior to H+ uptake during P620 formation.",

     "abstract": "Aggregation induced conformational change of light harvesting antenna complexes is believed to constitute one of the pathways through which photosynthetic organisms can safely dissipate the surplus of energy while exposed to saturating light. In this study, Stark fluorescence (SF) spectroscopy is applied to minor antenna complexes (CP24, CP26 and CP29) both in their light-harvesting and energy-dissipating states to trace and characterize different species generated upon energy dissipation through aggregation (in-vitro) induced conformational change. SF spectroscopy could identify three spectral species in the dissipative state of CP24, two in CP26 and only one in CP29. The comprehensive analysis of the SF spectra yielded different sets of molecular parameters for the multiple spectral species identified in CP24 or CP26, indicating the involvement of different pigments in their formation. Interestingly, a species giving emission around the 730\u00a0nm spectral region is found to form in both CP24 and CP26 following transition to the energy dissipative state, but not in CP29. The SF analyses revealed that the far red species has exceptionally large charge transfer (CT) character in the excited state. Moreover, the far red species was found to be formed invariably in both Zeaxanthin (Z)- and Violaxathin (V)-enriched CP24 and CP26 antennas with identical CT character but with larger emission yield in Z-enriched ones. This suggests that the carotenoid Z is not directly involved but only confers an allosteric effect on the formation of the far red species. Similar far red species with remarkably large CT character were also observed in the dissipative state of the major light harvesting antenna (LHCII) of plants [Wahadoszamen et al. PCCP, 2012], the fucoxanthin-chlorophyll protein (FCP) of brown algae [Wahadoszamen et al. BBA, 2014] and cyanobacterial IsiA [Wahadoszamen et al.

     "abstract": "Upon photoexcitation, the reaction center (RC) pigment-proteins that facilitate natural photosynthesis achieve a metastable separation of electrical charge among the embedded cofactors. Because of the high quantum efficiency of this process, there is a growing interest in their incorporation into biohybrid materials for solar energy conversion, bioelectronics and biosensing. Multiple bioelectrochemical studies have shown that reaction centers from various photosynthetic organisms can be interfaced with diverse electrode materials for the generation of photocurrents, but many mechanistic aspects of native protein functionality in a non-native environment is unknown. In vivo, RC's catalyse ubiquinone-10 reduction, protonation and exchange with other lipid phase ubiquinone-10s via protein-controlled spatial orientation and protein rearrangement. In contrast, the mechanism of ubiquinone-0 reduction, used to facilitate fast RC turnover in an aqueous photoelectrochemical cell (PEC), may not proceed via the same pathway as the native cofactor.In this report we show truncation of the native isoprene tail results in larger RC turnover rates in a PEC despite the removal of the tail's purported role of ubiquinone headgroup orientation and binding. Through the use of reaction centers with single or double mutations, we also show the extent to which two-electron/two-proton ubiquinone chemistry that operates in vivo also underpins the ubiquinone-0 reduction by surface-adsorbed RCs in a PEC. This reveals that only the ubiquinone headgroup is critical to the fast turnover of the RC in a PEC and provides insight into design principles for the development of new biophotovoltaic cells and biosensors.",

Fair additivity of the LH1 and RC absorption spectra suggests rather weak electronic coupling between them.

As part of a program aiming at getting easy access to new hydrogenases we report here a methodology based on a purely chemical assembly of their metal cofactors. This methodology is applied to the preparation and characterization of the hydrogenase from the fermentative anaerobic rumen bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii, which has only been incompletely characterized in the past.",

     "abstract": "A retinal protein from Exiguobacterium sibiricum (ESR) functions as a light-driven proton pump. Unlike other proton pumps, it contains Lys96 instead of a usual carboxylic residue in the internal proton donor site. Nevertheless, the reprotonation of the Schiff base occurs fast, indicating that Lys96 facilitates proton transfer from the bulk. In this study we examined kinetics of light-induced transmembrane electrical potential difference, \u0394\u03a8, generated in proteoliposomes reconstituted with ESR. We show that total magnitude of \u0394\u03a8 is comparable to that produced by bacteriorhodopsin but its kinetic components and their pH dependence are substantially different. The results are in agreement with the earlier finding that proton uptake precedes reprotonation of the Schiff base in ESR, suggesting that Lys96 is unprotonated in the initial state and gains a proton transiently in the photocycle. The electrogenic phases and the photocycle transitions related to proton transfer from the bulk to the Schiff base are pH dependent. At neutral pH, they occur with \u03c4 0.5\u00a0ms and 4.5\u00a0ms. At alkaline pH, the fast component ceases and Schiff base reprotonation slows. At pH\u00a08.4, a spectrally silent electrogenic component with \u03c4 0.25\u00a0ms is detected, which can be attributed to proton transfer from the bulk to Lys96. At pH\u00a05.1, the amplitude of \u0394\u03a8 decreases 10 fold, reflecting a decreased yield and rate of proton transfer, apparently from protonation of the acceptor (Asp85-His57 pair) in the initial state. The features of the photoelectric potential generation correlate with the ESR structure and proposed mechanism of proton transfer.",

Red algae are an important evolutionary group of algae which contain phycobilisomes (PBSs) on their thylakoid membranes, as do cyanobacteria. PBSs function not only as light-harvesting antennae but also as nitrogen storage. In this report, alterations of the supramolecular architecture of thylakoid membranes from red alga Porphyridium cruentum during nitrogen starvation were characterized. The morphology of the intact thylakoid membrane was observed to be round vesicles. Thylakoid membranes were reduced in content and PBSs were degraded during nitrogen starvation. The size and density of PBSs were both found to be reduced. PBS size decreased by less than one-half after 20\u00a0days of nitrogen starvation, but their hemispherical morphology was retained. The density of PBSs on thylakoid membranes was more seriously affected as time proceeded. Upon re-addition of nitrogen led to increasing of PBSs on thylakoid membranes. This work reports the first direct observation on alterations in the supramolecular architecture of thylakoid membranes from a photosynthetic organism in response to nitrogen stress.",

It is a key enzyme of the respiratory chain of many prokaryotic and most eukaryotic organisms. The reversible NADH oxidation reaction is facilitated in complex I by non-covalently bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Here we report that the catalytic activity of E. coli complex I with artificial electron acceptors potassium ferricyanide (FeCy) and hexaamineruthenium (HAR) is significantly inhibited in the enzyme pre-reduced by NADH. Further, we demonstrate that the inhibition is caused by reversible dissociation of FMN. The binding constant (Kd) for FMN increases from the femto- or picomolar range in oxidized complex I to the nanomolar range in the NADH reduced enzyme, with an FMN dissociation time constant of ~\u00a05\u00a0s. The oxidation state of complex I, rather than that of FMN, proved critical to the dissociation. Such dissociation is not observed with the T. thermophilus enzyme and our analysis suggests that the difference may be due to the unusually high redox potential of Fe-S cluster N1a in E. coli. It is possible that the enzyme attenuates ROS production in vivo by releasing FMN under highly reducing conditions.",

In bacteria such as Rhodobacter capsulatus it is constituted of three subunits: the iron-sulfur protein, cyt b and cyt c1, which form two catalytic domains, the Qo (hydroquinone (QH2) oxidation) and Qi (quinone (Q) reduction) sites. At the Qo site, the pathways of bifurcated electron transfers emanating from QH2 oxidation are known, but the associated proton release routes are not well defined. In energy transducing complexes, Zn2+ binding amino acid residues often correlate with proton uptake or release pathways. Earlier, using combined EXAFS and structural studies, we identified Zn coordinating residues of mitochondrial and bacterial cyt bc1. In this work, using the genetically tractable bacterial cyt bc1, we substituted each of the proposed Zn binding residues with non-protonatable side chains. Among these mutants, only the His291Leu substitution destroyed almost completely the Qo site catalysis without perturbing significantly the redox properties of the cofactors or the assembly of the complex. In this mutant, which is unable to support photosynthetic growth, the bifurcated electron transfer reactions that result from QH2 oxidation at the Qo site, as well as the associated proton(s) release, were dramatically impaired. Based on these findings, on the putative role of His291 in liganding Zn, and on its solvent exposed and highly conserved position, we propose that His291 of cyt b is critical for proton release associated to QH2 oxidation at the Qo site of cyt bc1.",

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle insulin resistance in obesity associates with mitochondrial dysfunction, but the causality of this association is controversial. This review evaluates mitochondrial models of nutrient-induced muscle insulin resistance. It transpires that all models predict that insulin resistance arises as a result of imbalanced cellular bioenergetics. The nature and precise origin of the proposed insulin-numbing molecules differ between models but all species only accumulate when metabolic fuel supply outweighs energy demand. This observation suggests that mitochondrial deficiency in muscle insulin resistance is not merely owing to intrinsic functional defects, but could instead be an adaptation to nutrient-induced changes in energy expenditure. Such adaptive effects are likely because muscle ATP supply is fully driven by energy demand. This market-economic control of myocellular bioenergetics offers a mechanism by which insulin-signalling deficiency can cause apparent mitochondrial dysfunction, as insulin resistance lowers skeletal muscle anabolism and thus dampens ATP demand and, consequently, oxidative ATP synthesis.",

Of the many possible posttranslational mechanisms that might participate in efficient co-ordination of metabolism and transport only reversible thiol-disulphide exchange mechanisms have been described in detail. Sucrose and trehalose metabolism are intertwined in the signalling hub that ensures appropriate resource allocation to drive growth and development under optimal and stress conditions, with trehalose-6-phosphate acting as an important signal for sucrose availability. The formidable suite of plant metabolite transporters provides enormous flexibility and adaptability in inter-pathway coordination and source-sink interactions. Focussing on the carbon metabolism network, we highlight the functions of different transporter families, and the important of thioredoxins in the metabolic dialogue between source and sink tissues.

These changes trigger a dynamic reorganization of the membrane protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes. Photosystem II (PSII) and its light harvesting system (LHCII) are the major target of this acclimation response, and accumulating evidences indicate that the amount and composition of PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes in thylakoids are dynamically adjusted in response to changes in light intensity and quality.In this study, we characterized the PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes in thylakoid membranes of pea plants in response to long-term acclimation to different light intensities. We provide evidence of a reorganization of the PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes showing distinct changes in their antenna moiety. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a specific reduction of Lhcb3, Lhcb6 and M-LHCII trimers bound to the PSII cores, while the Lhcb4.3 isoform increased in response to high light intensities. The modulation of Lhcb protein content correlates with the reduction of the functional PSII antenna size. These results suggest that the Lhcb3, Lhcb4.3 and Lhcb6 antenna subunits are major players in modulation of the PSII antenna size upon long-term acclimation to increased light levels. PsbS was not detected in the isolated PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes at any light condition, despite an increased accumulation in thylakoids of high light acclimated plants, suggesting that PsbS is not a constitutive component of PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes.",

In cytochrome bc1, one of the key enzymes of respiration or photosynthesis, proton transfers engage in oxidation of quinol (QH2) and reduction of quinone (Q) taking place at two distinct catalytic sites. Here we evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis the contribution of Lys251/Asp252 pair (bacterial numbering) in electron transfers and associated with it proton uptake to the quinone reduction site (Qi site). We showed that the absence of protonable group at position 251 or 252 significantly changes the equilibrium levels of electronic reactions including the Qi-site mediated oxidation of heme bH, reverse reduction of heme bH by quinol and heme bH/Qi semiquinone equilibrium. This implicates the role of H-bonding network in binding of quinone/semiquinone and defining thermodynamic properties of Q/SQ/QH2 triad. The Lys251/Asp252 proton path is disabled only when both protonable groups are removed. With just one protonable residue from this pair, the entrance of protons to the catalytic site is sustained, albeit at lower rates, indicating that protons can travel through parallel routes, possibly involving water molecules. This shows that proton paths display engineering tolerance for change as long as all the elements available for functional cooperation secure efficient proton delivery to the catalytic site.",

The spectral signatures arising from this analysis can be easily interpreted to assign experimentally known bands to specific molecular motions. In particular, we focused in the low frequency region of the vibrational spectrum of the S2 state.

An obligatory supercomplex is likely, due to the lack of genes encoding alternative electron transfer partners such as mono-heme cyt c.

Highly uniform supercomplex particles in electron microscopy analysis support a distinct structural composition.

     "abstract": "While the molybdenum cofactor in the majority of bisPGD enzymes goes through two consecutive 1-electron redox transitions, previous protein-film voltammetric results indicated the possibility of cooperative (n\u00a0=\u00a02) redox behavior in the bioenergetic enzyme arsenite oxidase (Aio). Combining equilibrium redox titrations, optical and EPR spectroscopies on concentrated samples obtained via heterologous expression, we unambiguously confirm this claim and quantify Aio's redox cooperativity. The stability constant, Ks, of the MoV semi-reduced intermediate is found to be lower than 10\u2212\u00a03. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the vicinity of the Mo-cofactor demonstrates that the degree of redox cooperativity is sensitive to H-bonding interactions between the pyranopterin moieties and amino acid residues. Remarkably, in particular replacing the Gln-726 residue by Gly results in stabilization of (low-temperature) EPR-observable MoV with KS\u00a0=\u00a04. As evidenced by comparison of room temperature optical and low temperature EPR titrations, the degree of stabilization is temperature-dependent. This highlights the importance of room-temperature redox characterizations for correctly interpreting catalytic properties in this group of enzymes.Geochemical and phylogenetic data strongly indicate that molybdenum played an essential biocatalytic roles in early life. Molybdenum's redox versatility and in particular the ability to show cooperative (n\u00a0=\u00a02) redox behavior provide a rationale for its paramount catalytic importance throughout the evolutionary history of life. Implications of the H-bonding network modulating Molybdenum's redox properties on details of a putative inorganic metabolism at life's origin are discussed.",

Untreated patients present episodic encephalopathic crises and biochemical liver alterations, whose pathophysiology is poorly known. We investigated the effects of OA, DA, cDA, octanoylcarnitine (OC) and decanoylcarnitine (DC) on critical mitochondrial functions in rat brain and liver. DA and cDA increased resting respiration and diminished ADP- and CCCP-stimulated respiration and complexes II-III and IV activities in both tissues. The data indicate that these compounds behave as uncouplers and metabolic inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation. Noteworthy, metabolic inhibition was more evident in brain as compared to liver. DA and cDA also markedly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, NAD(P)H content and Ca2\u00a0+ retention capacity in Ca2\u00a0+-loaded brain and liver mitochondria. The reduction of Ca2\u00a0+ retention capacity was more pronounced in liver and totally prevented by cyclosporine A and ADP, as well as by ruthenium red, demonstrating the involvement of mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) and Ca2\u00a0+. Furthermore, cDA induced lipid peroxidation in brain and liver mitochondria and increased hydrogen peroxide formation in brain, suggesting the participation of oxidative damage in cDA-induced alterations. Interestingly, OA, OC and DC did not alter the evaluated parameters, implying lower toxicity for these compounds. Our results suggest that DA and cDA, in contrast to OA and medium-chain acylcarnitines, disturb important mitochondrial functions in brain and liver by multiple mechanisms that are possibly involved in the neuropathology and liver alterations observed in MCAD deficiency.",

Here we investigated the influence of Fcp6, an orthologue to Lhcx1 of Thalassiosira pseudonana in the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana, by reducing its amount using an antisense approach. Whereas the pigment interactions inside FCPa were not influenced by the presence or absence of Fcp6, as demonstrated by unaltered spectra of circular dichroism, changes could be observed on the level of thylakoids and cells in the mutants compared to WT. This fits to recent models of NPQ in diatoms, where FCP aggregation or supramolecular reorganisation is thought to be a major feature.

Higher O2-QYs can be attained in cells by releasing constraints on charge transfer at the Photosystem II (PSII) acceptor side by adding membrane-permeable benzoquinone (BQ) derivatives that oxidize plastosemiquinone QB\u2212 and QBH2. This method allows uncoupling PSII turnover from its natural regulation in living cells, without artifacts of isolating PSII complexes. This approach reveals different extents of regulation across species, controlled at the QB\u2212 acceptor site. Arthrospira maxima is confirmed as the most efficient PSII-WOC (water oxidizing complex) and exhibits the least regulation of flux. Thermosynechococcus elongatus exhibits an O2-QY of 30%, suggesting strong downregulation. WOC cycle simulations with the most accurate model (VZAD) show that a light-driven backward transition (net addition of an electron to the WOC, distinct from recombination) occurs in up to 25% of native PSIIs in the S2 and S3 states, while adding BQ prevents backward transitions and increases the lifetime of S2 and S3 by 10-fold. Backward transitions occur in PSIIs that have plastosemiquinone radicals in the QB site and are postulated to be physiologically regulated pathways for storing light energy as proton gradient through direct PSII-cyclic electron flow (PSII-CEF). PSII-CEF is independent of classical PSI/cyt-b6f-CEF and provides an alternative proton translocation pathway for energy conversion. PSII-CEF enables variable fluxes between linear and cyclic electron pathways, thus accommodating species-dependent needs for redox and ion-gradient energy sources powered by a single photosystem.",

A wealth of experimental and theoretical data has provided a detailed picture of the complex role played by catalytic subunits. Although major conformational changes have only been seen in \u03b2-subunits, it is clear that \u03b1-subunits have to respond to these changes in order to be able to transmit information during the rotary mechanism. However, the conformational behavior of \u03b1-subunits has not been explored in detail. Here, we have combined unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and calorimetrically measured thermodynamic signatures to investigate the conformational flexibility of isolated \u03b1-subunits, as a step toward deepening our understanding of its function inside the \u03b13\u03b23 ring. The simulations indicate that the open-to-closed conformational transition of the \u03b1-subunit is essentially barrierless, which is ideal to accompany and transmit the movement of the catalytic subunits. Calorimetric measurements of the recombinant \u03b1-subunit from Geobacillus kaustophilus indicate that the isolated subunit undergoes no significant conformational changes upon nucleotide binding. Simulations confirm that the nucleotide-free and nucleotide-bound subunits show average conformations similar to that observed in the F1 crystal structure, but they reveal an increased conformational flexibility of the isolated \u03b1-subunit upon MgATP binding, which might explain the evolutionary conserved capacity of \u03b1-subunits to recognize nucleotides with considerable strength.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with obesity-related muscle insulin resistance, but the causality of this association is controversial. The notion that mitochondrial oxidative capacity may be insufficient to deal appropriately with excessive nutrient loads is for example disputed. Effective mitochondrial capacity is indirectly, but largely determined by ATP-consuming processes because skeletal muscle energy metabolism is mostly controlled by ATP demand. Probing the bioenergetics of rat and human myoblasts in real time we show here that the saturated fatty acid palmitate lowers the rate and coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation under conditions it causes insulin resistance. Stearate affects the bioenergetic parameters similarly, whereas oleate and linoleate tend to decrease the rate but not the efficiency of ATP synthesis. Importantly, we reveal that palmitate influences how oxidative ATP supply is used to fuel ATP-consuming processes. Direct measurement of newly made protein demonstrates that palmitate lowers the rate of de novo protein synthesis by more than 30%. The anticipated decrease of energy demand linked to protein synthesis is confirmed by attenuated cycloheximide-sensitivity of mitochondrial respiratory activity used to make ATP. This indirect measure of ATP turnover indicates that palmitate lowers ATP supply reserved for protein synthesis by at least 40%. This decrease is also provoked by stearate, oleate and linoleate, albeit to a lesser extent. Moreover, palmitate lowers ATP supply for sodium pump activity by 60\u201370% and, in human cells, decreases ATP supply for DNA/RNA synthesis by almost three-quarters. These novel fatty acid effects on energy expenditure inform the \u2018mitochondrial insufficiency\u2019 debate.",

Previous work demonstrated that the enzymatic activity depends on a structural pre-activation triggered by the entry of electrons through the electron transfer (ET) domain, which houses a heme c center. The catalytic activity of M. hydrocarbonoclasticus cd1NiR (Mhcd1NiR) was tested by mediated electrochemistry, using small ET proteins and chemical redox mediators. The rate of enzymatic reaction depends on the nature of the redox partner, with cytochrome (cyt) c552 providing the highest value. In situations where cyt c552 is replaced by either a biological (cyt c from horse heart) or a chemical mediator the catalytic response was only observed at very low scan rates, suggesting that the intermolecular ET rate is much slower.Molecular docking simulations with the 3D model structure of Mhcd1NiR and cyt c552 or cyt c showed that hydrophobic interactions favor the formation of complexes where the heme c domain of the enzyme is the principal docking site. However, only in the case of cyt c552 the preferential areas of contact and Fe\u2013Fe distances between heme c groups of the redox partners allow establishing competent ET pathways. The coupling of the enzyme with chemical redox mediators was also found not to be energetically favorable. These results indicate that although low activity functional complexes can be formed between Mhcd1NiR and different types of redox mediators, efficient ET is only observed with the putative physiological electron donor cyt c552.",

The gene coding for this protein is part of an operon mainly present in strict anaerobic bacteria, which is composed (in its core) by genes coding for the Orange Protein and two ATPase proposed to contain Fe-S clusters. In Desulfovibrio desulfuricans G20, there is an ORF, Dde_3197 that encodes a small protein containing several cysteine residues in its primary sequence. The heterologously produced Dde_3197 aggregates mostly in inclusion bodies and was isolated by unfolding with a chaotropic agent and refolding by dialysis. The refolded protein contained sub-stoichiometric amounts of iron atoms/protein (0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2), but after reconstitution with iron and sulfide, high iron load contents were detected (1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 or 3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) using 2- and 4-fold iron excess.

The refolded and reconstituted [2Fe-2S] Dde_3197 are EPR silent, but after reduction with dithionite, a rhombic signal is observed with gmax\u00a0=\u00a02.00, gmed\u00a0=\u00a01.95 and gmin\u00a0=\u00a01.92, consistent with a one-electron reduction of a [2Fe-2S]2\u00a0+ cluster into a [2Fe-2S]1\u00a0+ state, with an electron spin of S\u00a0=\u00a0\u00bd.

Here we have investigated the Flag-tagged ChlG (f.ChlG) in a complex with two different high-light inducible proteins (Hlips) HliD and HliC. The f.ChlG\u2013Hlips complex binds a Chl a and three different carotenoids, \u03b2-carotene, zeaxanthin and myxoxanthophyll. Application of ultrafast time-resolved absorption spectroscopy performed at room and cryogenic temperatures revealed excited-state dynamics of complex-bound pigments. After excitation of Chl a in the complex, excited Chl a is efficiently quenched by a nearby carotenoid molecule via energy transfer from the Chl a Qy state to the carotenoid S1 state. The kinetic analysis of the spectroscopic data revealed that quenching occurs with a time constant of ~\u00a02\u00a0ps and its efficiency is temperature independent. Even though due to its long conjugation myxoxanthophyll appears to be energetically best suited for role of Chl a quencher, based on comparative analysis and spectroscopic data we propose that \u03b2-carotene bound to Hlips acts as the quencher rather than myxoxanthophyll and zeaxanthin, which are bound at the f.ChlG and Hlips interface. The S1 state lifetime of the quencher has been determined to be 13\u00a0ps at room temperature and 21\u00a0ps at 77\u00a0K. These results demonstrate that Hlips act as a conserved functional module that prevents photodamage of protein complexes during photosystem assembly or Chl biosynthesis.",

     "abstract": "Matrix effects on long-range electron transfer were studied in cyanobacterial Photosystem I (PS I) complexes, embedded into trehalose glasses at different hydration levels. W-band EPR studies demonstrated, via nitroxide spin probes, structural homogeneity of the dry PS I-trehalose matrix and no alteration of cofactors' distance and relative orientation under temperature and matrix variation. In dry trehalose glasses at room temperature (RT), PS I was stable for months. Flash-induced charge recombination kinetics were examined by high-field time-resolved EPR and optical spectroscopies. The kinetics in hydrated PS I-trehalose glasses mostly reflected the reduction of the photooxidized primary donor P700\u2022+ by the reduced terminal iron-sulfur clusters. Upon dehydration, the P700\u2022+ decay accelerated and became more distributed. Continuous distributions of lifetimes \u03c4 were extracted from the kinetics by two numerical approaches: a maximum entropy method (MemExp program) and a constrained regularization method (CONTIN program). Both analyses revealed that upon dehydration the contribution of the two slowest components (lifetimes \u03c4 ~\u00a0300\u00a0ms and ~\u00a060\u00a0ms), attributed to P700\u2022+[FA/FB]\u2212 recombination, decreased in parallel with the increase of the fastest component (\u03c4\u00a0~\u00a0150\u00a0\u03bcs), and of additional distributed phases with intermediate lifetimes. Dehydration at RT mimicked the effects of freezing water-glycerol PS I systems, suggesting an impairment of PS I protein dynamics in the dry trehalose glass.

     "abstract": "The Fenna\u2013Matthews\u2013Olson (FMO) pigment\u2013protein complex in green sulfur bacteria transfers excitation energy from the chlorosome antenna complex to the reaction center. In understanding energy transfer in the FMO protein, the individual contributions of the bacteriochlorophyll pigments to the FMO complex's absorption spectrum could provide detailed information with which molecular and energetic models can be constructed. The absorption properties of the pigments, however, are such that their spectra overlap significantly. To overcome this, we used site-directed mutagenesis to construct a series of mutant FMO complexes in the model green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum (formerly Chlorobium tepidum). Two cysteines at positions 49 and 353 in the C. tepidum FMO complex, which reside near hydrogen bonds between BChls 2 and 3, and their amino acid binding partner serine 73 and tyrosine 15, respectively, were changed to alanine residues. The resulting C49A, C353A, and C49A C353A double mutants were analyzed with a combination of optical absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. Our results revealed changes in the absorption properties of several underlying spectral components in the FMO complex, as well as the redox behavior of the complex in response to the reductant sodium dithionite. A high-resolution X-ray structure of the C49A C353A double mutant reveals that these spectral changes appear to be independent of any major structural rearrangements in the FMO mutants. Our findings provide important tests for theoretical calculations of the C. tepidum FMO absorption spectrum, and additionally highlight a possible role for cysteine residues in the redox activity of the pigment\u2013protein complex.",

     "abstract": "Sulfide (H2S in the gas form) is the third gaseous transmitter found in mammals. However, in contrast to nitric oxide (NO) or carbon monoxide (CO), sulfide is oxidized by a sulfide quinone reductase and generates electrons that enter the mitochondrial respiratory chain arriving ultimately at cytochrome oxidase, where they combine with oxygen to generate water. In addition, sulfide is also a strong inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase, similar to NO, CO and cyanide. The balance between the electron donor and the inhibitory role of sulfide is likely controlled by sulfide and oxygen availability. The present study aimed to evaluate if and how sulfide release and oxidation impacts on the cellular affinity for oxygen. Results: i) when sulfide delivery approaches the maximal sulfide oxidation rate cells become exquisitely dependent on oxygen; ii) a positive feedback makes the balance between sulfide-releasing and -oxidizing rates the relevant parameter rather than the absolute values of these rates, and; iii) this altered dependence on oxygen is detected with sulfide concentrations that remain in the low micromolar range. Conclusions: i) within the context of continuous release of sulfide stemming from cellular metabolism, alterations in the activity of the sulfide oxidation pathway fine-tunes the cell's affinity for oxygen, and; ii) a decrease in the expression of the sulfide oxidation pathway greatly enhances the cell's dependence on oxygen concentration.",

This was achieved by separating the time-resolved fluorescence of PSI and PSII in the leaf. It is found that the PSII antenna size is larger on the abaxial side of A. thaliana leaves, presumably because chloroplasts in the spongy mesophyll are \u201cshaded\u201d by the palisade cells. The number of chlorophylls in PSI on the adaxial side of the A. thaliana leaf is slightly higher. The C4 plant M. x giganteus contains both mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, which have a different PSI/PSII ratio. It is shown that the time-resolved fluorescence of bundle sheath and mesophyll cells can be analysed separately. The relative number of chlorophylls, which belong to PSI (as compared to PSII) in the bundle sheath cells is at least 2.5 times higher than in mesophyll cells. FLIM is thus demonstrated to be a useful technique to study the PSI/PSII ratio and PSII antenna size in well-defined regions of plant leaves without having to isolate pigment-protein complexes.",

These delicate structures might, however, undergo substantial changes during isolating the thylakoid membranes or during sample preparations, e.g., for electron microscopy. Circular-dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique which can thus be used on intact samples. Via excitonic and psi-type CD bands, respectively, it carries information on short-range excitonic pigment\u2013pigment interactions and the macro-organisation (chiral macrodomains) of pigment\u2013protein complexes (psi, polymer or salt-induced). In order to obtain more specific information on the origin of the major psi-type CD bands, at around (+)506, (\u2212)674 and (+)690\u00a0nm, we fingerprinted detached leaves and isolated thylakoid membranes of wild-type and mutant plants and also tested the effects of different environmental conditions in vivo. We show that (i) the chiral macrodomains disassemble upon mild detergent treatments, but not after crosslinking the protein complexes; (ii) in different wild-type leaves of dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous angiosperms the CD features are quite robust, displaying very similar excitonic and psi-type bands, suggesting similar protein composition and (macro-) organisation of photosystem II (PSII) supercomplexes in the grana; (iii) the main positive psi-type bands depend on light-harvesting protein II contents of the membranes; (iv) the (+)506\u00a0nm band appears only in the presence of PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes and does not depend on the xanthophyll composition of the membranes.

In all reconstituted proteins, lutein 2 displayed a distorted conformation, as it does in purified LHCII trimers. Reconstituted WT and S123G also exhibited a conformation of bound neoxanthin (Nx) molecules identical to the native protein, while the S123P mutation was found to induce a change in Nx conformation. This structural change of neoxanthin is accompanied by a blue shift of the absorption of this carotenoid molecule. The interactions assumed by (and thus the structure of the binding sites of) the bound Chls b were found identical in all the reconstituted proteins, and only marginally perturbed as compared to purified LHCII. The interactions assumed by bound Chls a were also identical in purified LHCII and the reconstituted WT. However, the keto carbonyl group of one Chl a, originally free-from-interactions in WT LHCII, becomes involved in a strong H-bond with its environment in LHCII reconstituted from the S123P apoprotein. As the absorption in the Qy region of this protein is identical to that of the LHCII reconstituted from the WT apoprotein, we conclude that the interaction state of the keto carbonyl of Chl a does not play a significant role in tuning the binding site energy of these molecules.",

     "abstract": "We have investigated the nature of the photocurrent generated by Photosystem II (PSII), the water oxidizing enzyme, isolated from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, when immobilized on nanostructured titanium dioxide on an indium tin oxide electrode (TiO2/ITO). We investigated the properties of the photocurrent from PSII when immobilized as a monolayer versus multilayers, in the presence and absence of an inhibitor that binds to the site of the exchangeable quinone (QB) and in the presence and absence of exogenous mobile electron carriers (mediators). The findings indicate that electron transfer occurs from the first quinone (QA) directly to the electrode surface but that the electron transfer through the nanostructured metal oxide is the rate-limiting step. Redox mediators enhance the photocurrent by taking electrons from the nanostructured semiconductor surface to the ITO electrode surface not from PSII. This is demonstrated by photocurrent enhancement using a mediator incapable of accepting electrons from PSII. This model for electron transfer also explains anomalies reported in the literature using similar and related systems. The slow rate of the electron transfer step in the TiO2 is due to the energy level of electron injection into the semiconducting material being below the conduction band. This limits the usefulness of the present hybrid electrode. Strategies to overcome this kinetic limitation are discussed.",

     "abstract": "LHCSR3 is a member of the Light-Harvesting Complexes (LHC) family, which is mainly composed of pigment-protein complexes responsible for collecting photons during the first steps of photosynthesis. Unlike related LHCs, LHCSR3 is expressed in stress conditions and has been shown to be essential for the fast component of photoprotection, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. In plants, which do not possess LHCSR homologs, NPQ is triggered by the PSBS protein. Both PSBS and LHCSR3 possess the ability to sense pH changes but, unlike PSBS, LHCSR3 binds multiple pigments. In this work we have analyzed the properties of the pigments bound to LHCSR3 and their excited state dynamics. The data show efficient excitation energy transfer between pigments with rates similar to those observed for the other LHCs. Application of an exciton model based on a template of LHCII, the most abundant LHC, satisfactorily explains the collected steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic data, indicating that LHCSR3 has a LHC-like molecular architecture, although it probably binds less pigments. The model suggests that most of the chlorophylls have similar energy and interactions as in LHCII. The most striking difference is the localization of the lowest energy state, which is not on the Chlorophyll a (Chl a) 610-611-612 triplet as in all the LHCB antennas, but on Chl a613, which is located close to the lumen and to the pH-sensing region of the protein.",

PsbY is one of those low molecular mass proteins; this 4.7\u20134.9\u00a0kDa intrinsic protein seems not to bind any cofactors. Based on structural data from cyanobacterial and red algal Photosystem II PsbY is located closely or in direct contact with cytochrome b559. Cytb559 consists of two protein subunits (PsbE and PsbF) ligating a heme-group in-between them. While the exact function of this component in Photosystem II has not yet been clarified, a crucial role for assembly and photo-protection in prokaryotic complexes has been suggested. One unique feature of Cytb559 is its redox-heterogeneity, forming high, medium and low potential, however, neither origin nor mechanism are known. To reveal the function of PsbY within Photosystem II of Arabidopsis we have analysed PsbY knock-out plants and compared them to wild type and to complemented mutant lines.

The results presented here show an electrostatic coupling between the ionic atmosphere surrounding a membrane protein (the reaction center (RC) from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides) and two very different intra-protein ET processes taking place within it. Specifically we have studied the effect of salt concentration on: i) the kinetics of the charge recombination between the reduced primary quinone acceptor QA\u2212 and the primary photoxidized donor P+; ii) the thermodynamic equilibrium (QA\u2212\u00a0\u2194\u00a0QB\u2212) for the ET between QA\u2212 and the secondary quinone acceptor QB. A distinctive point of this investigation is that reactants and products are overall electroneutral. The protein electrostatics has been described adopting the lowest level of complexity sufficient to grasp the experimental phenomenology and the impact of salt on the relative free energy level of reactants and products has been evaluated according to suitable thermodynamic cycles. The ionic strength effect was found to be independent on the ion nature for P+\u00a0QA\u2212 charge recombination where the leading electrostatic term was the dipole moment. In the case of the QA\u2212\u00a0\u2194\u00a0QB\u2212 equilibrium, the relative stability of QA\u2212 and QB\u2212 was found to depend on the salt concentration in a fashion that is different for chaotropic and kosmotropic ions.

     "abstract": "Herein we extend prior studies of biosynthetic strontium replacement of calcium in PSII-WOC core particles to characterize whole cells. Previous studies of Thermosynechococcus elongatus found a lower rate of light-saturated O2 from isolated PSII-WOC(Sr) cores and 5\u20138\u00a0\u00d7 slower rate of oxygen release. We find similar properties in whole cells, and show it is due to a 20% larger Arrhenius activation barrier for O2 evolution. Cellular adaptation to the sluggish PSII-WOC(Sr) cycle occurs in which flux through the QAQB acceptor gate becomes limiting for turnover rate in vivo. Benzoquinone derivatives that bind to QB site remove this kinetic chokepoint yielding 31% greater O2 quantum yield (QY) of PSII-WOC(Sr) vs. PSII-WOC(Ca). QY and efficiency of the WOC(Sr) catalytic cycle are greatly improved at low light flux, due to fewer misses and backward transitions and 3-fold longer lifetime of the unstable S3 state, attributed to greater thermodynamic stabilization of the WOC(Sr) relative to the photoactive tyrosine YZ. More linear and less cyclic electron flow through PSII occurs per PSII-WOC(Sr). The organismal response to the more active PSII centers in Sr-grown cells at 45\u00a0\u00b0C is to lower the number of active PSII-WOC per Chl, producing comparable oxygen and energy per cell. We conclude that redox and protonic energy fluxes created by PSII are primary determinants for optimal growth rate of T. elongatus. We further conclude that the (Sr-favored) intermediate-spin S\u00a0=\u00a05/2 form of the S2 state is the active form in the catalytic cycle relative to the low-spin S\u00a0=\u00a01/2 form.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial Complex II is a key mitochondrial enzyme connecting the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain. Studies of complex II are clinically important since new roles for this enzyme have recently emerged in cell signalling, cancer biology, immune response and neurodegeneration. Oxaloacetate (OAA) is an intermediate of the TCA cycle and at the same time is an inhibitor of complex II with high affinity (Kd\u00a0~\u00a010\u2212\u00a08\u00a0M). Whether or not OAA inhibition of complex II is a physiologically relevant process is a significant, but still controversial topic. We found that complex II from mouse heart and brain tissue has similar affinity to OAA and that only a fraction of the enzyme in isolated mitochondrial membranes (30.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0% and 56.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6% in the heart and brain, respectively) is in the free, active form. Since OAA could bind to complex II during isolation, we established a novel approach to deplete OAA in the homogenates at the early stages of isolation. In heart, this treatment significantly increased the fraction of free enzyme, indicating that OAA binds to complex II during isolation. In brain the OAA-depleting system did not significantly change the amount of free enzyme, indicating that a large fraction of complex II is already in the OAA-bound inactive form. Furthermore, short-term ischemia resulted in a dramatic decline of OAA in tissues, but it did not change the amount of free complex II. Our data show that in brain OAA is an endogenous effector of complex II, potentially capable of modulating the activity of the enzyme.",

In particular, Em values of +\u00a0200\u00a0mV, \u2212\u00a0360\u00a0mV, \u2212\u00a0220\u00a0mV and \u2212\u00a050\u00a0mV (at pH\u00a07) were obtained for the Rieske cluster, heme bL, heme bH and heme ci, respectively.

Thermodynamic constraints, optimization of proton motive force build-up and the necessity of ROS-avoidance imposed by the rise in atmospheric O2 2.5\u00a0billion\u00a0years ago are discussed as putative evolutionary driving forces resulting in the observed redox upshift.

We report parallel circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) measurements at liquid helium temperatures of the proximal antenna protein CP47. This assembly hosts the lowest-energy chlorophylls in PSII, responsible for the well-known \u201cF695\u201d fluorescence band of thylakoids and PSII core complexes. Our new spectra enable a clear identification of the lowest-energy exciton state of CP47. This state exhibits a small but measurable excitonic delocalization, as predicated by its CD and CPL. Using structure-based simulations incorporating the new spectra, we propose a revised set of site energies for the 16 chlorophylls of CP47. The significant difference from previous analyses is that the lowest-energy pigment is assigned as Chl 612 (alternately numbered Chl 11). The new assignment is readily reconciled with the large number of experimental observations in the literature, while the most common previous assignment for the lowest energy pigment, Chl 627(29), is shown to be inconsistent with CD and CPL results. Chl 612(11) is near the peripheral light-harvesting system in higher plants, in a lumen-exposed region of the thylakoid membrane. The low-energy pigment is also near a recently proposed binding site of the PsbS protein. This result consequently has significant implications for our understanding of the kinetics and regulation of energy transfer in PSII.",

While proton uptake channels as well as water exit channels have been identified for A-type CcOs, the means by which water and protons exit B-type CcOs remain unclear. In this work, we investigate potential mechanisms for proton transport above the dinuclear center (DNC) in ba3-type CcO of Thermus thermophilus. Using long-time scale, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for several relevant protonation states, we identify a potential mechanism for proton transport that involves propionate A of the active site heme a3 and residues Asp372, His376 and Glu126II, with residue His376 acting as the proton-loading site. The proposed proton transport process involves a rotation of residue His376 and is in line with experimental findings. We also demonstrate how the strength of the salt bridge between residues Arg225 and Asp287 depends on the protonation state and that this salt bridge is unlikely to act as a simple electrostatic gate that prevents proton backflow. We identify two water exit pathways that connect the water pool above the DNC to the outer P-side of the membrane, which can potentially also act as proton exit transport pathways. Importantly, these water exit pathways can be blocked by narrowing the entrance channel between residues Gln151II and Arg449/Arg450 or by obstructing the entrance through a conformational change of residue Tyr136, respectively, both of which seem to be affected by protonation of residue His376.",

     "abstract": "Cyanobacterial light-harvesting complexes, phycobilisomes, can undergo extensive remodeling under varying light conditions. Acclimation to far-red light involves not only generation of red-shifted chlorophylls in the photosystems, but also induction of additional copies of core biliproteins that have been related to red-shifted components of the phycobilisome (Gan et al., Life 5, 4, 2015). We are studying the molecular basis for these acclimations in Chroococcidiopsis thermalis sp. PCC7203. Five far-red induced allophycocyanin subunits (ApcA2, ApcA3, ApcB2, ApcB3 and ApcF2) were expressed in Escherichia coli, together with S-type chromophore-protein lyases and in situ generated chromophore, phycocyanobilin. Only one subunit, ApcF2, shows an unusual red-shift (\u03bbAmax\u00a0~\u00a0675\u00a0nm, \u03bbFmax\u00a0~\u00a0698\u00a0nm): it binds the chromophore non-covalently, thereby preserving its full conjugation length. This mechanism operates also in two Cys-variants of the induced subunits of bulky APC. All other wild-type subunits bind phycocyanobilin covalently to the conventional Cys-81 under catalysis of the lyase, CpcS1. Although three of them also show binding to additional cysteines, all absorb and fluoresce similar to conventional APC subunits (\u03bbAmax\u00a0~\u00a0610\u00a0nm, \u03bbFmax\u00a0~\u00a0640\u00a0nm). Another origin of red-shifted complexes was identified, however, when different wild-type \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits of the far-red induced bulky APC were combined in a combinatorial fashion. Strongly red-shifted complexes (\u03bbFmax\u00a0\u2264\u00a0722\u00a0nm) were formed when the \u03b1-subunit, PCB-ApcA2, and the \u03b2-subunit, PCB-ApcB2, were generated together in E. coli. This extreme aggregation-induced red-shift of ~\u00a090\u00a0nm of covalently bound chromophores is reminiscent, but much larger, than the ~\u00a030\u00a0nm observed with conventional APC.",

Two-dimensional maps obtained by single particle electron microscopy (EM) clearly show that the tetramer lacks four-fold symmetry and is actually composed of a dimer of dimers with C2 symmetry. The resolution of these negative stain 2D maps did not permit the placement of most of the small PSI subunits, except for PsaL. Therefore cryo-EM was used for 3D reconstruction of the PSI tetramer complex. A 3D model at ~\u00a011.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution was obtained and a 2D map within the membrane plane of ~\u00a06.1\u00a0\u00c5. This data was used to build a model that was compared with the high-resolution structure of the PSI of Thermosynechococcus elongatus (T. elongatus) at 2.5\u00a0\u00c5. This comparison reveals key differences in which subunits are involved in the two different interfaces, interface type 1 within a dimer and interface type 2 between dimers. The type 1 interface in TS-821 is similar to the monomer interface in the trimeric PSI from T. elongatus, with interactions between subunits PsaA, -B, -I, -L and M. In type 2 the interaction is only between PsaA, -B and -L. Unlike the trimeric PSI, the central cavity of the complex is not filled with the PsaL-derived helical bundle, but instead seems filled with lipids. The physiological or evolutionary advantage of the tetramer is unknown. However, the presence of both dimers and tetramers in the thylakoid membrane suggest a dynamic equilibrium that shifts towards the tetramers in high light.",

     "abstract": "Life arose in a world without oxygen and the first organisms were anaerobes. Here we investigate the gene repertoire of the prokaryote common ancestor, estimating which genes it contained and to which lineages of modern prokaryotes it was most similar in terms of gene content. Using a phylogenetic approach we found that among trees for all 8779 protein families shared between 134 archaea and 1847 bacterial genomes, only 1045 have sequences from at least two bacterial and two archaeal groups and retain the ancestral archaeal\u2013bacterial split. Among those, the genes shared by anaerobes were identified as candidate genes for the prokaryote common ancestor, which lived in anaerobic environments. We find that these anaerobic prokaryote common ancestor genes are today most frequently distributed among methanogens and clostridia, strict anaerobes that live from low free energy changes near the thermodynamic limit of life. The anaerobic families encompass genes for bifunctional acetyl-CoA-synthase/CO-dehydrogenase, heterodisulfide reductase subunits C and A, ferredoxins, and several subunits of the Mrp-antiporter/hydrogenase family, in addition to numerous S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) dependent methyltransferases. The data indicate a major role for methyl groups in the metabolism of the prokaryote common ancestor. The data furthermore indicate that the prokaryote ancestor possessed a rotor stator ATP synthase, but lacked cytochromes and quinones as well as identifiable redox-dependent ion pumping complexes. The prokaryote ancestor did possess, however, an Mrp-type H+/Na+ antiporter complex, capable of transducing geochemical pH gradients into biologically more stable Na+-gradients. The findings implicate a hydrothermal, autotrophic, and methyl-dependent origin of life.

We performed taxonomic profiles of the several membrane bound respiratory proteins and complexes evaluating the presence of their respective coding genes in all species deposited in KEGG database. We evaluated 26 quinone reductases, 5 quinol:electron carriers oxidoreductases and 18 terminal electron acceptor reductases. We further included in the analyses enzymes performing redox or decarboxylation driven ion translocation, ATP synthase and transhydrogenase and we also investigated the electron carriers that perform functional connection between the membrane complexes, quinones or soluble proteins.

The reason for the presence of the multitude of Fe/S clusters in complex I remained enigmatic for a long time. The question was partly answered by investigations on the evolution of the complex revealing the stepwise construction of the electron transfer domain from several modules. Extension of the ancestral to the modern electron input domain was associated with the acquisition of several Fe/S-proteins. The X-ray structure of the complex showed that the NADH oxidation-site is connected with the quinone-reduction site by a chain of seven Fe/S-clusters. Fast enzyme kinetics revealed that this chain of Fe/S-clusters is used to regulate electron-tunneling rates within the complex. A possible function of the off-pathway cluster N1a is discussed.

CoQ receives electrons from different redox pathways, mainly NADH and FADH2 from tricarboxylic acid pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase that support key aspects of the metabolism. Here we explore some lines of evidence supporting the idea of the interaction of CoQ with the respiratory chain complexes, contributing to their superassembly, including respirasome, and its role in reactive oxygen species production in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

     "abstract": "Coenzyme Q (CoQ, or ubiquinone) is a remarkable lipid that plays an essential role in mitochondria as an electron shuttle between complexes I and II of the respiratory chain, and complex III. It is also a cofactor of other dehydrogenases, a modulator of the permeability transition pore and an essential antioxidant.CoQ is synthesized in mitochondria by a set of at least 12 proteins that form a multiprotein complex. The exact composition of this complex is still unclear. Most of the genes involved in CoQ biosynthesis (COQ genes) have been studied in yeast and have mammalian orthologues. Some of them encode enzymes involved in the modification of the quinone ring of CoQ, but for others the precise function is unknown. Two genes appear to have a regulatory role: COQ8 (and its human counterparts ADCK3 and ADCK4) encodes a putative kinase, while PTC7 encodes a phosphatase required for the activation of Coq7.Mutations in human COQ genes cause primary CoQ10 deficiency, a clinically heterogeneous mitochondrial disorder with onset from birth to the seventh decade, and with clinical manifestation ranging from fatal multisystem disorders, to isolated encephalopathy or nephropathy.The pathogenesis of CoQ10 deficiency involves deficient ATP production and excessive ROS formation, but possibly other aspects of CoQ10 function are implicated.CoQ10 deficiency is unique among mitochondrial disorders since an effective treatment is available. Many patients respond to oral CoQ10 supplementation. Nevertheless, treatment is still problematic because of the low bioavailability of the compound, and novel pharmacological approaches are currently being investigated.

     "abstract": "One of the important elements of operation of cytochrome bc1 (mitochondrial respiratory complex III) is a large scale movement of the head domain of iron\u2013sulfur protein (ISP-HD), which connects the quinol oxidation site (Qo) located within the cytochrome b, with the outermost heme c1 of cytochrome c1. Several mitochondrial disease-related mutations in cytochrome b are located at the cytochrome b-ISP-HD interface, thus their molecular effects can be associated with altered motion of ISP-HD. Using purple bacterial model, we recently showed that one of such mutations \u2014 G167P shifts the equilibrium position of ISP-HD towards positions remote from the Qo site as compared to the native enzyme [Borek et al., J. Biol. Chem. 290 (2015) 23781-23792]. This resulted in the enhanced propensity of the mutant to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) which was explained on the basis of the model evoking \u201csemireverse\u201d electron transfer from heme bL to quinone. Here we examine another mutation from that group \u2014 G332D (G290D in human), finding that it also shifts the equilibrium position of ISP-HD in the same direction, however displays less of the enhancement in ROS production. We provide spectroscopic indication that G332D might affect the electrostatics of interaction between cytochrome b and ISP-HD. This effect, in light of the measured enzymatic activities and electron transfer rates, appears to be less severe than structural distortion caused by proline in G167P mutant. Comparative analysis of the effects of G332D and G167P confirms a general prediction that mutations located at the cytochrome b-ISP-HD interface influence the motion of ISP-HD and indicates that \u201cpushing\u201d ISP-HD away from the Qo site is the most likely outcome of this influence. It can also be predicted that an increase in ROS production associated with the \u201cpushing\u201d effect is quite sensitive to overall severity of this change with more active mutants being generally more protected against elevated ROS.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \u2018EBEC 2016: 19th European Bioenergetics Conference, Riva del Garda, Italy, July 2\u20136, 2016\u2019, edited by Prof. Paolo Bernardi.",

Proton transfer through the D-channel is very fast, and its role in efficient transfer of both substrate and pumped protons is well established. However, it has not been fully clear why a separate K-channel is required, apparently for the supply of substrate protons only. In this work, we have analysed the available experimental and computational data, based on which we provide new perspectives on the role of the K-channel. Our analysis suggests that proton transfer in the K-channel may be gated by the protonation state of the active-site tyrosine (Tyr244) and that the neutral radical form of this residue has a more general role in the CcO mechanism than thought previously.

     "abstract": "Testing the predictions of the Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Ageing (MFRTA) has provided a deep understanding of the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondria in the aging process. However those data, which support MFRTA are in the majority correlative (e.g. increasing oxidative damage with age). In contrast the majority of direct experimental data contradict MFRTA (e.g. changes in ROS levels do not alter longevity as expected). Unfortunately, in the past, ROS measurements have mainly been performed using isolated mitochondria, a method which is prone to experimental artifacts and does not reflect the complexity of the in vivo process. New technology to study different ROS (e.g. superoxide or hydrogen peroxide) in vivo is now available; these new methods combined with state-of-the-art genetic engineering technology will allow a deeper interrogation of, where, when and how free radicals affect aging and pathological processes. In fact data that combine these new approaches, indicate that boosting mitochondrial ROS in lower animals is a way to extend both healthy and maximum lifespan. In this review, I discuss the latest literature focused on the role of mitochondrial ROS in aging, and how these new discoveries are helping to better understand the role of mitochondria in health and disease.

H2S can either act as a substrate or, similarly to CO and NO, an inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, in the latter case by targeting cytochrome c oxidase (CcOX). The impact of H2S on mitochondrial energy metabolism crucially depends on the bioavailability of this gaseous molecule and its interplay with the other two gasotransmitters. The H2S-producing human enzyme cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS), sustaining cellular bioenergetics in colorectal cancer cells, plays a role in the interplay between gasotransmitters. The enzyme was indeed recently shown to be negatively modulated by physiological concentrations of CO and NO, particularly in the presence of its allosteric activator S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet).

It can be synthesized endogenously but becomes \u201cconditionally essential\u201d in physiological or pathological conditions of high proliferation rate. To accomplish its functions glutamine has to be absorbed and distributed in the whole body. This job is efficiently carried out by a network of membrane transporters that differ in transport mechanisms and energetics, belonging to families SLC1, 6, 7, 38, and possibly, 25. Some of the transporters are involved in glutamine traffic across different membranes for metabolic purposes; others are involved in specific signaling functions through mTOR. Structure/function relationships and regulatory aspects of glutamine transporters are still at infancy. In the while, insights in involvement of these transporters in cell redox control, cancer metabolism and drug interactions are arising, stimulating basic research to uncover molecular mechanisms of transport and regulation.

     "abstract": "Glutamate elicits Ca2+ signals and workloads that regulate neuronal fate both in physiological and pathological circumstances. Oxidative phosphorylation is required in order to respond to the metabolic challenge caused by glutamate. In response to physiological glutamate signals, cytosolic Ca2+ activates respiration by stimulation of the NADH malate\u2013aspartate shuttle through Ca2+-binding to the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (Aralar/AGC1/Slc25a12), and by stimulation of adenine nucleotide uptake through Ca2+ binding to the mitochondrial ATP-Mg/Pi carrier (SCaMC-3/Slc25a23). In addition, after Ca2+ entry into the matrix through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), it activates mitochondrial dehydrogenases. In response to pathological glutamate stimulation during excitotoxicity, Ca2+ overload, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial dysfunction and delayed Ca2+ deregulation (DCD) lead to neuronal death. Glutamate-induced respiratory stimulation is rapidly inactivated through a mechanism involving Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation, consumption of cytosolic NAD+, a decrease in matrix ATP and restricted substrate supply. Glutamate-induced Ca2+-activation of SCaMC-3 imports adenine nucleotides into mitochondria, counteracting the depletion of matrix ATP and the impaired respiration, while Aralar-dependent lactate metabolism prevents substrate exhaustion. A second mechanism induced by excitotoxic glutamate is permeability transition pore (PTP) opening, which critically depends on ROS production and matrix Ca2+ entry through the MCU. By increasing matrix content of adenine nucleotides, SCaMC-3 activity protects against glutamate-induced PTP opening and lowers matrix free Ca2+, resulting in protracted appearance of DCD and protection against excitotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, while the lack of lactate protection during in vivo excitotoxicity explains increased vulnerability to kainite-induced toxicity in Aralar +/\u2212 mice.

     "abstract": "In this contribution we summarize most of the findings reported for the molecular and cellular biology of the physiological inhibitor of the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase, the engine of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and gate of cell death. We first describe the structure and major mechanisms and molecules that regulate the activity of the ATP synthase placing the ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 (IF1) as a major determinant in the regulation of the activity of the ATP synthase and hence of OXPHOS. Next, we summarize the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the expression of IF1 and emphasize, in addition to the regulation afforded by the protonation state of histidine residues, that the activity of IF1 as an inhibitor of the ATP synthase is also regulated by phosphorylation of a serine residue. Phosphorylation of S39 in IF1 by the action of a mitochondrial cAMP-dependent protein kinase A hampers its interaction with the ATP synthase, i.e., only dephosphorylated IF1 interacts with the enzyme. Upon IF1 interaction with the ATP synthase both the synthetic and hydrolytic activities of the engine of OXPHOS are inhibited. These findings are further placed into the physiological context to stress the emerging roles played by IF1 in metabolic reprogramming in cancer, in hypoxia and in cellular differentiation. We review also the implication of IF1 in other cellular situations that involve the malfunctioning of mitochondria. Special emphasis is given to the role of IF1 as driver of the generation of a reactive oxygen species signal that, emanating from mitochondria, is able to reprogram the nucleus of the cell to confer by various signaling pathways a cell-death resistant phenotype against oxidative stress. Overall, our intention is to highlight the urgent need of further investigations in the molecular and cellular biology of IF1 and of its target, the ATP synthase, to unveil new therapeutic strategies in human pathology.

Polytomella, lacking both chloroplasts and a cell wall, has greatly facilitated the purification of the algal ATP-synthase. Each monomer of the enzyme has 17 polypeptides, eight of which are the conserved, main functional components, and nine polypeptides (Asa1 to Asa9) unique to chlorophycean algae. These atypical subunits form the two robust peripheral stalks observed in the highly-stable dimer of the algal ATP synthase in several electron-microscopy studies. The topological disposition of the components of the enzyme has been addressed with cross-linking experiments in the isolated complex; generation of subcomplexes by limited dissociation of complex V; detection of subunit\u2013subunit interactions using recombinant subunits; in vitro reconstitution of subcomplexes; silencing of the expression of Asa subunits; and modeling of the overall structural features of the complex by EM image reconstruction. Here, we report that the amphipathic polymer Amphipol A8-35 partially dissociates the enzyme, giving rise to two discrete dimeric subcomplexes, whose compositions were characterized. An updated model for the topological disposition of the 17 polypeptides that constitute the algal enzyme is suggested.

The predominant isoform is the heart\u2013muscle\u2013brain ANT-isoform gene 1 (Ant1) while the other is the systemic Ant2 gene. Genetic inactivation of the Ant1 gene does not impair fetal development but results in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in postnatal mice. Using a knockin X-linked Ant2 allele in which exons 3 and 4 are flanked by loxP sites combined in males with a protamine 1 promoter driven Cre recombinase we created females heterozygous for a null Ant2 allele. Crossing the heterozygous females with the Ant2fl, PrmCre(+) males resulted in male and female ANT2-null embryos. These fetuses proved to be embryonic lethal by day E14.5 in association with cardiac developmental failure, immature cardiomyocytes having swollen mitochondria, cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation, and cardiac failure due to hypertrabeculation/noncompaction. ANTs have two main functions, mitochondrial\u2013cytosol ATP/ADP exchange and modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP). Previous studies imply that ANT2 biases the mtPTP toward closed while ANT1 biases the mtPTP toward open. It has been reported that immature cardiomyocytes have a constitutively opened mtPTP, the closure of which signals the maturation of cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we hypothesize that the developmental toxicity of the Ant2 null mutation may be the result of biasing the cardiomyocyte mtPTP to remain open thus impairing cardiomyocyte maturation and resulting in cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation and failure of trabecular maturation.

     "abstract": "V-ATPases are ATP-driven proton pumps that function within both intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane in a wide array of normal physiological and pathophysiological processes. V-ATPases are composed of a peripheral V1 domain that hydrolyzes ATP and an integral V0 domain that transports protons. Regulated assembly of the V-ATPase represents an important mechanism of regulating V-ATPase activity in response to a number of environmental cues. Our laboratory has demonstrated that glucose-dependent assembly of the V-ATPase complex in yeast is controlled by the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway. By contrast, increased assembly of the V-ATPase during dendritic cell maturation involves the PI-3 kinase and mTORC1 pathways. Recently, we have shown that amino acids regulate V-ATPase assembly in mammalian cells, possibly as a means to maintain adequate levels of amino acids upon nutrient starvation. V-ATPases have also been implicated in cancer cell survival and invasion. V-ATPases are targeted to different cellular membranes by isoforms of subunit a, with a3 targeting V-ATPases to the plasma membrane of osteoclasts. We have shown that highly invasive human breast cancer cell lines express higher levels of the a3 isoform than poorly invasive lines and that knockdown of a3 reduces both expression of V-ATPases at the plasma membrane and in vitro invasion of breast tumor cells. Moreover, overexpression of a3 in a non-invasive breast epithelial line increases both plasma membrane V-ATPases and in vitro invasion. Finally, specific ablation of plasma membrane V-ATPases in highly invasive human breast cancer cells using either an antibody or small molecule approach inhibits both in vitro invasion and migration. These results suggest that plasma membrane and a3-containing V-ATPases represent a novel and important target in the development of therapeutics to limit breast cancer metastasis.

     "abstract": "In this mini-review, we analyze the influence of cysteines in the structure and activity of mitochondrial outer membrane mammalian VDAC isoforms. The three VDAC isoforms show conserved sequences, similar structures and the same gene organization. The meaning of three proteins encoded in different chromosomes must thus be searched for subtle differences at the amino acid level. Among others, cysteine content is noticeable. In humans, VDAC1 has 2, VDAC2 has 9 and VDAC3 has 6 cysteines. Recent works have shown that, at variance from VDAC1, VDAC2 and VDAC3 exhibit cysteines predicted to protrude towards the intermembrane space, making them a preferred target for oxidation by ROS. Mass spectrometry in VDAC3 revealed that a disulfide bridge can be formed and other cysteine oxidations are also detectable. Both VDAC2 and VDAC3 cysteines were mutagenized to highlight their role in vitro and in complementation assays in \u0394porin1 yeast. Chemico-physical techniques revealed an important function of cysteines in the structural stabilization of the pore. In conclusion, the works available on VDAC cysteines support the notion that the three proteins are paralogs with a similar pore-function and slightly different, but important, ancillary biological functions.

     "abstract": "Proteins initially identified as essential for apoptosis also mediate a wide range of non-apoptotic functions that include cell cycle progression, differentiation and metabolism. As this phenomenon was mostly reported with non-cancer cells, we considered non-conventional roles for the apoptotic machinery in the cancer setting. We found that treating glioblastoma (GBM) tumors with siRNA against VDAC1, a mitochondrial protein found at the crossroads of metabolic and survival pathways and involved in apoptosis, inhibited tumor growth while leading to differentiation of tumor cells into neuronal-like cells, as reflected in the expression of specific markers. Although VDAC1 depletion did not induce apoptosis, the expression levels of several pro-apoptotic regulatory proteins were changed. Specifically, VDAC1 deletion led to up-regulation of caspases, p53, cytochrome c, and down-regulation of SMAC/Diablo, AIF and TSPO. The down-regulated group was highly expressed in U-87MG xenografts, as well as in GBMs from human patients. We also showed that the rewired cancer-cell metabolism resulting from VDAC1 depletion reinforced cell growth arrest and differentiation via alterations in the transcription factors p53, c-Myc, HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB. The decrease in c-Myc, HIF-1\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB levels was in accord with reduced cell proliferation, whereas increased p53 expression promoted differentiation. Thus, upon metabolic re-programing induced by VDAC1 depletion, the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins associated with cell growth decreased, while those connected to cell differentiation increased, converting GBM cells into astrocyte- and neuron-like cells. The results reveal that in tumors, pro-apoptotic proteins can perform non-apoptotic functions, acting as regulators of cell growth and differentiation, making these molecules potential new targets for cancer therapy.

The following potassium channels have been well described in the inner mitochondrial membrane: ATP-regulated potassium channel, Ca2\u00a0+-activated potassium channel, the voltage-gated Kv1.3 potassium channel, and the two-pore domain TASK-3 potassium channel. The primary functional roles of these channels include regulation of mitochondrial respiration and the alteration of membrane potential. Additionally, they modulate the mitochondrial matrix volume and the synthesis of reactive oxygen species by mitochondria. Mitochondrial potassium channels are believed to contribute to cytoprotection and cell death. In this paper, we discuss fundamental issues concerning mitochondrial potassium channels: their molecular identity, channel pharmacology and functional properties. Attention will be given to the current problems present in our understanding of the nature of mitochondrial potassium channels.

The view is emerging that also those residing in intracellular membranes play pivotal roles for the coordination of correct cell function. In this review we critically discuss our current understanding of the nature and physiological tasks of potassium channels in organelle membranes in both animal and plant cells, with a special emphasis on their function in the regulation of photosynthesis and mitochondrial respiration. In addition, the emerging role of potassium channels in the nuclear membranes in regulating transcription will be discussed. The possible functions of endoplasmic reticulum-, lysosome- and plant vacuolar membrane-located channels are also referred to. Altogether, experimental evidence obtained with distinct channels in different membrane systems points to a possible unifying function of most intracellular potassium channels in counterbalancing the movement of other ions including protons and calcium and modulating membrane potential, thereby fine-tuning crucial cellular processes.

     "abstract": "During apoptosis mitochondria undergo cristae remodeling and fragmentation, but how the latter relates to outer membrane permeabilization and downstream caspase activation is unclear. Here we show that the mitochondrial fission protein Dynamin Related Protein (Drp) 1 participates in cytochrome c release by selected intrinsic death stimuli. While Bax, Bak double deficient (DKO) and Apaf1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were less susceptible to apoptosis by Bcl-2 family member BID, H2O2, staurosporine and thapsigargin, Drp1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were protected only from BID and H2O2. Resistance to cell death of Drp1\u2212/\u2212 and DKO MEFs correlated with blunted cytochrome c release, whereas mitochondrial fragmentation occurred in all cell lines in response to all tested stimuli, indicating that other mechanisms accounted for the reduced cytochrome c release. Indeed, cristae remodeling was reduced in Drp1\u2212/\u2212 cells, potentially explaining their resistance to apoptosis. Our results indicate that caspase-independent mitochondrial fission and Drp1-dependent cristae remodeling amplify apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Within the mitochondrial reticulum of skeletal muscle, the I-Band segments (IBS) traverse the cell and form a contiguous matrix with the mitochondrial segments at the periphery (PS) of the cell. A tight electrical coupling via the matrix between the PS and IBS has been demonstrated. In addition, oxidative phosphorylation complexes that generate the proton motive force (PMF) are preferentially located in the PS, while Complex V, which utilizes the PMF, is primarily located along the IBS. This has led to the hypothesis that PS can support the production of ATP in the IBS by maintaining the potential energy available to produce ATP deep in the muscle cell via conduction of the PMF down the IBS. However, the mechanism of transmitting the PMF down the IBS is poorly understood. This theoretical study was undertaken to establish the physical limits governing IBS conduction as well as potential mechanisms for balancing the protons entering the matrix along the IBS with the ejection of protons in the PS. The IBS was modeled as a 300\u00a0nm diameter, water-filled tube, with an insulated circumferential wall. Two mechanisms were considered to drive ion transport along the IBS: the electrical potential and/or concentration gradients between the PS to the end of the IBS. The magnitude of the flux was estimated from the maximum ATP production rate for skeletal muscle. The major transport ions in consideration were H+, Na+, and K+ using diffusion coefficients from the literature. The simulations were run using COMSOL Multiphysics simulator. These simulations suggest conduction along the IBS via H+ alone is unlikely requiring un-physiological gradients, while Na+ or K+ could carry the current with minor gradients in concentration or electrical potential along the IBS. The majority of conduction down the IBS is likely dependent on these abundant ions; however, this presents a question as to how H+ is recycled from the matrix of the IBS to the PS for active extrusion. We propose that the abundant cation\u2013proton antiporter in skeletal muscle mitochondria operates in opposite directions in the IBS and PS to permit local recycling of H+ at each site driven by cooperative gradients in H+ and Na+/K+ which favor H+ entry in the PS and H+ efflux in the IBS.

     "abstract": "The cell is metabolically highly compartmentalized. Especially, mitochondria host many vital reactions in their different microcompartments. However, due to their small size, these microcompartments are not accessible by conventional microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) fluorescence lifetime-imaging microscopy (FLIM) classifies not only mitochondria, but different microcompartments inside mitochondria. Sensor proteins in the matrix had a different lifetime than probes at membrane proteins. Localization in the outer and inner mitochondrial membrane could be distinguished by significant differences in the lifetime. The method was sensitive enough to monitor shifts in protein location within mitochondrial microcompartments. Macromolecular crowding induced by changes in the protein content significantly affected the lifetime, while oxidizing conditions or physiological pH changes had only marginal effects. We suggest that FLIM is a versatile and completive method to monitor spatiotemporal events in mitochondria. The sensitivity in the time domain allows for gaining substantial information about sub-mitochondrial localization overcoming diffraction limitation.

An altered expression of Lon leads to a profound reprogramming of cell metabolism, with a switch from respiration to glycolysis, which is often observed in cancer cells.

The genetic connection between Parkin and Parkinson's disease derives from clinical gene-association studies, whereas our mechanistic understanding of Parkin functioning in mitophagy is based almost entirely on work performed in cultured cells. Surprisingly, experimental evidence linking the disease and the presumed mechanism derives almost entirely from fruit flies; germline Parkin deficient mice do not develop Parkinson's disease phenotypes. Moreover, genetic manipulation of Parkin signaling in mouse hearts does not support a central role for Parkin in homeostatic mitochondrial quality control in this mitochondria-rich and -dependent organ. Here, I provide an overview of data suggesting that (in mouse hearts at least) Parkin functions more as a stress-induced and developmentally-programmed facilitator of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial turnover.

NGS approaches are able to identify the causative gene defects in small families and even single individuals, unsuitable for investigation by traditional linkage analysis. These technologies are contributing to fill the gap between mitochondrial disease cases defined on the basis of clinical, neuroimaging and biochemical readouts, which still outnumber by approximately 50% the cases for which a molecular-genetic diagnosis is attained. We have been using a combined, two-step strategy, based on targeted genes panel as a first NGS screening, followed by whole exome sequencing (WES) in still unsolved cases, to analyze a large cohort of subjects, that failed to show mutations in mtDNA and in ad hoc sets of specific nuclear genes, sequenced by the Sanger's method. Not only this approach has allowed us to reach molecular diagnosis in a significant fraction (20%) of these difficult cases, but it has also revealed unexpected and conceptually new findings. These include the possibility of marked variable penetrance of recessive mutations, the identification of large-scale DNA rearrangements, which explain spuriously heterozygous cases, and the association of mutations in known genes with unusual, previously unreported clinical phenotypes. Importantly, WES on selected cases has unraveled the presence of pathogenic mutations in genes encoding non-mitochondrial proteins (e.g. the transcription factor E4F1), an observation that further expands the intricate genetics of mitochondrial disease and suggests a new area of investigation in mitochondrial medicine.

We have used this system to transduce the Chinese hamster V79-G7 OXPHOS mutant cell line with a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis. The complemented cells were found to have acquired the cDNA for the bS6m polypeptide of the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome. bS6m is a 14\u00a0kDa polypeptide located on the outside of the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit and interacts with the rRNA. The V79-G7 mutant protein was found to harbor a methionine to threonine missense mutation at codon 13. The hamster bS6m null mutant could also be complemented by its orthologs from either mouse or human. bS6m protein tagged at its C-terminus by HA, His or GFP localized to the mitochondrion and was fully functional. Through site-directed mutagenesis we identified the probable RNA interacting residues of the bS6m peptide and tested the functional significance of mammalian specific C-terminal region. The N-terminus of the bS6m polypeptide functionally corresponds to that of the prokaryotic small ribosomal subunit, but deletion of C-terminal residues along with the zinc ion coordinating cysteine had no functional effect. Since mitochondrial diseases can result from hundreds to thousands of different nDNA gene mutations, this one step viral complementation cloning may facilitate the molecular diagnosis of a range of nDNA mitochondrial disease mutations.

Although at the organismal level the central timekeeper is constituted by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei practically all the peripheral tissues are equipped with autonomous oscillators made up by common molecular clockworks represented by circuits of gene expression that are organized in interconnected positive and negative feed-back loops. In this study we exploited a well-established in vitro synchronization model to investigate specifically the linkage between clock gene expression and the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Here we show that synchronized cells exhibit an autonomous ultradian mitochondrial respiratory activity which is abrogated by silencing the master clock gene ARNTL/BMAL1. Surprisingly, pharmacological inhibition of the mitochondrial OxPhos system resulted in dramatic deregulation of the rhythmic clock-gene expression and a similar result was attained with mtDNA depleted cells (Rho0).

Either at cluster N2 (the terminal cluster in the chain) or upon the binding/reduction/dissociation of ubiquinone/ubiquinol, energy from the redox process is captured to initiate long-range energy transfer through the complex and drive proton translocation. This review focuses on current knowledge of how the redox reaction and proton transfer are coupled, with particular emphasis on the formation and role of semiquinone intermediates in both energy transduction and reactive oxygen species production.

     "abstract": "Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) plays a central role in cellular energy production, coupling electron transfer between NADH and quinone to proton translocation. It is the largest protein assembly of respiratory chains and one of the most elaborate redox membrane proteins known. Bacterial enzyme is about half the size of mitochondrial and thus provides its important \u201cminimal\u201d model. Dysfunction of mitochondrial complex I is implicated in many human neurodegenerative diseases. The L-shaped complex consists of a hydrophilic arm, where electron transfer occurs, and a membrane arm, where proton translocation takes place. We have solved the crystal structures of the hydrophilic domain of complex I from Thermus thermophilus, the membrane domain from Escherichia coli and recently of the intact, entire complex I from T. thermophilus (536\u00a0kDa, 16 subunits, 9 iron\u2013sulphur clusters, 64 transmembrane helices). The 95\u00a0\u00c5 long electron transfer pathway through the enzyme proceeds from the primary electron acceptor flavin mononucleotide through seven conserved Fe\u2013S clusters to the unusual elongated quinone-binding site at the interface with the membrane domain. Four putative proton translocation channels are found in the membrane domain, all linked by the central flexible axis containing charged residues. The redox energy of electron transfer is coupled to proton translocation by the as yet undefined mechanism proposed to involve long-range conformational changes.

     "abstract": "Proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) is the largest and most complicated enzyme of the respiratory chain. Fourteen central subunits represent the minimal form of complex I and can be assigned to functional modules for NADH oxidation, ubiquinone reduction, and proton pumping. In addition, the mitochondrial enzyme comprises some 30 accessory subunits surrounding the central subunits that are not directly associated with energy conservation. Complex I is known to release deleterious oxygen radicals (ROS) and its dysfunction has been linked to a number of hereditary and degenerative diseases. We here review recent progress in structure determination, and in understanding the role of accessory subunits and functional analysis of mitochondrial complex I. For the central subunits, structures provide insight into the arrangement of functional modules including the substrate binding sites, redox-centers and putative proton channels and pump sites. Only for two of the accessory subunits, detailed structures are available. Nevertheless, many of them could be localized in the overall structure of complex I, but most of these assignments have to be considered tentative. Strikingly, redox reactions and proton pumping machinery are spatially completely separated and the site of reduction for the hydrophobic substrate ubiquinone is found deeply buried in the hydrophilic domain of the complex. The X-ray structure of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica provides clues supporting the previously proposed two-state stabilization change mechanism, in which ubiquinone redox chemistry induces conformational states and thereby drives proton pumping. The same structural rearrangements may explain the active/deactive transition of complex I implying an integrated mechanistic model for energy conversion and regulation.

     "abstract": "Respiratory complex I couples NADH:quinone oxidoreduction to ion translocation across the membrane, contributing to the buildup of the transmembrane difference of electrochemical potential. H+ is well recognized to be the coupling ion of this system but some studies suggested that this role could be also performed by Na+. We have previously observed NADH-driven Na+ transport opposite to H+ translocation by menaquinone-reducing complexes I, which indicated a Na+/H+ antiporter activity in these systems. Such activity was also observed for the ubiquinone-reducing mitochondrial complex I in its deactive form. The relation of Na+ with complex I may not be surprising since the enzyme has three subunits structurally homologous to bona fide Na+/H+ antiporters and translocation of H+ and Na+ ions has been described for members of most types of ion pumps and transporters. Moreover, no clearly distinguishable motifs for the binding of H+ or Na+ have been recognized yet.We noticed that in menaquinone-reducing complexes I, less energy is available for ion translocation, compared to ubiquinone-reducing complexes I. Therefore, we hypothesized that menaquinone-reducing complexes I perform Na+/H+ antiporter activity in order to achieve the stoichiometry of 4H+/2e\u2212. In agreement, the organisms that use ubiquinone, a high potential quinone, would have kept such Na+/H+ antiporter activity, only operative under determined conditions. This would imply a physiological role(s) of complex I besides a simple \u201ccoupling\u201d of a redox reaction and ion transport, which could account for the sophistication of this enzyme.

     "abstract": "Complex I deficiency is the most frequently encountered single mitochondrial single enzyme deficiency in patients with a mitochondrial disorder. Although specific genotype\u2013phenotype correlations are very difficult to identify, the majority of patients present with symptoms caused by leukodystrophy. The poor genotype\u2013phenotype correlations can make establishing a diagnosis a challenge. The classical way to establish a complex I deficiency in patients is by performing spectrophotometric measurements of the enzyme in a muscle biopsy or other patient-derived material (liver or heart biopsy, cultured skin fibroblasts). Complex I is encoded by both the mtDNA and nuclear DNA and pathogenic mutations have been identified in the majority of the 44 genes encoding the structural subunits of complex I. In recent years, the increasing possibilities for diagnostic molecular genetic tests of large gene panels, exomes, and even entire genomes has led to the identification of many novel genetic defects causing complex I deficiency. Complex I mutations not only result in a reduced enzyme activity but also induce secondary effects at the cellular level, such as elevated reactive oxygen species production, altered membrane potential and mitochondrial morphology. At this moment there is no cure for complex I deficiency and the treatment options for complex I patients are restricted to symptomatic treatment. Recent developments, amongst others based on the treatment of the secondary effects of complex I deficiency, have shown to be promising as new therapeutic strategies in vitro and have entered clinical trials.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is a key enzyme in cellular energy metabolism and provides approximately 40% of the proton-motive force that is utilized during mitochondrial ATP production. The dysregulation of complex I function \u2013 either genetically, pharmacologically, or metabolically induced \u2013 has severe pathophysiological consequences that often involve an imbalance in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Slow transition of the active (A) enzyme to the deactive, dormant (D) form takes place during ischemia in metabolically active organs such as the heart and brain. The reactivation of complex I occurs upon reoxygenation of ischemic tissue, a process that is usually accompanied by an increase in cellular ROS production. Complex I in the D-form serves as a protective mechanism preventing the oxidative burst upon reperfusion. Conversely, however, the D-form is more vulnerable to oxidative/nitrosative damage. Understanding the so-called active/deactive (A/D) transition may contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions for conditions like stroke, cardiac infarction, and other ischemia-associated pathologies. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the mechanism of A/D transition of mitochondrial complex I considering recently available structural data and site-specific labeling experiments. In addition, this review discusses in detail the impact of the A/D transition on ROS production by complex I and the S-nitrosation of a critical cysteine residue of subunit ND3 as a strategy to prevent oxidative damage and tissue damage during ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury.

     "abstract": "Complex I or NADH quinone oxidoreductase (NUO) is an integral component of modern day respiratory chains and has a close evolutionary relationship with energy-conserving [NiFe]-hydrogenases of anaerobic microorganisms. Specifically, in all of biology, the quinone-binding subunit of Complex I, NuoD, is most closely related to the proton-reducing, H2-evolving [NiFe]-containing catalytic subunit, MbhL, of membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH), to the methanophenzine-reducing subunit of a methanogenic respiratory complex (FPO) and to the catalytic subunit of an archaeal respiratory complex (MBX) involved in reducing elemental sulfur (S\u00b0). These complexes also pump ions and have at least 10 homologous subunits in common. As electron donors, MBH and MBX use ferredoxin (Fd), FPO uses either Fd or cofactor F420, and NUO uses either Fd or NADH. In this review, we examine the evolutionary trajectory of these oxidoreductases from a proton-reducing ancestral respiratory complex (ARC). We hypothesize that the diversification of ARC to MBH, MBX, FPO and eventually NUO was driven by the larger energy yields associated with coupling Fd oxidation to the reduction of oxidants with increasing electrochemical potential, including protons, S\u00b0 and membrane soluble organic compounds such as phenazines and quinone derivatives. Importantly, throughout Earth's history, the availability of these oxidants increased as the redox state of the atmosphere and oceans became progressively more oxidized as a result of the origin and ecological expansion of oxygenic photosynthesis. ARC-derived complexes are therefore remarkably stable respiratory systems with little diversity in core structure but whose general function appears to have co-evolved with the redox state of the biosphere.

Based on experimental data and the conservation of critical residues we identify a spectrum of protein function conservation between the complex I representatives and their non-complex I homologs. This spectrum ranges from proteins that have retained their molecular function but in which the substrate specificity may have changed or have become more specific, like NDUFAF5, to proteins that have lost their original molecular function and critical catalytic residues like NDUFAF6. In between are proteins that have retained their molecular function, which however appears unrelated to complex I, like ACAD9, or proteins in which amino acids of the active site are conserved but for which no enzymatic activity has been reported, like NDUFA10. We interpret complex I evolution against the background of molecular evolution theory. Complex I supernumerary subunits and assembly factors appear to have been recruited from proteins that are mitochondrial and/or that are expressed when complex I is active. Within the evolution of complex I and its assembly there are many cases of neofunctionalization after gene duplication, like ACAD9 and TMEM126B, one case of subfunctionalization: ACPM1 and ACPM2 in Yarrowia lipolytica, and one case in which a complex I protein itself appears to have been the source of a new protein from another complex: NDUFS6 gave rise to cytochrome c oxidase subunit COX4/COX5b. Complex I and its assembly can therewith be regarded as a treasure trove for pathway evolution.

The proton-pumping Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the first and most complicated enzyme required in this process. Complex I is an L-shaped enzyme consisting of more than 40 subunits, one FMN molecule and eight Fe\u2013S clusters. In recent years, genetic and proteomic analyses of Complex I mutants in various model systems, including plants, have provided valuable insights into the assembly of this multimeric enzyme. Assisted by a number of key players, referred to as \u201cassembly factors\u201d, the assembly of Complex I takes place in a sequential and modular manner. Although a number of factors have been identified, their precise function in mediating Complex I assembly still remains to be elucidated. This review summarizes our current knowledge of plant Complex I composition and assembly derived from studies in plant model systems such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Plant Complex I is highly conserved and comprises a significant number of subunits also present in mammalian and fungal Complexes I. Plant Complex I also contains additional subunits absent from the mammalian and fungal counterpart, whose function in enzyme activity and assembly is not clearly understood.

     "abstract": "Eleven genes encoding chloroplast NADH dehydrogenase-like (NDH) complex have been discovered in plastid genomes on the basis of their homology with genes encoding respiratory complex I. Despite this structural similarity, chloroplast NDH and its evolutionary origin NDH-1 in cyanobacteria accept electrons from ferredoxin (Fd), indicating that chloroplast NDH is an Fd-dependent plastoquinone (PQ) reductase rather than an NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. In Arabidopsis thaliana, chloroplast NDH interacts with photosystem I (PSI); this interaction is needed to stabilize NDH, especially under high light. On the basis of these distinct characters of chloroplast and cyanobacterial NDH, it can be distinguished as a photosynthetic NDH from respiratory complex I. In fact, chloroplast NDH forms part of the machinery of photosynthesis by mediating the minor pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport. Along with the antimycin A-sensitive main pathway of PSI cyclic electron transport, chloroplast NDH compensates the ATP/NADPH production ratio in the light reactions of photosynthesis. In this review, I revisit the original concept of chloroplast NDH on the basis of its similarity to respiratory complex I and thus introduce current progress in the field to researchers focusing on respiratory complex I. I summarize recent progress on the basis of structure and function. Finally, I introduce the results of our examination of the process of assembly of chloroplast NDH. Although the process requires many plant-specific non-subunit factors, the core processes of assembly are conserved between chloroplast NDH and respiratory complex I.

Here, we studied how in the intact cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C.r.) the lack of the photosystem I (PSI) core or the photosystem II (PSII) core affects these interactions. To that end the mutants F15 and M18 (both PSI-deficient) and FUD7 (PSII-deficient) were incubated under conditions known to promote state transitions in wild-type. The intact cells were then instantly frozen to 77\u00a0K and the full-spectrum time-resolved fluorescence emission of the cells was measured by means of streak camera. In the PSI-deficient mutants excitation energy transfer (EET) towards light-harvesting complexes of PSI (Lhca) occurs in less than 0.5\u00a0ns, and fluorescence from Lhca decays in 3.1\u00a0ns. Decreased trapping by PSII and increased fluorescence of Lhca upon state 1 (S1)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0state 2 (S2) transition appears in the F15 and less in the M18 mutant.

Moreover, EET of 0.4\u00a0ns from the remaining LHCII to PSI increases upon S1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S2 transition.

Many other purple phototrophs have monomeric core complexes and the basis for requiring dimeric cores is not fully established, so we analysed strains of Rba. sphaeroides that contain either native dimeric core complexes or altered monomeric cores harbouring a deletion of the first 12 residues from the N-terminus of PufX, which retains the PufX polypeptide but removes the major determinant of core complex dimerization. Membranes were purified from strains with dimeric or monomeric cores, and with either high or low levels of the LH2 complex. Samples were interrogated with absorption, steady-state fluorescence, and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence kinetic spectroscopies to reveal their light-harvesting and energy trapping properties. We find that under saturating excitation light intensity the photosynthetic membranes containing LH2 and monomeric core complexes have fluorescence lifetimes nearly twice that of membranes with LH2 plus dimeric core complexes. This trend of increased lifetime is maintained with RCs in the open state as well, and for two different levels of LH2 content. Thus, energy trapping is more efficient when photosynthetic membranes of Rba. sphaeroides consist of RC\u2013LH1\u2013PufX dimers and LH2 complexes.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol is attracting much interest because of its potential to decrease body weight and increase life span, influencing liver and muscle function by increasing mitochondrial mass and energy expenditure. Even though resveratrol was already shown to reduce the adipose tissue mass in animal models, its effects on mitochondrial mass and network structure in adipocytes have not yet been studied. For this purpose, we investigated the effect of resveratrol on mitochondrial mass increase and remodeling during adipogenic differentiation of two in vitro models of adipocyte biology, the murine 3T3-L1 cell line and the human SGBS cell strain. We confirm that resveratrol inhibits lipogenesis in differentiating adipocytes, both mouse and human. We further show that this is linked to inhibition of the normally observed mitochondrial mass increase and mitochondrial remodeling. At the molecular level, the anti-lipogenic effect of resveratrol seems to be mediated by a blunted expression increase and an inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). This is one of the consequences of an inhibited insulin-induced signaling via Akt, and maintained signaling via AMP-activated protein kinase. The anti-lipogenic effect of resveratrol is further modulated by expression levels of mitochondrial ATAD3, consistent with the emerging role of this protein as an important regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and lipogenesis. Our data suggest that resveratrol acts on differentiating preadipocytes by inhibiting insulin signaling, mitochondrial biogenesis, and lipogenesis, and that resveratrol-induced reduction of mitochondrial biogenesis and lipid storage contribute to adipose tissue weight loss in animals and humans.",

The method is discussed, and all published data obtained with this system are combined and analyzed as a single dataset. This meta-analysis led to the following results. 1) At equilibrium, the transmembrane \u0394pH is energetically equivalent to the transmembrane electric potential difference. 2) The standard free energy for ATP synthesis (reference reaction) is \u0394G\u00b0ref\u00a0=\u00a033.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0kJ/mol. 3) The thermodynamic H+/ATP ratio, as obtained from the shift of the ATP synthesis equilibrium induced by changing the transmembrane \u0394pH (varying either pHin or pHout) is 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1. The structural H+/ATP ratio, calculated from the ratio of proton binding sites on the c-subunit-ring in F0 to the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the \u03b2-subunits in F1, is c/\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a014/3\u00a0=\u00a04.7. We infer that the energy of 0.7 protons per ATP that flow through the enzyme, but do not contribute to shifting the ATP/(ADP\u00b7Pi) ratio, is used for additional processes within the enzyme, such as activation, and/or energy dissipation, due e.g. to internal uncoupling.

In this study, we used transgenic Arabidopsis plants with decreased glutathione reductase 2 (GR2) levels to investigate whether this GR2 activity protects the photosynthetic machinery under excess light. The transgenic plants were highly sensitive to excess light and accumulated high levels of H2O2. Photosystem II (PSII) activity was significantly decreased in transgenic plants. Flash-induced fluorescence relaxation and thermoluminescence measurements demonstrated inhibition of electron transfer between QA and QB and decreased redox potential of QB in transgenic plants. Immunoblot and blue native gel analysis showed that the levels of PSII proteins and PSII complexes were decreased in transgenic plants. Analyses of the repair of photodamaged PSII and in vivo pulse labeling of thylakoid proteins showed that the repair of photodamaged PSII is inhibited due to the inhibition of the synthesis of the D1 protein de novo in transgenic plants. Taken together, our results suggest that under excess light conditions, GR2 plays an important role in maintaining both the function of the acceptor side of PSII and the repair of photodamaged PSII by preventing the accumulation of H2O2. In addition, our results provide details of the role of H2O2 in vivo accumulation in photoinhibition in plants.",

Pre-steady-state kinetics of the reactions of BsFNR with NADP+, NADPH, NADPD (deuterated form) and B. subtilis ferredoxin (BsFd) using stopped-flow spectrophotometry were studied. Mixing BsFNR with NADP+ and NADPH yielded two types of charge-transfer (CT) complexes, oxidized FNR (FNRox)-NADPH and reduced FNR (FNRred)-NADP+, both having CT absorption bands centered at approximately 600\u00a0nm. After mixing BsFNRox with about a 10-fold molar excess of NADPH (forward reaction), BsFNR was almost completely reduced at equilibrium. When BsFNRred was mixed with NADP+, the amount of BsFNRox increased with increasing NADP+ concentration, but BsFNRred remained as the major species at equilibrium even with about 50-fold molar excess NADP+. In both directions, the hydride-transfer was the rate-determining step, where the forward direction rate constant (~\u00a0500\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) was much higher than the reverse one (<\u00a010\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01). Mixing BsFdred with BsFNRox induced rapid formation of a neutral semiquinone form. This process was almost completed within 1\u00a0ms. Subsequently the neutral semiquinone form was reduced to the hydroquinone form with an apparent rate constant of 50 to 70\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, which increased as BsFdred increased from 40 to 120\u00a0\u03bcM. The reduction rate of BsFNRox by BsFdred was markedly decreased by premixing BsFNRox with BsFdox, indicating that the dissociation of BsFdox from BsFNRsq is rate-limiting in the reaction.

The harvested light energy is funneled to reaction centers via two energy traps, allophycocyanin B and the core-membrane linker, ApcE1 (conventional ApcE). The covalently bound phycocyanobilin (PCB) of ApcE1 absorbs near 660\u00a0nm and fluoresces near 675\u00a0nm. In cyanobacteria capable of near infrared photoacclimation, such as Synechococcus sp. PCC7335, there exist even further spectrally red shifted components absorbing >\u00a0700\u00a0nm and fluorescing >\u00a0710\u00a0nm. We expressed the chromophore domain of the extra core-membrane linker from Synechococcus sp. PCC7335, ApcE2, in E. coli together with enzymes generating the chromophore, PCB.

The red shift of ~\u00a040\u00a0nm compared with canonical ApcE1 results from non-covalent binding of the chromophore by which its full conjugation length including the \u03943,31 double bond is preserved. The extreme spectral red-shift could not be ascribed to exciton coupling: dimeric PCB-ApcE2(1-273) and monomeric-ApcE2(24-245) absorbed and fluoresced similarly. Chromophorylation of ApcE2 with phycoerythrobilin- or phytochromobilin resulted in similar red shifts (absorption at 615 and 711\u00a0nm, fluorescence at 628 or 726\u00a0nm, respectively), compared to the covalently bound chromophores.

     "abstract": "Efficient energy transfer in the major light harvesting complex II (LHCII) of green plants is facilitated by the precise alignment of pigments due to the protein matrix they are bound to. Much is known about the import of the LHCII apoprotein into the chloroplast via the TOC/TIC system and its targeting to the thylakoid membrane but information is sparse about when and where the pigments are bound and how this is coordinated with protein folding. In vitro, the LHCII apoprotein spontaneously folds and binds its pigments if the detergent-solubilized protein is combined with a mixture of chlorophylls a and b and carotenoids. In the present work, we employed this approach to study apoprotein folding and pigment binding in a time-resolved manner by using pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Intra-molecular distances were measured before folding, after 255\u00a0ms and 40\u00a0s folding time in the absence of cryoprotectant, and in the fully folded and assembled LHCII. In accordance with earlier results, the most of the folding of the three membrane-spanning alpha helices precedes their apposition into the final tertiary structure. However, their formation follows different kinetics, partially extending into the final phase of LHCII formation during which much of the condensation of the pigment-protein structure occurs, presumably governed by the binding of chlorophyll b. A rough timetable is proposed to sort partial events into the LHCII formation process.",

It is bound to the cytoplasmic surface of this membrane protein complex where it greatly affects the efficiency of the linear photosynthetic electron flow although it is not directly involved in the electron transfer reactions.Despite the crystal structures of the b6f core complex, structural information for the transient regulatory b6f subunits is still missing. Here we present the first structure of PetP at atomic resolution as determined by solution NMR. The protein adopts an SH3 fold, which is a common protein motif in eukaryotes but comparatively rare in prokaryotes. The structure of PetP enabled the identification of the potential interaction site for b6f binding by conservation mapping. The interaction surface is mainly formed by two large loop regions and one short 310 helix which also exhibit an increased flexibility as indicated by heteronuclear steady-state {1H}\u201315N NOE and random coil index parameters. The properties of this potential b6f binding site greatly differ from the canonical peptide binding site which is highly conserved in eukaryotic SH3 domains. Interestingly, three other proteins of the photosynthetic electron transport chain share this SH3 fold with PetP: NdhS of the photosynthetic NADH dehydrogenase-like complex (NDH-1), PsaE of the photosystem 1 and subunit \u03b1 of the ferredoxin\u2013thioredoxin reductase have, similar to PetP, a great impact on the photosynthetic electron transport. Finally, a model is presented to illustrate how SH3 domains modulate the photosynthetic electron transport processes in cyanobacteria.",

     "abstract": "Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) plays a unique role in protecting many cyanobacteria from light-induced damage. The active form of OCP is directly involved in energy dissipation by binding to the phycobilisome (PBS), the major light-harvesting complex in cyanobacteria. There are two structural modules in OCP, an N-terminal domain (NTD), and a C-terminal domain (CTD), which play different functional roles during the OCP\u2013PBS quenching cycle. Because of the quasi-stable nature of active OCP, structural analysis of active OCP has been lacking compared to its inactive form. In this report, partial proteolysis was used to generate two structural domains, NTD and CTD, from active OCP. We used multiple native mass spectrometry (MS) based approaches to interrogate the structural features of the NTD and the CTD. Collisional activation and ion mobility analysis indicated that the NTD releases its bound carotenoid without forming any intermediates and the CTD is resistant to unfolding upon collisional energy ramping. The unfolding intermediates observed in inactive intact OCP suggest that it is the N-terminal extension and the NTD\u2013CTD loop that lead to the observed unfolding intermediates. These combined approaches extend the knowledge of OCP photo-activation and structural features of OCP functional domains. Combining native MS, ion mobility, and collisional activation promises to be a sensitive new approach for studies of photosynthetic protein-pigment complexes.",

Important details of its mechanism are not well understood. In order to understand the mechanism of water splitting, we perform here large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the active site of PSII in different oxidation, spin and ligand states. Prior to formation of the O-O bond, we find that all manganese atoms are oxidized to Mn(IV) in the S3 state, consistent with earlier studies. We find here, however, that the formation of the S3 state is coupled to the movement of a calcium-bound hydroxide (W3) from the Ca to a Mn (Mn1 or Mn4) in a process that is triggered by the formation of a tyrosyl radical (Tyr-161) and its protonated base, His-190. We find that subsequent oxidation and deprotonation of this hydroxide on Mn1 result in formation of an oxyl-radical that can exergonically couple with one of the oxo-bridges (O5), forming an O-O bond. When O2 leaves the active site, a second Ca-bound water molecule reorients to bridge the gap between the manganese ions Mn1 and Mn4, forming a new oxo-bridge for the next reaction cycle. Our findings are consistent with experimental data, and suggest that the calcium ion may control substrate water access to the water oxidation sites.",

The study includes inter-monomeric electron transfer; here we provide atomistic details of the reaction, and discuss the possible roles of inter-monomeric electronic communication in bc1 complex. Binding of natural ligands or inhibitors leads to local conformational changes which propagate through protein and control the conformation of key residues involved in the electron tunneling pathways. Aromatic\u2013aromatic interactions are highly utilized in the communication network since the key residues are aromatic in nature.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidases (CcOs) are the terminal enzymes of the respiratory chain in mitochondria and most bacteria. These enzymes reduce dioxygen (O2) to water and, simultaneously, generate a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient. Despite their importance in the aerobic metabolism and the large amount of structural and biochemical data available for the A1-type CcO family, there is still no consensually accepted description of the molecular mechanisms operating in this protein. A substantial number of questions about the CcO's working mechanism remain to be answered, including how the protonation behavior of some key residues is modulated during a reduction cycle and how is the conformation of the protein affected by protonation.The main objective of this work was to study the protonation\u2013conformation coupling in CcOs and identify the molecular factors that control the protonation state of some key residues. In order to directly capture the interplay between protonation and conformational effects, we have performed constant-pH MD simulations of an A1-type CcO inserted into a lipid bilayer in two redox states (oxidized and reduced) at physiological pH. From the simulations, we were able to identify several groups with unusual titration behavior that are highly dependent on the protein redox state, including the A-propionate from heme a and the D-propionate from heme a3, two key groups possibly involved in proton pumping. The protonation state of these two groups is heavily influenced by subtle conformational changes in the protein (notably of R481I and R482I) and by small changes in the hydrogen bond network.",

     "abstract": "The ADP/ATP carrier (AAC) of mitochondria has been an early example for elucidating the transport mechanism alternating between the external (c-) and internal (m-) states (M. Klingenberg, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1778 (2008) 1978\u20132021). An atomic resolution crystal structure of AAC is available only for the c-state featuring a three repeat transmembrane domain structure. Modeling of transport mechanism remained hypothetical for want of an atomic structure of the m-state. Previous molecular dynamics studies simulated the binding of ADP or ATP to the AAC remaining in the c-state. Here, a full description of the AAC switching from the c- to the m-state is reported using well-tempered metadynamics simulations. Free-energy landscapes of the entire translocation from the c- to the m-state, based on the gyration radii of the c- and m-gates and of the center of mass, were generated. The simulations revealed three free-energy basins attributed to the c-, intermediate- and m-states separated by activation barriers. These simulations were performed with the empty and with the ADP- and ATP-loaded AAC as well as with the poorly transported AMP and guanine nucleotides, showing in the free energy landscapes that ADP and ATP lowered the activation free-energy barriers more than the other substrates. Upon binding AMP and guanine nucleotides a deeper free-energy level stabilized the intermediate-state of the AAC2 hampering the transition to the m-state. The structures of the substrate binding sites in the different states are described producing a full picture of the translocation events in the AAC.",

     "abstract": "Phosphorescence measurements at 77 K and light-induced FTIR difference spectroscopy at 95 K were applied to study of the triplet state of chlorophyll a (3Chl) in photosystem II (PSII) core complexes isolated from spinach. Using both methods, 3Chl was observed in the core preparations with doubly reduced primary quinone acceptor QA. The spectral parameters of Chl phosphorescence resemble those in the isolated PSII reaction centers (RCs). The main spectral maximum and the lifetime of the phosphorescence corresponded to 955\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nm and of 1.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0ms respectively; in the excitation spectrum, the absorption maxima of all core complex pigments (Chl, pheophytin a (Pheo), and \u03b2-carotene) were observed. The differential signal at 1667(\u2212)/1628(+)\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 reflecting a downshift of the stretching frequency of the 131-keto C=O group of Chl was found to dominate in the triplet-minus-singlet FTIR difference spectrum of core complexes. Based on FTIR results and literature data, it is proposed that 3Chl is mostly localized on the accessory chlorophyll that is in triplet equilibrium with P680. Analysis of the data suggests that the Chl triplet state responsible for the phosphorescence and the FTIR difference spectrum is mainly generated due to charge recombination in the reaction center radical pair P680+\u00a0PheoD1\u2212, and the energy and temporal parameters of this triplet state as well as the molecular environment and interactions of the triplet-bearing Chl molecule are similar in the PSII core complexes and isolated PSII RCs.",

     "abstract": "Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase (SOD1), the most important antioxidant defense against ROS in eukaryotic cells, localizes in cytosol and intermembrane space of mitochondria (IMS). Several evidences show a SOD1 intersection with both fermentative and respiratory metabolism. The Voltage Dependent Anion Channel (VDAC) is the main pore-forming protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), and is considered the gatekeeper of mitochondrial metabolism. Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking VDAC1 (\u0394por1) is a very convenient model system, since it shows an impaired growth rate on non-fermentable carbon source. Transformation of \u0394por1 yeast with human SOD1 completely restores the cell growth deficit in non-fermentative conditions and re-establishes the physiological levels of ROS, as well as the mitochondrial membrane potential. No similar result was found upon yeast SOD1 overexpression. A previous report highlighted the action of SOD1 as a transcription factor. Quantitative Real-Time PCR showed that \u03b2-barrel outer-membrane encoding-genes por2, tom40, sam50 are induced by hSOD1, but the same effect was not obtained in \u0394por1\u0394por2 yeast, indicating a crucial function for yVDAC2. Since the lack of VDAC1 in yeast can be considered a stress factor for the cell, hSOD1 could relieve it stimulating the expression of genes bringing to the recovery of the MOM function. Our results suggest a direct influence of SOD1 on VDAC.",

Photosystem I (PSI) formed under such conditions is fully active, but photosystem II (PSII) is present in its latent form with inactive oxygen evolving complex (OEC). In this work we have studied light-induced gradual changes in PSII function in dark-grown cotyledons of Norway spruce (Picea abies) via the measurement of chlorophyll a fluorescence rise, absorption changes at 830\u00a0nm, thermoluminescence glow curves (TL) and protein analysis. The results indicate that in dark-grown cotyledons, alternative reductants were able to act as electron donors to PSII with inactive OEC. Illumination of cotyledons for 5\u00a0min led to partial activation of PSII, which was accompanied by detectable oxygen evolution, but still a substantial number of PSII centers remained in the so called PSII-QB-non-reducing form. Interestingly, even 24\u00a0h long illumination was not sufficient for the full activation of PSII centers. This was evidenced by a weak attachment of PsbP protein and the absence of PsbQ protein in PSII particles, the absence of PSII supercomplexes, the suboptimal maximum yield of PSII photochemistry, the presence of C band in TL curve and also the presence of up-shifted Q band in TL in DCMU-treated cotyledons. This slow light-induced activation of PSII in dark-grown cotyledons could contribute to the prevention of PSII overexcitation before the light-induced increase in PSI/PSII ratio allows effective operation of linear electron flow.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism is important for sustaining cellular growth and maintenance; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying individual processes in plant mitochondria remain largely uncharacterized. Previous redox-proteomics studies have suggested that mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (mMDH), a key enzyme in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and redox shuttling, is under thiol-based redox regulation as a target candidate of thioredoxin (Trx). In addition, the adenine nucleotide status may be another factor controlling mitochondrial metabolism, as respiratory ATP production in mitochondria is believed to be influenced by several environmental stimuli. Using biochemical and reverse-genetic approaches, we addressed the redox- and adenine nucleotide-dependent regulation of mMDH in Arabidopsis thaliana. Recombinant mMDH protein formed intramolecular disulfide bonds under oxidative conditions, but these bonds did not have a considerable effect on mMDH activity. Mitochondria-localized o-type Trx (Trx-o) did not facilitate re-reduction of oxidized mMDH. Determination of the in vivo redox state revealed that mMDH was stably present in the reduced form even in Trx-o-deficient plants. Accordingly, we concluded that mMDH is not in the class of redox-regulated enzymes. By contrast, mMDH activity was lowered by adenine nucleotides (AMP, ADP, and ATP). Each adenine nucleotide suppressed mMDH activity with different potencies and ATP exerted the largest inhibitory effect with a significantly lower Ki. Correspondingly, mMDH activity was inhibited by the increase in ATP/ADP ratio within the physiological range. These results suggest that mMDH activity is finely controlled in response to variations in mitochondrial adenine nucleotide balance.",

The slow temporarily increasing post-pulse phase was recorded, when ATP synthase was inactivated in the dark and plastoquinol (PQH2) oxidation was initiated by a short pulse of far-red light (FRL). During illumination by red light, the Q-cycle-supported proton arrival at the lumen and departure via ATP synthase were simultaneous, precluding extreme build-up of the membrane potential. To investigate the kinetics of the Q-cycle, less than one PQH2 per cytochrome b6f (Cyt b6f) were reduced by illuminating the leaf with strong light pulses or single-turnover Xe flashes. The post-pulse rate of oxidation of these PQH2 molecules was recorded via the rate of reduction of plastocyanin (PC+) and P700+, monitored at 810 and 950\u00a0nm.

As yeast cells lack orthologues of the mammalian proteins, the yeast expression system for the mammalian calcium uniporter subunits is useful for investigating their functions. We here established a yeast expression system for the native-form mouse MCU and 4 other subunits. This expression system enabled us to precisely reconstitute the properties of the mammalian MCU complex in yeast mitochondria. Using this expression system, we analyzed the essential MCU regulator (EMRE), which is a key subunit for Ca2\u00a0+ uptake but whose functions and structure remain unclear. The topology of EMRE was revealed: its N- and C-termini projected into the matrix and the inter membrane space, respectively. The expression of EMRE alone was insufficient for Ca2\u00a0+ uptake; and co-expression of MCU with EMRE was necessary. EMRE was independent of the protein levels of other subunits, indicating that EMRE was not a protein-stabilizing factor. Deletion of acidic amino acids conserved in EMRE did not significantly affect Ca2\u00a0+ uptake; thus, EMRE did not have basic properties of ion channels such as ion-selectivity filtration and ion concentration. Meanwhile, EMRE closely interacted with the MCU on both sides of the inner membrane, and this interaction was essential for Ca2\u00a0+ uptake. This close interaction suggested that EMRE might be a structural factor for opening of the MCU-forming pore.",

Four decades ago, measurements of flash-induced oxygen evolution have shown that the OEC steps through oxidation states S0, S1, S2, S3 and S4 before O2 is released and the S0 state is reformed. The light-induced transitions between these states involve misses and double hits. While it is widely accepted that the miss parameter is S state dependent and may be further modulated by the oxidation state of the acceptor side, the traditional way of analyzing each flash-induced oxygen evolution pattern (FIOP) individually did not allow using enough free parameters to thoroughly test this proposal. Furthermore, this approach does not allow assessing whether the presently known recombination processes in photosystem II fully explain all measured oxygen yields during Si state lifetime measurements. Here we present a global fit program that simultaneously fits all flash-induced oxygen yields of a standard FIOP (2\u00a0Hz flash frequency) and of 11\u201318 FIOPs each obtained while probing the S0, S2 and S3 state lifetimes in spinach thylakoids at neutral pH.

     "abstract": "The accumulated results of thirty years of rational and computational de novo protein design have taught us important lessons about the stability, information content, and evolution of natural proteins. First, de novo protein design has complicated the assertion that biological function is equivalent to biological structure \u2014 demonstrating the capacity to abstract active sites from natural contexts and paste them into non-native topologies without loss of function. The structure\u2013function relationship has thus been revealed to be either a generality or strictly true only in a local sense. Second, the simplification to \u201cmaquette\u201d topologies carried out by rational protein design also has demonstrated that even sophisticated functions such as conformational switching, cooperative ligand binding, and light-activated electron transfer can be achieved with low-information design approaches. This is because for simple topologies the functional footprint in sequence space is enormous and easily exceeds the number of structures which could have possibly existed in the history of life on Earth. Finally, the pervasiveness of extraordinary stability in designed proteins challenges accepted models for the \u201cmarginal stability\u201d of natural proteins, suggesting that there must be a selection pressure against highly stable proteins. This can be explained using recent theories which relate non-equilibrium thermodynamics and self-replication.

     "abstract": "Central to the design of an efficient de novo enzyme is a robust yet mutable protein scaffold. The maquette approach to protein design offers precisely this, employing simple four-\u03b1-helix bundle scaffolds devoid of evolutionary complexity and with proven tolerance towards iterative protein engineering. We recently described the design of C2, a de novo designed c-type cytochrome maquette that undergoes post-translational modification in E. coli to covalently graft heme onto the protein backbone in vivo. This de novo cytochrome is capable of reversible oxygen binding, an obligate step in the catalytic cycle of many oxygen-activating oxidoreductases. Here we demonstrate the flexibility of both the maquette platform and the post-translational machinery of E. coli by creating a suite of functional de novo designed c-type cytochromes. We explore the engineering tolerances of the maquette by selecting alternative binding sites for heme C attachment and creating di-heme maquettes either by appending an additional heme C binding motif to the maquette scaffold or by binding heme B through simple bis-histidine ligation to a second binding site. The new designs retain the essential properties of the parent design but with significant improvements in structural stability.

Here we focus on water-soluble maquettes designed and engineered to perform diffusive electron transport of the kind typically carried out by cytochromes, ferredoxins and flavodoxins and other small proteins in photosynthetic and respiratory energy conversion and oxido-reductive metabolism. Our designs were tested by analysis of electron transfer between heme maquettes and the well-known natural electron transporter, cytochrome c. Electron-transfer kinetics were measured from seconds to milliseconds by stopped-flow, while sub-millisecond resolution was achieved through laser photolysis of the carbon monoxide maquette heme complex. These measurements demonstrate electron transfer from the maquette to cytochrome c, reproducing the timescales and charge complementarity modulation observed in natural systems.

The ET activity of Cu\u03b13D\u2013CH3 was determined using five different photosensitizers. By exhibiting a complete depletion of the photo-oxidant and the successive formation of a Cu(II) species at 400\u00a0nm, the transient and generated spectra demonstrated an ET transfer reaction between the photo-oxidant and Cu(I)\u03b13D-CH3. This observation illustrated our success in integrating an ET center within a de novo designed scaffold. From the kinetic traces at 400\u00a0nm, first-order and bimolecular rate constants of 105\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and 108\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 were derived.

The nitrogenase FeMoCO cluster converts di-nitrogen to ammonia in an eight-electron transfer step. The 2(Fe4S4) containing bacterial ferredoxin is an evolutionarily ancient metalloprotein fold and is thought to be a primordial progenitor of extant oxidoreductases. Controlling chemical transformations mediated by iron-sulfur centers such as nitrogen fixation, hydrogen production as well as electron transfer reactions involved in photosynthesis are of tremendous importance for sustainable chemistry and energy production initiatives. As such, there is significant interest in the design of iron-sulfur proteins as minimal models to gain fundamental understanding of complex natural systems and as lead-molecules for industrial and energy applications. Herein, we discuss salient structural characteristics of natural iron-sulfur proteins and how they guide principles for design.

     "abstract": "A compelling target for the design of electron transfer proteins with novel cofactors is to create a model for the oxygen-evolving complex, a Mn4Ca cluster, of photosystem II. A mononuclear Mn cofactor can be added to the bacterial reaction center, but the addition of multiple metal centers is constrained by the native protein architecture. Alternatively, metal centers can be incorporated into artificial proteins. Designs for the addition of dinuclear metal centers to four-helix bundles resulted in three artificial proteins with ligands for one, two, or three dinuclear metal centers able to bind Mn. The three-dimensional structure determined by X-ray crystallography of one of the Mn-proteins confirmed the design features and revealed details concerning coordination of the Mn center. Electron transfer between these artificial Mn-proteins and bacterial reaction centers was investigated using optical spectroscopy. After formation of a light-induced, charge-separated state, the experiments showed that the Mn-proteins can donate an electron to the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer of modified reaction centers, with the Mn-proteins having additional metal centers being more effective at this electron transfer reaction. Modeling of the structure of the Mn-protein docked to the reaction center showed that the artificial protein likely binds on the periplasmic surface similarly to cytochrome c2, the natural secondary donor. Combining reaction centers with exogenous artificial proteins provides the opportunity to create ligands and investigate the influence of inhomogeneous protein environments on multinuclear redox-active metal centers.

     "abstract": "Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (SDSL EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool to determine solvent accessibility, side-chain dynamics, and inter-spin distances at specific sites in biological macromolecules. This information provides important insights into the structure and dynamics of both natural and designed proteins and protein complexes. Here, we discuss the application of SDSL EPR spectroscopy in probing the charge-transfer cofactors in photosynthetic reaction centers (RC) such as photosystem I (PSI) and the bacterial reaction center (bRC). Photosynthetic RCs are large multi-subunit proteins (molecular weight\u00a0\u2265\u00a0300\u00a0kDa) that perform light-driven charge transfer reactions in photosynthesis. These reactions are carried out by cofactors that are paramagnetic in one of their oxidation states. This renders the RCs unsuitable for conventional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigations. However, the presence of native paramagnetic centers and the ability to covalently attach site-directed spin labels in RCs makes them ideally suited for the application of SDSL EPR spectroscopy. The paramagnetic centers serve as probes of conformational changes, dynamics of subunit assembly, and the relative motion of cofactors and peptide subunits. In this review, we describe novel applications of SDSL EPR spectroscopy for elucidating the effects of local structure and dynamics on the electron-transfer cofactors of photosynthetic RCs. Because SDSL EPR Spectroscopy is uniquely suited to provide dynamic information on protein motion, it is a particularly useful method in the engineering and analysis of designed electron transfer proteins and protein networks.

     "abstract": "Redox potentials are a major contributor in controlling the electron transfer (ET) rates and thus regulating the ET processes in the bioenergetics. To maximize the efficiency of the ET process, one needs to master the art of tuning the redox potential, especially in metalloproteins, as they represent major classes of ET proteins. In this review, we first describe the importance of tuning the redox potential of ET centers and its role in regulating the ET in bioenergetic processes including photosynthesis and respiration. The main focus of this review is to summarize recent work in designing the ET centers, namely cupredoxins, cytochromes, and iron\u2013sulfur proteins, and examples in design of protein networks involved these ET centers. We then discuss the factors that affect redox potentials of these ET centers including metal ion, the ligands to metal center and interactions beyond the primary ligand, especially non-covalent secondary coordination sphere interactions. We provide examples of strategies to fine-tune the redox potential using both natural and unnatural amino acids and native and nonnative cofactors. Several case studies are used to illustrate recent successes in this area. Outlooks for future endeavors are also provided.

     "abstract": "Myoglobin reconstitution with various synthetic heme analogues was reviewed to follow the consequences of modified heme\u2013globin interactions. Utility of dimethyl sulfoxide as the solvent for water-insoluble hemes was emphasized.Proton NMR spectroscopy revealed that loose heme\u2013globin contacts in the heme pocket eventually caused the dynamic heme rotation around the iron\u2013histidine bond. The full rotational rate was estimated to be about 1400\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at room temperature for 1,4,5,8-tetramethylhemin. The X-ray analysis of the myoglobin containing iron porphine, the smallest heme without any side chains, showed that the original globin fold was well conserved despite the serious disruption of native heme\u2013globin contacts. Comparison between the two myoglobins with static and rotatory prosthetic groups indicated that the oxygen and carbon monoxide binding profiles were almost unaffected by the heme motion. On the other hand, altered tetrapyrrole array of porphyrin dramatically changed the dissociation constant of oxygen from 0.0005\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg of porphycene-myoglobin to \u221e in oxypyriporphyrin-myoglobin.Heme\u2013globin interactions in myoglobin were also monitored with circular dichroism spectroscopy. The observation on several reconstituted protein revealed an unrecognized role of the propionate groups in protoheme. Shortening of heme 6,7-propionates to carboxylates resulted in almost complete disappearance of the positive circular dichroism band in the Soret region. The theoretical analysis suggested that the disappeared circular dichroism band reflected the cancellation effects between different conformers of the carboxyl groups directly attached to heme periphery. The above techniques were proposed to be applicable to other hemoproteins to create new biocatalysts.

     "abstract": "The unique photochemical properties of Ru(II)-diimine complexes have helped initiate a series of seminal electron transfer studies in metalloenzymes. It has thus been possible to experimentally determine rate constants for long-range electron transfers. These studies have laid the foundation for the investigation of reactive intermediates in heme proteins and for the design of light-activated biocatalysts. Various metalloenzymes such as hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, nitrogenase, laccase and cytochrome P450 BM3 have been functionalized with Ru(II)-diimine complexes. Upon visible light-excitation, these photosensitized metalloproteins are capable of sustaining photocatalytic activity to reduce small molecules such as protons, acetylene, hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide or activate molecular dioxygen to produce hydroxylated products. The Ru(II)-diimine photosensitizers are hence able to deliver multiple electrons to metalloenzymes buried active sites, circumventing the need for the natural redox partners.

Further, the activity of wild type Co-cyt b562 can be modulated by a factor of 2.5 by exchanging the coordinating methionine with alanine or aspartic acid. The observed turnover numbers (TON) range between 125 and 305, and correlate well with the redox potential of the Co-cyt b562 mutants. The photosensitized system catalyzes proton reduction with high efficiency even under an aerobic atmosphere, implicating its use for biotechnological applications.

In this study we demonstrate a scaffold design utilizing carbon nanotubes, deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA) and a specific DNA binding transcription factor that allows for directed immobilization of a single enzyme.Functionalized carbon nanotubes were covalently bonded to a diazonium salt modified gold surface through carbodiimide chemistry creating a brush-type nanotube alignment. The aligned nanotubes created a highly ordered structure with high surface area that allowed for the attachment of a protein assembly through a designed DNA scaffold. The enzyme immobilization was controlled by a zinc finger (ZNF) protein domain that binds to a specific dsDNA sequence. ZNF 268 was genetically fused to the small laccase (SLAC) from Streptomyces coelicolor, an enzyme belonging to the family of multi-copper oxidases, and used to demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach.

     "abstract": "The enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation is a striking example of the functional association of multiple enzyme complexes, working together to form ATP from cellular reducing equivalents. These complexes, such as cytochrome c oxidase or the ATP synthase, are typically investigated individually and therefore, their functional interplay is not well understood. Here, we present methodology that allows the co-reconstitution of purified terminal oxidases and ATP synthases in synthetic liposomes. The enzymes are functionally coupled via proton translocation where upon addition of reducing equivalents the oxidase creates and maintains a transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient that energizes the synthesis of ATP by the F1F0 ATP synthase. The method has been tested with the ATP synthases from Escherichia coli and spinach chloroplasts, and with the quinol and cytochrome c oxidases from E. coli and Rhodobacter sphaeroides, respectively. Unlike in experiments with the ATP synthase reconstituted alone, the setup allows in vitro ATP synthesis under steady state conditions, with rates up to 90 ATP\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0enzyme\u2212\u00a01.

To prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis, subunit \u03b5 in bacterial ATP synthases changes its conformation from the non-inhibitory down- to the inhibitory up-state at a low cellular ATP concentration. Recently, a crystal structure of the \u03b5 subunit in complex with ATP was solved in a non-biologically relevant dimeric form. Here, to derive the functional ATP binding site motif, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. Our results suggest that the ATP binding site markedly differs from the experimental resolved one; we observe a reorientation of several residues, which bind to ATP in the crystal structure. In addition we find that an Mg2+ ion is coordinated by ATP, replacing interactions of the second chain in the crystal structure. Thus we demonstrate more generally the influence of crystallization effects on ligand binding sites and their respective binding modes. Furthermore, we propose a role for two highly conserved residues to control the ATP binding/unbinding event, which have not been considered before.

The combined study of the two complexes facilitated interpretation of a rather complicated relaxation observed in the intrinsic complex. While a single carotenoid triplet state was resolved in the peridinin\u2013chlorophyll protein complex, evidence of at least two different carotenoid triplets was obtained for the intrinsic light-harvesting complex. Most probably, each of these carotenoids protects different chlorophylls. In both complexes the quenching of the chlorophyll triplet states by carotenoids occurs with a very high efficiency (~\u00a0100%), and with transfer times estimated to be in the order of 0.1\u00a0ns or even faster. The triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer is thus much faster than formation of the chlorophyll triplet states by intersystem crossing. Since the triplet states of chlorophylls are formed during the whole lifetime of their singlet states, the apparent lifetimes of both states are the same, and observed to be equal to the carotenoid triplet state rise time (~\u00a05\u00a0ns).",

All these effects of sAC inhibition are prevented by the addition of the membrane-permeant 8-Br-cAMP.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial F1FO-ATP synthase of chlorophycean algae is dimeric. It contains eight orthodox subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, OSCP, a and c) and nine atypical subunits (Asa1 to 9). These subunits build the peripheral stalk of the enzyme and stabilize its dimeric structure. The location of the 66.1\u00a0kDa subunit Asa1 has been debated. On one hand, it was found in a transient subcomplex that contained membrane-bound subunits Asa1/Asa3/Asa5/Asa8/a (Atp6)/c (Atp9). On the other hand, Asa1 was proposed to form the bulky structure of the peripheral stalk that contacts the OSCP subunit in the F1 sector. Here, we overexpressed and purified the recombinant proteins Asa1 and OSCP and explored their interactions in vitro, using immunochemical techniques and affinity chromatography. Asa1 and OSCP interact strongly, and the carboxy-terminal half of OSCP seems to be instrumental for this association. In addition, the algal ATP synthase was partially dissociated at relatively high detergent concentrations, and an Asa1/Asa3/Asa5/Asa8/a/c10 subcomplex was identified. Furthermore, Far-Western analysis suggests an Asa1\u2013Asa8 interaction. Based on these results, a model is proposed in which Asa1 spans the whole peripheral arm of the enzyme, from a region close to the matrix-exposed side of the mitochondrial inner membrane to the F1 region where OSCP is located. 3D models show elongated, helix-rich structures for chlorophycean Asa1 subunits. Asa1 subunit probably plays a scaffolding role in the peripheral stalk analogous to the one of subunit b in orthodox mitochondrial enzymes.",

VCP binds carotenoids violaxanthin (Vio), vaucheriaxanthin (Vau), and vaucheriaxanthin-ester (Vau-ester). Here we report on energy transfer pathways in the VCP complex. The overall carotenoid-to-Chla energy transfer has efficiency over 90%. Based on their energy transfer properties, the carotenoids in VCP can be divided into two groups; blue carotenoids with the lowest energy absorption band around 480\u00a0nm and red carotenoids with absorption extended up to 530\u00a0nm. Both carotenoid groups transfer energy efficiently from their S2 states, reaching efficiencies of ~\u00a070% (blue) and ~\u00a060% (red). The S1 pathway, however, is efficient only for the red carotenoid pool for which two S1 routes characterized by 0.33 and 2.4\u00a0ps time constants were identified. For the blue carotenoids the S1-mediated pathway is represented only by a minor route likely involving a hot S1 state. The relaxed S1 state of blue carotenoids decays to the ground state within 21\u00a0ps. Presence of a fraction of non-transferring red carotenoids with the S1 lifetime of 13\u00a0ps indicates some specific carotenoid-protein interaction that must shorten the intrinsic S1 lifetime of Vio and/or Vau whose S1 lifetimes in methanol are 26 and 29\u00a0ps, respectively. The VCP complex from N. oceanica is the first example of a light-harvesting complex binding only non-carbonyl carotenoids with carotenoid-to-chlorophyll energy transfer efficiency over 90%.",

The physiological electron donor for AprAB is proposed to be the QmoABC membrane complex, coupling the quinone-pool to sulfate reduction.

In this work we demonstrate for the first time direct electron transfer between the Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774 QmoABC complex and AprAB. Cyclic voltammetry conducted with the modified Qmo electrode and AprAB in the electrolyte solution presented the Qmo electrochemical signature with two additional well-defined one electron redox processes, attributed to the AprAB FAD redox behavior. Moreover, experiments performed under catalytic conditions using the QmoABC modified electrode, with AprAB and APS in solution, show a catalytic current peak develop in the cathodic wave, attributed to substrate reduction, and which is not observed in the absence of QmoABC. Substrate dependence conducted with different electrode preparations (with and without immobilized Qmo) demonstrated that the QmoABC complex is essential for efficient electron delivery to AprAB, in order to sustain catalysis.

Here we replace each of these two residues by aspartate, in order to mimic phosphorylation, and report the structural and functional changes in the resulting cytochrome c variants. We find that the T28D mutant causes a 30-mV decrease on the midpoint redox potential and lowers the affinity for the distal site of Arabidopsis thaliana cytochrome c1 in complex III. Both the T28D and S47D variants display a higher efficiency as electron donors for the cytochrome c oxidase activity of complex IV. In both protein mutants, the peroxidase activity is significantly higher, which is related to the ability of cytochrome c to leave the mitochondria and reach the cytoplasm.

The SCP mutant cells were larger in size, showed irregular thylakoid structure and differed in cell-surface morphology. Deletion of scp genes strongly affected the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance, resulting in accumulation of carbohydrates and a decrease in N-rich compounds (proteins and chlorophyll). Data from transcriptomic and metabolomic experiments revealed a role of SCPs in the control of chlorophyll biosynthesis. Additionally, SCPs diminished formation of reactive oxygen species, thereby preventing damage within Photosystem II. We conclude that the lack of SCP-function to remove free chlorophyll under stress conditions has a large impact on the metabolism of the entire cell.",

These unique complexes are a good natural system to investigate the thermally activated energy transfer process, with the donor energies different while the other factors (such as the acceptor energy, special pair at 890\u00a0nm, and the distance/relative orientation between the donor and acceptor) remain the same.

Speract is a decapeptide from the outer jelly layer of the Strongylocentrotus purpuratus egg that upon binding to its receptor in the sperm, stimulates sperm motility, respiration and ion fluxes, among other physiological events. Altering the sea urchin sperm mitochondrial function with specific inhibitors of this organelle, increases [Ca2\u00a0+]i in an external Ca2\u00a0+ concentration ([Ca2\u00a0+]ext)-dependent manner (Ard\u00f3n, et al., 2009.

To further understand the interrelationship between the mitochondrion and the speract responses, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) and NADH levels. We found that the stimulation of sperm with speract depolarizes the mitochondrion and increases the levels of NADH. Surprisingly, these responses are independent of external Ca2\u00a0+ and are due to the increase in intracellular pH (pHi) induced by speract. Our findings indicate that speract, by regulating pHi, in addition to [Ca2\u00a0+]i, may finely modulate mitochondrial metabolism to control motility and ensure that sperm reach the egg and fertilize it.",

As electronic properties of chromophores are altered by such differences, a conformational effect may influence the site-energies of specific pigments and thus play a role in mediating the excitation energy transfer dynamics, but this has not yet been established. The difficulty of assessing this question is shown to be partly the result of the inability of the sequential truncation approach usually employed to account for interactions between the conformations of the macrocycle and its substituents and an alternative approach is suggested. By assigning the BChl atoms to meaningful atom groups and performing all possible permutations of partial optimizations in a full-factorial design, where each group is either frozen in the crystal geometry or optimized in vacuo, followed by excited state calculations on each resulting structure (PM6//ZIndo/S), the specific effects of the conformations of each BChl component as well as mutual interactions between the molecular fragments on the site-energy can be delineated. This factorial relaxation procedure gives different estimates of the macrocycle conformational perturbation than the approach of sequentially truncating the BChl periphery.

Most data focusing on implication of CL content and mitochondrial bioenergetics were performed in yeast or in cellular models of Barth syndrome. Previous work reported that increase in CL content leads to decrease in liver mitochondrial ATP synthesis yield. Therefore the aim of this study was to determine the effects of moderate decrease in CL content on mitochondrial bioenergetics in human hepatocytes. For this purpose, we generated a cardiolipin synthase knockdown (shCLS) in HepaRG hepatoma cells showing bioenergetics features similar to primary human hepatocytes. shCLS cells exhibited a 55% reduction in CLS gene and a 40% decrease in protein expression resulting in a 45% lower content in CL compared to control (shCTL) cells. Oxygen consumption was significantly reduced in shCLS cells compared to shCTL regardless of substrate used and energy state analyzed. Mitochondrial low molecular weight supercomplex content was higher in shCLS cells (+\u00a060%) compared to shCTL. Significant fragmentation of the mitochondrial network was observed in shCLS cells compared to shCTL cells. Surprisingly, mitochondrial ATP synthesis was unchanged in shCLS compared to shCTL cells but exhibited a higher ATP:O ratio (+\u00a046%) in shCLS cells. Our results suggest that lowered respiratory chain activity induced by moderate reduction in CL content may be due to both destabilization of supercomplexes and mitochondrial network fragmentation.

Kinetic modelling of the time-resolved fluorescence data revealed the existence of separate pools of LHCII distinguished by the time scale of energy transfer. A strongly coupled pool, equivalent to one LHCII trimer per PSI, transferred excitations to PSI with near-unity efficiency on a time scale of less than 10\u00a0ps but extra LHCIIs also contributed significantly to the effective antenna size of PSI, which could be increased by up to 47% in membranes containing 3 LHCII trimers per PSI. The results demonstrate a remarkable competence of LHCII to increase the absorption cross-section of PSI, given the opportunity that the two types of complexes interact in the membrane.",

     "abstract": "For Vibrio cholerae, the coordinated import and export of Na+ is crucial for adaptation to habitats with different osmolarities. We investigated the Na+-extruding branch of the sodium cycle in this human pathogen by in vivo 23Na-NMR spectroscopy. The Na+ extrusion activity of cells was monitored after adding glucose which stimulated respiration via the Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR). In a V. cholerae deletion mutant devoid of the Na+-NQR encoding genes (nqrA-F), rates of respiratory Na+ extrusion were decreased by a factor of four, but the cytoplasmic Na+ concentration was essentially unchanged. Furthermore, the mutant was impaired in formation of transmembrane voltage (\u0394\u03a8, inside negative) and did not grow under hypoosmotic conditions at pH\u00a08.2 or above. This growth defect could be complemented by transformation with the plasmid encoded nqr operon. In an alkaline environment, Na+/H+ antiporters acidify the cytoplasm at the expense of the transmembrane voltage. It is proposed that, at alkaline pH and limiting Na+ concentrations, the Na+-NQR is crucial for generation of a transmembrane voltage to drive the import of H+ by electrogenic Na+/H+ antiporters. Our study provides the basis to understand the role of the Na+-NQR in pathogenicity of V. cholerae and other pathogens relying on this primary Na+ pump for respiration.",

     "abstract": "Aerobic respiratory chains from all life kingdoms are composed by several complexes that have been deeply characterized in their isolated form. These membranous complexes link the oxidation of reducing substrates to the reduction of molecular oxygen, in a process that conserves energy by ion translocation between both sides of the mitochondrial or prokaryotic cytoplasmatic membranes. In recent years there has been increasing evidence that those complexes are organized as supramolecular structures, the so-called supercomplexes and respirasomes, being available for eukaryotes strong data namely obtained by electron microscopy and single particle analysis. A parallel study has been developed for prokaryotes, based on blue native gels and mass spectrometry analysis, showing that in these more simple unicellular organisms such supercomplexes also exist, involving not only typical aerobic-respiration associated complexes, but also anaerobic-linked enzymes. After a short overview of the data on eukaryotic supercomplexes, we will analyse comprehensively the different types of prokaryotic aerobic respiratory supercomplexes that have been thus far suggested, in both bacteria and archaea.

     "abstract": "Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is an essential process for most living organisms mostly sustained by protein complexes embedded in the cell membrane. In order to thrive, cells need to quickly respond to changes in the metabolic demand or in their environment. An overview of the strategies that can be employed by bacterial cells to adjust the OXPHOS outcome is provided. Regulation at the level of gene expression can only provide a means to adjust the OXPHOS outcome to long-term trends in the environment. In addition, the actual view is that bioenergetic membranes are highly compartmentalized structures. This review discusses what is known about the spatial organization of OXPHOS complexes and the timescales at which they occur. As exemplified with the commensal gut bacterium Escherichia coli, three levels of spatial organization are at play: supercomplexes, membrane microdomains and polar assemblies. This review provides a particular focus on whether dynamic spatial organization can fine-tune the OXPHOS through the definition of specialized functional membrane microdomains. Putative mechanisms responsible for spatio-temporal regulation of the OXPHOS complexes are discussed.

The Escherichia coli complex I is made up of 13 different subunits encoded by the so-called nuo-genes. The electron transfer is catalyzed by nine cofactors, a flavin mononucleotide and eight iron\u2013sulfur (Fe/S)-clusters. The individual subunits and the cofactors have to be assembled together in a coordinated way to guarantee the biogenesis of the active holoenzyme. Only little is known about the assembly of the bacterial complex compared to the mitochondrial one. Due to the presence of so many Fe/S-clusters the assembly of complex I is intimately connected with the systems responsible for the biogenesis of these clusters. In addition, a few other proteins have been reported to be required for an effective assembly of the complex in other bacteria. The proposed role of known bacterial assembly factors is discussed and the information from other bacterial species is used in this review to draw an as complete as possible model of bacterial complex I assembly.

     "abstract": "The purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides provides a useful model system for studies of the assembly and dynamics of bacterial photosynthetic membranes. For the nascent developing membrane, proteomic analyses showed an ~\u00a02-fold enrichment in general membrane assembly factors, compared to chromatophores. When the protonophore carbonyl-cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) was added to an ICM inducing culture, an ~\u00a02-fold elevation in spectral counts vs. the control was seen for the SecA translocation ATPase, the preprotein translocase SecY, SecD and SecF insertion components, and chaperonins DnaJ and DnaK, which act early in the assembly process. It is suggested that these factors accumulated with their nascent polypeptides, as putative assembly intermediates in a functionally arrested state. Since in Synechocystis PCC 6803, a link has been established between Chl delivery involving the high-light HilD protein and the SecY/YidC-requiring cotranslational insertion of nascent polypeptides, such a connection between BChl biosynthesis and insertion and folding of nascent Rba. sphaeroides BChl binding proteins is likely to also occur. AFM imaging studies of the formation of the reaction center (RC)\u2013light harvesting 1 (LH1) complex suggested a cooperative assembly mechanism in which, following the association between the RC template and the initial LH1 unit, addition of successive LH1 units to the RC drives the assembly process to completion. Alterations in membrane dynamics as the developing membrane becomes filled with LH2-rings were assessed by fluorescence induction/relaxation kinetics, which showed a slowing in RC electron transfer rate thought to mainly reflect alterations in donor side electron transfer. This was attributed to an increased distance for electron flow in cytochrome c2 between the RC and cytochrome bc1 complexes, as suggested in the current structural models.

Here we used an ultra-fast microfluidic stopped-flow instrument to determine rate constants and the difference spectra for the six consecutive reaction steps of Vibrio harveyi Na+-NQR reduction by NADH. The instrument, with a dead time of 0.25\u00a0ms and optical path length of 1\u00a0cm allowed collection of visible spectra in 50-\u03bcs intervals. By comparing the spectra of reaction steps with the spectra of known redox transitions of individual enzyme cofactors, we were able to identify the chemical nature of most intermediates and the sequence of electron transfer events. A previously unknown spectral transition was detected and assigned to the Cys4[Fe] center reduction. Electron transfer from the [2Fe\u20132S] cluster to the Cys4[Fe] center and all subsequent steps were markedly accelerated when Na+ concentration was increased from 20\u00a0\u03bcM to 25\u00a0mM, suggesting coupling of the former step with tight Na+ binding to or occlusion by the enzyme. An alternating access mechanism was proposed to explain electron transfer between subunits NqrF and NqrC.

Two sets of mutants explore all possible residues at M131 (M polypeptide, native residue Val near HB) in tandem with either a fixed His or a fixed Asn at L181 (L polypeptide, native residue Phe near BB). A third set of mutants explores all possible residues at L181 with a fixed Glu at M131 that can form a hydrogen bond to HB. For each set of mutants, the results of a rapid millisecond screening assay that probes the yield of P+\u00a0QB\u2212 are compared among that set and to the other mutants reported here or previously. For a subset of eight mutants, the rate constants and yields of the individual B-side electron transfer processes are determined via transient absorption measurements spanning 100\u00a0fs to 50\u00a0\u03bcs. The resulting ranking of mutants for their yield of P+\u00a0QB\u2212 from ultrafast experiments is in good agreement with that obtained from the millisecond screening assay, further validating the efficient, high-throughput screen for B-side transmembrane charge separation.

The poorly understood integral membrane protein heme A synthase catalyzes the synthesis of heme A from heme O.

We used heme A synthase from the eubacterium Bacillus subtilis and the hyperthermophilic archeon Aeropyrum pernix to investigate the functional role of these cysteine residues. Results with B. subtilis amino acid substituted proteins indicated the pair of cysteine residues in the loop connecting transmembrane segments I and II as being essential for catalysis but not required for binding of the enzyme substrate, heme O. Experiments with isolated A. pernix and B. subtilis heme A synthase demonstrated that a disulfide bond can form between the cysteine residues in the same loop and also between loops showing close proximity of the two loops in the folded enzyme protein.Based on the findings, we propose a classification scheme for the four discrete types of heme A synthase found so far in different organisms and propose that essential cysteinyls mediate transfer of reducing equivalents required for the oxygen-dependent catalysis of heme A synthesis from heme O.",

     "abstract": "The chloroplast must regulate supply of reducing equivalents and ATP to meet rapid changes in downstream metabolic demands. Cyclic electron flow around photosystem I (CEF) is proposed to balance the ATP/NADPH budget by using reducing equivalents to drive plastoquinone reduction, leading to the generation of proton motive force and subsequent ATP synthesis. While high rates of CEF have been observed in vivo, isolated thylakoids show only very slow rates, suggesting that the activity of a key complex is lost or down-regulated upon isolation. We show that isolation of thylakoids while in the continuous presence of reduced thiol reductant dithiothreitol (DTT), but not oxidized DTT, maintains high CEF activity through an antimycin A sensitive ferredoxin:quinone reductase (FQR). Maintaining low concentrations (~\u00a02\u00a0mM) of reduced DTT while modulating the concentration of oxidized DTT leads to reversible activation/inactivation of CEF with an apparent midpoint potential of \u2212\u00a0306\u00a0mV (\u00b110\u00a0mV) and n\u00a0=\u00a02, consistent with redox modulation of a thiol/disulfide couple and thioredoxin-mediated regulation of the plastoquinone reductase involved in the antimycin A-sensitive pathway, possibly at the level of the PGRL1 protein. Based on proposed differences in regulatory modes, we propose that the FQR and NADPH:plastoquinone oxidoreductase (NDH) pathways for CEF are activated under different conditions and fulfill different roles in chloroplast energy balance.",

The C-terminal half of the molecule encompasses the domains C and D, which are connected by a small linker and the N-terminal half of the protein contains two domains (A and B) that form one structural unit. It was proposed that this protein works as an electrically conductive device in G. sulfurreducens, transferring electrons within the periplasm or to outer-membrane cytochromes. In this work, a novel strategy was applied to characterize in detail the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the hexaheme fragment CD of GSU1996. This characterization revealed the electron transfer process of GSU1996 for the first time, showing that a heme at the edge of the C-terminal of the protein is thermodynamic and kinetically competent to receive electrons from physiological redox partners.

Structurally, they consist of three homologous domains with a single substrate binding site. They alternate between a cytoplasmic and matrix state in which the binding site is accessible to these compartments for binding of ADP or ATP. It has been proposed that cycling between states occurs by disruption and formation of a matrix and cytoplasmic salt bridge network in an alternating way, but formation of the latter has not been shown experimentally. Here, we show that state-dependent formation of the cytoplasmic salt bridge network can be demonstrated by measuring the effect of mutations on the thermal stability of detergent-solubilized carriers locked in a specific state. For this purpose, mutations were made to increase or decrease the overall interaction energy of the cytoplasmic network. When locked in the cytoplasmic state by the inhibitor carboxyatractyloside, the thermostabilities of the mutant and wild-type carriers were similar, but when locked in the matrix state by the inhibitor bongkrekic acid, they correlated with the predicted interaction energy of the cytoplasmic network, demonstrating its formation. Changing the interaction energy of the cytoplasmic network also had a profound effect on the kinetics of transport, indicating that formation of the network is a key step in the transport cycle. These results are consistent with a unique alternating access mechanism that involves the simultaneous rotation of the three domains around a central translocation pathway.",

For understanding the catalytic strategy of biological water oxidation it is important to elucidate the energetic landscape of PSII and in particular that of the final S4\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S0 transition. In this short-lived chemical step the four oxidizing equivalents accumulated in the preceding photochemical events are used up to form molecular oxygen, two protons are released and at least one substrate water molecule binds to the Mn4CaO5 cluster. In this study we probed the probability to form S4 from S0 and O2 by incubating YD-less PSII in the S0 state for 2\u20133\u00a0days in the presence of 18O2 and H216O. The absence of any measurable 16,18O2 formation by water-exchange in the S4 state suggests that the S4 state is hardly ever populated. On the basis of a detailed analysis we determined that the equilibrium constant K of the S4\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S0 transition is larger than 1.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 so that this step is highly exergonic.

The Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants crd1\u0394 and pgc1\u0394 both accumulate PG. Based on analyses of the phospholipid content of pgc1\u0394 and crd1\u0394 yeast, we revealed that in yeast mitochondria, two separate pools of PG are present, which differ in their fatty acid composition and accessibility for Pgc1p-catalyzed degradation. In contrast to CL-deficient crd1\u0394 yeast, the pgc1\u0394 mutant contains normal levels of CL. This makes the pgc1\u0394 strain a suitable model to study the effect of accumulation of PG per se. Using fluorescence microscopy, we show that accumulation of PG with normal levels of CL resulted in increased fragmentation of mitochondria, while in the absence of CL, accumulation of PG led to the formation of large mitochondrial sheets. We also show that pgc1\u0394 mitochondria exhibited increased respiration rates due to increased activity of cytochrome c oxidase. Taken together, our results indicate that not only a lack of anionic phospholipids, but also excess PG, or unbalanced ratios of anionic phospholipids in mitochondrial membranes, have harmful consequences on mitochondrial morphology and function.",

However, the dependence of FLIM data on input laser power has not been quantitatively explained by absolute excitation probabilities under actual imaging conditions. In an effort to distinguish between photosystem I and photosystem II (PSI and PSII) in microscopic images, we have obtained dependence of FLIM data on input laser power from a filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis and single cellular green alga Parachlorella kessleri. Nitrogen-fixing cells in A. variabilis, heterocysts, are mostly visualized as cells in which short-lived fluorescence (\u2264\u00a00.1\u00a0ns) characteristic of PSI is predominant. The other cells in A. variabilis (vegetative cells) and P. kessleri cells show a transition in the status of PSII from an open state with the maximal charge separation rate at a weak excitation limit to a closed state in which charge separation is temporarily prohibited by previous excitation(s) at a relatively high laser power. This transition is successfully reproduced by a computer simulation with a high fidelity to the actual imaging conditions. More details in the fluorescence from heterocysts were examined to assess possible functions of PSII in the anaerobic environment inside the heterocysts for the nitrogen-fixing enzyme, nitrogenase. Photochemically active PSII:PSI ratio in heterocysts is tentatively estimated to be typically below our detection limit or at most about 5% in limited heterocysts in comparison with that in vegetative cells.",

It has been proposed that the carbonic anhydrase domain of complex I is involved in a process mediating efficient recycling of mitochondrial CO2 for photosynthetic carbon fixation which is especially important during growth conditions causing increased photorespiration. Depletion of CAL proteins has been shown to significantly affect plant development and photomorphogenesis. To better understand CAL function in plants we here investigated effects of CAL depletion on the mitochondrial compartment. In mutant lines and cell cultures complex I amount was reduced by 90\u201395% but levels of complexes III and V were unchanged. At the same time, some of the CA transcripts were less abundant. Proteome analysis of CAL depleted cells revealed significant reduction of complex I subunits as well as proteins associated with photorespiration, but increased amounts of proteins participating in amino acid catabolism and stress response reactions. Developmental delay of the mutants was slightly alleviated if plants were cultivated at high CO2. Profiling of selected metabolites revealed defined changes in intermediates of the citric acid cycle and amino acid catabolism.

Whereas UCP1's central role in non-shivering thermogenesis is acknowledged, the function and even tissue expression pattern of UCP3 are still under dispute. Because UCP3 properties regarding transport of protons are qualitatively identical to those of UCP1, its expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) alongside UCP1 requires justification. In this work, we tested whether any correlation exists between the expression of UCP1 and UCP3 in BAT by quantification of protein amounts in mouse tissues at physiological conditions, in cold-acclimated and UCP1 knockout mice. Quantification using recombinant UCP3 revealed that the UCP3 amount in BAT (0.51\u00a0ng/(\u03bcg total tissue protein)) was nearly one order of magnitude higher than that in muscles and heart. Cold-acclimated mice showed an approximate three-fold increase in UCP3 abundance in BAT in comparison to mice in thermoneutral conditions. Surprisingly, we found a significant decrease of UCP3 in BAT of UCP1 knockout mice, whereas the protein amount in skeletal and heart muscles remained constant. UCP3 abundance decreased even more in cold-acclimated UCP1 knockout mice. Protein quantification in UCP3 knockout mice revealed no compensatory increase in UCP1 or UCP2 expression. Our results do not support the participation of UCP3 in thermogenesis in the absence of UCP1 in BAT, but clearly demonstrate the correlation in abundance between both proteins. The latter is important for understanding UCP3's function in BAT.",

Besides, the length of the peptide upstream of the phosphorylated site (Thr) is also crucial for Lhcb phosphorylation in vitro. Furthermore, the two N-terminal residues of Lhcb appear to play a key role in the phosphorylation kinetics because Lhcb with N-terminal RR was phosphorylated much faster than with RK. Therefore, we conclude that the substrate recognition of the LHCII kinase is determined to a large extent by the N-terminal sequence of the Lhcb proteins. The study provides new insights into the interactions of the Lhcb proteins with the LHCII kinase.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor, IF1, regulates the activity of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. The oligomeric state of IF1 related to pH is crucial for its inhibitory activity. Although extensive structural studies have been performed to characterize the oligomeric states of bovine IF1, only little is known concerning those of yeast IF1. While bovine IF1 can be found as an inhibitory dimer at low pH and a non-inhibitory tetramer at high pH, a monomer/dimer equilibrium has been described for yeast IF1, high pH values favoring the monomeric state. Combining different strategies involving the grafting of nitroxide spin labels combined with Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, the present study brings the first structural characterization, at the residue level, of yeast IF1 in its dimeric form. The results show that the dimerization interface involves the central region of the peptide revealing that the dimer corresponds to a non-inhibitory state. Moreover, we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of the peptide is highly dynamic and that this segment is probably folded back onto the central region. Finally, the pH-dependence of the inter-label distance distribution has been observed indicating a conformational change between two structural states in the dimer.",

     "abstract": "A conserved cysteine located in the signature motif of the catalytic center (H-cluster) of [FeFe]-hydrogenases functions in proton transfer. This residue corresponds to C298 in Clostridium acetobutylicum CaHydA. Despite the chemical and structural difference, the mutant C298D retains fast catalytic activity, while replacement with any other amino acid causes significant activity loss. Given the proximity of C298 to the H-cluster, the effect of the C298D mutation on the catalytic center was studied by continuous wave (CW) and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies.Comparison of the C298D mutant with the wild type CaHydA by CW and pulse EPR showed that the electronic structure of the center is not altered. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that absorption peak values observed in the mutant are virtually identical to those observed in the wild type, indicating that the H-cluster is not generally affected by the mutation. Significant differences were observed only in the inhibited state Hox\u2013CO: the vibrational modes assigned to the COexo and Fed-CO in this state are shifted to lower values in C298D, suggesting different interaction of these ligands with the protein moiety when C298 is changed to D298. More relevant to the catalytic cycle, the redox equilibrium between the Hox and Hred states is modified by the mutation, causing a prevalence of the oxidized state.This work highlights how the interactions between the protein environment and the H-cluster, a dynamic closely interconnected system, can be engineered and studied in the perspective of designing bio-inspired catalysts and mimics.",

It is commonly accepted that these complexes only absorb green and orange light, complementing chlorophyll absorbance. Here, we present a new phycobilisome derived complex that consists only of allophycocyanin core subunits, having red-shifted absorption peaks of 653 and 712\u00a0nm. These red-shifted phycobiliprotein complexes were isolated from the chlorophyll f-containing cyanobacterium, Halomicronema hongdechloris, grown under monochromatic 730\u00a0nm-wavelength (far-red) light. The 3D model obtained from single particle analysis reveals a double disk assembly of 120\u2013145\u00a0\u00c5 with two \u03b1/\u03b2 allophycocyanin trimers fitting into the two separated disks. They are significantly smaller than typical phycobilisomes formed from allophycocyanin subunits and core-membrane linker proteins, which fit well with a reduced distance between thylakoid membranes observed from cells grown under far-red light. Spectral analysis of the dissociated and denatured phycobiliprotein complexes grown under both these light conditions shows that the same bilin chromophore, phycocyanobilin, is exclusively used. Our findings show that red-shifted phycobilisomes are required for assisting efficient far-red light harvesting. Their discovery provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of light harvesting under extreme conditions for photosynthesis, as well as the strategies involved in flexible chromatic acclimation to diverse light conditions.",

     "abstract": "Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) spectroscopy is an established but relatively little-used technique that monitors the chirality of an emission. When applied to photosynthetic pigment assemblies, we find that CPL provides sensitive and detailed information on low-energy exciton states, reflecting the interactions, site energies and geometries of interacting pigments. CPL is the emission analog of circular dichroism (CD) and thus spectra explore the optical activity only of fluorescent states of the pigment-protein complex and consequently the nature of the lowest-energy excited states (trap states), whose study is a critical area of photosynthesis research. In this work, we develop the new approach of temperature-dependent CPL spectroscopy, over the 2\u2013120\u00a0K temperature range, and apply it to the CP43 proximal antenna protein of photosystem II. Our results confirm strong excitonic interactions for at least one of the two well-established emitting states of CP43 named \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d.

This state dominates CPL spectra and is attributed predominantly to chlorophyll a's labeled Chl 634 and Chl 636 (alternatively labeled Chl 43 and 45 by Shibata et al.).

Two blue-shifted complexes obtained by chemical modification, B893 and B882, have increasing full widths at half maximum (FWHM) and decreasing transition dipole oscillator strength. 77\u00a0K Stark absorption spectroscopy studies were employed for the three complexes, trying to understand the origin of the 915\u00a0nm absorption. We found that Tr(\u2206\u03b1) and |\u2206\u03bc| of both Qy and carotenoid (Car) bands are larger than for other purple bacterial LH complexes reported previously. Moreover, the red shifts of the Qy bands are associated with (1) increasing Tr(\u2206\u03b1) and |\u2206\u03bc| of the Qy band, (2) the red shift of the Car Stark signal and (3) the increasing |\u2206\u03bc| of the Car band. Based on the results and the crystal structure, a combined effect of exciton-charge transfer (CT) states mixing, and inhomogeneous narrowing of the BChl a site energy is proposed to be the origin of the 915\u00a0nm absorption. CT-exciton state mixing has long been found to be the origin of strong Stark signal in LH1 and special pair, and the more extent of the mixing in Tch. tepidum LH1 is mainly the consequence of the shorter BChl\u2013BChl distances. The less flexible protein structure results in a smaller site energy disorder (inhomogeneous narrowing), which was demonstrated to be able to influence |\u2206\u03bc| and absorption.",

     "abstract": "The respiratory chain bc1 complex is central to mitochondrial bioenergetics and the target of antiprotozoals. We characterized a modified yeast bc1 complex that more closely resemble Plasmodium falciparum enzyme. The mutant version was generated by replacing ten cytochrome b Qo site residues by P. falciparum equivalents. The Plasmodium-like changes caused a major dysfunction of the catalytic mechanism of the bc1 complex resulting in superoxide overproduction and respiratory growth defect. The defect was corrected by substitution of the conserved residue Y279 by a phenylalanine, or by mutations in or in the vicinity of the hinge domain of the iron\u2013sulphur protein. It thus appears that side-reactions can be prevented by the substitution Y279F or the modification of the iron\u2013sulphur protein hinge region. Interestingly, P. falciparum \u2014 and all the apicomplexan \u2014 contains an unusual hinge region. We replaced the yeast hinge region by the Plasmodium version and combined it with the Plasmodium-like version of the Qo site. This combination restored the respiratory growth competence.

This is due to the hydrogen bond disruption that suggests the necessity to reconsider the traditional approach of the purely electrostatic calculation of the transfer energy from water into protein. In this paper, the method combining the experimental estimates of the transfer energies from water into aprotic solvent and the electrostatic calculation of the transfer energies from aprotic solvent into protein is proposed. Hydrogen bonds between aprotic solvent and solute are taken into account by introducing an imaginary aprotic medium incapable to form hydrogen bonds with the solute. Besides, a new treatment of the heterogeneous intraprotein dielectric permittivity based on the microscopic protein structure and electrometric measurements is elaborated. The method accounts semi-quantitatively for the electrostatic effect of diverse charged amino acid substitutions in the donor and acceptor parts of the photosynthetic bacterial reaction center from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Analysis of the volatile secondary acceptor site QB revealed that in the conformation with a minimal distance between quinone QB and Glu L 212 the proton uptake upon the reduction of QB is prompted by Glu L 212 in alkaline and by Asp L 213 in slightly acidic regions. This agrees with the pH dependences of protonation degrees and the proton uptake. The method of pK calculation was applied successfully also for dissociation of Asp 26 in bacterial thioredoxin.",

The model allows an understanding of the photoinduced processes without assuming further electronic states or a dependence of the 2Ag state character on the vibrational sub-state. We report molecular dynamics simulations (CHARMM22 force field) and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations on PCP. In the latter, the QM region containing a single peridinin (Per) chromophore or a Per-Chl a (chlorophyll a) pair is treated by density functional theory (DFT, CAM-B3LYP) for geometries and by DFT-based multireference configuration interaction (DFT/MRCI) for excitation energies.The calculations show that Per has a bright, green light absorbing 2Ag state, in addition to the blue light absorbing 1Bu state found in other carotenoids. Both states undergo a strong energy lowering upon relaxation, leading to emission in the red, while absorbing in the blue or green. The orientation of their transition dipole moments indicates that both states are capable of excited-state energy transfer to Chl a, without preference for either 1Bu or 2Ag as donor state. We propose that the commonly postulated partial intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character of a donating Per state can be assigned to the relaxed 1Bu state, which takes on ICT character. By assuming that both 1Bu and 2Ag are able to donate to the Chl a Q band, one can explain why different chlorophyll species in PCP exhibit different acceptor capabilities.",

Proton-pumping rhodopsins are found in Archaea (Halobacteria), multiple groups of Bacteria, numerous fungi, and some microscopic algae. An overwhelming majority of these proton pumps share the common transport mechanism, in which a proton from the retinal Schiff base is first transferred to the primary proton acceptor (normally an Asp) on the extracellular side of retinal. Next, reprotonation of the Schiff base from the cytoplasmic side is mediated by a carboxylic proton donor (Asp or Glu), which is located on helix C and is usually hydrogen-bonded to Thr or Ser on helix B. The only notable exception from this trend was recently found in Exiguobacterium, where the carboxylic proton donor is replaced by Lys. Here we describe a new group of efficient proteobacterial retinal-binding light-driven proton pumps which lack the carboxylic proton donor on helix C (most often replaced by Gly) but possess a unique His residue on helix B. We characterize the group spectroscopically and propose that this histidine forms a proton-donating complex compensating for the loss of the carboxylic proton donor.",

Extensive mutational studies have characterized the protein\u2013protein interaction in FNR/Fd and FNR/Fld complexes. Interestingly, even though Fd and Fld share the interaction site on FNR, individual residues on FNR do not participate to the same extent in the interaction with each of the protein partners, pointing to different electron transfer mechanisms.

     "abstract": "State transitions are an important photosynthetic short-term response that maintains the excitation balance between photosystems I (PSI) and II (PSII). In plants, when PSII is preferentially excited, LHCII, the main heterotrimeric light harvesting complex of PSII, is phosphorylated by the STN7 kinase, detaches from PSII and moves to PSI to equilibrate the relative absorption of the two photosystems (State II). When PSI is preferentially excited LHCII is dephosphorylated by the PPH1 (TAP38) phosphatase, and returns to PSII (State I). Phosphorylation of LHCII that remain bound to PSII has also been observed. Although the kinetics of LHCII phosphorylation are well known from a qualitative standpoint, the absolute phosphorylation levels of LHCII (and its isoforms) bound to PSI and PSII have been little studied. In this work we thoroughly investigated the phosphorylation level of the Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 isoforms that compose LHCII in PSI-LHCII and PSII-LHCII supercomplexes purified from WT and state transition mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that, at most, 40% of the monomers that make up PSI-bound LHCII trimers are phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was much lower in PSII-bound LHCII trimers reaching only 15\u201320%. Dephosphorylation assays using a recombinant PPH1 phosphatase allowed us to investigate the role of the two isoforms during state transitions. Our results strongly suggest that a single phosphorylated Lhcb2 is sufficient for the formation of the PSI-LHCII supercomplex. These results are a step towards a refined model of the state transition phenomenon and a better understanding of the short-term response to changes in light conditions in plants.",

     "abstract": "Ubiquinone is the universal mobile charge carrier involved in biological electron transfer processes. Its redox properties and biological function depend on the molecular partition and lateral diffusion over biological membranes. However, ubiquinone localization and dynamics within lipid bilayers are long debated and still uncertain. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations of several ubiquinone homologs with variable isoprenoid tail lengths complexed to phosphatidylcholine bilayers. Initially, a new force-field parametrization for ubiquinone is derived from and compared to high level quantum chemical data. Free energy profiles for ubiquinone insertion in the lipid bilayer are obtained with the new force-field. The profiles allow for the determination of the equilibrium location of ubiquinone in the membrane as well as for the validation of the simulation model by direct comparison with experimental partition coefficients. A detailed analysis of structural properties and interactions shows that the ubiquinone polar head group is localized at the water\u2013bilayer interface at the same depth of the lipid glycerol groups and oriented normal to the membrane plane. Both the localization and orientation of ubiquinone head groups do not change significantly when increasing the number of isoprenoid units. The isoprenoid tail is extended and packed with the lipid acyl chains. For ubiquinones with long tails, the terminal isoprenoid units have high flexibility. Calculated ubiquinone diffusion coefficients are similar to that found for the phosphatidylcholine lipid. These results may have further implications for the mechanisms of ubiquinone transport and binding to respiratory and photosynthetic protein complexes.",

According to the literature, the question of the precise function of CooC as a chaperone folding the C-cluster in a form which accommodates free nickel or as a mere nickel donor is not resolved. Here, we report the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization of two recombinant forms of the CODH, produced in the absence and in the presence of CooC, designated CooS and CooSC, respectively. CooS contains no nickel and cannot be activated, supporting the idea that the role of CooC is to fold the C-cluster so that it can bind nickel. As expected, CooSC is Ni-loaded, reversibly converts CO and CO2, displays the typical Cred1 and Cred2 EPR signatures of the C-cluster and activates in the presence of methyl viologen and CO in an autocatalytic process. However, Ni-loaded CooSC reaches maximum activity only upon reductive treatment in the presence of exogenous nickel, a phenomenon that had not been observed before. Surprisingly, the enzyme displays the Cred1 and Cred2 signatures whether it has been activated or not, showing that this activation process of the Ni-loaded Dv CODH is not associated with structural changes at the active site.",

Recent research on mitochondria reveals that these genomes are far less helpless than originally envisioned.

     "abstract": "A number of studies have shown that ageing is associated with increased amounts of mtDNA deletions and/or point mutations in a variety of species as diverse as Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, rats, dogs, primates and humans. This detected vulnerability of mtDNA has led to the suggestion that the accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations might arise from increased oxidative damage and could play an important role in the ageing process by producing cells with a decreased oxidative capacity. However, the vast majority of DNA polymorphisms and disease-causing base-substitution mutations and age-associated mutations that have been detected in human mtDNA are transition mutations. They are likely arising from the slight infidelity of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase. Indeed, transition mutations are also the predominant type of mutation found in mtDNA mutator mice, a model for premature ageing caused by increased mutation load due to the error prone mitochondrial DNA synthesis. These particular misincorporation events could also be exacerbated by dNTP pool imbalances. The role of different repair, replication and maintenance mechanisms that contribute to mtDNA integrity and mutagenesis will be discussed in details in this article.

In recent years, the implications of cellular senescence in physiological and pathological settings, such as ageing and cancer, have gained firm ground. It is, therefore, important to understand the mechanisms underpinning the establishment and maintenance of senescence. Age-dependent alterations in cellular metabolic processes are greatly driven by changes in mitochondrial function and homeostasis. Classically, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in cellular senescence mainly by promoting oxidative damage-induced cell-cycle arrest; however, emerging data suggests that other mitochondrial-dependent factors play an important role in the induction of senescent phenotypes. Here we review the role of mitochondrial homeostatic mechanisms, mitochondrial metabolites and ROS generation in the signalling pathways leading to the induction and maintenance of cellular senescence and discuss how this may contribute to the ageing process.

Regeneration is maintained by somatic stem cells (SSCs), which require tightly controlled energy metabolism and genomic integrity for their homeostasis. Recent data indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction may compromise this homeostasis, and thereby contribute to tissue degeneration and aging. Progeroid Mutator mouse, accumulating random mtDNA point mutations in their SSCs, showed disturbed SSC homeostasis, emphasizing the importance of mtDNA integrity for stem cells. The mechanism involved changes in cellular redox-environment, including subtle increase in reactive oxygen species (H2O2 and superoxide anion), which did not cause oxidative damage, but disrupted SSC function. Mitochondrial metabolism appears therefore to be an important regulator of SSC fate determination, and defects in it in SSCs may underlie premature aging.

Downstream effects of these pathways include a reduction in cellular damage induced by oxidative stress, enhanced efficiency of mitochondrial functions and maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control, thereby attenuating age-related declines in mitochondrial function. However, the literature also accumulates conflicting evidence regarding how DR ameliorates mitochondrial performance and whether that is enough to slow age-dependent cellular and organismal deterioration.

Specifically, prohibitin deficiency shortens the lifespan of otherwise wild type worms, while it dramatically extends the lifespan under compromised metabolic conditions. This extremely intriguingly phenotype has been linked to alterations in mitochondrial function and in fat metabolism. However, the true function of the mitochondrial prohibitin complex remains elusive. Here, we used gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (GC/FID) and 1H NMR spectroscopy to gain molecular insights into the effect of prohibitin depletion on the Caenorhabditis elegans metabolome. We analysed the effect of prohibitin deficiency in two different developmental stages and under two different conditions, which result in opposing longevity phenotypes, namely wild type worms and daf-2(e1370) insulin signalling deficient mutants. Prohibitin depletion was shown to alter the fatty acid (GC/FID) and 1H NMR metabolic profiles of wild type animals both at the fourth larval stage of development (L4) and at the young adult (YA) stage, while being more pronounced at the later stage. Furthermore, wild type and the diapause mutant daf-2(e1370), either expressing or not prohibitin, were clearly distinguishable based on their metabolic profiles, revealing changes in fatty acid composition, as well as in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Moreover, the metabolic data indicate that daf-2(e1370) mutants are more robust than the wild type animals to changes induced by prohibitin depletion. The impact of prohibitin depletion on the C. elegans metabolome will be discussed herein in the scope of its effect on longevity.

Severe mitochondrial dysfunction leads to life-threatening diseases in humans and accelerates the aging process.

Large-scale screens, however, are manual, subjective, time consuming and costly. These limitations could be reduced by the identification of automatically quantifiable biomarkers of healthy aging. In this study we exploit the distinct and reproducible phenotypes described in C. elegans upon different levels of mitochondrial alteration to develop an automated high-content strategy to identify new potential pro-longevity interventions. Utilizing the microscopy platform Cellomics ArrayScan Reader, we optimize a workflow to automatically and reliably quantify the discrete phenotypic readouts associated with different degrees of silencing of mitochondrial respiratory chain regulatory proteins, and validate the approach with mitochondrial-targeting drugs known to extend lifespan in C. elegans.

Phospholipid classes and fatty acid composition were assayed by chromatographic methods in liver and liver mitochondria. Mitochondrial bioenergetic function was also evaluated. While MitoQ had no or slight effects on total liver fatty acid composition and phospholipid classes and their fatty acid composition, it had major effects on liver mitochondrial phospholipids and mitochondrial function. Indeed, MitoQ both increased CL synthase gene expression and CL content of liver mitochondria and increased 18:2n-6 (linoleic acid) content of mitochondrial phospholipids by comparison to the HF diet. Moreover, mitochondrial CL content was positively correlated to mitochondrial membrane fluidity, membrane potential and respiration, as well as to ATP synthase activity, while it was negatively correlated to mitochondrial ROS production.These findings suggest that MitoQ may decrease pathogenic alterations to CL content and profiles, thereby preserving mitochondrial function and attenuating the development of some of the features of metabolic syndrome in obesogenic diet-fed rats.",

The second intermediate E2P hydrolyzes rapidly, which is essential for the rapid removal of Ca2\u00a0+ from the cytosol of muscle cells. The present work studies whether a weakening of the scissile PO bond in the E2P ground state facilitates dephosphorylation. To this end, the experimentally known vibrational spectrum of the E2P phosphate group was calculated with density functional theory (DFT) using structural models at two levels of structural complexity: (i) Models of acetyl phosphate in simple environments and (ii) ~\u00a0150 atom models of the catalytic site. It was found that the enzyme environment distorts the structure of the phosphate group: one of the terminal PO bonds is shorter in the catalytic site indicating weaker interactions than in water. However, the bond that bridges phosphate and Asp351 is unaffected. This indicates that the scissile PO bond is not weakened by the enzyme environment of E2P. A second finding was that the catalytic site of the E2P state in aqueous solution appears to adopt a structure as in the crystals with BeF3\u2212, where the ATPase is in a non-reactive conformation. The reactant state of the dephosphorylation reaction differs from the E2P ground state: Glu183 faces Asp351 and positions the attacking water molecule. This state has a 0.04\u00a0\u00c5 longer, and thus weaker, bridging PO bond. The reactant state is not detected in our experiments, indicating that its energy is at least 1\u00a0kcal/mol higher than that of the E2P ground state.",

Escherichia coli nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) is a member of the Mo/W-bisPGD family that allows anaerobic respiration using nitrate as terminal electron acceptor. Here, using protein film voltammetry on NarGH films, we show that the enzyme is purified in a functionally heterogeneous form that contains between 20 and 40% of inactive species that activate the first time they are reduced. This activation proceeds in two steps: a non-redox reversible reaction followed by an irreversible reduction.

We hypothesize that ischemia disrupts Met80-Fe ligation of cyt c, forming pentacoordinated heme Fe2\u00a0+, which inhibits electron transport (ET) and promotes oxygenase activity.SS-20 (Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2) was used to demonstrate the role of Met80-Fe ligation in ischemia. Mitochondria were isolated from ischemic rat kidneys to determine sites of respiratory inhibition. Mitochondrial cyt c and cyt c Met-O were quantified by western blot, and cristae architecture was examined by electron microscopy.Biochemical and structural studies showed that SS-20 selectively targets cardiolipin (CL) and protects Met80-Fe ligation in cyt c. Ischemic mitochondria showed 17-fold increase in Met-O cyt c, and dramatic cristaeolysis. Loss of cyt c was associated with proteolytic degradation of OPA1. Ischemia significantly inhibited ET initiated by direct reduction of cyt c and coupled respiration. All changes were prevented by SS-20.Our results show that ischemia disrupts the Met80-Fe ligation of cyt c resulting in the formation of a globin-like pentacoordinated heme Fe2\u00a0+ that inhibits ET, and converts cyt c into an oxygenase to cause CL peroxidation and proteolytic degradation of OPA1, resulting in cyt c release.Cyt c heme structure represents a novel target for minimizing ischemic injury. SS-20, which we show to selectively target CL and protect the Met80-Fe ligation, minimizes ischemic injury and promotes ATP recovery.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial complex I is a large, membrane-bound enzyme central to energy metabolism, and its dysfunction is implicated in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. An interesting feature of mammalian complex I is the so-called A/D transition, when the idle enzyme spontaneously converts from the active (A) to the de-active, dormant (D) form. The A/D transition plays an important role in tissue response to ischemia and rate of the conversion can be a crucial factor determining outcome of ischemia/reperfusion. Here, we describe the effects of alkali cations on the rate of the D-to-A transition to define whether A/D conversion may be regulated by sodium.At neutral pH (7\u20137.5) sodium resulted in a clear increase of rates of activation (D-to-A conversion) while other cations had minor effects. The stimulating effect of sodium in this pH range was not caused by an increase in ionic strength. EIPA, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporters, decreased the rate of D-to-A conversion and sodium partially eliminated this effect of EIPA. At higher pH (>\u00a08.0), acceleration of the D-to-A conversion by sodium was abolished, and all tested cations decreased the rate of activation, probably due to the effect of ionic strength.The implications of this finding for the mechanism of complex I energy transduction and possible physiological importance of sodium stimulation of the D-to-A conversion at pathophysiological conditions in vivo are discussed.",

In the initial phase, the low-spin heme b560 is rapidly and almost completely oxidized (kobs\u00a0>\u00a033,000\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) whereas CuA remains nearly fully reduced. The internal equilibrium between CuA and heme b560 with forward and reverse rate constants of 4621\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and 3466\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, respectively, indicates a ~\u00a07.5\u00a0mV lower midpoint potential for CuA compared to heme b560. The formation of the oxidized enzyme is relatively slow (693\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01). In contrast to the Paracoccus denitrificans cytochrome aa3 oxidase, where in the last phase of the oxidative half cycle a radical from the strictly conserved Trp272 is formed, no radical is formed in the cytochrome ba3 oxidase. Mutation of the Trp229, the cytochrome ba3 oxidase homologue to the Trp272, did not abolish the activity, again in contrast to the Paracoccus cytochrome aa3 oxidase. Differences in the proton pumping mechanisms of Type A and Type B oxidases are discussed in view of the proposed role of the strictly conserved tryptophan residue in the mechanism of redox-linked proton pumping in Type A oxidases. In spite of the differences between the Type A and Type B oxidases, we conclude that protonation of the proton-loading site constitutes the major rate-limiting step in both catalytic cycles.",

     "abstract": "F-type ATP synthases, central energy conversion machines of the cell synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP) using an electrochemical gradient across the membrane and, reversely, can also hydrolyze ATP to pump ions across the membrane, depending on cellular conditions such as ATP concentration. To prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis, mammalian and bacterial ATP synthases possess different regulatory mechanisms. In bacteria, a low ATP concentration induces a conformational change in the \u03b5 subunit from the down- to up-states, which inhibits ATP hydrolysis. Moreover, the conformational change of the \u03b5 subunit depends on Mg2+ concentration in some bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, but not in others. This diversity makes the \u03b5 subunit a potential target for antibiotics. Here, performing molecular dynamics simulations, we identify the Mg2+ binding site in the \u03b5 subunit from B. subtilis as E59 and E86. The free energy analysis shows that the first-sphere bi-dentate coordination of the Mg2+ ion by the two glutamates is the most stable state. In comparison, we also clarify the reason for the absence of Mg2+ dependency in the \u03b5 subunit from thermophilic Bacillus PS3, despite the high homology to that from B. subtilis. Sequence alignment suggests that this Mg2+ binding motif is present in the \u03b5 subunits of some pathogenic bacteria. In addition we discuss strategies to stabilize an isolated \u03b5 subunit carrying the Mg2+ binding motif by site directed mutagenesis, which also can be used to crystallize Mg2+ dependent \u03b5 subunits in future.",

Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the kinetics and thermodynamics properties of PccH redox behavior. Entropy, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy changes associated with the redox center transition between the ferric and the ferrous state were determined, indicating an enhanced solvent exposure. The midpoint redox potential is considerably low for a monoheme c-type cytochrome and the heterogeneous electron transfer constant rate reflects a high efficiency of electron transfer process in PccH. The midpoint redox potential dependence on the pH (redox-Bohr effect) was investigated, over the range of 2.5 to 9.1, and is described by the protonation/deprotonation events of two distinct centers in the vicinity of the heme group with pKa values of 2.7 (pKox1); 4.1 (pKred1) and 5.9 (pKox2); 6.4 (pKred2). Based on the inspection of PccH structure, these centers were assigned to heme propionic acids P13 and P17, respectively.

CCCP blocks generation of the electrochemical proton gradient required for integral membrane protein insertion. ICM formation was induced for 8\u00a0h, followed by a 4-h exposure to CCCP. Measurements of fluorescence induction/relaxation kinetics showed that CCCP caused a diminished quantum yield, a cessation in expansion of the functional absorption cross-section and a 4- to 10-fold slowing in the electron transfer turnover rate. ICM vesicles (chromatophores) and an upper-pigmented band (UPB) containing ICM growth initiation sites, were isolated and subjected to clear-native electrophoresis. Proteomic analysis of the chromatophore gel bands indicated that CCCP produced a 2.7-fold reduction in spectral counts in the preferentially assembled light-harvesting 2 (LH2) antenna, while the RC-LH1 complex, F1FO-ATPase and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase decreased by 1.7\u20131.9-fold. For 35 soluble enzymes, the ratio of 0.99 for treated/control proteins demonstrated that protein synthesis was unaffected by CCCP, suggesting that the membrane complex decline arose from the turnover of unassembled apoproteins. In the UPB fraction, an ~\u00a02-fold accumulation was observed for the preprotein translocase SecY, the SecA translocation ATPase, SecD and SecF insertion components, and chaperonins DnaJ and DnaK, consistent with the possibility that these factors, which act early in the assembly process, have accumulated in association with nascent polypeptides as stabilized assembly intermediates.",

     "abstract": "Humic substances (HS) constitute a significant fraction of natural organic matter in terrestrial and aquatic environments and can act as terminal electron acceptors in anaerobic microbial respiration. Geobacter sulfurreducens has a remarkable respiratory versatility and can utilize the HS analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) as a terminal electron acceptor or its reduced form (AH2QDS) as an electron donor. Previous studies set the triheme cytochrome PpcA as a key component for HS respiration in G. sulfurreducens, but the process is far from fully understood. In this work, NMR chemical shift perturbation measurements were used to map the interaction region between PpcA and AH2QDS, and to measure their binding affinity. The results showed that the AH2QDS binds reversibly to the more solvent exposed edge of PpcA heme IV. The NMR and visible spectroscopies coupled to redox measurements were used to determine the thermodynamic parameters of the PpcA:quinol complex. The higher reduction potential of heme IV (\u2212\u00a0127\u00a0mV) compared to that of AH2QDS (\u2212\u00a0184\u00a0mV) explains why the electron transfer is more favorable in the case of reduction of the cytochrome by the quinol. The clear evidence obtained for the formation of an electron transfer complex between AH2QDS and PpcA, combined with the fact that the protein also formed a redox complex with AQDS, revealed for the first time the bifunctional behavior of PpcA toward an analog of the HS. Such behavior might confer selective advantage to G. sulfurreducens, which can utilize the HS in any redox state available in the environment for its metabolic needs.",

     "abstract": "Redox homeostasis is significant for the survival of pro- and eukaryotic cells and is crucial for defense against reactive oxygen species like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In Escherichia coli, the reduction of peroxides occurs via the redox active disulfide center of the alkyl hydroperoxide reductase C subunit (AhpC), whose reduced state becomes restored by AhpF. The 57\u00a0kDa EcAhpF contains an N-terminal domain (NTD), which catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH via an FAD of the C-terminal domain into EcAhpC. The NTD is connected to the C-terminal domain via a linker. Here, the first crystal structure of E. coli AhpF bound with NADH and NAD+ has been determined at 2.5\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.4\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, respectively. The NADH-bound form of EcAhpF reveals that the NADH-binding domain is required to alter its conformation to bring a bound NADH to the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin, and thereby render the NADH-domain dithiol center accessible to the NTD disulfide center for electron transfer. The NAD+-bound form of EcAhpF shows conformational differences for the nicotinamide end moieties and its interacting residue M467, which is proposed to represent an intermediate product-release conformation. In addition, the structural alterations in EcAhpF due to NADH- and NAD+-binding in solution are shown by small angle X-ray scattering studies. The EcAhpF is revealed to adopt many intermediate conformations in solution to facilitate the electron transfer from the substrate NADH to the C-terminal domain, and subsequently to the NTD of EcAhpF for the final step of AhpC reduction.",

This is remarkable because these complexes do not bind xanthophylls. Oligomerization is even more disturbed in crtH mutant cells, which show limited carotenoid synthesis; in these cells also the phycobilisomes are distorted despite the fact that these extramembranous light-harvesting complexes do not contain carotenoids. The number of phycocyanin rods connected to the phycobilisome core is strongly reduced leading to high amounts of unattached phycocyanin units. In the absence of carotenoids the overall organization of the thylakoid membranes is disturbed: Photosystem II is not formed, photosystem I hardly oligomerizes and the assembly of phycobilisomes remains incomplete.

     "abstract": "One of the remaining mysteries regarding the respiratory enzyme cytochrome c oxidase is how proton pumping can occur in all reduction steps in spite of the low reduction potentials observed in equilibrium titration experiments for two of the active site cofactors, CuB(II) and Fea3(III). It has been speculated that, at least the copper cofactor can acquire two different states, one metastable activated state occurring during enzyme turnover, and one relaxed state with lower energy, reached only when the supply of electrons stops. The activated state should have a transiently increased CuB(II) reduction potential, allowing proton pumping. The relaxed state should have a lower reduction potential, as measured in the titration experiments. However, the structures of these two states are not known. Quantum mechanical calculations show that the proton coupled reduction potential for CuB is inherently high in the active site as it appears after reaction with oxygen, which explains the observed proton pumping. It is suggested here that, when the flow of electrons ceases, a relaxed resting state is formed by the uptake of one extra proton, on top of the charge compensating protons delivered in each reduction step. The extra proton in the active site decreases the proton coupled reduction potential for CuB by almost half a volt, leading to agreement with titration experiments. Furthermore, the structure for the resting state with an extra proton is found to have a hydroxo-bridge between CuB(II) and Fea3(III), yielding a magnetic coupling that can explain the experimentally observed EPR silence.",

This study examines the ET reaction from reduced amicyanin to an alternative electron acceptor, the diheme protein MauG. It was possible to vary the \u0394G\u00b0 for this ET reaction by simply changing pH to determine the dependence of kET on \u0394G\u00b0. A P94A mutation of amicyanin significantly altered its oxidation\u2013reduction midpoint potential value.

Comparison of the \u03bb values associated with the ET reactions between amicyanin and the TTQ of methylamine dehydrogenase, the diheme center of MauG and the single heme of cytochrome c-551i, provides insight into the factors that dictate the \u03bb values for the respective reactions.

We herein demonstrated that intermolecular hydrophobic and charge\u2013charge interactions between Fd and enzymes were both critical for enzymatic activity. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis, which altered physicochemical properties of residues on the interfaces of Fd for FNR /SiR, revealed various changes in activities of both enzymes. The replacement of serine 43 of Fd to a hydrophobic residue (S43W) and charged residue (S43D) increased and decreased FNR activity, respectively, while S43W showed significantly lower SiR activity without affecting SiR activity by S43D, suggesting that hydrophobic and electrostatic interprotein forces affected FNR activity. Enzyme kinetics revealed that changes in FNR activity by mutating Fd correlated with Km, but not with kcat or activation energy, indicating that interprotein interactions determined FNR activity. Calorimetry-based binding thermodynamics between Fd and FNR showed different binding modes of FNR to wild-type, S43W, or S43D, which were controlled by enthalpy and entropy, as shown by the driving force plot.

     "abstract": "The cyanobacterial multi-subunit membrane protein complex NDH-1 is both structurally and functionally related to Complex I of eubacteria and mitochondria. In addition to functions in respiration and cyclic electron transfer around photosystem I (PSI), the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex is involved in a unique mechanism for inorganic carbon concentration. Although the crystal structures of the similar respiratory Complex I from Thermus thermophilus and Escherichia coli are known, atomic structural information is not available for the cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex yet. In particular, the structures of those subunits that are not homologous to Complex I will help to understand their distinct functions. The 15.7\u00a0kDa protein CupS is a small soluble subunit of the complex variant NDH-1MS, which is thought to play a role in CO2 conversion.Here, we present the NMR structure of CupS from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, which is the very first structure of a specific cyanobacterial NDH-1 complex subunit. CupS shares a structural similarity with members of the Fasciclin protein superfamily. The structural comparison to Fasciclin type proteins based on known NMR structures and protein sequences of human TGFBIp, MPB70 from Mycobacterium bovis, and Fdp from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, together with a virtual docking model of CupS and NdhF3, provide first insight into the specific binding of CupS to the NDH-1MS complex at atomic resolution.",

Three members of this family, here named AtAPC1, AtAPC2, and AtAPC3, exhibit high structural similarities to the human mitochondrial ATP\u2013Mg2\u00a0+/phosphate carriers. Under normal physiological conditions the AtAPC1 gene was expressed at least five times more than the other two AtAPC genes in flower, leaf, stem, root and seedlings. However, in stress conditions the expression levels of AtAPC1 and AtAPC3 change. Direct transport assays with recombinant and reconstituted AtAPC1, AtAPC2 and AtAPC3 showed that they transport phosphate, AMP, ADP, ATP, adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate and, to a lesser extent, other nucleotides. AtAPC2 and AtAPC3 also had the ability to transport sulfate and thiosulfate. All three AtAPCs catalyzed a counter-exchange transport that was saturable and inhibited by pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate. The transport activities of AtAPCs were also inhibited by the addition of EDTA or EGTA and stimulated by the addition of Ca2\u00a0+. Given that phosphate and sulfate can be recycled via their own specific carriers, these findings indicate that AtAPCs can catalyze net transfer of adenine nucleotides across the inner mitochondrial membrane in exchange for phosphate (or sulfate), and that this transport is regulated both at the transcriptional level and by Ca2\u00a0+.",

     "abstract": "The C-family (cbb3) of heme-copper oxygen reductases are proton-pumping enzymes terminating the aerobic respiratory chains of many bacteria, including a number of human pathogens. The most common form of these enzymes contains one copy each of 4 subunits encoded by the ccoNOQP operon. In the cbb3 from Rhodobacter capsulatus, the enzyme is assembled in a stepwise manner, with an essential role played by an assembly protein CcoH. Importantly, it has been proposed that a transient interaction between the transmembrane domains of CcoP and CcoH is essential for assembly. Here, we test this proposal by showing that a genetically engineered form of cbb3 from Vibrio cholerae (CcoNOQPX) that lacks the hydrophilic domain of CcoP, where the two heme c moieties are present, is fully assembled and stable. Single-turnover kinetics of the reaction between the fully reduced CcoNOQPX and O2 are essentially the same as the wild type enzyme in oxidizing the 4 remaining redox-active sites. The enzyme retains approximately 10% of the steady state oxidase activity using the artificial electron donor TMPD, but has no activity using the physiological electron donor cytochrome c4, since the docking site for this cytochrome is presumably located on the absent domain of CcoP. Residue E49 in the hydrophobic domain of CcoP is the entrance of the KC-channel for proton input, and the E49A mutation in the truncated enzyme further reduces the steady state activity to less than 3%. Hence, the same proton channel is used by both the wild type and truncated enzymes.",

The carrier is regulated by the concentration of cytosolic calcium, altering the size of the adenine nucleotide pool in the mitochondrial matrix in response to energetic demands. The protein consists of three domains; (i) the N-terminal regulatory domain, which is formed of two pairs of fused calcium-binding EF-hands, (ii) the C-terminal mitochondrial carrier domain, which is involved in transport, and (iii) a linker region with an amphipathic \u03b1-helix of unknown function. The mechanism by which calcium binding to the regulatory domain modulates substrate transport in the carrier domain has not been resolved. Here, we present two new crystal structures of the regulatory domain of the human isoform 1. Careful analysis by SEC confirmed that although the regulatory domain crystallised as dimers, full-length ATP-Mg/Pi carrier is monomeric. Therefore, the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier must have a different mechanism of calcium regulation than the architecturally related aspartate/glutamate carrier, which is dimeric. The structure showed that an amphipathic \u03b1-helix is bound to the regulatory domain in a hydrophobic cleft of EF-hand 3/4. Detailed bioinformatics analyses of different EF-hand states indicate that upon release of calcium, EF-hands close, meaning that the regulatory domain would release the amphipathic \u03b1-helix. We propose a mechanism for ATP-Mg/Pi carriers in which the amphipathic \u03b1-helix becomes mobile upon release of calcium and could block the transport of substrates across the mitochondrial inner membrane.",

     "abstract": "Abnormal accumulation of oncometabolite fumarate and succinate is associated with inhibition of mitochondrial function and carcinogenesis. By competing with \u03b1-ketoglutarate, oncometabolites also activate hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), which makes oncometabolite mimetics broadly utilised in hypoxia research. We found that dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), a synthetic analogue of \u03b1-ketoglutarate, commonly used to induce HIF signalling, inhibits O2 consumption in cancer cell lines HCT116 and PC12, well before activation of HIF pathways. A rapid suppression of cellular respiration was accompanied by a decrease in histone H4 lysine 16 acetylation and not abolished by double knockdown of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1. In agreement with this, production of NADH and state 3 respiration in isolated mitochondria were down-regulated by the de-esterified DMOG derivative, N-oxalylglycine. Exploring the roles of DMOG as a putative inhibitor of glutamine/\u03b1-ketoglutarate metabolic axis, we found that the observed suppression of OxPhos and compensatory activation of glycolytic ATP flux make cancer cells vulnerable to combined treatment with DMOG and inhibitors of glycolysis. On the other hand, DMOG treatment impairs deep cell deoxygenation in 3D tissue culture models, demonstrating a potential to relieve functional stress imposed by deep hypoxia on tumour, ischemic or inflamed tissues. Indeed, using a murine model of colitis, we found that O2 availability in the inflamed colon tissue rapidly increased after application of DMOG, which could contribute to the known therapeutic effect of this compound. Overall, our results provide new insights into the relationship between mitochondrial function, O2 availability, metabolic reprogramming and associated diseases.",

The first colonizers of the desert sands are cyanobacteria. Facing the harsh conditions of the desert, these organisms must withstand frequent desiccation\u2013hydration cycles, combined with high light intensities. Here, we characterize structural and functional modifications to the photosynthetic apparatus that enable a cyanobacterium, Leptolyngbya sp., to thrive under these conditions.Using multiple in vivo spectroscopic and imaging techniques, we identified two complementary mechanisms for dissipating absorbed energy in the desiccated state. The first mechanism involves the reorganization of the phycobilisome antenna system, increasing excitonic coupling between antenna components. This provides better energy dissipation in the antenna rather than directed exciton transfer to the reaction center. The second mechanism is driven by constriction of the thylakoid lumen which limits diffusion of plastocyanin to P700. The accumulation of P700+ not only prevents light-induced charge separation but also efficiently quenches excitation energy.These protection mechanisms employ existing components of the photosynthetic apparatus, forming two distinct functional modes. Small changes in the structure of the thylakoid membranes are sufficient for quenching of all absorbed energy in the desiccated state, protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from photoinhibitory damage. These changes can be easily reversed upon rehydration, returning the system to its high photosynthetic quantum efficiency.",

Delayed fluorescence spectra showed a clear difference between PSII monomer and PSII dimer isolated from the four diatoms. The difference can be interpreted as reflecting suppressed energy transfer between PSII monomers in the PSII dimer for efficient energy trapping at the reaction center. The observation was especially prominent in C. gracilis and T. pseudonana. The pathways seem to be suppressed under a low pH condition in isolated PSII complexes from C. gracilis, and excitation energy may be quenched with fucoxanthin chlorophyll a/c-binding protein (FCP) that was closely associated with PSII in C. gracilis.

We used time-resolved absorption spectroscopy to measure the kinetics of P680\u2022+ reduction by tyrosine after the first flash given to dark-adapted PS II as a function of temperature and pH. The half-life of TyrZ oxidation by P680\u2022+ increases from 20\u00a0ns at 300\u00a0K to about 4\u00a0\u03bcs at 150\u00a0K. Analyzing the temperature dependence of the rate, one obtains a reorganization energy of about 770\u00a0meV. Between 260\u00a0K and 150\u00a0K, the reduction of P680\u2022+ by TyrZ is increasingly replaced by charge recombination between P680\u2022+ and QA\u2022\u2212. We propose that the driving force for TyrZ oxidation by P680\u2022+ decreases upon lowering the temperature. TyrZ oxidation cannot be excluded in a minority of PS II complexes at cryogenic temperatures.TyrD oxidation by P680\u2022+ with a half-life of about 30\u00a0ns was observed at high pH. The pH dependence of the yield of TyrD oxidation can be described by a single protonable group with a pK of approximately 8.4. The rate of TyrD oxidation by P680\u2022+ is virtually identical upon substitution of solvent exchangeable protons with deuterons indicating that the rate is limited by electron transfer. The rate is independent of temperature between 5\u00a0K and 250\u00a0K. It is concluded that TyrD donates the electron to P680\u2022+ via PD2.",

     "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO), a product of heme degradation by heme oxygenases, plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. Recent evidence indicates that mitochondria are among a number of molecular targets that mediate the cellular actions of CO. In the present study we characterized the effects of CO released from CORM-401 on mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in intact human endothelial cells using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry and the Seahorse XF technology. We found that CORM-401 (10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM) induced a persistent increase in the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) that was accompanied by inhibition of glycolysis (extracellular acidification rate, ECAR) and a decrease in ATP-turnover. Furthermore, CORM-401 increased proton leak, diminished mitochondrial reserve capacity and enhanced non-mitochondrial respiration. Inactive CORM-401 (iCORM-401) neither induced mitochondrial uncoupling nor inhibited glycolysis, supporting a direct role of CO in the endothelial metabolic response induced by CORM-401. Interestingly, blockade of mitochondrial large-conductance calcium-regulated potassium ion channels (mitoBKCa) with paxilline abolished the increase in OCR promoted by CORM-401 without affecting ECAR; patch-clamp experiments confirmed that CO derived from CORM-401 activated mitoBKCa channels present in mitochondria. Conversely, stabilization of glycolysis by MG132 prevented CORM-401-mediated decrease in ECAR but did not modify the OCR response. In summary, we demonstrated in intact endothelial cells that CO induces a two-component metabolic response: uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration dependent on the activation of mitoBKCa channels and inhibition of glycolysis independent of mitoBKCa channels.",

The curves representing the dependencies of V \u02d9 O 2 and metabolite concentrations on single complex activity, entire OXPHOS activity or ESA intensity exhibit a characteristic threshold at some OXPHOS complex activity/ESA intensity. This threshold for V \u02d9 O 2 of single complex activities is significantly lower in intact muscle during moderate and heavy work, than in isolated mitochondria in state 3. Metabolite concentrations and pH in working muscle start to change significantly at much higher OXPHOS complex activities/ESA intensities than V \u02d9 O 2 . The effect of entire OXPHOS deficiency or ESA dysfunction is potentially much stronger than the effect of a single complex deficiency. Implications of these findings for the genesis of mitochondrial myopathies are discussed. It is concluded that V \u02d9 O 2 in state 3 and its dependence on complex activity in isolated mitochondria is not a universal quantitative determinant of the effect of mitochondrial dysfunctions in vivo. Moderate and severe mitochondria dysfunctions are defined: the former affect significantly only metabolite concentrations and pH, while the latter also decrease significantly V \u02d9 O 2 in intact skeletal muscle during work. The dysfunction-caused decrease in V \u02d9 O 2 /oxidative ATP synthesis flux, disturbance of metabolite homeostasis, elevated ROS production and anaerobic glycolysis recruitment can account for such mitochondrial myopathy symptoms as muscle weakness, exercise intolerance (exertional fatigue) and lactic acidosis.",

     "abstract": "In living cells, growth is the result of coupling between substrate catabolism and multiple metabolic processes that take place during net biomass formation and cellular maintenance processes. A crucial parameter for growth evaluation is its yield, i.e. the efficiency of the transformation processes. The yeast Candida utilis is of peculiar interest since its mitochondria exhibit a complex I that is proposed to pump protons but also an external NADH dehydrogenase that do not pump protons. Here, we show that in C. utilis cells grown on non-fermentable media, growth yield is 30% higher as compared to that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that do not exhibit a complex I. Moreover, ADP/O determination in C. utilis shows that electrons coming from internal NADH dehydrogenase go through proton pumping complex I, whereas electrons coming from external NADH dehydrogenases do not go through proton pumping complex I. Furthermore, we show that electron competition strictly depends on extra-mitochondrial NADH concentration, i.e. the higher the extra-mitochondrial NADH concentration, the higher the competition process with a right way for electrons coming from external NADH dehydrogenases. Such a complex regulation in C. utilis allows an increase in growth yield when cytosolic NADH is not plentiful but still favors the cytosolic NADH re-oxidation at high NADH, favoring biomass generation metabolic pathways.",

     "abstract": "A characteristic feature of the active Photosystem II (PSII) complex is a red-shifted low temperature fluorescence emission at about 693\u00a0nm. The origin of this emission has been attributed to a monomeric \u2018red\u2019 chlorophyll molecule located in the CP47 subunit. However, the identity and function of this chlorophyll remain uncertain. In our previous work, we could not detect the red PSII emission in a mutant of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 lacking PsbH, a small transmembrane subunit bound to CP47. However, it has not been clear whether the PsbH is structurally essential for the red emission or the observed effect of mutation has been indirectly caused by compromised PSII stability and function. In the present work we performed a detailed spectroscopic characterization of PSII in cells of a mutant lacking PsbH and Photosystem I and we also characterized PSII core complexes isolated from this mutant. In addition, we purified and characterized the CP47 assembly modules containing and lacking PsbH. The results clearly confirm an essential role of PsbH in the origin of the PSII red emission and also demonstrate that PsbH stabilizes the binding of one \u03b2-carotene molecule in PSII. Crystal structures of the cyanobacterial PSII show that PsbH directly interacts with a single monomeric chlorophyll ligated by the histidine 114 residue of CP47 and we conclude that this peripheral chlorophyll hydrogen-bonded to PsbH is responsible for the red fluorescence state of CP47. Given the proximity of \u03b2-carotene this state could participate in the dissipation of excessive light energy.",

     "abstract": "The initial light-induced processes of the photochromic, phycocyanobilin-binding GAF domain of Slr1393 from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 have been studied by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. We use lifetime density analysis as a model-independent method for the evolution of the experimental data, which gives a comprehensive overview of the excitation wavelength dependence of the photoconversion kinetics. The method is particularly suitable for this highly complex and not purely exponential kinetics. In contrast to previously studied cyanobacteriochromes (CBCRs), here both the red- and the green-absorbing forms show significantly slower reaction dynamics, which proceed also via ground state intermediates. The photoconversion of the green-absorbing form is faster than that of the red state, which allowed a clear detection of the primary photoproduct Lumi-G. Strong coherent oscillations of the recorded transient absorption due to wavepacket motion on the excited state potential energy surface were observed and analyzed for both (red and green) forms of Slr1393g3. The vibrational modes responsible for the coherent oscillations could play a role in the dynamics of the initially heterogeneous excited state (ES) population and direct the system towards the minima on the potential energy surface that determine the ES decay pathway. Furthermore, the coherent oscillations appear to be a common feature of bilin-based photoreceptors and thus deserve further attention. The investigated CBCR exhibits an extraordinary high level of heterogeneity due to the remarkable flexibility of the phycocyanobilin and the protein binding pocket. These properties should allow spectrally tuned response to the light stimuli and thus have significant biological implications.",

PEP is a bacterial-type multisubunit enzyme composed of core subunits (coded for by the plastid rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1 and rpoC2 genes) and additional protein factors (sigma factors and polymerase associated protein, PAPs) encoded in the nuclear genome. Sigma factors are required by PEP for promoter recognition. Six different sigma factors are used by PEP in Arabidopsis plastids. NEP activity is represented by phage-type RNA polymerases. Only one NEP subunit has been identified, which bears the catalytic activity. NEP and PEP use different promoters. Many plastid genes have both PEP and NEP promoters. PEP dominates in the transcription of photosynthesis genes. Intriguingly, rpoB belongs to the few genes transcribed exclusively by NEP. Both NEP and PEP are active in non-green plastids and in chloroplasts at all stages of development. The transcriptional activity of NEP and PEP is affected by endogenous and exogenous factors.

In silico analysis has predicted the code used for PPR motif\u2013nucleotide interaction, and the crystal structure of a protein\u2013RNA complex supports this model. Despite progress in understanding the RNA-binding mechanism of PPR proteins, some of the flexibility of RNA recognition observed in trans-factors of RNA editing has not been fully explained. It is probably necessary to consider another unknown mechanism, and this consideration is related to the question of how PPR proteins have managed the creation of RNA editing sites during evolution. This question may be related to the mystery of the biological function of RNA editing in plants. MORF/RIP family members are required for RNA editing at multiple editing sites and are components of the RNA editosome in plants. The DYW domain has been a strong candidate for the C deaminase activity required for C-to-U conversion in RNA editing. So far, the activity of this enzyme has not been detected in recombinant DYW proteins, and several puzzling experimental results need to be explained to support the model.

In mammals, members of the mitochondrial transcription termination factor (mTERF) family play important roles in OGE. Intriguingly, three of the four mammalian mTERFs do not actually terminate transcription, as their designation suggests, but appear to function in antisense transcription termination and ribosome biogenesis. During the evolution of land plants, the mTERF family has expanded to approximately 30 members, but knowledge of their function in photosynthetic organisms remains sparse.

     "abstract": "During the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, many genes have been interrupted by intervening sequences (introns) that must be removed post-transcriptionally from RNA precursors to form mRNAs ready for translation. The origin of nuclear introns is still under debate, but one hypothesis is that the spliceosome and the intron\u2013exon structure of genes have evolved from bacterial-type group II introns that invaded the eukaryotic genomes. The group II introns were most likely introduced into the eukaryotic genome from an \u03b1-proteobacterial predecessor of mitochondria early during the endosymbiosis event. These self-splicing and mobile introns spread through the eukaryotic genome and later degenerated. Pieces of introns became part of the general splicing machinery we know today as the spliceosome. In addition, group II introns likely brought intron maturases with them to the nucleus. Maturases are found in most bacterial introns, where they act as highly specific splicing factors for group II introns. In the spliceosome, the core protein Prp8 shows homology to group II intron-encoded maturases. While maturases are entirely intron specific, their descendant of the spliceosomal machinery, the Prp8 protein, is an extremely versatile splicing factor with multiple interacting proteins and RNAs. How could such a general player in spliceosomal splicing evolve from the monospecific bacterial maturases? Analysis of the organellar splicing machinery in plants may give clues on the evolution of nuclear splicing.Plants encode various proteins which are closely related to bacterial maturases. The organellar genomes contain one maturase each, named MatK in chloroplasts and MatR in mitochondria. In addition, several maturase genes have been found in the nucleus as well, which are acting on mitochondrial pre-RNAs. All plant maturases show sequence deviation from their progenitor bacterial maturases, and interestingly are all acting on multiple organellar group II intron targets. Moreover, they seem to function in the splicing of group II introns together with a number of additional nuclear-encoded splicing factors, possibly acting as an organellar proto-spliceosome. Together, this makes them interesting models for the early evolution of nuclear spliceosomal splicing. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the role of plant maturases and their accessory factors in plants.

     "abstract": "A protein designated as VIPP1 is found widely in organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis, but its precise role in chloroplasts has remained somewhat mysterious. Based on its structural similarity, it presumably has evolved from bacterial Phage shock protein A (PspA) with a C-terminal extension of approximately 40 amino acids. Both VIPP1 and PspA are membrane-associated despite the lack of transmembrane helices. They form an extremely large homo-complex that consists of an oligomeric ring unit. Although PspA is known to respond to membrane stress and although it acts in maintaining proton motive force through membrane repair, the multiple function of VIPP1, such as vesicle budding from inner envelope to deliver lipids to thylakoids, maintenance of photosynthetic complexes in thylakoid membranes, biogenesis of Photosystem I, and protective role of inner envelope against osmotic stress, has been proposed. Whatever its precise function in chloroplasts, it is an important protein because depletion of VIPP1 in mutants severely affects photoautotrophic growth. Recent reports of the relevant literature describe that VIPP1 becomes highly mobile when chloroplasts receive hypotonic stress, and that VIPP1 is tightly bound to lipids, which implies a crucial role of VIPP1 in membrane repair through lipid transfer. This review presents a summary of our current knowledge related to VIPP1, particularly addressing the dynamic behavior of complexes against stress and its property of lipid binding. Those data altogether suggest that VIPP1 acts a priori in chloroplast membrane maintenance through its activity to transfer lipids rather than in thylakoid formation through vesicles.

     "abstract": "The LHC family includes nuclear-encoded, integral thylakoid membrane proteins, most of which coordinate chlorophyll and xanthophyll chromophores. By assembling with the core complexes of both photosystems, LHCs form a flexible peripheral moiety for enhancing light-harvesting cross-section, regulating its efficiency and providing protection against photo-oxidative stress. Upon its first appearance, LHC proteins underwent evolutionary diversification into a large protein family with a complex genetic redundancy. Such differentiation appears as a crucial event in the adaptation of photosynthetic organisms to changing environmental conditions and land colonization. The structure of photosystems, including nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded subunits, presented the cell with a number of challenges for the control of the light harvesting function. Indeed, LHC-encoding messages are translated in the cytosol, and pre-proteins imported into the chloroplast, processed to their mature size and targeted to the thylakoids where are assembled with chromophores. Thus, a tight coordination between nuclear and plastid gene expression, in response to environmental stimuli, is required to adjust LHC composition during photoacclimation. In recent years, remarkable progress has been achieved in elucidating structure, function and regulatory pathways involving LHCs; however, a number of molecular details still await elucidation. In this review, we will provide an overview on the current knowledge on LHC biogenesis, ranging from organization of pigment\u2013protein complexes to the modulation of gene expression, import and targeting to the photosynthetic membranes, and regulation of LHC assembly and turnover.

     "abstract": "Plastids are a class of essential plant cell organelles comprising photosynthetic chloroplasts of green tissues, starch-storing amyloplasts of roots and tubers or the colorful pigment-storing chromoplasts of petals and fruits. They express a few genes encoded on their organellar genome, called plastome, but import most of their proteins from the cytosol. The import into plastids, the folding of freshly-translated or imported proteins, the degradation or renaturation of denatured and entangled proteins, and the quality-control of newly folded proteins all require the action of molecular chaperones. Members of all four major families of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones (chaperonin/Cpn60, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp100 families) have been identified in plastids from unicellular algae to higher plants. This review aims not only at giving an overview of the most current insights into the general and conserved functions of these plastid chaperones, but also into their specific plastid functions. Given that chloroplasts harbor an extreme environment that cycles between reduced and oxidized states, that has to deal with reactive oxygen species and is highly reactive to environmental and developmental signals, it can be presumed that plastid chaperones have evolved a plethora of specific functions some of which are just about to be discovered. Here, the most urgent questions that remain unsolved are discussed, and guidance for future research on plastid chaperones is given.

The repair of the damaged D1 protein, i.e. the repair cycle of PSII, initiates in the grana stacks where the damage generally takes place, but subsequently continues in non-appressed thylakoid domains, where many steps are common for both the repair and de novo assembly of PSII. The sequence of the (re)assembly steps of genuine PSII subunits is relatively well-characterized in higher plants. A number of novel findings have shed light into the regulation mechanisms of lateral migration of PSII subcomplexes and the repair as well as the (re)assembly of the complex. Besides the utmost importance of the PSII repair cycle for the maintenance of PSII functionality, recent research has pointed out that the maintenance of PSI is closely dependent on regulation of the PSII repair cycle. This review focuses on the current knowledge of regulation of the repair cycle of PSII in higher plant chloroplasts. Particular emphasis is paid on sequential assembly steps of PSII and the function of the number of PSII auxiliary proteins involved both in the biogenesis and repair of PSII.

     "abstract": "Progress in the field of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) in recent years has not surpassed plant biology. Nevertheless, reports on RIP in plants, and especially in chloroplasts, are still scarce. Of the four different families of intramembrane proteases, only two have been linked to chloroplasts so far, rhomboids and site-2 proteases (S2Ps). The lack of chloroplast-located rhomboid proteases was associated with reduced fertility and aberrations in flower morphology, probably due to perturbations in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, which occurs in chloroplasts. Mutations in homologues of S2P resulted in chlorophyll deficiency and impaired chloroplast development, through a yet unknown mechanism. To date, the only known substrate of RIP in chloroplasts is a PHD transcription factor, located in the envelope. Upon proteolytic cleavage by an unknown protease, the soluble N-terminal domain of this protein is released from the membrane and relocates to the nucleus, where it activates the transcription of the ABA response gene ABI4. Continuing studies on these proteases and substrates, as well as identification of the genes responsible for different chloroplast mutant phenotypes, are expected to shed more light on the roles of intramembrane proteases in chloroplast biology.",

We provide a comprehensive review of the Clp protease system present in all plastid types and we draw lessons from structural and functional information of bacterial Clp systems. The Clp system plays a central role in plastid development and function, through selective removal of miss-folded, aggregated, or otherwise unwanted proteins. The Clp system consists of a tetradecameric proteolytic core with catalytically active ClpP and inactive ClpR subunits, hexameric ATP-dependent chaperones (ClpC,D) and adaptor protein(s) (ClpS1) enhancing delivery of subsets of substrates. Many structural and functional features of the plastid Clp system are now understood though extensive reverse genetics analysis combined with biochemical analysis, as well as large scale quantitative proteomics for loss-of-function mutants of Clp core, chaperone and ClpS1 subunits. Evolutionary diversification of Clp system across non-photosynthetic and photosynthetic prokaryotes and organelles is illustrated. Multiple substrates have been suggested based on their direct interaction with the ClpS1 adaptor or screening of different loss-of-function protease mutants. The main challenge is now to determine degradation signals (degrons) in Clp substrates and substrate delivery mechanisms, as well as functional interactions of Clp with other plastid proteases.

However, the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport is mediated solely by \u2206pH. To assess the contribution of two cyclic electron transport pathways around photosystem I (one depending on PGR5/PGRL1 and one on NDH) to pmf formation, electrochromic shift (ECS) was analyzed in the Arabidopsis pgr5 mutant, NDH-defective mutants (ndhs and crr4-2), and their double mutants (ndhs pgr5 and crr4-2 pgr5). In pgr5, the size of the pmf, as represented by ECSt, was reduced by 30% to 47% compared with that in the wild type (WT). A gH+ parameter, which is considered to represent the activity of ATP synthase, was enhanced at high light intensities. However, gH+ recovered to its low-light levels after 20\u00a0min in the dark, implying that the elevation in gH+ is due to the disturbed regulation of ATP synthase rather than to photodamage. After long dark adaptation more than 2\u00a0h, gH+ was higher in pgr5 than in the WT. During induction of photosynthesis, gH+ was more rapidly elevated in pgr5 than that in the WT. Both results suggest that ATP synthase is not fully inactivated in the dark in pgr5. In the NDH-deficient mutants, ECSt was slightly but significantly lower than in the WT, whereas gH+ was not affected. In the double mutants, ECSt was even lower than in pgr5. These results suggest that both PGR5/PGRL1- and NDH-dependent pathways contribute to pmf formation, although to different extents.

     "abstract": "Plastids, such as chloroplasts, are widely distributed endosymbiotic organelles in plants and algae. Apart from their well-known functions in photosynthesis, they have roles in processes as diverse as signal sensing, fruit ripening, and seed development. As most plastid proteins are produced in the cytosol, plastids have developed dedicated translocon machineries for protein import, comprising the TOC (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) and TIC (translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts) complexes. Multiple lines of evidence reveal that protein import via the TOC complex is actively regulated, based on the specific interplay between distinct receptor isoforms and diverse client proteins. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of protein import regulation, particularly in relation to control by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS), and how such regulation changes plastid development. The diversity of plastid import receptors (and of corresponding preprotein substrates) has a determining role in plastid differentiation and interconversion. The controllable turnover of TOC components by the UPS influences the developmental fate of plastids, which is fundamentally linked to plant development. Understanding the mechanisms by which plastid protein import is controlled is critical to the development of breakthrough approaches to increase the yield, quality and stress tolerance of important crop plants, which are highly dependent on plastid development.

     "abstract": "After the engulfment of two prokaryotic organisms, the thus emerged eukaryotic cell needed to establish means of communication and signaling to properly integrate the acquired organelles into its metabolism. Regulatory mechanisms had to evolve to ensure that chloroplasts and mitochondria smoothly function in accordance with all other cellular processes. One essential process is the post\u2010translational import of nuclear encoded organellar proteins, which needs to be adapted according to the requirements of the plant. The demand for protein import is constantly changing depending on varying environmental conditions, as well as external and internal stimuli or different developmental stages. Apart from long-term regulatory mechanisms such as transcriptional/translation control, possibilities for short-term acclimation are mandatory. To this end, protein import is integrated into the cellular redox network, utilizing the recognition of signals from within the organelles and modifying the efficiency of the translocon complexes. Thereby, cellular requirements can be communicated throughout the whole organism. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Chloroplast Biogenesis",

     "abstract": "Chloroplasts must import thousands of nuclear-encoded preproteins synthesized in the cytosol through two successive protein translocons at the outer and inner envelope membranes, termed TOC and TIC, respectively, to fulfill their complex physiological roles. The molecular identity of the TIC translocon had long remained controversial; two proteins, namely Tic20 and Tic110, had been proposed to be central to protein translocation across the inner envelope membrane. Tic40 also had long been considered to be another central player in this process. However, recently, a novel 1-megadalton complex consisting of Tic20, Tic56, Tic100, and Tic214 was identified at the chloroplast inner membrane of Arabidopsis and was demonstrated to constitute a general TIC translocon which functions in concert with the well-characterized TOC translocon. On the other hand, direct interaction between this novel TIC transport system and Tic110 or Tic40 was hardly observed. Consequently, the molecular model for protein translocation across the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts might need to be extensively revised. In this review article, I intend to propose such alternative view regarding the TIC transport system in contradistinction to the classical view. I also would emphasize importance of reevaluation of previous works in terms of with what methods these classical Tic proteins such as Tic110 or Tic40 were picked up as TIC constituents at the very beginning as well as what actual evidence there were to support their direct and specific involvement in chloroplast protein import.

This review intends to highlight new findings of research on tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plants and algae. In the course of the heme and chlorophyll synthesis in these photosynthetic organisms, glutamate, one of the central and abundant metabolites, is converted into highly photoreactive tetrapyrrole intermediates. Thereby, several mechanisms of posttranslational control are thought to be essential for a tight regulation of each enzymatic step. Finally, we wish to discuss the potential role of tetrapyrroles in retrograde signaling and point out perspectives of the formation of macromolecular protein complexes in tetrapyrrole biosynthesis as an efficient mechanism to ensure a fine-tuned metabolic flow in the pathway.

This approach has been used to analyze three chloroplast genes of this sort coding for the \u03b1 subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoA), a ribosomal protein (rps12) and the catalytic subunit of the ATP-dependent ClpP protease (clpP1). Depletion of the three corresponding proteins leads to growth arrest and cell death. Shutdown of chloroplast transcription and translation increases the abundance of a set of plastid transcripts that includes mainly those involved in transcription, translation and proteolysis and reveals multiple regulatory feedback loops in the chloroplast gene circuitry. Depletion of ClpP profoundly affects plastid protein homeostasis and elicits an autophagy-like response with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization of cells. It also triggers changes in chloroplast and nuclear gene expression resulting in increased abundance of chaperones, proteases, ubiquitin-related proteins and proteins involved in lipid trafficking and thylakoid biogenesis. These features are hallmarks of an unfolded protein response in the chloroplast and raise new questions on plastid protein homeostasis and plastid signaling.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Chloroplast Biogenesis.",

Many of the nuclear genes are of cyanobacterial ancestry and continue to perform their ancestral function. However, many others evolved subsequently and comprise a diverse set of proteins found specifically in photosynthetic eucaryotes. Genetic approaches have been key to the discovery of nuclear genes that participate in chloroplast biogenesis, especially those lacking close homologs outside the plant kingdom.This article summarizes contributions from a genetic resource in maize, the Photosynthetic Mutant Library (PML). The PML collection consists of ~\u00a02000 non-photosynthetic mutants induced by Mu transposons. We include a summary of mutant phenotypes for 20 previously unstudied maize genes, including genes encoding chloroplast ribosomal proteins, a PPR protein, tRNA synthetases, proteins involved in plastid transcription, a putative ribosome assembly factor, a chaperonin 60 isoform, and a NifU-domain protein required for Photosystem I biogenesis.Insertions in 94 maize genes have been linked thus far to visible and molecular phenotypes with the PML collection. The spectrum of chloroplast biogenesis genes that have been genetically characterized in maize is discussed in the context of related efforts in other organisms. This comparison shows how distinct organismal attributes facilitate the discovery of different gene classes, and reveals examples of functional divergence between monocot and dicot plants.These findings elucidate the biology of an organelle whose activities are fundamental to agriculture and the biosphere.

     "abstract": "In recent years many advances have been made to obtain insight into chloroplast biogenesis and development. In plants several plastids types exist such as the proplastid (which is the progenitor of all plastids), leucoplasts (group of colourless plastids important for storage including elaioplasts (lipids), amyloplasts (starch) or proteinoplasts (proteins)), chromoplasts (yellow to orange-coloured due to carotenoids, in flowers or in old leaves as gerontoplasts), and the green chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are indispensable for plant development; not only by performing photosynthesis and thus rendering the plant photoautotrophic, but also for biochemical processes (which in some instances can also take place in other plastids types), such as the synthesis of pigments, lipids, and plant hormones and sensing environmental stimuli. Although we understand many aspects of these processes there are gaps in our understanding of the establishment of functional chloroplasts and their regulation. Why is that so? Even though chloroplast function is comparable in all plants and most of the algae, ferns and moss, detailed analyses have revealed many differences, specifically with respect to its biogenesis. As an update to our prior review on the genetic analysis of chloroplast biogenesis and development [1] herein we will focus on recent advances in Angiosperms (monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants) that provide novel insights and highlight the challenges and prospects for unravelling the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis specifically during the establishment of the young plants.

Complex I translocates protons across the membrane using electron transfer energy. Semiquinone (SQ) intermediates appearing during catalysis are suggested to be key for the coupling mechanism in complex I. However, the existence of SQ has remained controversial due to the extreme difficulty in detecting unstable and low intensity SQ signals. Here, for the first time with Escherichia coli complex I reconstituted in proteoliposomes, we successfully resolved and characterized three distinct SQ species by EPR. These species include: fast-relaxing SQ (SQNf) with P1/2 (half-saturation power level)\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0mW and a wider linewidth (12.8 G); slow-relaxing SQ (SQNs) with P1/2\u00a0=\u00a02\u20133\u00a0mW and a 10\u00a0G linewidth; and very slow-relaxing SQ (SQNvs) with P1/2\u00a0= ~\u00a00.1\u00a0mW and a 7.5\u00a0G linewidth. The SQNf signals completely disappeared in the presence of the uncoupler gramicidin D or squamotacin, a potent E. coli complex I inhibitor. The pH dependency of the SQNf signals correlated with the proton-pumping activities of complex I. The SQNs signals were insensitive to gramicidin D, but sensitive to squamotacin. The SQNvs signals were insensitive to both gramicidin D and squamotacin. Our deuterium exchange experiments suggested that SQNf is neutral, while SQNs and SQNvs are anion radicals. The SQNs signals were lost in the \u0394NuoL mutant missing transporter module subunits NuoL and NuoM. The roles and relationships of the SQ intermediates in the coupling mechanism are discussed.",

We have performed classical atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on a three-subunit CcO, which show the formation of water wires between the polar head groups of lipid molecules bound to subunit III and the proton uptake site Asp91 (Bos taurus enzyme numbering). Continuum electrostatic calculations suggest that these lipids directly influence the proton affinity of Asp91 by 1\u20132\u00a0pK units. We surmise that lipids bound to subunit III influence the rate of proton uptake through the D-pathway, and therefore play a key role in preventing turnover-induced inactivation.

One heme is low-spin with ligands provided by His205 and Tyr294, and the other is high-spin with a ligand provided by His35. The side chain methyl groups of Thr67 and Leu70 are positioned at a distance of 3.4\u00a0\u00c5 on either side of His35, maintaining a hydrophobic environment in the proximal pocket of the high-spin heme and restricting the movement of this ligand. Mutation of Thr67 to Ala in the proximal pocket of the high-spin heme prevented reduction of the low-spin heme by dithionite, yielding a mixed-valent state. The mutation also enhanced the stabilization of the charge\u2013resonance-transition of the high-valent bis-FeIV state that is generated by addition of H2O2. The rates of electron transfer from TTQ biosynthetic intermediates to the high-valent form of T67A MauG were similar to that of wild-type MauG. These results are compared to those previously reported for mutation of residues in the distal pocket of the high-spin heme that also affected the redox properties and charge resonance transition stabilization of the high-valent state of the hemes.

     "abstract": "The extremely acidophilic archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum is found in iron-rich biomining environments and is an important micro-organism in naturally occurring microbial communities in acid mine drainage. F. acidiphilum is an iron oxidizer that belongs to the order Thermoplasmatales (Euryarchaeota), which harbors the most extremely acidophilic micro-organisms known so far. At present, little is known about the nature or the structural and functional organization of the proteins in F. acidiphilum that impact the iron biogeochemical cycle. We combine here biochemical and biophysical techniques such as enzyme purification, activity measurements, proteomics and spectroscopy to characterize the iron oxidation pathway(s) in F. acidiphilum. We isolated two respiratory membrane protein complexes: a 850\u00a0kDa complex containing an aa3-type cytochrome oxidase and a blue copper protein, which directly oxidizes ferrous iron and reduces molecular oxygen, and a 150\u00a0kDa cytochrome ba complex likely composed of a di-heme cytochrome and a Rieske protein. We tentatively propose that both of these complexes are involved in iron oxidation respiratory chains, functioning in the so-called uphill and downhill electron flow pathways, consistent with autotrophic life. The cytochrome ba complex could possibly play a role in regenerating reducing equivalents by a reverse (\u2018uphill\u2019) electron flow. This study constitutes the first detailed biochemical investigation of the metalloproteins that are potentially directly involved in iron-mediated energy conservation in a member of the acidophilic archaea of the genus Ferroplasma.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial citrate\u2013malate exchanger (CIC), a known target of acetylation, is up-regulated in activated immune cells and plays a key role in the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the role of acetylation in CIC activity is elusive. We show that CIC is acetylated in activated primary human macrophages and U937 cells and the level of acetylation is higher in glucose-deprived compared to normal glucose medium. Acetylation enhances CIC transport activity, leading to a higher citrate efflux from mitochondria in exchange with malate. Cytosolic citrate levels do not increase upon activation of cells grown in deprived compared to normal glucose media, indicating that citrate, transported from mitochondria at higher rates from acetylated CIC, is consumed at higher rates. Malate levels in the cytosol are lower in activated cells grown in glucose-deprived compared to normal glucose medium, indicating that this TCA intermediate is rapidly recycled back into the cytosol where it is used by the malic enzyme. Additionally, in activated cells CIC inhibition increases the NADP+/NADPH ratio in glucose-deprived cells; this ratio is unchanged in glucose-rich grown cells due to the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway. Consistently, the NADPH-producing isocitrate dehydrogenase level is higher in activated glucose-deprived as compared to glucose rich cells. These results demonstrate that, in the absence of glucose, activated macrophages increase CIC acetylation to enhance citrate efflux from mitochondria not only to produce inflammatory mediators but also to meet the NADPH demand through the actions of isocitrate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Quinones are essential building blocks of respiration, a universal process dedicated to efficient harvesting of environmental energy and its conversion into a transmembrane chemiosmotic potential. Quinones differentiate mostly by their midpoint redox potential. As such, \u03b3-proteobacteria such as Escherichia coli are characterized by the presence of demethylmenaquinone (DMK) with an intermediate redox potential between low-potential (menaquinone) and high-potential (ubiquinone) quinones. In this study, we show that demethylmenaquinol (DMKH2) is a good substrate for nitrate reductase A (NarGHI) in nitrate respiration in E. coli. Kinetic studies performed with quinol analogs on NarGHI show that removal of the methyl group on the naphthoquinol ring impacts modestly the catalytic constant but not the KM. EPR-monitored redox titrations of NarGHI-enriched membrane vesicles reveal that endogeneous demethylmenasemiquinone (DMSK) intermediates are stabilized in the enzyme. The measured midpoint potential of the DMK/DMKH2 redox couple in NarGHI (E\u2032m,7.5 (DMK/DMKH2) ~\u2212\u00a070\u00a0mV) is significantly lower than that previously measured for unbound species. High resolution pulsed EPR experiments demonstrate that DMSK are formed within the NarGHI quinol oxidation site. Overall, our results provide the first characterization of a protein-bound DMSK and allows for comparison for distinct use of three quinones at a single Q-site in NarGHI.",

The Cl\u2212 transfer process of HR from Natronomonas pharaonis (NpHR) was examined utilizing a mutant strain, KM-1, which expresses large amount of NpHR in a complex with the carotenoid bacterioruberin (Brub). When Cl\u2212 was added to unphotolyzed Cl\u2212-free NpHR\u2013Brub complex, Brub caused the absorption spectral change in response to the Cl\u2212 binding to NpHR through the altered electrostatic environment and/or distortion of its own configuration. During the Cl\u2212-puming photocycle, on the other hand, oppositely directed spectral change of Brub appeared during the O intermediate formation and remained until the decay of the last intermediate NpHR\u2032. These results indicate that Cl\u2212 is released into the cytoplasmic medium during the N to O transition, and that the subsequent NpHR\u2032 still maintains an altered protein conformation while another Cl\u2212 already binds in the vicinity of the Schiff base. Using the cell envelope vesicles, the effect of the interior negative membrane potential on the photocycle was examined. The prominent effect appeared in the shift of the N\u2013O quasi-equilibrium toward N, supporting Cl\u2212 release during the N to O transition. The membrane potential had a much larger effect on the Cl\u2212 transfer in the cytoplasmic half channel compared to that in the extracellular half channel.

     "publication date": "07-2015",
     "abstract": "Both extremes of redox balance are known to cause cardiac injury, with mounting evidence revealing that the injury induced by both oxidative and reductive stress is oxidative in nature. During reductive stress, when electron acceptors are expected to be mostly reduced, some redox proteins can donate electrons to O2 instead, which increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. However, the high level of reducing equivalents also concomitantly enhances ROS scavenging systems involving redox couples such as NADPH/NADP+ and GSH/GSSG. Here our objective was to explore how reductive stress paradoxically increases net mitochondrial ROS production despite the concomitant enhancement of ROS scavenging systems. Using recombinant enzymes and isolated permeabilized cardiac mitochondria, we show that two normally antioxidant matrix NADPH reductases, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, generate H2O2 by leaking electrons from their reduced flavoprotein to O2 when electron flow is impaired by inhibitors or because of limited availability of their natural electron acceptors, GSSG and oxidized thioredoxin. The spillover of H2O2 under these conditions depends on H2O2 reduction by peroxiredoxin activity, which may regulate redox signaling in response to endogenous or exogenous factors. These findings may explain how ROS production during reductive stress overwhelms ROS scavenging capability, generating the net mitochondrial ROS spillover causing oxidative injury. These enzymes could potentially be targeted to increase cancer cell death or modulate H2O2-induced redox signaling to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion damage.",

Mitochondrial disorders including Leigh Syndrome often involve CI dysfunction, the pathophysiological consequences of which still remain incompletely understood. Here we combined experimental and computational strategies to gain mechanistic insight into the energy metabolism of isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria from 5-week-old wild-type (WT) and CI-deficient NDUFS4\u2212/\u2212 (KO) mice. Enzyme activity measurements in KO mitochondria revealed a reduction of 79% in maximal CI activity (Vmax), which was paralleled by 45\u201372% increase in Vmax of CII, CIII, CIV and citrate synthase. Mathematical modeling of mitochondrial metabolism predicted that these Vmax changes do not affect the maximal rates of pyruvate (PYR) oxidation and ATP production in KO mitochondria. This prediction was empirically confirmed by flux measurements. In silico analysis further predicted that CI deficiency altered the concentration of intermediate metabolites, modestly increased mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio and stimulated the lower half of the TCA cycle, including CII. Several of the predicted changes were previously observed in experimental models of CI-deficiency. Interestingly, model predictions further suggested that CI deficiency only has major metabolic consequences when its activity decreases below 90% of normal levels, compatible with a biochemical threshold effect. Taken together, our results suggest that mouse skeletal muscle mitochondria possess a substantial CI overcapacity, which minimizes the effects of CI dysfunction on mitochondrial metabolism in this otherwise early fatal mouse model.",

     "abstract": "In photosynthesis, photosystem II (PSII) harvests sunlight with bound pigments to oxidize water and reduce quinone to quinol, which serves as electron and proton mediators for solar-to-chemical energy conversion. At least two types of quinone cofactors in PSII are redox-linked: QA, and QB. Here, we for the first time apply 257-nm ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy to acquire the molecular vibrations of plastoquinone (PQ) in PSII membranes. Owing to the resonance enhancement effect, the vibrational signal of PQ in PSII membranes is prominent. A strong band at 1661\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 is assigned to ring CC/CO symmetric stretch mode (\u03bd8a mode) of PQ, and a weak band at 469\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 to ring stretch mode. By using a pump-probe difference UVRR method and a sample jet technique, the signals of QA and QB can be distinguished. A frequency difference of 1.4\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 in \u03bd8a vibrational mode between QA and QB is observed, corresponding to ~\u00a086\u00a0mV redox potential difference imposed by their protein environment. In addition, there are other PQs in the PSII membranes. A negligible anharmonicity effect on their combination band at 2130\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 suggests that the \u2018other PQs\u2019 are situated in a hydrophobic environment. The detection of the \u2018other PQs\u2019 might be consistent with the view that another functional PQ cofactor (not QA or QB) exists in PSII. This UVRR approach will be useful to the study of quinone molecules in photosynthesis or other biological systems.",

After FRL was turned off, plastoquinol (PQH2) accumulated, but LEF decreased more than accountable by F increase, indicating PQH2-oxidizing cyclic electron flow in PSII (CEFII). CEFII was faster under conditions requiring more ATP, consistent with CEFII being coupled with proton translocation. We propose that PQH2 bound to the QC site is oxidized, one e\u2212 moving to P680+, the other e\u2212 to Cyt b559. From Cyt b559 the e\u2212 reduces QB\u2212 at the QB site, forming PQH2. About 10\u201315% electrons may cycle, causing misses in the period-4 flash O2 evolution and lower quantum yield of photosynthesis under stress. We also measured concentration dependence of PQH2 oxidation by dioxygen, as indicated by post-illumination decrease of Chl fluorescence yield. After light was turned off, F rapidly decreased from Fm to 0.2 Fv, but further decrease to F0 was slow and O2 concentration dependent.

It consists of a Mn4CaO5-cluster close to a redox-active tyrosine residue (YZ). Cl\u2212 is also required for enzyme activity. By using EPR spectroscopy it has been shown that both Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange and Cl\u2212/I\u2212 exchange perturb the proportions of centers showing high (S\u00a0=\u00a05/2) and low spin (S\u00a0=\u00a01/2) forms of the S2-state. The S3-state was also found to be heterogeneous with: i) a S\u00a0=\u00a03 form that is detectable by EPR and not sensitive to near-infrared light; and ii) a form that is not EPR visible but in which Mn photochemistry occurs resulting in the formation of a (S2YZ)\u2032 split EPR signal upon near-infrared illumination. In Sr/Cl-PSII, the high spin (S\u00a0=\u00a05/2) form of S2 shows a marked heterogeneity with a g\u00a0=\u00a04.3 form generated at low temperature that converts to a relaxed form at g\u00a0=\u00a04.9 at higher temperatures. The high spin g\u00a0=\u00a04.9 form can then progress to the EPR detectable form of S3 at temperatures as low as 180\u00a0K whereas the low spin (S\u00a0=\u00a01/2) S2-state can only advance to the S3 state at temperatures\u00a0\u2265\u00a0235\u00a0K. Both of the two S2 configurations and the two S3 configurations are each shown to be in equilibrium at \u2265\u00a0235\u00a0K but not at 198\u00a0K. Since both S2 configurations are formed at 198\u00a0K, they likely arise from two specific populations of S1. The existence of heterogeneous populations in S1, S2 and S3 states may be related to the structural flexibility associated with the positioning of the oxygen O5 within the cluster highlighted in computational approaches and which has been linked to substrate exchange. These data are discussed in the context of recent in silico studies of the electron transfer pathways between the S2-state(s) and the S3-state(s).",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria play a key role in adaptation during stressing situations. Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation. Interestingly, we found that thermal stress promotes a 30% increase in the cardiolipin content and modifies the physical state of mitochondrial membranes. These changes have effects on mtDNA stability, adapting cells to thermal stress. Conversely, this effect is cardiolipin-dependent since a cardiolipin synthase-null mutant strain is unable to adapt to thermal stress as observed by a 60% increase of cells lacking mtDNA (\u03c10). Interestingly, we found that the loss of cardiolipin specifically affects the segregation of mtDNA to daughter cells, leading to a respiratory deficient phenotype after replication. We also provide evidence that mtDNA physically interacts with cardiolipin both in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian mitochondria. Overall, our results demonstrate that the mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin is a key determinant in the maintenance of mtDNA stability and segregation.",

     "abstract": "Cardiolipin (CL) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are the main anionic phospholipids present in the Eukarya and Bacteria domains. They participate in energy transduction by activating and stabilizing the components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Experimental evidence shows that they are synthesized by two different mechanisms which indicate that both pathways evolved convergently. Former studies on the lipid composition of archaeal membranes showed the absence of CL in these organisms, consequently, restricting it to the Eukarya and Bacteria domains. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated that both CL and PG are present as constitutive components of membranes of the haloarchaea group. However, this scenario complicates the analysis of the evolutionary origin of this biosynthetic pathway. Here I suggest that a phospholipid biosynthetic pathway in Eukarya probably arose from a chimeric event between bacterial and archaeal enzymes during the endosymbiosis event. Phylogenetic analyses support the different evolutionary origin of the enzymes comprising this pathway in bacteria and Eukarya. Based on protein domain analyses, orthologous proteins in the Archaea domain were identified. An integrative analysis of the proteins found demonstrates that CL biosynthesis in major clades of the Eukarya domain originated by chimerism between the bacteria and archaea pathways. Moreover, primary and secondary endosymbiontic events in plants and chromoalveolata respectively, reshaped this pathway again. The implications and advantages that these new enzymatic orders conferred to the Eukarya domain are discussed.",

A specific fraction of the light harvesting complex II (LHCII) has been postulated to get phosphorylated by the STN7 kinase and subsequently to migrate from PSII to PSI as part of a process called \u2018state transition\u2019. Nevertheless, the thylakoid membrane incorporates a large excess of LHCII not present in the isolatable PSII\u2013LHCII and PSI\u2013LHCII complexes. Moreover, LHCII phosphorylation is not limited to a specific LHCII pool and \u201cstate 2\u201d condition, but is found in all thylakoid domains in any constant light condition. Here, using a targeted solubilization of pigment\u2013protein complexes from different thylakoid domains, we demonstrate that even a minor detachment of LHCII leads to markedly increased fluorescence emission from LHCII and PSII both in grana core and non-appressed thylakoid membranes and the effect of the detergent to detach LHCII is enhanced in the absence of LHCII phosphorylation. These findings provide evidence that PSII and PSI are energy traps embedded in the same energetically connected LHCII lake. In the lake, PSI and LHCII are energetically connected even in the absence of LHCII phosphorylation, yet the phosphorylation enhances the interaction required for efficient energy transfer to PSI in the grana margin regions.",

We studied the effects of long-chain 3-hydroxylated fatty acids (LCHFA) that accumulate in LCHAD deficiency on liver bioenergetics using mitochondrial preparations from young rats. We provide strong evidence that 3-hydroxytetradecanoic (3HTA) and 3-hydroxypalmitic (3HPA) acids, the monocarboxylic acids that are found at the highest tissue concentrations in this disorder, act as metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. These conclusions are based on the findings that these fatty acids decreased ADP-stimulated (state 3) and uncoupled respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential and NAD(P)H content, and, in contrast, increased resting (state 4) respiration. We also verified that 3HTA and 3HPA markedly reduced Ca2\u00a0+ retention capacity and induced swelling in Ca2\u00a0+-loaded mitochondria. These effects were mediated by mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) induction since they were totally prevented by the classical MPT inhibitors cyclosporin A and ADP, as well as by ruthenium red, a Ca2\u00a0+ uptake blocker. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the major monocarboxylic LCHFA accumulating in LCHAD deficiency disrupt energy mitochondrial homeostasis in the liver.

Permeability transition pore (PTP) is a mitochondrial channel involved in cell death. We have studied the respective effects of oxygen and energy substrate deprivation on beta cell viability as well as the involvement of oxidative stress and PTP opening. Energy substrate deprivation for 1\u00a0h followed by incubation in normal conditions led to a cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive-PTP-opening in INS-1 cells and human islets. Such a procedure dramatically decreased INS-1 cells viability except when transient removal of energy substrates was performed in anoxia, in the presence of antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or when CsA or metformin inhibited PTP opening. Superoxide production increased during removal of energy substrates and increased again when normal energy substrates were restored. NAC, anoxia or metformin prevented the two phases of oxidative stress while CsA prevented the second one only. Hypoxia or anoxia alone did not induce oxidative stress, PTP opening or cell death. In conclusion, energy substrate deprivation leads to an oxidative stress followed by PTP opening, triggering beta cell death. Pharmacological prevention of PTP opening during islet transplantation may be a suitable option to improve islet survival and graft success.",

Carotenoid synthesis in the Rba. sphaeroides strain was engineered to redirect carotenoid production away from spheroidene into the spirilloxanthin synthesis pathway. The strain assembles LH2 antennas with substantial amounts of spirilloxanthin (total double-bond conjugation length N\u00a0=\u00a013) if grown anaerobically and of keto-bearing long-chain analogs [2-ketoanhydrorhodovibrin (N\u00a0=\u00a013), 2-ketospirilloxanthin (N\u00a0=\u00a014) and 2,2\u2032-diketospirilloxanthin (N\u00a0=\u00a015)] if grown semi-aerobically (with ratios that depend on growth conditions). We present the photophysical, electronic, and vibrational properties of these carotenoids, both isolated in organic media and assembled within LH2 complexes. Measurements of excited-state energy transfer to the array of excitonically coupled bacteriochlorophyll a molecules (B850) show that the mean lifetime of the first singlet excited state (S1) of the long-chain (N\u00a0\u2265\u00a013) carotenoids does not change appreciably between organic media and the protein environment. In each case, the S1 state appears to lie lower in energy than that of B850. The energy-transfer yield is ~\u00a00.4 in LH2 (from the strain grown aerobically or semi-aerobically), which is less than half that achieved for LH2 that contains short-chain (N\u00a0\u2264\u00a011) analogues. Collectively, the results suggest that the S1 excited state of the long-chain (N\u00a0\u2265\u00a013) carotenoids participates little if at all in carotenoid-to-BChl a energy transfer, which occurs predominantly via the carotenoid S2 excited state in these antennas.",

The model takes into account all individual electron transfer reactions in Complexes I and III. The model accounts for multiple, often seemingly contradictory observations on the effects of \u0394\u03a8 and \u0394pH, and for the effects of multiple substrate and inhibitor conditions, including differential effects of Complex III inhibitors antimycin A, myxothiazol and stigmatellin. Simulation results confirm that, in addition to O2\u2022\u2212 formation in Complex III and at the flavin site of Complex I, the quinone binding site of Complex I is an additional superoxide generating site that accounts for experimental observations on O2\u2022\u2212 production during reverse electron transfer. However, our simulation results predict that, when cytochrome c oxidase is inhibited during oxidation of succinate, ROS production at this site is eliminated and almost all superoxide in Complex I is generated by reduced FMN, even when the redox pressure for reverse electron transfer from succinate is strong. In addition, the model indicates that conflicting literature data on the kinetics of electron transfer in Complex III involving the iron\u2013sulfur protein-cytochrome bL complex can be resolved in favor of a dissociation of the protein only after electron transfer to cytochrome bH. The model predictions can be helpful in understanding factors driving mitochondrial superoxide formation in intact cells and tissues.",

     "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) of photosynthesis catalyzes one of the most challenging reactions in nature, the light driven oxidation of water and release of molecular oxygen. PSII couples the sequential four step oxidation of water and two step reduction of plastoquinone to single photon photochemistry with charge accumulation centers on both its electron donor and acceptor sides. Photon capture, excitation energy transfer, and trapping occur on a much faster time scale than the subsequent electron transfer and charge accumulation steps. A balance between excitation of PSII and the use of the absorbed energy to drive electron transport is essential. If the absorption of light energy increases and/or the sink capacity for photosynthetically derived electrons decreases, potentially deleterious side reactions may occur, including the production of reactive oxygen species. In response, a myriad of fast (second to minutes timescale) and reversible photoprotective mechanisms are observed to regulate PSII excitation when the environment changes more quickly than can be acclimated to by gene expression. This review compares the diverse photoprotective mechanisms that are used to dissipate (quench) PSII excitation within the antenna systems of higher land plants, green algae, diatoms, and cyanobacteria. The molecular bases of how PSII excitation pressure is sensed by the antenna system and how the antenna then reconfigures itself from a light harvesting to an energy dissipative mode are discussed.",

Similar communications may operate between spatially distant chloroplasts in large cells where photosynthetic and respiratory activities are distributed unevenly under fluctuating patterned illumination. Microfluorometry of chlorophyll fluorescence in vivo in internodal cells of the alga Chara corallina revealed that a 30-s pulse of localized light induces a transient increase (~\u00a025%) in F\u2032 fluorescence of remote cell parts exposed to dim background light at a 1.5-mm distance on the downstream side from the illuminated spot in the plane of unilateral cytoplasmic streaming but has no effect on F\u2032 at equal distance on the upstream side. An abrupt arrest of cytoplasmic streaming for about 30\u00a0s by triggering the action potential extended either the ascending or descending fronts of the F\u2032 fluorescence response, depending on the exact moment of streaming cessation. The response of F\u2032 fluorescence to localized illumination of a distant cell region was absent in dark-adapted internodes, when the localized light was applied within the first minute after switching on continuous background illumination of the whole cell, but it appeared in full after longer exposures to continuous background light. These results and the elimination of the F\u2032 response by methyl viologen known to redirect electron transport pathways beyond photosystem I indicate the importance of photosynthetic induction and the stromal redox state for long-distance communications of chloroplasts in vivo.",

     "abstract": "The biogenesis of the cauliflower curd mitochondrial proteome was investigated under cold, heat and the recovery. For the first time, two dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis was used to study the plant mitochondrial complexome in heat and heat recovery. Particularly, changes in the complex I and complex III subunits and import proteins, and the partial disintegration of matrix complexes were observed. The presence of unassembled subunits of ATP synthase was accompanied by impairment in mitochondrial translation of its subunit. In cold and heat, the transcription profiles of mitochondrial genes were uncorrelated. The in-gel activities of respiratory complexes were particularly affected after stress recovery. Despite a general stability of respiratory chain complexes in heat, functional studies showed that their activity and the ATP synthesis yield were affected. Contrary to cold stress, heat stress resulted in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation likely due to changes in alternative oxidase (AOX) activity. Stress and stress recovery differently modulated the protein level and activity of AOX. Heat stress induced an increase in AOX activity and protein level, and AOX1a and AOX1d transcript level, while heat recovery reversed the AOX protein and activity changes. Conversely, cold stress led to a decrease in AOX activity (and protein level), which was reversed after cold recovery. Thus, cauliflower AOX is only induced by heat stress. In heat, contrary to the AOX activity, the activity of rotenone-insensitive internal NADH dehydrogenase was diminished. The relevance of various steps of plant mitochondrial biogenesis to temperature stress response and recovery is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is one of the nine neurodegenerative disorders caused by expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) domains. Common pathogenic mechanisms, including bioenergetics defects, have been suggested for these so called polyQ diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanism(s) behind the metabolic dysfunction is still unclear. In this study we identified a previously unreported mechanism, involving disruption of p53 and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) activity, by which the expanded SCA7 disease protein ATXN7 causes metabolic dysregulation. The NOX1 protein is known to promote glycolytic activity, whereas the transcription factor p53 inhibits this process and instead promotes mitochondrial respiration. In a stable inducible PC12 model of SCA7, p53 and mutant ATXN7 co-aggregated and the transcriptional activity of p53 was reduced, resulting in a 50% decrease of key p53 target proteins, like AIF and TIGAR. In contrast, the expression of NOX1 was increased approximately 2 times in SCA7 cells. Together these alterations resulted in a decreased respiratory capacity, an increased reliance on glycolysis for energy production and a subsequent 20% reduction of ATP in SCA7 cells. Restoring p53 function, or suppressing NOX1 activity, both reversed the metabolic dysfunction and ameliorated mutant ATXN7 toxicity. These results hence not only enhance the understanding of the mechanisms causing metabolic dysfunction in SCA7 disease, but also identify NOX1 as a novel potential therapeutic target in SCA7 and possibly other polyQ diseases.",

The relative use of two branches in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has been studied by changing the Met axial ligands of the chlorophyll a acceptor molecules, A0A and A0B, to His. The nature of the effect on the ET is found to be species dependent. In C. reinhardtii, transient absorption and transient EPR data show that in the M688HPsaA variant, forward ET from A0A to the quinone, A1A, is blocked in 100% of the PS I complexes. In contrast, in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, forward ET from A0A to A1A is blocked in only 50% of the PS I complexes, but in those PS I complexes in which electrons reach A1A, further transfer to the iron\u2013sulfur cluster FX is blocked. Similar species differences are found for the corresponding B-branch variants. One possible explanation of this behavior is that it is the result of two conformers in which an H-bond between the His side chain and the O1 carbonyl group of A1 is either present or absent. The spectroscopic data suggest that the two conformers are present in nearly equal amounts in the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 variants, while only the conformer without the H-bond is present in the same variants of C. reinhardtii.",

     "abstract": "The soluble F1 complex of ATP synthase (FoF1) is capable of ATP hydrolysis, accomplished by the minimum catalytic core subunits \u03b13\u03b23\u03b3. A special feature of cyanobacterial F1 and chloroplast F1 (CF1) is an amino acid sequence inserted in the \u03b3-subunit. The insertion is extended slightly into the CF1 enzyme containing two additional cysteines for regulation of ATPase activity via thiol modulation. This molecular switch was transferred to a chimeric F1 by inserting the cysteine-containing fragment from spinach CF1 into a cyanobacterial \u03b3-subunit [Y. Kim et al., redox regulation of rotation of the cyanobacterial F1-ATPase containing thiol regulation switch, J Biol Chem, 286 (2011) 9071\u20139078]. Under oxidizing conditions, the obtained F1 tends to lapse into an ADP-inhibited state, a common regulation mechanism to prevent wasteful ATP hydrolysis under unfavorable circumstances. However, the information flow between thiol modulation sites on the \u03b3-subunit and catalytic sites on the \u03b2-subunits remains unclear. Here, we clarified a possible interplay for the CF1-ATPase redox regulation between structural elements of the \u03b2DELSEED-loop and the \u03b3-subunit neck region, i.e., the most convex part of the \u03b1-helical \u03b3-termini. Critical residues were assigned on the \u03b2-subunit, which received the conformation change signal produced by disulfide/dithiol formation on the \u03b3-subunit. Mutant response to the ATPase redox regulation ranged from lost to hypersensitive. Furthermore, mutant cross-link experiments and inversion of redox regulation indicated that the \u03b3-redox state might modulate the subunit interface via reorientation of the \u03b2DELSEED motif region.",

Mammalian complex I is composed of 45 subunits and harbors FMN and iron\u2013sulfur cluster cofactors. A heterogeneous disease profile is associated with complex I deficiency. In a large fraction of complex I deficiencies, the primary defect is not in any of the genes encoding a subunit. The proper assembly and function of complex I require the participation of at least 12 assembly factors or chaperones. FOXRED1 encodes a complex I-specific assembly factor and mutations in this gene result in complex I deficiency, infantile onset encephalomyopathy and Leigh syndrome. The human FOXRED1 protein is a mitochondria-targeted 486-amino acid FAD-dependent oxidoreductase. It is most closely related to N-methyl amino acid dehydrogenases. FOXRED1 orthologs are present in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. Fungal FOXRED1 orthologs were likely acquired from alphaproteobacteria by horizontal gene transfer. The phylogenetic profile of FOXRED1 orthologs does not parallel the phylogenetic profile of complex I, strongly suggesting that, at least in some organisms, FOXRED1 has a function unrelated to complex I. The only large clade where all members investigated contain both FOXRED1 and complex I is the metazoans. Some bacterial FOXRED1 genes are present in metabolic operons related to amino acid metabolism. FOXRED1 phylogenetic distribution and gene organization suggest a metabolic role for FOXRED1 in complex I biogenesis should be considered.",

     "abstract": "Photosystem I (PSI) is an essential component of photosynthetic membranes. Despite the high sequence and structural homologies, its absorption properties differ substantially in algae, plants and cyanobacteria. In particular it is characterized by the presence of low-energy chlorophylls (red forms), the number and the energy of which vary in different organisms. The PSI\u2013LHCI (PSI\u2013light harvesting complex I) complex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C.r.) is significantly larger than that of plants, containing five additional light-harvesting complexes (together binding\u00a0\u2248\u00a065 chlorophylls), and contains red forms with higher energy than plants. To understand how these differences influence excitation energy transfer and trapping in the system, we studied two PSI\u2013LHCI C.r. particles, differing in antenna size and red-form content, using time-resolved fluorescence and compared them to plant PSI\u2013LHCI. The excited state kinetics in C.r. shows the same average lifetime (50\u00a0ps) as in plants suggesting that the effect of antenna enlargement is compensated by higher energy red forms. The system equilibrates very fast, indicating that all Lhcas are well-connected, despite their long distance to the core. The differences between C.r. PSI\u2013LHCI with and without Lhca2 and Lhca9 show that these Lhcas bind red forms, although not the red-most. The red-most forms are in (or functionally close to) other Lhcas and slow down the trapping, but hardly affect the quantum efficiency, which remains as high as 97% even in a complex that contains 235 chlorophylls.",

     "abstract": "Time-resolved fluorescence measurements on grana membranes with instrumental response function of 3\u00a0ps reveal faster excitation dynamics (120\u00a0ps) than those reported previously. A possible reason for the faster decay may be a relatively low amount of \u201cextra\u201d LHCII trimers per reaction center of Photosystem II. Monte Carlo modeling of excitation dynamics in C2S2M2 form of PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes has been performed using a coarse grained model of this complex, constituting a large majority of proteins in grana membranes. The main factor responsible for the fast fluorescence decay reported in this work was the deep trap constituted by the primary charge separated state in the reaction center (950\u20131090\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01). This value is critical for a good fit, whereas typical hopping times between antenna polypeptides (from ~\u00a04.5 to ~\u00a010.5\u00a0ps) and reversible primary charge separation times (from ~\u00a04 to ~\u00a01.5\u00a0ps, respectively) are less critical. Consequently, respective mean migration times of excitation from anywhere in the PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes to reaction center range from ~\u00a030 to ~\u00a080\u00a0ps. Thus 1/4\u20132/3 of the ~\u00a0120-ps average excitation lifetime is necessary for the diffusion of excitation to reaction center, whereas the remaining time is due to the bottle-neck effect of the trap. Removal of 27% of the Lhcb6 apoprotein pool by mutagenesis of DEG5 gene caused the acceleration of the excitation decay from ~\u00a0120 to ~\u00a0100\u00a0ps. This effect may be due to the detachment of LHCII-M trimers from PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes, accompanied by deepening of the reaction center trap.",

PEI architecture and size not only modulate transfection efficiency, but also cytotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms of PEI-induced multifaceted cell damage and death are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the central mechanisms of PEI architecture- and size-dependent perturbations of integrated cellular metabolomics involve destabilization of plasma membrane and mitochondrial membranes with consequences on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolytic flux and redox homeostasis that ultimately modulate cell death. In comparison to linear PEI, the branched architectures induced greater plasma membrane destabilization and were more detrimental to glycolytic activity and OXPHOS capacity as well as being a more potent inhibitor of the cytochrome c oxidase. Accordingly, the branched architectures caused a greater lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and ATP depletion, activated AMP kinase (AMPK) and disturbed redox homeostasis through diminished availability of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), reduced antioxidant capacity of glutathione (GSH) and increased burden of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The differences in metabolic and redox imprints were further reflected in the transfection performance of the polycations, but co-treatment with the GSH precursor N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) counteracted redox dysregulation and increased the number of viable transfected cells. Integrated biomembrane integrity and metabolomic analysis provides a rapid approach for mechanistic understanding of multifactorial polycation-mediated cytotoxicity, and could form the basis for combinatorial throughput platforms for improved design and selection of safer polymeric vectors.",

     "abstract": "Inorganic carbon (Ci) is the major sink for photosynthetic reductant in organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis. In the absence of abundant Ci, the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 expresses a high affinity Ci acquisition system, the CO2-concentrating mechanisms (CCM), controlled by the transcriptional regulator CcmR and the metabolites NADP+ and \u03b1-ketoglutarate, which act as co-repressors of CcmR by modulating its DNA binding. The CCM thus responds to internal cellular redox changes during the transition from Ci-replete to Ci-limited conditions. However, the actual changes in the metabolic state of the NADPH/NADP+ system that occur during the transition to Ci-limited conditions remain ill-defined. Analysis of changes in the redox state of cells experiencing Ci limitation reveals systematic changes associated with physiological adjustments and a trend towards the quinone and NADP pools becoming highly reduced. A rapid and persistent increase in F0 was observed in cells reaching the Ci-limited state, as was the induction of photoprotective fluorescence quenching. Systematic changes in the fluorescence induction transients were also observed. As with Chl fluorescence, a transient reduction of the NADPH pool (\u2018M\u2019 peak), is assigned to State 2\u2192\u00a0State 1 transition associated with increased electron flow to NADP+. This was followed by a characteristic decline, which was abolished by Ci limitation or inhibition of the Calvin\u00a0\u2013Benson\u2013Bassham (CBB) cycle and is thus assigned to the activation of the CBB cycle. The results are consistent with the proposed regulation of the CCM and provide new information on the nature of the Chl and NADPH fluorescence induction curves.",

     "abstract": "Experiments have shown that the A-family cytochrome c oxidases pump four protons per oxygen molecule, also at a high electrochemical gradient. This has been considered a puzzle, since two of the reduction potentials involved, Cu(II) and Fe(III), were estimated from experiments to be too low to afford proton pumping at a high gradient. The present quantum mechanical study (using hybrid density functional theory) suggests a solution to this puzzle. First, the calculations show that the charge compensated Cu(II) potential for CuB is actually much higher than estimated from experiment, of the same order as the reduction potentials for the tyrosyl radical and the ferryl group, which are also involved in the catalytic cycle. The reason for the discrepancy between theory and experiment is the very large uncertainty in the experimental observations used to estimate the equilibrium potentials, mainly caused by the lack of methods for direct determination of reduced CuB. Second, the calculations show that a high energy metastable state, labeled EH, is involved during catalytic turnover. The EH state mixes the low reduction potential of Fe(III) in heme a3 with another, higher potential, here suggested to be that of the tyrosyl radical, resulting in enough exergonicity to allow proton pumping at a high gradient. In contrast, the corresponding metastable oxidized state, OH, is not significantly higher in energy than the resting state, O. Finally, to secure the involvement of the high energy EH state it is suggested that only one proton is taken up via the K-channel during catalytic turnover.",

     "abstract": "ATP-diphosphohydrolase is associated with human syncytiotrophoblast mitochondria. The activity of this enzyme is implicated in the stimulation of oxygen uptake and progesterone synthesis. We reported previously that: (1) the detergent-solubilized ATP-diphosphohydrolase has low substrate specificity, and (2) purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, tri- or diphosphates, are fully dephosphorylated in the presence of calcium or magnesium (Flores-Herrera 1999, 2002). In this study we show that ATP-diphosphohydrolase hydrolyzes first the nucleoside triphosphate to nucleoside diphosphate, and then to nucleotide monophosphate, in the case of all tested nucleotides. The activation energies (Ea) for ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP were 6.06, 4.10, 6.25, and 5.26\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively; for ADP, GDP, UDP, and CDP, they were 4.67, 5.42, 5.43, and 6.22\u00a0kcal/mol, respectively. The corresponding Arrhenius plots indicated a single rate-limiting step for each hydrolyzed nucleoside, either tri- or diphosphate. In intact mitochondria, the ADP produced by ATP-diphosphohydrolase activity depolarized the membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and stimulated oxygen uptake. Mitochondrial respiration showed the state-3/state-4 transition when ATP was added, suggesting that ATP-diphosphohydrolase and the F1F0-ATP synthase work in conjunction to avoid a futile cycle. Substrate selectivity of the ATP-diphosphohydrolase was modified by \u0394\u03a8m (i.e. ATP was preferred over GTP when the inner mitochondrial membrane was energized). In contrast, dissipation of \u0394\u03a8m by CCCP produced a loss of substrate specificity and so the ATP-diphosphohydrolase was able to hydrolyze ATP and GTP at the same rate. In intact mitochondria, ATP hydrolysis increased progesterone synthesis as compared with GTP. Although dissipation of \u0394\u03a8m by CCCP decreased progesterone synthesis, NADPH production restores steroidogenesis. Overall, our results suggest a novel physiological role for \u0394\u03a8m in steroidogenesis.",

Emission from this state, which peaks at 780\u00a0nm, has been seen [2] for both plant and cyanobacterial samples. We show that Thermosynechococcus vulcanus PS II core complexes have parallel absorbance in the 700\u2013730\u00a0nm region and similar photochemical behaviour to that seen in spinach. This establishes the low energy charge transfer state as intrinsic to the native PS II reaction centre.

The temperature and field dependence of MCD spectra establish that the system peaking near 1550\u00a0nm is a heme-to-Fe(III) charge transfer excitation. These transitions have not previously been observed for cyt b559 or cyt c550. The distinctive characteristics of the MCD signals seen at 770\u00a0nm allow us to assign absorption in this region to a dz2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0dx2\u00a0\u2212\u00a0y2 transition of Mn(III) in the Ca-Mn4O5 cluster of the oxygen evolving centre.

However, another potential source of extracellular protons is the production of CO2 during substrate oxidation: CO2 is hydrated to H2CO3, which then dissociates to HCO3\u2212\u00a0+\u00a0H+.O2 consumption and pH were monitored in a popular platform for measuring extracellular acidification (the Seahorse XF Analyzer).We found that CO2 produced during respiration caused almost stoichiometric release of H+ into the medium. With C2C12 myoblasts given glucose, respiration-derived CO2 contributed 34% of the total extracellular acidification. When glucose was omitted or replaced by palmitate or pyruvate, this value was 67\u2013100%. Analysis of primary cells, cancer cell lines, stem cell lines, and isolated synaptosomes revealed contributions of CO2-produced acidification that were usually substantial, ranging from 3% to 100% of the total acidification rate.Measurement of glycolytic rate using extracellular acidification requires differentiation between respiratory and glycolytic acid production.The data presented here demonstrate the importance of this correction when extracellular acidification is used for quantitative measurement of glycolytic flux to lactate. We describe a simple way to correct the measured extracellular acidification rate for respiratory acid production, using simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption rate.Extracellular acidification is often assumed to result solely from glycolytic lactate production, but respiratory CO2 also contributes. We demonstrate that extracellular acidification by myoblasts given glucose is 66% glycolytic and 34% respiratory and describe a method to differentiate these sources.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome bd is a prokaryotic respiratory quinol oxidase phylogenetically unrelated to heme-copper oxidases, that was found to promote virulence in some bacterial pathogens. Cytochrome bd from Escherichia coli was previously reported to contribute not only to proton motive force generation, but also to bacterial resistance to nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we investigated the interaction of the purified enzyme with peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), another harmful reactive species produced by the host to kill invading microorganisms. We found that addition of ONOO\u2212 to cytochrome bd in turnover with ascorbate and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) causes the irreversible inhibition of a small (\u2264\u00a015%) protein fraction, due to the NO generated from ONOO\u2212 and not to ONOO\u2212 itself. Consistently, addition of ONOO\u2212 to cells of the E. coli strain GO105/pTK1, expressing cytochrome bd as the only terminal oxidase, caused only a minor (\u2264\u00a05%) irreversible inhibition of O2 consumption, without measurable release of NO. Furthermore, by directly monitoring the kinetics of ONOO\u2212 decomposition by stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy, it was found that the purified E. coli cytochrome bd in turnover with O2 is able to metabolize ONOO\u2212 with an apparent turnover rate as high as ~\u00a010\u00a0mol ONOO\u2212 (mol enzyme)\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C.

Genomic crtI replacements were used to swap the native three-step Rba. sphaeroides CrtI for the four-step Pantoea agglomerans enzyme, which re-routed carotenoid biosynthesis and culminated in the production of 2,2\u2032-diketo-spirilloxanthin under semi-aerobic conditions. The new carotenoid pathway was elucidated using a combination of HPLC and mass spectrometry. Premature termination of this new pathway by inactivating crtC or crtD produced strains with lycopene or rhodopin as major carotenoids.

The copper-binding Sco protein(s) have been implicated with the metallation of this site in various model organisms.Here we analyze the role of the two Sco homologues termed ScoA and ScoB, along with two other copper chaperones, on the biogenesis of the cytochrome c oxidase in the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans by deleting each of the four genes individually or pairwise, followed by assessing the functionality of the assembled oxidase both in intact membranes and in the purified enzyme complex. Copper starvation leads to a drastic decrease of oxidase activity in membranes from strains involving the scoB deletion.

For the first hundreds of flashes following MV addition at submillimolar concentrations, the kinetics of NADPH formation were hardly modified (less than 15% decrease in signal amplitude) with a significant signal decrease only observed after more flashes or continuous illumination. The dependence of the P700 photooxidation kinetics on the MV concentration exhibited a saturation effect at 0.3\u00a0mM MV, a concentration which inhibits the recombination reactions in photosystem I. The kinetics of NADPH formation and decay under continuous light with MV at 0.3\u00a0mM showed that MV induces the oxidation of the NADP pool in darkness and that the yield of linear electron transfer decreased by only 50% after 1.5\u20132 photosystem-I turnovers. The unexpectedly poor efficiency of MV in inhibiting NADPH formation was corroborated by in vitro flash-induced absorption experiments with purified photosystem-I, ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase. These experiments showed that the second-order rate constants of MV reduction are 20 to 40-fold smaller than the competing rate constants involved in reduction of ferredoxin and ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase. The present study shows that MV, which accepts electrons in vivo both at the level of photosystem-I and ferredoxin, can be used at submillimolar concentrations to inhibit recombination reactions in photosystem-I with only a moderate decrease in the efficiency of fast reactions involved in linear electron transfer and possibly cyclic electron transfer.",

The thermal activation and pH dependence of the overall rate constants of different RC variants were measured and compared in solvents of water (H2O) and heavy water (D2O). The electron transfer variants where the electron transfer is rate limiting (wild type and M17DN, L210DN and H173EQ mutants) do not show solvent isotope effect and the significant decrease of the rate constant of the second electron transfer in these mutants is due to lowering the operational pKa of QB\u2212/QBH: 4.5 (native), 3.9 (L210DN), 3.7 (M17DN) and 3.1 (H173EQ) at pH\u00a07. On the other hand, the proton transfer variants where the proton transfer is rate limiting demonstrate solvent isotope effect of pH-independent moderate magnitude (2.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.26 (WT\u00a0+\u00a0Ni2\u00a0+), 2.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35 (WT\u00a0+\u00a0Cd2\u00a0+) and 2.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44 (L210DN/M17DN)) or pH-dependent large magnitude (5.7 at pH\u00a04 (L213DN)). Upon deuteration, the free energy and the enthalpy of activation increase in all proton transfer variants by about 1\u00a0kcal/mol and the entropy of activation becomes negligible in L210DN/M17DN mutant.

     "abstract": "The permeability transition pore (PTP) is a large channel of the mitochondrial inner membrane, the opening of which is the central event in many types of stress-induced cell death. PTP opening is induced by elevated concentrations of mitochondrial calcium. It has been demonstrated that spermine and other polyamines can delay calcium-induced swelling of isolated mitochondria, suggesting their role as inhibitors of the mitochondrial PTP. Here we further investigated the mechanism by which spermine inhibits the calcium-induced, cyclosporine A (CSA) \u2014 sensitive PTP by using three indicators: 1) calcium release from the mitochondria detected with calcium green, 2) mitochondrial membrane depolarization using TMRM, and 3) mitochondrial swelling by measuring light absorbance. We found that despite calcium release and membrane depolarization, indicative of PTP activation, mitochondria underwent only partial swelling in the presence of spermine. This was in striking contrast to the high-amplitude swelling detected in control mitochondria and in mitochondria treated with the PTP inhibitor CSA. We conclude that spermine selectively prevents opening of the high-conductance state, while allowing activation of the lower conductance state of the PTP. We propose that the existence of lower conductance, stress-induced PTP might play an important physiological role, as it is expected to allow the release of toxic levels of calcium, while keeping important molecules (e.g., NAD) within the mitochondrial matrix.",

In order to study the functional significance of minor antennae in the energetic coupling between LHCII and the PSII core, characteristics of PSII\u2013LHCII proteoliposomes, with or without minor antennae, were investigated. Two types of PSII preparations containing different antenna compositions were isolated from pea: 1) the PSII preparation composed of the PSII core complex, all of the minor antennae, and a small amount of major antennae (MCC); and 2) the purified PSII dimeric core complexes without periphery antenna (CC). They were incorporated, together with LHCII, into liposomes composed of thylakoid membrane lipids. The spectroscopic and functional characteristics were measured. 77\u00a0K fluorescence emission spectra revealed an increased spectral weight of fluorescence from PSII reaction center in the CC\u2013LHCII proteoliposomes, implying energetic coupling between LHCII and CC in the proteoliposomes lacking minor antennae. This result was further confirmed by chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics. The incorporation of LHCII together with CC markedly increased the antenna cross-section of the PSII core complex. The 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol photoreduction measurement implied that the lack of minor antennae in PSII supercomplexes did not block the energy transfer from LHCII to the PSII core complex. In conclusion, it is possible, in liposomes, that LHCII transfer energy directly to the PSII core complex, in the absence of minor antennae.",

The absence of Photosystem I allows us to reach the full assignment of the carotenoid triplet states populated in PSII under steady state illumination at low temperature. Five carotenoid triplet (3Car) populations were identified in PSII\u2013LHCII, and four in the PSII core complex. Thus, four 3Car populations are attributed to \u03b2-carotene molecules bound to the core complex. All of them show associated fluorescence emission maxima which are relatively red-shifted with respect to the bulk emission of both the PSII\u2013LHCII and the isolated core complexes.

In Thermosynechococcus elongatus, taking advantage of the robustness of the PSII variant with PsbA3 as the D1 subunit (WT*3), 4 mutants were designed hoping to get mutants nevertheless the obligatory phototrophy of this cyanobacterium. In two of them, an axial histidine ligand of the haem-iron was substituted for either a methionine, PsbE/H23M, which could be potentially a ligand or for an alanine, PsbE/H23A, which cannot. In the other mutants, PsbE/Y19F and PsbE/T26P, the environment around PsbE/H23 was expected to be modified. From EPR, MALDI-TOF and O2 evolution activity measurements, the following results were obtained: Whereas the PsbE/H23M and PsbE/H23A mutants assemble only an apo-Cytb559 the steady-state level of active PSII was comparable to that in WT*3. The lack of the haem or, in PsbE/T26P, conversion of the high-potential into a lower potential form, slowed-down the recovery rate of the O2 activity after high-light illumination but did not affect the photoinhibition rate. This resulted in the following order for the steady-state level of active PSII centers under high-light conditions: PsbE/H23M\u00a0\u2248\u00a0PsbE/H23A\u00a0<\u00a0< PsbE/Y19F\u00a0\u2264\u00a0PsbE/T26P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0WT*3.

     "abstract": "Plant photosystem II (PSII) is a multicomponent pigment-protein complex that harvests sunlight via pigments photoexcitation, and converts light energy into chemical energy. Against high light induced photodamage, excess light absorption of antenna pigments triggers the operation of photoprotection mechanism in plant PSII. Non-photochemical energy relaxation as a major photoprotection way is essentially correlated to the excess light absorption. Here we investigate the energy relaxation of plant PSII complexes with varying incident light density, by performing steady-state and transient chlorophyll fluorescence measurements of the grana membranes (called as BBY), functional moiety PSII reaction center and isolated light-harvesting complex LHCII under excess light irradiation. Based on the chlorophyll fluorescence decays of these samples, it is found that an irradiation density dependent energy relaxation occurs in the LHCII assemblies, especially in the antenna assembly of PSII supercomplexes in grana membrane, when irradiation increases to somewhat higher density levels. Correspondingly, the average chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime of the highly isolated BBY fragments gradually decreases from ~\u00a01680 to ~\u00a01360\u00a0ps with increasing the irradiation density from 6.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 to 5.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010 photon cm\u2212\u00a02 pulse\u2212\u00a01. Analysis of the relation of fluorescence decay change to the aggregation extent of LHCIIs suggests that a dense arrangement of trimeric LHCIIs is likely the structural base for the occurrence of this irradiation density dependent energy relaxation. Once altering the irradiation density, this energy relaxation is quickly reversible, implying that it may play an important role in photoprotection of plant PSII.",

Selectivity is achieved via resonance with the absorption transition of the chromophore of interest. Fluorescence line-narrowing spectroscopy is a complementary technique, in that it provides the same level of information (structure, conformation, interactions), but in this case for the emitting pigment(s) only (whether isolated or in an ensemble of interacting chromophores). The selectivity provided by these vibrational techniques allows for the analysis of pigment molecules not only when they are isolated in solvents, but also when embedded in soluble or membrane proteins and even, as shown recently, in vivo. They can be used, for instance, to relate the electronic properties of these pigment molecules to their structure and/or the physical properties of their environment. These techniques are even able to follow subtle changes in chromophore conformation associated with regulatory processes. After a short introduction to the physical principles that govern resonance Raman and fluorescence line-narrowing spectroscopies, the information content of the vibrational spectra of chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules is described in this article, together with the experiments which helped in determining which structural parameter(s) each vibrational band is sensitive to. A selection of applications is then presented, in order to illustrate how these techniques have been used in the field of photosynthesis, and what type of information has been obtained.

     "abstract": "The photosynthetic conversion of water to molecular oxygen is catalyzed by the Mn4CaO5 cluster in Photosystem II and provides nearly our entire supply of atmospheric oxygen. The Mn4CaO5 cluster accumulates oxidizing equivalents in response to light-driven photochemical events within Photosystem II and then oxidizes two molecules of water to oxygen. The Mn4CaO5 cluster converts water to oxygen much more efficiently than any synthetic catalyst because its protein environment carefully controls the cluster's reactivity at each step in its catalytic cycle. This control is achieved by precise choreography of the proton and electron transfer reactions associated with water oxidation and by careful management of substrate (water) access and proton egress. This review describes the FTIR studies undertaken over the past two decades to identify the amino acid residues that are responsible for this control and to determine the role of each. In particular, this review describes the FTIR studies undertaken to characterize the influence of the cluster's metal ligands on its activity, to delineate the proton egress pathways that link the Mn4CaO5 cluster with the thylakoid lumen, and to characterize the influence of specific residues on the water molecules that serve as substrate or as participants in the networks of hydrogen bonds that make up the water access and proton egress pathways. This information will improve our understanding of water oxidation by the Mn4CaO5 catalyst in Photosystem II and will provide insight into the design of new generations of synthetic catalysts that convert sunlight into useful forms of storable energy.

In this review, studies that assessed the mechanism of water oxidation using infrared spectroscopy are summarized focusing on electron and proton transfer dynamics. Structural changes in proteins and water molecules between intermediates known as Si states (i\u00a0=\u00a00\u20133) were detected using flash-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. Electron flow in PSII and proton release from substrate water were monitored using the infrared changes in ferricyanide as an exogenous electron acceptor and Mes buffer as a proton acceptor. Time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy provided information on the dynamics of proton-coupled electron transfer during the S-state transitions. In particular, a drastic proton movement during the lag phase (~\u00a0200\u00a0\u03bcs) before electron transfer in the S3\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S0 transition was detected directly by monitoring the infrared absorption of a polarizable proton in a hydrogen bond network. Furthermore, the proton release pathways in the PSII proteins were analyzed by FTIR difference measurements in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, isotopic substitutions, and quantum chemical calculations. Therefore, infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding the molecular mechanism of photosynthetic water oxidation.

Tyrosine-based PCET reactions are important in photosystem II, which carries out the light-induced oxidation of water, and in ribonucleotide reductase, which reduces ribonucleotides to form deoxynucleotides. Photosystem II contains two redox-active tyrosines, YD (Y160 in the D2 polypeptide) and YZ (Y161 in the D1 polypeptide). YD forms a light-induced stable radical, while YZ functions as an essential charge relay, oxidizing the catalytic Mn4CaO5 cluster on each of four photo-oxidation reactions. In Escherichia coli class 1a RNR, the \u03b22 subunit contains the radical initiator, Y122O\u00a0\u2022, which is reversibly reduced and oxidized in long range electron transfer with the \u03b12 subunit. In the isolated E. coli \u03b22 subunit, Y122O\u00a0\u2022 is a stable radical, but Y122O\u00a0\u2022 is activated for rapid PCET in an \u03b12\u03b22 substrate/effector complex. Recent results concerning the structure and function of YD, YZ, and Y122 are reviewed here. Comparison is made to recent results derived from bioengineered proteins and biomimetic compounds, in which tyrosine-based charge transfer mechanisms have been investigated.

     "abstract": "Fourier transform infrared difference spectroscopy (FTIR DS) has been widely used to study the structural details of electron transfer cofactors (and their binding sites) in many types of photosynthetic protein complexes. This review focuses in particular on work that has been done to investigate the A1 cofactor in photosystem I photosynthetic reaction centers. A review of this subject area last appeared in 2006 [1], so only work undertaken since then will be covered here.Following light excitation of intact photosystem I particles the P700+A1 secondary radical pair state is formed within 100\u00a0ps. This state decays within 300\u00a0ns at room temperature, or 300\u00a0\u03bcs at 77\u00a0K. Given the short-lived nature of this state, it is not easily studied using \u201cstatic\u201d photo-accumulation FTIR difference techniques at either temperature. Time-resolved techniques are required. This article focuses on the use of time-resolved step-scan FTIR DS for the study of the P700+A1 state in intact photosystem I. Up until now, only our group has undertaken studies in this area. So, in this article, recent work undertaken in our lab is described, where we have used low-temperature (77\u00a0K), microsecond time-resolved step-scan FTIR DS to study the P700+A1 state in photosystem I.In photosystem I a phylloquinone molecule occupies the A1 binding site. However, different quinones can be incorporated into the A1 binding site, and here work is described for photosystem I particles with plastoquinone-9, 2-phytyl naphthoquinone and 2-methyl naphthoquinone incorporated into the A1 binding site. Studies in which 18O isotope labeled phylloquinone has been incorporated into the A1 binding site are also discussed.To fully characterize PSI particles with different quinones incorporated into the A1 binding site nanosecond to millisecond visible absorption spectroscopy has been shown to be of considerable value, especially so when undertaken using identical samples under identical conditions to that used in time-resolved step-scan FTIR measurements. In this article the latest work that has been undertaken using both visible and infrared time resolved spectroscopies on the same sample will be described.Finally, vibrational spectroscopic data that has been obtained for phylloquinone in the A1 binding site in photosystem I is compared to corresponding data for ubiquinone in the QA binding site in purple bacterial reaction centers.

CcO is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain and its O2 reduction reaction is coupled with H+ pumping activity across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The former is catalyzed by heme a3 and its mechanism has been determined using a rR technique, while the latter used the protein moiety and has been investigated with an IR technique. The number of H+ relative to e\u2212 transferred in the reaction is 1:1, and their coupling is presumably performed by heme a and nearby residues. To perform this function, different parts of the protein need to cooperate with each other spontaneously and sequentially. It is the purpose of this article to describe the structural details on the coupling on the basis of the vibrational spectra of certain specified residues and chromophores involved in the reaction. Recent developments in time-resolved IR and Raman technology concomitant with protein manipulation methods have yielded profound insights into such structural changes. In particular, the new IR techniques that yielded the breakthrough are reviewed and assessed in detail.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase is the terminal enzyme in the electron transfer chain. It reduces oxygen to water and harnesses the released energy to translocate protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The mechanism by which the oxygen chemistry is coupled to proton translocation is not yet resolved owing to the difficulty of monitoring dynamic proton transfer events. Here we summarize several postulated mechanisms for proton translocation, which have been supported by a variety of vibrational spectroscopic studies. We recently proposed a proton translocation model involving proton accessibility to the regions near the propionate groups of the heme a and heme a3 redox centers of the enzyme based by hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange Raman scattering studies (Egawa et al., PLoS ONE 2013). To advance our understanding of this model and to refine the proton accessibility to the hemes, the H/D exchange dependence of the heme propionate group vibrational modes on temperature and pH was measured. The H/D exchange detected at the propionate groups of heme a3 takes place within a few seconds under all conditions. In contrast, that detected at the heme a propionates occurs in the oxidized but not the reduced enzyme and the H/D exchange is pH-dependent with a pKa of ~\u00a08.0 (faster at high pH). Analysis of the thermodynamic parameters revealed that, as the pH is varied, entropy/enthalpy compensation held the free energy of activation in a narrow range. The redox dependence of the possible proton pathways to the heme groups is discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Vibrational spectroscopies and bioenergetic systems.",

     "abstract": "The route of O2 to and from the high-spin heme in heme\u2013copper oxidases has generally been believed to emulate that of carbon monoxide (CO). Time-resolved and stationary infrared experiments in our laboratories of the fully reduced CO-bound enzymes, as well as transient optical absorption saturation kinetics studies as a function of CO pressure, have provided strong support for CO binding to CuB+ on the pathway to and from the high-spin heme. The presence of CO on CuB+ suggests that O2 binding may be compromised in CO flow-flash experiments. Time-resolved optical absorption studies show that the rate of O2 and NO binding in the bovine enzyme (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) is unaffected by the presence of CO, which is consistent with the rapid dissociation (t1/2 = 1.5\u00a0\u03bcs) of CO from CuB+. In contrast, in Thermus thermophilus (Tt) cytochrome ba3 the O2 and NO binding to heme a3 slows by an order of magnitude in the presence of CO (from 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0108\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01), but is still considerably faster (~\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcs at 1\u00a0atm O2) than the CO off-rate from CuB in the absence of O2 (milliseconds). These results show that traditional CO flow-flash experiments do not give accurate results for the physiological binding of O2 and NO in Tt ba3, namely, in the absence of CO. They also raise the question whether in CO flow-flash experiments on Tt ba3 the presence of CO on CuB+ impedes the binding of O2 to CuB+ or, if O2 does not bind to CuB+ prior to heme a3, whether the CuB+\u2013CO complex sterically restricts access of O2 to the heme. Both possibilities are discussed, and we argue that O2 binds directly to heme a3 in Tt ba3, causing CO to dissociate from CuB+ in a concerted manner through steric and/or electronic effects. This would allow CuB+ to function as an electron donor during the fast (5\u00a0\u03bcs) breaking of the OO bond. These results suggest that the binding of CO to CuB+ on the path to and from heme a3 may not be applicable to O2 and NO in all heme-copper oxidases.

     "abstract": "V-ATPase is an ATP-driven rotary motor that vectorially transports ions. Together with F-ATPase, a homologous protein, several models on the ion transport have been proposed, but their molecular mechanisms are yet unknown. V-ATPase from Enterococcus hirae forms a large supramolecular protein complex (total molecular weight: ~\u00a0700,000) and physiologically transports Na+ and Li+ across a hydrophobic lipid bilayer. Stabilization of these cations in the binding site has been discussed on the basis of X-ray crystal structures of a membrane-embedded domain, the K-ring (Na+ and Li+ bound forms). Sodium or lithium ion binding-induced difference FTIR spectra of the intact E. hirae V-ATPase have been measured in aqueous solution at physiological temperature. The results suggest that sodium or lithium ion binding induces the deprotonation of Glu139, a hydrogen-bonding change in the tyrosine residue and rigid \u03b1-helical structures. Identical difference FTIR spectra between the entire V-ATPase complex and K-ring strongly suggest that protein interaction with the I subunit does not cause large structural changes in the K-ring. This result supports the previously proposed Na+ transport mechanism by V-ATPase stating that a flip-flop movement of a carboxylate group of Glu139 without large conformational changes in the K-ring accelerates the replacement of a Na+ ion in the binding site.

Calcium has been proposed to play a role in the activation of ATP production via PKA phosphorylation in response to intramitochondrial cAMP generation. We evaluated the effect of cAMP, its membrane permeable analogs (dibutyryl-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP), and the PKA inhibitor H89 on respiration of isolated pig heart mitochondria. cAMP analogs did not stimulate State 3 respiration of Ca2\u00a0+-depleted mitochondria (82.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6% of control), in contrast to the 2-fold activation induced by 0.95\u00a0\u03bcM free Ca2\u00a0+, which was unaffected by H89. Using fluorescence and integrating sphere spectroscopy, we determined that Ca2\u00a0+ increased the reduction of NADH (8%), and of cytochromes bH (3%), c1 (3%), c (4%), and a (2%), together with a doubling of conductances for Complex I\u00a0+\u00a0III and Complex IV. None of these changes were induced by cAMP analogs nor abolished by H89. In Ca2\u00a0+-undepleted mitochondria, we observed only slight changes in State 3 respiration rates upon addition of 50\u00a0\u03bcM cAMP (85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9%), dibutyryl-cAMP (80.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2%), 8-bromo-cAMP (88.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3%), or 1\u00a0\u03bcM H89 (89.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019.9%) with respect to controls.

Addition of exogenous PKA with dibutyryl-cAMP or the constitutively active catalytic subunit of PKA to isolated mitochondria decreased State 3 respiration by only 5\u201315%.

     "abstract": "The main cofactors of Photosystem II (PSII) are borne by the D1 and D2 subunits. In the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, three psbA genes encoding D1 are found in the genome. Among the 344 residues constituting the mature form of D1, there are 21 substitutions between PsbA1 and PsbA3, 31 between PsbA1 and PsbA2, and 27 between PsbA2 and PsbA3. In a previous study (Sugiura et al., J. Biol. Chem. 287 (2012), 13336-13347) we found that the oxidation kinetics and spectroscopic properties of TyrZ were altered in PsbA2-PSII when compared to PsbA(1/3)-PSII. The comparison of the different amino acid sequences identified the residues Cys144 and Pro173 found in PsbA1 and PsbA3, as being substituted in PsbA2 by Pro144 and Met173, and thus possible candidates accounting for the changes in the geometry and/or the environment of the TyrZ/His190 phenol/imidizol motif. Indeed, these amino acids are located upstream of the \u03b1-helix bearing TyrZ and between the two \u03b1-helices bearing TyrZ and its hydrogen-bonded partner, D1/His190. Here, site-directed mutants of PSII, PsbA3/Pro173Met and PsbA2/Met173Pro, were analyzed using X- and W-band EPR and UV-visible time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The Pro173Met substitution in PsbA2-PSII versus PsbA3-PSII is shown to be the main structural determinant of the previously described functional differences between PsbA2-PSII and PsbA3-PSII. In PsbA2-PSII and PsbA3/Pro173Met-PSII, we found that the oxidation of TyrZ by P680+\u25cf was specifically slowed during the transition between S-states associated with proton release. We thus propose that the increase of the electrostatic charge of the Mn4CaO5 cluster in the S2 and S3 states could weaken the strength of the H-bond interaction between TyrZ\u25cf and D1/His190 in PsbA2 versus PsbA3 and/or induce structural modification(s) of the water molecules network around TyrZ.",

Single particle analysis of cryo-electron micrographs of C-terminal truncated (EcAhpC1\u00a0-172 and EcAhpC1\u00a0-182) and mutated forms of EcAhpC reveals the loss of decamer formation, indicating the importance of the very C-terminus of AhpC in dimer to decamer transition. The crystallographic structures of the truncated EcAhpC1\u00a0-172 and EcAhpC1\u00a0-182 demonstrate for the first time that, in contrast to the reduced form, the very C-terminus of the oxidized EcAhpC is oriented away from the AhpC dimer interface and away from the catalytic redox-center, reflecting structural rearrangements during redox-modulation and -oligomerization. Furthermore, using an ensemble of different truncated and mutated EcAhpC protein constructs the importance of the very C-terminus in AhpC activity and in AhpC\u2013AhpF assembly has been demonstrated.",

     "abstract": "Non-photochemical (dark) increases in chlorophyll a fluorescence yield associated with non-photochemical reduction of redox carriers (Fnpr) have been attributed to the reduction of plastoquinone (PQ) related to cyclic electron flow (CEF) around photosystem I. In vivo, this rise in fluorescence is associated with activity of the chloroplast plastoquinone reductase (plastid NAD(P)H:plastoquinone oxidoreductase) complex. In contrast, this signal measured in isolated thylakoids has been attributed to the activity of the protein gradient regulation-5 (PGR5)/PGR5-like (PGRL1)-associated CEF pathway. Here, we report a systematic experimentation on the origin of Fnpr in isolated thylakoids. Addition of NADPH and ferredoxin to isolated spinach thylakoids resulted in the reduction of the PQ pool, but neither its kinetics nor its inhibitor sensitivities matched those of Fnpr. Notably, Fnpr was more rapid than PQ reduction, and completely insensitive to inhibitors of the PSII QB site and oxygen evolving complex as well as inhibitors of the cytochrome b6f complex. We thus conclude that Fnpr in isolated thylakoids is not a result of redox equilibrium with bulk PQ. Redox titrations and fluorescence emission spectra imply that Fnpr is dependent on the reduction of a low potential redox component (Em about \u2212\u00a0340\u00a0mV) within photosystem II (PSII), and is likely related to earlier observations of low potential variants of QA within a subpopulation of PSII that is directly reducible by ferredoxin. The implications of these results for our understanding of CEF and other photosynthetic processes are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The orange carotenoid protein (OCP), a member of the family of blue light photoactive proteins, is required for efficient photoprotection in many cyanobacteria. Photoexcitation of the carotenoid in the OCP results in structural changes within the chromophore and the protein to give an active red form of OCP that is required for phycobilisome binding and consequent fluorescence quenching. We characterized the light-dependent structural changes by mass spectrometry-based carboxyl footprinting and found that an \u03b1 helix in the N-terminal extension of OCP plays a key role in this photoactivation process. Although this helix is located on and associates with the outside of the \u03b2-sheet core in the C-terminal domain of OCP in the dark, photoinduced changes in the domain structure disrupt this interaction. We propose that this mechanism couples light-dependent carotenoid conformational changes to global protein conformational dynamics in favor of functional phycobilisome binding, and is an essential part of the OCP photocycle.",

Lack of minor Lhcs in vivo causes impairment of PSII organization, and negatively affects electron transport rates and photoprotection capacity. Here we used picosecond-fluorescence spectroscopy to study excitation-energy transfer (EET) in thylakoid membranes isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type plants and knockout lines depleted of either two (koCP26/24 and koCP29/24) or all minor Lhcs (NoM). In the absence of all minor Lhcs, the functional connection of LHCII to the PSII cores appears to be seriously impaired whereas the \u201cdisconnected\u201d LHCII is substantially quenched. For both double knock-out mutants, excitation trapping in PSII is faster than in NoM thylakoids but slower than in WT thylakoids. In NoM thylakoids, the loss of all minor Lhcs is accompanied by an over-accumulation of LHCII, suggesting a compensating response to the reduced trapping efficiency in limiting light, which leads to a photosynthetic phenotype resembling that of low-light-acclimated plants. Finally, fluorescence kinetics and biochemical results show that the missing minor complexes are not replaced by other Lhcs, implying that they are unique among the antenna subunits and crucial for the functioning and macro-organization of PSII.",

The effect on growth and photosynthetic activity under Fe limitation were more severe than those observed under Mn limitation. Moreover, the intracellular elemental quotas of Fe and Mn were found to be linked. Fe limitation reduced the intracellular Mn quota. Mn limitation did not exert a reciprocal effect on Fe quotas. Microarray analysis comparing Mn and Fe limitation revealed a stark difference in the extent of the transcriptional response to the two limiting conditions, reflective of the physiological responses. The effects of Fe limitation on the transcriptional network are widespread while the effects on Mn limitation are highly specific.

     "abstract": "The metabolism of aerobic life uses the conversion of molecular oxygen to water as an energy source. This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) consuming four electrons and four protons, which move along specific routes. While all four electrons are transferred via the same cofactors to the binuclear reaction center (BNC), the protons take two different routes in the A-type CcO, i.e., two of the four chemical protons consumed in the reaction arrive via the D-channel in the oxidative first half starting after oxygen binding. The other two chemical protons enter via the K-channel in the reductive second half of the reaction cycle. To date, the mechanism behind these separate proton transport pathways has not been understood.In this study, we propose a model that can explain the reaction-step specific opening and closing of the K-channel by conformational and pKA changes of its central lysine 362. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal an upward movement of Lys362 towards the BNC, which had already been supposed by several experimental studies. Redox state-dependent pKA calculations provide evidence that Lys362 may protonate transiently, thereby opening the K-channel only in the reductive second half of the reaction cycle. From our results, we develop a model that assigns a key role to Lys362 in the proton gating between the two proton input channels of the A-type CcO.",

     "abstract": "In sulfate-reducing and methanogenic environments complex biopolymers are hydrolyzed and degraded by fermentative micro-organisms that produce hydrogen, carbon dioxide and short chain fatty acids. Degradation of short chain fatty acids can be coupled to methanogenesis or to sulfate-reduction. Here we study from a genome perspective why some of these micro-organisms are able to grow in syntrophy with methanogens and others are not. Bacterial strains were selected based on genome availability and upon their ability to grow on short chain fatty acids alone or in syntrophic association with methanogens. Systematic functional domain profiling allowed us to shed light on this fundamental and ecologically important question. Extra-cytoplasmic formate dehydrogenases (InterPro domain number; IPR006443), including their maturation protein FdhE (IPR024064 and IPR006452) is a typical difference between syntrophic and non-syntrophic butyrate and propionate degraders. Furthermore, two domains with a currently unknown function seem to be associated with the ability of syntrophic growth. One is putatively involved in capsule or biofilm production (IPR019079) and a second in cell division, shape-determination or sporulation (IPR018365). The sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfobacterium autotrophicum HRM2, Desulfomonile tiedjei and Desulfosporosinus meridiei were never tested for syntrophic growth, but all crucial domains were found in their genomes, which suggests their possible ability to grow in syntrophic association with methanogens. In addition, profiling domains involved in electron transfer mechanisms revealed the important role of the Rnf-complex and the formate transporter in syntrophy, and indicate that DUF224 may have a role in electron transfer in bacteria other than Syntrophomonas wolfei as well.

     "abstract": "Whether active UCP1 can reduce ROS production in brown-fat mitochondria is presently not settled. The issue is of principal significance, as it can be seen as a proof- or disproof-of-principle concerning the ability of any protein to diminish ROS production through membrane depolarization. We therefore undertook a comprehensive investigation of the significance of UCP1 for ROS production, by comparing the ROS production in brown-fat mitochondria isolated from wildtype mice (that display membrane depolarization) or from UCP1(\u2212/\u2212) mice (with a high membrane potential). We tested the significance of UCP1 for glycerol-3-phosphate-supported ROS production by three methods (fluorescent dihydroethidium and the ESR probe PHH for superoxide, and fluorescent Amplex Red for hydrogen peroxide), and followed ROS production also with succinate, acyl-CoA or pyruvate as substrate. We studied the effects of the reverse electron flow inhibitor rotenone, the UCP1 activity inhibitor GDP, and the uncoupler FCCP. We also examined the effect of a physiologically induced increase in UCP1 amount. We noted GDP effects that were not UCP1-related. We conclude that only ROS production supported by exogenously added succinate was affected by the presence of active UCP1; ROS production supported by any other tested substrate (including endogenously generated succinate) was unaffected. This conclusion indicates that UCP1 is not involved in control of ROS production in brown-fat mitochondria. Extrapolation of these data to other tissues would imply that membrane depolarization may not necessarily decrease physiologically relevant ROS production.

Relatively more B800-820 and B800-840 are produced under low light conditions, while relatively more B800-850 is produced under high light conditions. Polypeptide compositions of the three different LH2 types were determined by a combination of HPLC and TOF/MS. The B800-820, B800-840 and B800-850 LH2 types all have a heterogeneous polypeptide composition, containing multiple types of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptides, and differ in their precise polypeptide composition. They all have a mixed carotenoid composition, containing carotenoids of the spirilloxanthin series. In all cases the most abundant carotenoid is rhodopin; however, there is a shift towards carotenoids with a higher conjugation number in LH2 complexes produced under low light conditions.

In surveying all possible residues at position 131 in the M subunit, we discovered that when glutamic acid replaces the native valine the efficiency of the secondary ET is nearly two-fold higher than in the wild-type RC. The positive effect of M131 Glu is likely due to formation of a hydrogen bond with the ring V keto group of the B-side bacteriopheophytin leading to stabilization of the charge-separated state involving this cofactor. This change slows charge recombination by roughly a factor of two and affords the improved yield of the desired forward ET to the B-side quinone terminal acceptor.",

We isolated functional acpPC from the dinoflagellate Symbiodinium. Both SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis quantified the denatured subunit polypeptide molecular weight (MW) as 18\u00a0kDa. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and blue native gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) were employed to estimate the size of native acpPC complex to be 64\u201366\u00a0kDa. We also performed native ESI-MS, which can volatilize and ionize active biological samples in their native states. Our result demonstrated that the native acpPC complex carried 14 to 16 positive charges, and the MW of acpPC with all the associated pigments was found to be 66.5\u00a0kDa. Based on these data and the pigment stoichiometry, we propose that the functional light harvesting state of acpPC is a trimer. Our bioinformatic analysis indicated that Symbiodinium acpPC shares high similarity to diatom fucoxanthin Chl a/c binding protein (FCP), which tends to form a trimer. Additionally, acpPC protein sequence variation was confirmed by de novo protein sequencing. Its sequence heterogeneity is also discussed in the context of Symbiodinium eco-physiological adaptations.",

PUFAs have a number of cellular targets, including membrane proteins. They can interact with plasma membrane and intracellular potassium channels. The goal of this work was to verify the interaction between PUFAs and the most common and intensively studied mitochondrial large conductance Ca2+-regulated potassium channel (mitoBKCa). For this purpose human astrocytoma U87 MG cell lines were investigated using a patch-clamp technique. We analyzed the effects of arachidonic acid (AA); eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), which is a non-metabolizable analog of AA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The open probability (Po) of the channel did not change significantly after application of 10\u00a0\u03bcM ETYA. Po increased, however, after adding 10\u00a0\u03bcM AA. The application of 30\u00a0\u03bcM DHA or 10\u00a0\u03bcM EPA also increased the Po of the channel. Additionally, the number of open channels in the patch increased in the presence of 30\u00a0\u03bcM EPA.

The subsequent and first step exclusive to bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis, the reduction of the C7\u00a0=\u00a0C8 bond, is catalyzed by chlorophyllide oxidoreductase. It has been demonstrated that the enzyme from bacteriochlorophyll a-utilizing bacteria can catalyze the formation of compounds carrying an ethyl group at C8 from both ethyl- and vinyl-carrying substrates, indicating a surprising additional C8-vinyl reductase function, while the enzyme from organisms producing BChl b could only catalyze C7\u00a0=\u00a0C8 reduction with a vinyl substrate, but this product carried an ethylidene group at the C8 position. We have replaced the native chlorophyllide oxidoreductase-encoding genes of Rhodobacter sphaeroides with those from Blastochloris viridis, but the switch from bacteriochlorophyll a to b biosynthesis is only detected when the native conventional C8-vinyl reductase is absent.

     "abstract": "Calcium is thought to regulate respiration but it is unclear whether this is dependent on the increase in ATP demand caused by any Ca2\u00a0+ signal or to Ca2\u00a0+ itself. [Na+]i, [Ca2\u00a0+]i and [ATP]i dynamics in intact neurons exposed to different workloads in the absence and presence of Ca2\u00a0+ clearly showed that Ca2\u00a0+-stimulation of coupled respiration is required to maintain [ATP]i levels. Ca2\u00a0+ may regulate respiration by activating metabolite transport in mitochondria from outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane, or after Ca2\u00a0+ entry in mitochondria through the calcium uniporter (MCU). Two Ca2\u00a0+-regulated mitochondrial metabolite transporters are expressed in neurons, the aspartate\u2013glutamate exchanger ARALAR/AGC1/Slc25a12, a component of the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle, and the ATP-Mg/Pi exchanger SCaMC-3/APC2/Slc25a23, with S0.5 for Ca2\u00a0+ of 300\u00a0nM and 3.4\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. The lack of SCaMC-3 results in a smaller Ca2\u00a0+-dependent stimulation of respiration only at high workloads, as caused by veratridine, whereas the lack of ARALAR reduced by 46% basal OCR in intact neurons using glucose as energy source and the Ca2\u00a0+-dependent responses to all workloads: a reduction of about 65\u201370% in the response to the high workload imposed by veratridine, and completely suppression of the OCR responses to moderate (K+-depolarization) and small (carbachol) workloads, effects reverted by pyruvate supply. For K+-depolarization, this occurs in spite of the presence of large [Ca2\u00a0+]mit signals and increased formation of mitochondrial NAD(P)H. These results show that ARALAR-MAS is a major contributor of Ca2\u00a0+-stimulated respiration in neurons by providing increased pyruvate supply to mitochondria. In its absence and under moderate workloads, matrix Ca2\u00a0+ is unable to stimulate pyruvate metabolism and entry in mitochondria suggesting a limited role of MCU in these conditions.

     "abstract": "The functional or regulatory role of long-distance interactions between protein surface and interior represents an insufficiently understood aspect of protein function. Cationic screening of surface charges determines the morphology of thylakoid membrane stacks. We show that it also influences directly the light-driven reactions in the interior of photosystem II (PSII). After laser-flash excitation of PSII membrane particles from spinach, time courses of the delayed recombination fluorescence (10\u00a0\u03bcs\u201310\u00a0ms) and the variable chlorophyll-fluorescence yield (100\u00a0\u03bcs\u20131\u00a0s) were recorded in the presence of chloride salts. At low salt-concentrations, a stimulating effect was observed for the S-state transition efficiency, the time constant of O2-formation at the Mn4Ca-complex of PSII, and the halftime of re-oxidation of the primary quinone acceptor (Qa) by the secondary quinone acceptor (Qb). The cation valence determined the half-effect concentrations of the stimulating salt effect, which were around 6\u00a0\u03bcM, 200\u00a0\u03bcM and 10\u00a0mM for trivalent (LaCl3), bivalent (MgCl2, CaCl2), and monovalent cations (NaCl, KCl), respectively. A depressing high-salt effect also depended strongly on the cation valence (onset concentrations around 2\u00a0mM, 50\u00a0mM, and 500\u00a0mM). These salt effects are proposed to originate from electrostatic screening of negatively charged carboxylate sidechains, which are found in the form of carboxylate clusters at the solvent-exposed protein surface. We conclude that the influence of electrostatic screening by solvent cations manifests a functionally relevant long-distance interaction between protein surface and electron-transfer reactions in the protein interior. A relation to regulation and adaptation in response to environmental changes is conceivable.",

Molecular and genetic analyses showed replacement of all WT copies of the Synechocystis DNA with the transgenic version, thereby achieving genomic DNA homoplasmy. Biochemical analyses showed the absence of the phycocyanin \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits, and the overexpression of the kanamycin resistance NPTI protein in the \u0394cpc. Physiological analyses revealed a higher, by a factor of about 2, intensity for the saturation of photosynthesis in the \u0394cpc compared to the WT. Under limiting intensities of illumination, growth of the \u0394cpc was slower than that of the WT. This difference in the rate of cell duplication diminished gradually as growth irradiance increased. Identical rates of cell duplication of about 13\u00a0h for both WT and \u0394cpc were observed at about 800\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0photons\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 or greater.

Here we report on the influence of carotenoid composition on the organization of RC\u2013LH1 pigment\u2013protein complexes in intact membranes and cells of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Mostly dimeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes could be isolated from strains expressing native brown carotenoids when grown under illuminated/anaerobic conditions, or from strains expressing green carotenoids when grown under either illuminated/anaerobic or dark/semiaerobic conditions. However, mostly monomeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes were isolated from strains expressing the native photoprotective red carotenoid spheroidenone, which is synthesized during phototrophic growth in the presence of oxygen. Despite this marked difference, linear dichroism (LD) and light-minus-dark LD spectra of oriented intact intracytoplasmic membranes indicated that RC\u2013LH1 complexes are always assembled in ordered arrays, irrespective of variations in the relative amounts of isolated dimeric and monomeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes. We propose that part of the photoprotective response to the presence of oxygen mediated by synthesis of spheroidenone may be a switch of the structure of the RC\u2013LH1 complex from dimers to monomers, but that these monomers are still organized into the photosynthetic membrane in ordered arrays. When levels of the dimeric RC\u2013LH1 complex were very high, and in the absence of LH2, LD and \u2206LD spectra from intact cells indicated an ordered arrangement of RC\u2013LH1 complexes.

Here, we show that, in Caenorhabditis elegans, the mitochondria-localized CeEF4 (referred to as mtEF4) affects mitochondrial functions, especially at low temperature (15\u00a0\u00b0C). At worms' optimum growing temperature (20\u00a0\u00b0C), mtef4 deletion leads to self-brood size reduction, growth delay and mitochondrial dysfunction. Transcriptomic analyses show that mtef4 deletion induces retrograde pathways, including mitochondrial biogenesis and cytoplasmic translation reorganization. At low temperature (15\u00a0\u00b0C), mtef4 deletion reduces mitochondrial translation and disrupts the assembly of respiratory chain supercomplexes containing complex IV.

PTOX is important for plastid development and carotenoid biosynthesis, and its role in photosynthesis is controversially discussed. To analyze PTOX activity in photosynthetic electron transport recombinant purified PTOX fused to the maltose-binding protein was added to photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments. These membrane fragments contain the plastoquinone (PQ) pool as verified by thermoluminescence. Experimental evidence for PTOX oxidizing PQH2 is demonstrated by following chlorophyll fluorescence induction. Addition of PTOX to photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments led to a slower rise, a lower level of the maximal fluorescence and an acceleration of the fluorescence decay. This effect was only observed at low light intensities indicating that PTOX cannot compete efficiently with the reduction of the PQ pool by photosystem II at higher light intensities. PTOX attached tightly to the membranes since it was only partly removable by membrane washings. Divalent cations enhanced the effect of PTOX on chlorophyll fluorescence compared to NaCl most likely because they increase connectivity between photosystem II centers and the size of the PQ pool. Using single turnover flashes, it was shown that the level of reactive oxygen species, generated by PTOX in a side reaction, increased when the spacing between subsequent double flashes was enlarged. This shows that PTOX generates reactive oxygen species under limited substrate availability.",

Hyn is a periplasmic membrane-associated hydrogenase harboring two additional electron transfer subunits: Isp1 is a transmembrane protein, while Isp2 is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. In this work, the connection of HynSL to various electron transport pathways is studied. During photoautotrophic growth, electrons, generated from the oxidation of thiosulfate and sulfur, are donated to the photosynthetic electron transport chain via cytochromes. Electrons formed from thiosulfate and sulfur oxidation might also be also used for Hyn-dependent hydrogen evolution which was shown to be light and proton motive force driven. Hyn-linked hydrogen uptake can be promoted by both sulfur and nitrate. The electron flow from/to HynSL requires the presence of Isp2 in both directions. Hydrogenase-linked sulfur reduction could be inhibited by a QB site competitive inhibitor, terbutryne, suggesting a redox coupling between the Hyn hydrogenase and the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Based on these findings, redox linkages of Hyn hydrogenase are modeled.",

     "abstract": "Carnitine is well recognized as a key regulator of long-chain fatty acyl group translocation into the mitochondria. In addition, carnitine, as acetylcarnitine, acts as an acceptor of excess acetyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase. Here, we provide a new methodology for accurate quantification of acetylcarnitine content and determination of its localization in skeletal muscles. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI\u2013IMS) to visualize acetylcarnitine distribution in rat skeletal muscles. MALDI\u2013IMS and immunohistochemistry of serial cross-sections showed that acetylcarnitine was enriched in the slow-type muscle fibers. The concentration of ATP was lower in muscle regions with abundant acetylcarnitine, suggesting a relationship between acetylcarnitine and metabolic activity. Using our novel method, we detected an increase in acetylcarnitine content after muscle contraction. Importantly, this increase was not detected using traditional biochemical assays of homogenized muscles. We also demonstrated that acetylation of carnitine during muscle contraction was concomitant with glycogen depletion. Our methodology would be useful for the quantification of acetylcarnitine and its contraction-induced kinetics in skeletal muscles.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial respiratory chain plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and its dysfunction is implicated in a wide range of human diseases. In order to understand the global expression of local mutations in the rate of oxygen consumption or in the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) it is useful to have a mathematical model in which the changes in a given respiratory complex are properly modeled. Our aim in this paper is to provide thermodynamics respecting and structurally simple equations to represent the kinetics of each isolated complexes which can, assembled in a dynamical system, also simulate the behavior of the respiratory chain, as a whole, under a large set of different physiological and pathological conditions. On the example of the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)\u2013ubiquinol\u2013oxidoreductase (complex I) we analyze the suitability of different types of rate equations. Based on our kinetic experiments we show that very simple rate laws, as those often used in many respiratory chain models, fail to describe the kinetic behavior when applied to a wide concentration range. This led us to adapt rate equations containing the essential parameters of enzyme kinetic, maximal velocities and Henri\u2013Michaelis\u2013Menten like-constants (KM and KI) to satisfactorily simulate these data.",

     "abstract": "In plants, channeling of cytochrome c molecules between complexes III and IV has been purported to shuttle electrons within the supercomplexes instead of carrying electrons by random diffusion across the intermembrane bulk phase. However, the mode plant cytochrome c behaves inside a supercomplex such as the respirasome, formed by complexes I, III and IV, remains obscure from a structural point of view. Here, we report ab-initio Brownian dynamics calculations and nuclear magnetic resonance-driven docking computations showing two binding sites for plant cytochrome c at the head soluble domain of plant cytochrome c1, namely a non-productive (or distal) site with a long heme-to-heme distance and a functional (or proximal) site with the two heme groups close enough as to allow electron transfer. As inferred from isothermal titration calorimetry experiments, the two binding sites exhibit different equilibrium dissociation constants, for both reduced and oxidized species, that are all within the micromolar range, thus revealing the transient nature of such a respiratory complex. Although the docking of cytochrome c at the distal site occurs at the interface between cytochrome c1 and the Rieske subunit, it is fully compatible with the complex III structure. In our model, the extra distal site in complex III could indeed facilitate the functional cytochrome c channeling towards complex IV by building a \u201cfloating boat bridge\u201d of cytochrome c molecules (between complexes III and IV) in plant respirasome.",

     "abstract": "Kinetic isotope effects in reactions involving hydride transfer and their temperature dependence are powerful tools to explore dynamics of enzyme catalytic sites. In plant-type ferredoxin-NADP+ reductases the FAD cofactor exchanges a hydride with the NADP(H) coenzyme. Rates for these processes are considerably faster for the plastidic members (FNR) of the family than for those belonging to the bacterial class (FPR). Hydride transfer (HT) and deuteride transfer (DT) rates for the NADP+ coenzyme reduction of four plant-type FNRs (two representatives of the plastidic type FNRs and the other two from the bacterial class), and their temperature dependences are here examined applying a full tunnelling model with coupled environmental fluctuations. Parameters for the two plastidic FNRs confirm a tunnelling reaction with active dynamics contributions, but isotope effects on Arrhenius factors indicate a larger contribution for donor\u2013acceptor distance (DAD) dynamics in the Pisum sativum FNR reaction than in the Anabaena FNR reaction. On the other hand, parameters for bacterial FPRs are consistent with passive environmental reorganisation movements dominating the HT coordinate and no contribution of DAD sampling or gating fluctuations. This indicates that active sites of FPRs are more organised and rigid than those of FNRs. These differences must be due to adaptation of the active sites and catalytic mechanisms to fulfil their particular metabolic roles, establishing a compromise between protein flexibility and functional optimisation. Analysis of site-directed mutants in plastidic enzymes additionally indicates the requirement of a minimal optimal architecture in the catalytic complex to provide a favourable gating contribution.",

     "abstract": "Limited uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation is known to be beneficial in various laboratory models of diseases. The search for cationic uncouplers is promising as their protonophorous effect is self-limiting because these uncouplers lower membrane potential which is the driving force for their accumulation in mitochondria. In this work, the penetrating cation Rhodamine 19 butyl ester (C4R1) was found to decrease membrane potential and to stimulate respiration of mitochondria, appearing to be a stronger uncoupler than its more hydrophobic analog Rhodamine 19 dodecyl ester (C12R1). Surprisingly, C12R1 increased H+ conductance of artificial bilayer lipid membranes or induced mitochondria swelling in potassium acetate with valinomycin at concentrations lower than C4R1. This paradox might be explained by involvement of mitochondrial proteins in the uncoupling action of C4R1. In experiments with HeLa cells, C4R1 rapidly and selectively accumulated in mitochondria and stimulated oligomycin-sensitive respiration as a mild uncoupler. C4R1 was effective in preventing oxidative stress induced by brain ischemia and reperfusion in rats: it suppressed stroke-induced brain swelling and prevented the decline in neurological status more effectively than C12R1. Thus, C4R1 seems to be a promising example of a mild uncoupler efficient in treatment of brain pathologies related to oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "We report on energy transfer pathways in the main light-harvesting complex of photosynthetic relative of apicomplexan parasites, Chromera velia. This complex, denoted CLH, belongs to the family of FCP proteins and contains chlorophyll (Chl) a, violaxanthin, and the so far unidentified carbonyl carotenoid related to isofucoxanthin. The overall carotenoid-to-Chl-a energy transfer exhibits efficiency over 90% which is the largest among the FCP-like proteins studied so far. Three spectroscopically different isofucoxanthin-like molecules were identified in CLH, each having slightly different energy transfer efficiency that increases from isofucoxanthin-like molecules absorbing in the blue part of the spectrum to those absorbing in the reddest part of spectrum. Part of the energy transfer from carotenoids proceeds via the ultrafast S2 channel of both the violaxanthin and isofucoxanthin-like carotenoid, but major energy transfer pathway proceeds via the S1/ICT state of the isofucoxanthin-like carotenoid. Two S1/ICT-mediated channels characterized by time constants of ~\u00a00.5 and ~\u00a04\u00a0ps were found. For the isofucoxanthin-like carotenoid excited at 480\u00a0nm the slower channel dominates, while those excited at 540\u00a0nm employs predominantly the fast 0.5\u00a0ps channel. Comparing these data with the excited-state properties of the isofucoxanthin-like carotenoid in solution we conclude that, contrary to other members of the FCP family employing carbonyl carotenoids, CLH complex suppresses the charge transfer character of the S1/ICT state of the isofucoxanthin-like carotenoid to achieve the high carotenoid-to-Chl-a energy transfer efficiency.",

Fluorescence decay in these types of PSI preparations has been previously investigated but never under the same experimental conditions. As a result we present consistent picture of excitation dynamics in algal PSI. Temporal evolution of fluorescence spectra can be generally described by three decay components with similar lifetimes in all samples (6\u20138\u00a0ps, 25\u201330\u00a0ps, 166\u2013314\u00a0ps). In the PSI cores, the fluorescence decay is dominated by the two fastest components (~\u00a090%), which can be assigned to excitation energy trapping in the reaction center by reversible primary charge separation. Excitation dynamics in the PSI\u2013LHCI preparations is more complex because of the energy transfer between the LHCI antenna system and the core. The average trapping time of excitations created in the well coupled LHCI antenna system is about 12\u201315\u00a0ps longer than excitations formed in the PSI core antenna. Excitation dynamics in PSI\u2013LHCI complexes in whole living cells is very similar to that observed in isolated complexes.

We labelled cytbc1 complexes with gold nanobeads, each attached by a Histidine10 (His10)-tag to the C-terminus of cytc1. Electron microscopy (EM) of negatively stained chromatophore vesicles showed that the majority of the cytbc1 complexes occur as dimers in the membrane.

     "abstract": "We recently reported that mitochondria-targeted derivatives of resveratrol are cytotoxic in vitro, selectively inducing mostly necrotic death of fast-growing and tumoral cells when supplied in the low \u03bcM range (N. Sassi et al., Curr. Pharm. Des. 2014). Cytotoxicity is due to H2O2 produced upon accumulation of the compounds into mitochondria. We investigate here the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and mitochondrial depolarization caused by these agents. We find that they interact with the respiratory chain, especially complexes I and III, causing superoxide production. \u201cCapping\u201d free hydroxyls with acetyl or methyl groups increases their effectiveness as respiratory chain inhibitors, promoters of ROS generation and cytotoxic agents. Exposure to the compounds also induces an increase in the occurrence of short transient [Ca2\u00a0+] \u201cspikes\u201d in the cells. This increase is unrelated to ROS production, and it is not the cause of cell death. These molecules furthermore inhibit the F0F1 ATPase. When added to oligomycin-treated cells, the acetylated/methylated ones cause a recovery of the cellular oxygen consumption rates depressed by oligomycin. Since a protonophoric futile cycle which might account for the uncoupling effect is impossible, we speculate that the compounds may cause the transformation of the ATP synthase and/or respiratory chain complex(es) into a conduit for uncoupled proton translocation. Only in the presence of excess oligomycin the most effective derivatives appear to induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) within the cells.

     "abstract": "To investigate the role of oxidative stress and/or mitochondrial impairment in the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) during sepsis, we developed a sepsis-induced in vitro model using proximal tubular epithelial cells exposed to a bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). This investigation has provided key features on the relationship between oxidative stress and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity defects.LPS treatment resulted in an increase in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX-4), suggesting the cytosolic overexpression of nitric oxide and superoxide anion, the primary reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This oxidant state seemed to interrupt mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by reducing cytochrome c oxidase activity. As a consequence, disruptions in the electron transport and the proton pumping across the mitochondrial inner membrane occurred, leading to a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential, a release of apoptotic-inducing factors and a depletion of adenosine triphosphate. Interestingly, after being targeted by RNS and ROS, mitochondria became in turn producer of ROS, thus contributing to increase the mitochondrial dysfunction.The role of oxidants in mitochondrial dysfunction was further confirmed by the use of iNOS inhibitors or antioxidants that preserve cytochrome c oxidase activity and prevent mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. These results suggest that sepsis-induced AKI should not only be regarded as failure of energy status but also as an integrated response, including transcriptional events, ROS signaling, mitochondrial activity and metabolic orientation such as apoptosis.",

In particular, the enzyme slowly and reversibly inactivates when exposed to high concentrations of nitrate. Here, we study the kinetics of substrate inhibition and its dependence on electrode potential and substrate concentration to learn about the properties of the active and inactive forms of the enzyme. We conclude that the substrate-inhibited enzyme never significantly accumulates in the EPR-active Mo(+\u00a0V) state.

Acetobacter pasteurianus, an \u03b1-Proteobacterial acetic acid bacterium (AAB), produces UOX but not COX, although it has a partial COX gene cluster, ctaBD and ctaA, in addition to the UOX operon cyaBACD. We expressed ctaB and ctaA genes of A. pasteurianus in Escherichia coli and demonstrated their function as heme O and heme A synthases. We also found that the absence of ctaD function is likely due to accumulated mutations. These COX genes are closely related to other \u03b1-Proteobacterial COX proteins. However, the UOX operons of AAB are closely related to those of the \u03b2/\u03b3-Proteobacteria (\u03b3-type UOX), distinct from the \u03b1/\u03b2-Proteobacterial proteins (\u03b1-type UOX), but different from the other \u03b3-type UOX proteins by the absence of the cyoE heme O synthase. Thus, we suggest that A. pasteurianus has a functional \u03b3-type UOX but has lost the COX genes, with the exception of ctaB and ctaA, which supply the heme O and A moieties for UOX.

We describe bio-engineering of a Photosystem II (PSII) RC inspired peptide model, building on our earlier studies. A non-photosynthetic haem containing bacterioferritin (BFR) from Escherichia coli that expresses as a homodimer was used as a protein scaffold, incorporating redox-active cofactors mimicking those of PSII. Desirable properties include: a di-nuclear metal binding site which provides ligands for bivalent metals, a hydrophobic pocket at the dimer interface which can bind a photosensitive porphyrin and presence of tyrosine residues proximal to the bound cofactors, which can be utilised as efficient electron-tunnelling intermediates.Light-induced electron transfer from proximal tyrosine residues to the photo-oxidised ZnCe6\u2022+, in the modified BFR reconstituted with both ZnCe6 and MnII, is presented. Three site-specific tyrosine variants (Y25F, Y58F and Y45F) were made to localise the redox-active tyrosine in the engineered system. The results indicate that: presence of bound MnII is necessary to observe tyrosine oxidation in all BFR variants; Y45 the most important tyrosine as an immediate electron donor to the oxidised ZnCe6\u2022+ and that Y25 and Y58 are both redox-active in this system, but appear to function interchangebaly. High-resolution (2.1\u00a0\u00c5) crystal structures of the tyrosine variants show that there are no mutation-induced effects on the overall 3-D structure of the protein. Small effects are observed in the Y45F variant. Here, the BFR-RC represents a protein model for artificial photosynthesis.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we use the photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides to find out how the acclimation of photosynthetic apparatus to growth conditions influences the rates of energy migration toward the reaction center traps and the efficiency of charge separation at the reaction centers. To answer these questions we measured the spectral and picosecond kinetic fluorescence responses as a function of excitation intensity in membranes prepared from cells grown under different illumination conditions. A kinetic model analysis yielded the microscopic rate constants that characterize the energy transfer and trapping inside the photosynthetic unit as well as the dependence of exciton trapping efficiency on the ratio of the peripheral LH2 and core LH1 antenna complexes, and on the wavelength of the excitation light. A high quantum efficiency of trapping over 80% was observed in most cases, which decreased toward shorter excitation wavelengths within the near infrared absorption band. At a fixed excitation wavelength the efficiency declines with the LH2/LH1 ratio. From the perspective of the ecological habitat of the bacteria the higher population of peripheral antenna facilitates growth under dim light even though the energy trapping is slower in low light adapted membranes. The similar values for the trapping efficiencies in all samples imply a robust photosynthetic apparatus that functions effectively at a variety of light intensities.",

It was shown that initial formation of anion radical band of pheophytin molecule (Pheo\u2212) at 460\u00a0nm is observed with rise time of ~\u00a011\u00a0ps. The kinetics of the observed rise was ascribed to charge separation between Chl (chlorophyll a) dimer, primary electron donor in PSII (P680*) and Pheo located in D1 protein subunit (PheoD1) absorbing at 420\u00a0nm, 545\u00a0nm and 680\u00a0nm with formation of the ion-radical pair P680+PheoDI\u2212. The subsequent electron transfer from PheoD1\u2212 to primary plastoquinone electron acceptor (QA) was accompanied by relaxation of the 460-nm band and occurred within ~\u00a0250\u00a0ps in good agreement with previous measurements in Photosystem II-enriched particles and bacterial reaction centers. The subtraction of the P680+ spectrum measured at 455\u00a0ps delay from the spectra at 23\u00a0ps or 44\u00a0ps delay reveals the spectrum of PheoDI\u2212, which is very similar to that measured earlier by accumulation method. The spectrum of PheoDI\u2212 formation includes a bleaching (or red shift) of the 670\u00a0nm band indicating that Chl-670 is close to PheoD1. According to previous measurements in the femtosecond\u2013picosecond time range this Chl-670 was ascribed to ChlD1 [Shelaev, Gostev, Vishnev, Shkuropatov, Ptushenko, Mamedov, Sarkisov, Nadtochenko, Semenov and Shuvalov, J.

This light-driven reaction is catalyzed by withdrawing electrons from the Mn4CaO5-cluster (Mn-cluster) in four discrete oxidation steps [S1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0(S4\u00a0/\u00a0S0)] characterized in the Kok-cycle. In order to understand in detail the proton release events and the subsequent translocation of such energized protons, the protonation pattern of the Mn-cluster need to be elucidated. The new high-resolution PSII crystal structure from Umena, Kawakami, Shen, and Kamiya is an excellent basis to make progress in solving this problem. Following our previous work on oxidation and protonation states of the Mn-cluster, in this work, quantum chemical/electrostatic calculations were performed in order to estimate the pKa of different protons of relevant groups and atoms of the Mn-cluster such as W2, O4, O5 and His337. In broad agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work, our data suggest that W2 and His337 are likely to be in hydroxyl and neutral form, respectively, O5 and O4 to be unprotonated.

     "abstract": "The main technique employed to characterize the efficiency of water-splitting in photosynthetic preparations in terms of miss and double hit parameters and for the determination of Si (i\u00a0=\u00a02,3,0) state lifetimes is the measurement of flash-induced oxygen oscillation pattern on bare platinum (Joliot-type) electrodes. We demonstrate here that this technique is not innocent. Polarization of the electrode against an Ag/AgCl electrode leads to a time-dependent formation of hydrogen peroxide by two-electron reduction of dissolved oxygen continuously supplied by the flow buffer. While the miss and double hit parameters are almost unaffected by H2O2, a time dependent reduction of S1 to S\u2212\u00a01 occurs over a time period of 20\u00a0min. The S1 reduction can be largely prevented by adding catalase or by removing O2 from the flow buffer with N2. Importantly, we demonstrate that even at the shortest possible polarization times (40\u00a0s in our set up) the S2 and S0 decays are significantly accelerated by the side reaction with H2O2. The removal of hydrogen peroxide leads to unperturbed S2 state data that reveal three instead of the traditionally reported two phases of decay. In addition, even under the best conditions (catalase\u00a0+\u00a0N2; 40\u00a0s polarization) about 4% of S\u2212\u00a01 state is observed in well dark-adapted samples, likely indicating limitations of the equal fit approach.

     "abstract": "The D1 protein of Photosystem II (PSII) is recognized as the main target of photoinhibitory damage and exhibits a high turnover rate due to its degradation and replacement during the PSII repair cycle. Damaged D1 is replaced by newly synthesized D1 and, although reasonable, there is no direct evidence for selective replacement of damaged D1. Instead, it remains possible that increased turnover of D1 subunits occurs in a non-selective manner due for example, to a general up-regulation of proteolytic activity triggered during damaging environmental conditions, such as high light. To determine if D1 degradation is targeted to damaged D1 or generalized to all D1, we developed a genetic system involving simultaneous dual expression of wild type and mutant versions of D1 protein. Dual D1 strains (nS345P:eWT and nD170A:eWT) expressed a wild type (WT) D1 from ectopic and a damage prone mutant (D1-S345P, D1-D170A) from native locus on the chromosome. Characterization of strains showed that all dual D1 strains restore WT like phenotype with high PSII activity. Higher PSII activity indicates increased population of PSII reaction centers with WT D1. Analysis of steady state levels of D1 in nS345P:eWT by immunoblot showed an accumulation of WT D1 only. But, in vivo pulse labeling confirmed the synthesis of both S345P (exists as iD1) and WT D1 in the dual strain. Expression of nS345P:eWT in FtsH2 knockout background showed accumulation of both iD1 and D1 proteins. This demonstrates that dual D1 strains express both forms of D1, yet only damage prone PSII complexes are selected for repair providing evidence that the D1 degradation process is targeted towards damaged PSII complexes. Since the N-terminus has been previously shown to be important for the degradation of damaged D1, the possibility that the highly conserved cysteine 18 residue situated in the N-terminal domain of D1 is involved in the targeted repair process was tested by examining site directed mutants of this and the other cysteines of the D1 protein.

     "abstract": "The PsbL protein is a 4.5\u00a0kDa subunit at the monomer\u2013monomer interface of Photosystem II (PS II) consisting of a single membrane-spanning domain and a hydrophilic stretch of ~\u00a015 residues facing the cytosolic (or stromal) side of the photosystem. Deletion of conserved residues in the N-terminal region has been used to investigate the importance of this hydrophilic extension. Using Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, three deletion strains: \u2206(N6\u2013N8), \u2206(P11\u2013V12) and \u2206(E13\u2013N15), have been created. The \u2206(N6\u2013N8) and \u2206(P11\u2013V12) strains remained photoautotrophic but were more susceptible to photodamage than the wild type; however, the \u2206(E13\u2013N15) cells had the most severe phenotype. The \u0394(E13\u2013N15) mutant showed decreased photoautotrophic growth, a reduced number of PS II centers, impaired oxygen evolution in the presence of PS II-specific electron acceptors, and was highly susceptible to photodamage. The decay kinetics of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence after a single turnover saturating flash and the sensitivity to low concentrations of PS II-directed herbicides in the \u0394(E13\u2013N15) strain indicate that the binding of plastoquinone to the QB-binding site had been altered such that the affinity of QB is reduced. In addition, the PS II-specific electron acceptor 2,5-dimethyl-p-benzoquinone was found to inhibit electron transfer through the quinone-acceptor complex of the \u2206(E13\u2013N15) strain. The PsbL Y20A mutant was also investigated and it exhibited increased susceptibility to photodamage and increased herbicide sensitivity. Our data suggest that the N-terminal hydrophilic region of PsbL influences forward electron transfer from QA through indirect interactions with the D\u2013E loop of the D1 reaction center protein. Our results further indicate that disruption of interactions between the N-terminal region of PsbL and other PS II subunits or lipids destabilizes PS II dimer formation.

     "abstract": "The PsbP protein is an extrinsic subunit of photosystem II (PSII) that is essential for photoautotrophic growth in higher plants. Several crystal structures of PsbP have been reported, but the binding topology of PsbP in PSII has not yet been clarified. In this study, we report that the basic pocket of PsbP, which consists of conserved Arg48, Lys143, and Lys160, is important for the electrostatic interaction with the PSII complex. Our release-reconstitution experiment showed that the binding affinities of PsbP-R48A, -K143A, and -K160A mutated proteins to PSII were lower than that of PsbP-WT, and triple mutations of these residues greatly diminished the binding affinity to PSII. Even when maximum possible binding had occurred, the R48A, K143A, and K160A proteins showed a reduced ability to restore the rate of oxygen evolution at low chloride concentrations. Fourier transform infrared resonance (FTIR) difference spectroscopy results were consistent with the above finding, and suggested that these mutated proteins were not able to induce the normal conformational change around the Mn cluster during S1 to S2 transition. Finally, chemical cross-linking experiments suggested that the interaction between the N-terminus of PsbP with PsbE was inhibited by these mutations. These data suggest that the basic pocket of PsbP is important for proper association and interaction with PSII.

By solubilizing isolated stacked pea thylakoid membranes either with the \u03b1 or \u03b2 isomeric forms of the detergent n-dodecyl-D-maltoside, followed by sucrose density ultracentrifugation, we previously showed that PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes of types C2S2M2 and C2S2, respectively, can be isolated [S. Barera et al., Phil. Trans. R Soc. B 67 (2012) 3389\u20133399]. Here we analysed their protein composition by applying extensive bottom-up and top-down mass spectrometry on the two forms of the isolated supercomplexes. In this way, we revealed the presence of the antenna proteins Lhcb3 and Lhcb6 and of the extrinsic polypeptides PsbP, PsbQ and PsbR exclusively in the C2S2M2 supercomplex. Other proteins of the PSII core complex, common to the C2S2M2 and C2S2 supercomplexes, including the low molecular mass subunits, were also detected and characterized. To complement the proteomic study with structural information, we performed negative stain transmission electron microscopy and single particle analysis on the PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes isolated from pea thylakoid membranes solubilized with n-dodecyl-\u03b1-D-maltoside. We observed the C2S2M2 supercomplex in its intact form as the largest PSII complex in our preparations. Its dataset was further analysed in silico, together with that of the second largest identified sub-population, corresponding to its C2S2 subcomplex. In this way, we calculated 3D electron density maps for the C2S2M2 and C2S2 supercomplexes, approaching respectively 30 and 28\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, extended by molecular modelling towards the atomic level.

     "abstract": "In higher plants, thylakoid membrane protein complexes show lateral heterogeneity in their distribution: photosystem (PS) II complexes are mostly located in grana stacks, whereas PSI and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase are mostly found in the stroma-exposed thylakoids. However, recent research has revealed strong dynamics in distribution of photosystems and their light harvesting antenna along the thylakoid membrane. Here, the dark-adapted spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) thylakoid network was mechanically fragmented and the composition of distinct PSII-related proteins in various thylakoid subdomains was analyzed in order to get more insights into the composition and localization of various PSII subcomplexes and auxiliary proteins during the PSII repair cycle. Most of the PSII subunits followed rather equal distribution with roughly 70% of the proteins located collectively in the grana thylakoids and grana margins; however, the low molecular mass subunits PsbW and PsbX as well as the PsbS proteins were found to be more exclusively located in grana thylakoids. The auxiliary proteins assisting in repair cycle of PSII were mostly located in stroma-exposed thylakoids, with the exception of THYLAKOID LUMEN PROTEIN OF 18.3 (TLP18.3), which was more evenly distributed between the grana and stroma thylakoids. The TL29 protein was present exclusively in grana thylakoids. Intriguingly, PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION5 (PGR5) was found to be distributed quite evenly between grana and stroma thylakoids, whereas PGR5-LIKE PHOTOSYNTHETIC PHENOTYPE1 (PGRL1) was highly enriched in the stroma thylakoids and practically missing from the grana cores.

     "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) calculations, a semi-continuum (SC) approach, and quantum chemistry (QC) calculations were employed together to investigate the molecular mechanics of ultrafast charge separation reactions in Photosystem I (PS I) of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. A molecular model of PS I was developed with the aim to relate the atomic structure with electron transfer events in the two branches of cofactors. A structural flexibility map of PS I was constructed based on MD simulations, which demonstrated its rigid hydrophobic core and more flexible peripheral regions. The MD model permitted the study of atomic movements (dielectric polarization) in response to primary and secondary charge separations, while QC calculations were used to estimate the direct chemical effect of the A0A/A0B ligands (Met or Asn in the 688/668 position) on the redox potential of chlorophylls A0A/A0B and phylloquinones A1A/A1B. A combination of MD and SC approaches was used to estimate reorganization energies \u03bb of the primary (\u03bb1) and secondary (\u03bb2) charge separation reactions, which were found to be independent of the active branch of electron transfer; in PS I from the wild type, \u03bb1 was estimated to be 390\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0mV, while \u03bb2 was estimated to be higher at 445\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0mV. MD and QC approaches were used to describe the effect of substituting Met688PsaA/Met668PsaB by Asn688PsaA/Asn668PsaB on the energetics of electron transfer. Unlike Met, which has limited degrees of freedom in the site, Asn was found to switch between two relatively stable conformations depending on cofactor charge. The introduction of Asn and its conformation flexibility significantly affected the reorganization energy of charge separation and the redox potentials of chlorophylls A0A/A0B and phylloquinones A1A/A1B, which may explain the experimentally observed slowdown of secondary electron transfer in the M688NPsaA variant.

The absorption band of Chl f appeared during cultivation of this organism under far-red light. The absorption maximum of Chl f in organic solvents occurs at a wavelength of approximately 40\u00a0nm longer than that of Chl a. In vivo, the cells display a new absorption band at approximately 730\u00a0nm at 298\u00a0K, which is at a significantly longer wavelength than that of Chl a. We primarily assigned this band to a long wavelength form of Chl a. The function of Chl f is currently unknown. We measured the fluorescence of cells using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy in the picosecond-to-nanosecond time range and found clear differences in fluorescence properties between the cells that contained Chl f and the cells that did not. After excitation, the fluorescence peaks of photosystem I and photosystem II appeared quickly but diminished immediately. A unique fluorescence peak located at 748\u00a0nm subsequently appeared in cells containing Chl f. This finding strongly suggests that the Chl f in this alga exists in photosystem I and II complexes and is located close to each molecule of Chl a.

     "abstract": "In adaption to its specific environmental conditions, the cyanobacterium Acaryochloris marina developed two different types of light-harvesting complexes: chlorophyll-d-containing membrane-intrinsic complexes and phycocyanobilin (PCB) \u2014 containing phycobiliprotein (PBP) complexes. The latter complexes are believed to form a rod-shaped structure comprising three homo-hexamers of phycocyanin (PC), one hetero-hexamer of phycocyanin and allophycocyanin (APC) and probably a linker protein connecting the PBPs to the reaction centre. Excitation energy transfer and electron-vibrational coupling in PBPs have been investigated by selectively excited fluorescence spectra. The data reveal a rich spectral substructure with a total of five low-energy electronic states with fluorescence bands at 635\u00a0nm, 645\u00a0nm, 654\u00a0nm, 659\u00a0nm and a terminal emitter at about 673\u00a0nm. The electronic states at ~\u00a0635 and 645\u00a0nm are tentatively attributed to PC and APC, respectively, while an apparent heterogeneity among PC subunits may also play a role. The other fluorescence bands may be associated with three different isoforms of the linker protein. Furthermore, a large number of vibrational features can be identified for each electronic state with intense phonon sidebands peaking at about 31 to 37\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, which are among the highest phonon frequencies observed for photosynthetic antenna complexes. The corresponding Huang-Rhys factors S fall in the range between 0.98 (terminal emitter), 1.15 (APC), and 1.42 (PC). Two characteristic vibronic lines at about 1580 and 1634\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 appear to reflect CNH+ and CC stretching modes of the PCB chromophore, respectively.

     "abstract": "In the last ten years, a large series of studies have targeted antenna complexes of plants (Lhc) with the aim of understanding the mechanisms of light harvesting and photoprotection. Combining spectroscopy, modeling and mutation analyses, the role of individual pigments in these processes has been highlighted in vitro. In plants, however, these proteins are associated with multiple complexes of the photosystems and function within this framework. In this work, we have envisaged a way to bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo studies by knocking out in vivo pigments that have been proposed to play an important role in excitation energy transfer between the complexes or in photoprotection. We have complemented a CP24 knock-out mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana with the CP24 (Lhcb6) gene carrying a His-tag and with a mutated version lacking the ligand for chlorophyll 612, a specific pigment that in vitro experiments have indicated as the lowest energy site of the complex. Both complexes efficiently integrated into the thylakoid membrane and assembled into the PSII supercomplexes, indicating that the His-tag does not impair the organization in vivo. The presence of the His-tag allowed the purification of CP24-WT and of CP24-612 mutant in their native states. It is shown that CP24-WT coordinates 10 chlorophylls and 2 carotenoid molecules and has properties identical to those of the reconstituted complex, demonstrating that the complex self-assembled in vitro assumes the same folding as in the plant. The absence of the ligand for chlorophyll 612 leads to the loss of one Chl a and of lutein, again as in vitro, indicating the feasibility of the method.

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic organisms have developed vital strategies which allow them to switch from a light-harvesting to an energy dissipative state at the level of the antenna system in order to survive the detrimental effects of excess light illumination. These mechanisms are particularly relevant in diatoms, which grow in highly fluctuating light environments and thus require fast and strong response to changing light conditions. We performed transient absorption spectroscopy on FCPa, the main light-harvesting antenna from the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana, in the unquenched and quenched state. Our results show that in quenched FCPa two quenching channels are active and are characterized by differing rate constants and distinct spectroscopic signatures. One channel is associated with a faster quenching rate (16\u00a0ns\u2212\u00a01) and virtually no difference in spectral shape compared to the bulk unquenched chlorophylls, while a second channel is associated with a slower quenching rate (2.7\u00a0ns\u2212\u00a01) and exhibits an increased population of red-emitting states. We discuss the origin of the two processes in the context of the models proposed for the regulation of photosynthetic light-harvesting.

The Fx\u2013Chl a/c-protein (FCP) complex from the diatom Chaetoceros gracilis contains Chl c1, Chl c2, and the keto-carotenoid, Fx, as antenna pigments, in addition to Chl a. In the present study, we investigated energy transfer in the FCP complex associated with photosystem II (FCPII) of C. gracilis. For these investigations, we analyzed time-resolved fluorescence spectra, fluorescence rise and decay curves, and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data. Chl a exhibited different energy forms with fluorescence peaks ranging from 677\u00a0nm to 688\u00a0nm. Fx transferred excitation energy to lower-energy Chl a with a time constant of 300\u00a0fs. Chl c transferred excitation energy to Chl a with time constants of 500\u2013600\u00a0fs (intra-complex transfer), 600\u2013700\u00a0fs (intra-complex transfer), and 4\u20136\u00a0ps (inter-complex transfer). The latter process made a greater contribution to total Chl c-to-Chl a transfer in intact cells of C. gracilis than in the isolated FCPII complexes.

     "abstract": "Fluorescence yield relaxation following a light pulse was studied in various cyanobacteria under aerobic and microaerobic conditions. In Synechocystis PCC 6803 fluorescence yield decays in a monotonous fashion under aerobic conditions. However, under microaerobic conditions the decay exhibits a wave feature showing a dip at 30\u201350\u00a0ms after the flash followed by a transient rise, reaching maximum at ~\u00a01\u00a0s, before decaying back to the initial level. The wave phenomenon can also be observed under aerobic conditions in cells preilluminated with continuous light. Illumination preconditions cells for the wave phenomenon transiently: for few seconds in Synechocystis PCC 6803, but up to one hour in Thermosynechocystis elongatus BP-1. The wave is eliminated by inhibition of plastoquinone binding either to the QB site of Photosystem-II or the Qo site of cytochrome b6f complex by 3-(3\u2032,4\u2032-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea or 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, respectively. The wave is also absent in mutants, which lack either Photosystem-I or the NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase (NDH-1) complex. Monitoring the redox state of the plastoquinone pool revealed that the dip of the fluorescence wave corresponds to transient oxidation, whereas the following rise to re-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. It is concluded that the unusual wave feature of fluorescence yield relaxation reflects transient oxidation of highly reduced plastoquinone pool by Photosystem-I followed by its re-reduction from stromal components via the NDH-1 complex, which is transmitted back to the fluorescence yield modulator primary quinone electron acceptor via charge equilibria. Potential applications of the wave phenomenon in studying photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport are discussed.

     "abstract": "Here we show how the protein environment in terms of detergent concentration/protein aggregation state, affects the sensitivity to pH of isolated, native LHCII, in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence quenching. Three detergent concentrations (200, 20 and 6\u00a0\u03bcM n-dodecyl \u03b2-d-maltoside) have been tested. It was found that at the detergent concentration of 6\u00a0\u03bcM, low pH quenching of LHCII is close to the physiological response to lumen acidification possessing pK of 5.5. The analysis has been conducted both using arbitrary PAM fluorimetry measurements and chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime component analysis. The second led to the conclusion that the 3.5\u00a0ns component lifetime corresponds to an unnatural state of LHCII, induced by the detergent used for solubilising the protein, whilst the 2\u00a0ns component is rather the most representative lifetime component of the conformational state of LHCII in the natural thylakoid membrane environment when the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was absent. The 2\u00a0ns component is related to a pre-aggregated LHCII that makes it more sensitive to pH than the trimeric LHCII with the dominating 3.5\u00a0ns lifetime component. The pre-aggregated LHCII displayed both a faster response to protons and a shift in the pK for quenching to higher values, from 4.2 to 4.9. We concluded that environmental factors like lipids, zeaxanthin and PsbS protein that modulate NPQ in vivo could control the state of LHCII aggregation in the dark that makes it more or less sensitive to the lumen acidification.

     "abstract": "As high-intensity solar radiation can lead to extensive damage of the photosynthetic apparatus, cyanobacteria have developed various protection mechanisms to reduce the effective excitation energy transfer (EET) from the antenna complexes to the reaction center. One of them is non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of the phycobilisome (PB) fluorescence. In Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 this role is carried by the orange carotenoid protein (OCP), which reacts to high-intensity light by a series of conformational changes, enabling the binding of OCP to the PBs reducing the flow of energy into the photosystems. In this paper the mechanisms of energy migration in two mutant PB complexes of Synechocystis sp. were investigated and compared. The mutant CK is lacking phycocyanin in the PBs while the mutant \u0394PSI/PSII does not contain both photosystems. Fluorescence decay spectra with picosecond time resolution were registered using a single photon counting technique. The studies were performed in a wide range of temperatures \u2014 from 4 to 300\u00a0K. The time course of NPQ and fluorescence recovery in darkness was studied at room temperature using both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements. The OCP induced NPQ has been shown to be due to EET from PB cores to the red form of OCP under photon flux densities up to 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0photons\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. The gradual changes of the energy transfer rate from allophycocyanin to OCP were observed during the irradiation of the sample with blue light and consequent adaptation to darkness. This fact was interpreted as the revelation of intermolecular interaction between OCP and PB binding site. At low temperatures a significantly enhanced EET from allophycocyanin to terminal emitters has been shown, due to the decreased back transfer from terminal emitter to APC. The activation of OCP not only leads to fluorescence quenching, but also affects the rate constants of energy transfer as shown by model based analysis of the decay associated spectra. The results indicate that the ability of OCP to quench the fluorescence is strongly temperature dependent.

The main results are that the levels of the PSI core proteins decrease at a slower rate than those of PSII. Amongst the light-harvesting complexes, the decrease of CP26 proceeds at the same rate as for the PSII core proteins whereas it is significantly slower for CP29, and for the antenna complexes of PSI this rate is comprised between that of CP26 and CP29.

     "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis is driven via sequential action of Photosystem II (PSII) and (PSI)reaction centers via the Z-scheme. Both of these pigment\u2013membrane protein complexes are found in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. Unlike PSII, PSI is remarkably stable and does not undergo limiting photo-damage. This stability, as well as other fundamental structural differences, makes PSI the most attractive reaction centers for applied photosynthetic applications. These applied applications exploit the efficient light harvesting and high quantum yield of PSI where the isolated PSI particles are redeployed providing electrons directly as a photocurrent or, via a coupled catalyst to yield H2. Recent advances in molecular genetics, synthetic biology, and nanotechnology have merged to allow PSI to be integrated into a myriad of biohybrid devices. In photocurrent producing devices, PSI has been immobilized onto various electrode substrates with a continuously evolving toolkit of strategies and novel reagents. However, these innovative yet highly variable designs make it difficult to identify the rate-limiting steps and/or components that function as bottlenecks in PSI-biohybrid devices. In this study we aim to highlight these recent advances with a focus on identifying the similarities and differences in electrode surfaces, immobilization/orientation strategies, and artificial redox mediators. Collectively this work has been able to maintain an annual increase in photocurrent density (A\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a02) of ~\u00a010-fold over the past decade. The potential drawbacks and attractive features of some of these schemes are also discussed with their feasibility on a large-scale.

     "abstract": "We studied the periodicity of the multilamellar membrane system of granal chloroplasts in different isolated plant thylakoid membranes, using different suspension media, as well as on different detached leaves and isolated protoplasts\u2014using small-angle neutron scattering. Freshly isolated thylakoid membranes suspended in isotonic or hypertonic media, containing sorbitol supplemented with cations, displayed Bragg peaks typically between 0.019 and 0.023\u00a0\u00c5\u2212\u00a01, corresponding to spatially and statistically averaged repeat distance values of about 275\u2013330\u00a0\u00c5. Similar data obtained earlier led us in previous work to propose an origin from the periodicity of stroma thylakoid membranes. However, detached leaves, of eleven different species, infiltrated with or soaked in D2O in dim laboratory light or transpired with D2O prior to measurements, exhibited considerably smaller repeat distances, typically between 210 and 230\u00a0\u00c5, ruling out a stromal membrane origin. Similar values were obtained on isolated tobacco and spinach protoplasts. When NaCl was used as osmoticum, the Bragg peaks of isolated thylakoid membranes almost coincided with those in the same batch of leaves and the repeat distances were very close to the electron microscopically determined values in the grana. Although neutron scattering and electron microscopy yield somewhat different values, which is not fully understood, we can conclude that small-angle neutron scattering is a suitable technique to study the periodic organization of granal thylakoid membranes in intact leaves under physiological conditions and with a time resolution of minutes or shorter. We also show here, for the first time on leaves, that the periodicity of thylakoid membranes in situ responds dynamically to moderately strong illumination.

     "abstract": "The determination of pH in the cell cytoplasm or in intracellular organelles is of high relevance in cell biology. Also in plant cells, organelle-specific pH monitoring with high spatial precision is an important issue, since e.g. \u0394pH across thylakoid membranes is the driving force for ATP synthesis critically regulating photoprotective mechanisms like non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence or the xanthophyll cycle. In animal cells, pH determination can serve to monitor proton permeation across membranes and, therefore, to assay the efficiency of drugs against proton-selective transporters or ion channels. In this work, we demonstrate the applicability of the pH-sensitive GFP derivative (eGFP-pHsens, originally termed deGFP4 by Hanson et al. [1]) for pH measurements using fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) with excellent precision. eGFP-pHsens was either expressed in the cytoplasm or targeted to the mitochondria of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and applied here for monitoring activity of the M2 proton channel from influenza A virus. It is shown that the M2 protein confers high proton permeability of the plasma membrane upon expression in CHO-K1 cells resulting in rapid and strong changes of the intracellular pH upon pH changes of the extracellular medium. These pH changes are abolished in the presence of amantadine, a specific blocker of the M2 proton channel. These results were obtained using a novel multi-parameter FLIM setup that permits the simultaneous imaging of the fluorescence amplitude ratios and lifetimes of eGFP-pHsens enabling the quick and accurate pH determination with spatial resolution of 500\u00a0nm in two color channels with time resolution of below 100\u00a0ps. With FLIM, we also demonstrate the simultaneous determination of pH in the cytoplasm and mitochondria showing that the pH in the mitochondrial matrix is slightly higher (around 7.8) than that in the cytoplasm (about 7.0). The results obtained for CHO-K1 cells without M2 channels in comparison to M2-expressing cells show that the pH dynamics is determined by the specific H+ permeability of the membrane, the buffering of protons in the internal cell lumen and/or an outwardly directed proton pump activity that stabilizes the interior pH at a higher level than the external acidic pH.

The photosynthetic apparatuses of these dinoflagellates possess a unique photosynthetic antenna system incorporating the peridinin\u2013chlorophyll a\u2013protein (PCP). It has been proposed that the appearance of a PCP-specific 77\u00a0K fluorescence emission band around 672\u2013675\u00a0nm indicates that high light treatment results in PCP dissociation from intrinsic membrane antenna complexes, blocking excitation transfer to the intrinsic membrane-bound antenna complexes, chlorophyll a\u2013chlorophyll c2\u2013peridinin\u2013protein-complex (acpPC) and associated photosystems (Reynolds et al., 2008 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 105:13674\u201313678).We have tested this model using time-resolved fluorescence decay kinetics in conjunction with global fitting to compare the time-evolution of the PCP spectral bands before and after high light exposure. Our results show that no long-lived PCP fluorescence emission components appear either before or after high light treatment, indicating that the efficiency of excitation transfer from PCP to membrane antenna systems remains efficient and rapid even after exposure to high light. The apparent increased relative emission at around 675\u00a0nm was, instead, caused by strong preferential exciton quenching of the membrane antenna complexes associated with acpPC and reaction centers. This strong non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is consistent with the activation of xanthophyll-associated quenching mechanisms and the generally-observed avoidance in nature of long-lived photoexcited states that can lead to oxidative damage. The acpPC component appears to be the most strongly quenched under high light exposure suggesting that it houses the photoprotective exciton quencher.",

Photosynthetic apparatus of algae belonging to this group have been poorly characterized in the past, but they are now receiving an increasing interest also because of their possible biotechnological application in biofuel production. In this work, isolated VCP proteins have been studied by means of advanced EPR techniques in order to prove the presence of the photoprotective mechanism based on the triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer (TTET), occurring between chlorophyll and carotenoid molecules. This process has been observed before in several light harvesting complexes belonging to various photosynthetic organisms. We used Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance (ODMR) to identify the triplet states populated by photo-excitation, and describe the optical properties of the chromophores carrying the triplet states. In parallel, time-resolved EPR (TR-EPR) and pulse EPR have been employed to get insight into the TTET mechanism and reveal the structural features of the pigment sites involved in photoprotection. The analysis of the spectroscopic data shows a strong similarity among VCP, FCP from diatoms and LHC-II from higher plants. Although these antenna proteins have differentiated sequences and bind different pigments, results suggest that in all members of the LHC superfamily there is a protein core with a conserved structural organization, represented by two central carotenoids surrounded by five chlorophyll a molecules, which plays a fundamental photoprotective role in Chl triplet quenching through carotenoid triplet formation.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system consists of four electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (CI\u2013CIV) and the FoF1-ATP synthase (CV), which sustain ATP generation via chemiosmotic coupling. The latter requires an inward-directed proton-motive force (PMF) across the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) consisting of a proton (\u0394pH) and electrical charge (\u0394\u03c8) gradient. CI actively participates in sustaining these gradients via trans-MIM proton pumping. Enigmatically, at the cellular level genetic or inhibitor-induced CI dysfunction has been associated with \u0394\u03c8 depolarization or hyperpolarization. The cellular mechanism of the latter is still incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that chronic (24\u00a0h) CI inhibition in HEK293 cells induces a proton-based \u0394\u03c8 hyperpolarization in HEK293 cells without triggering reverse-mode action of CV or the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). Hyperpolarization was associated with low levels of CII-driven O2 consumption and prevented by co-inhibition of CII, CIII or CIV activity. In contrast, chronic CIII inhibition triggered CV reverse-mode action and induced \u0394\u03c8 depolarization.

     "abstract": "The binding affinity of the two substrate\u2013water molecules to the water-oxidizing Mn4CaO5 catalyst in photosystem II core complexes of the extremophilic red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae was studied in the S2 and S3 states by the exchange of bound 16O-substrate against 18O-labeled water. The rate of this exchange was detected via the membrane-inlet mass spectrometric analysis of flash-induced oxygen evolution. For both redox states a fast and slow phase of water-exchange was resolved at the mixed labeled m/z 34 mass peak: kf\u00a0=\u00a052\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and ks\u00a0=\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 in the S2 state, and kf\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and kslow\u00a0=\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 in S3, respectively. Overall these exchange rates are similar to those observed previously with preparations of other organisms. The most remarkable finding is a significantly slower exchange at the fast substrate\u2013water site in the S2 state, which confirms beyond doubt that both substrate\u2013water molecules are already bound in the S2 state. This leads to a very small change of the affinity for both the fast and the slowly exchanging substrates during the S2\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S3 transition.

Despite extensive studies, several issues pertaining to the morphology and molecular architecture of this elemental energy conversion system remain controversial or unknown. To tackle these issues, we combined electron microscope tomography, immuno-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. We found that the intracellular Rb. sphaeroides chromatophores form a continuous reticulum rather than existing as discrete vesicles. We also found that the cytochrome bc1 complex localizes to fragile chromatophore regions, which most likely constitute the tubular structures that interconnect the vesicles in the reticulum. In contrast, the peripheral light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2) is preferentially hexagonally packed within the convex vesicular regions of the membrane network. Based on these observations, we propose that the bc1 complexes are in the inter-vesicular regions and surrounded by reaction center (RC) core complexes, which in turn are bounded by arrays of peripheral antenna complexes. This arrangement affords rapid cycling of electrons between the core and bc1 complexes while maintaining efficient excitation energy transfer from LH2 domains to the RCs.",

     "abstract": "The plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) is a plastohydroquinone:oxygen oxidoreductase that shares structural similarities with alternative oxidases (AOX). Multiple roles have been attributed to PTOX, such as involvement in carotene desaturation, a safety valve function, participation in the processes of chlororespiration and setting the redox poise for cyclic electron transport. We have investigated a homogenously pure MBP fusion of PTOX. The protein forms a homo-tetrameric complex containing 2 Fe per monomer and is very specific for the plastoquinone head-group. The reaction kinetics were investigated in a soluble monophasic system using chemically reduced decyl-plastoquinone (DPQ) as the model substrate and, in addition, in a biphasic (liposomal) system in which DPQ was reduced with DT-diaphorase. While PTOX did not detectably produce reactive oxygen species in the monophasic system, their formation was observed by room temperature EPR in the biphasic system in a [DPQH2] and pH-dependent manner. This is probably the result of the higher concentration of DPQ achieved within the partial volume of the lipid bilayer and a higher Km observed with PTOX-membrane associates which is \u2248\u00a047\u00a0mM compared to the monophasic system where a Km of \u2248\u00a074\u00a0\u03bcM was determined. With liposomes and at the basic stromal pH of photosynthetically active chloroplasts, PTOX was antioxidant at low [DPQH2] gaining prooxidant properties with increasing quinol concentrations. It is concluded that in vivo, PTOX can act as a safety valve when the steady state [PQH2] is low while a certain amount of ROS is formed at high light intensities.",

     "abstract": "Ferredoxins function as electron carrier in a wide range of metabolic and regulatory reactions. It is not clear yet, whether the multiplicity of ferredoxin proteins is also reflected in functional multiplicity in photosynthetic organisms. We addressed the biological function of the bacterial-type ferredoxin, Fed7 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The expression of fed7 is induced under low CO2 conditions and further enhanced by additional high light treatment. These conditions are considered as promoting photooxidative stress, and prompted us to investigate the biological function of Fed7 under these conditions. Loss of Fed7 did not inhibit growth of the mutant strain \u0394fed7 but significantly modulated photosynthesis parameters when the mutant was grown under low CO2 and high light conditions. Characteristics of the \u0394fed7 mutant included elevated chlorophyll and photosystem I levels as well as reduced abundance and activity of photosystem II. Transcriptional profiling of the mutant under low CO2 conditions demonstrated changes in gene regulation of the carbon concentrating mechanism and photoprotective mechanisms such as the Flv2/4 electron valve, the PSII dimer stabilizing protein Sll0218, and chlorophyll biosynthesis. We conclude that the function of Fed7 is connected to coping with photooxidative stress, possibly by constituting a redox-responsive regulatory element in photoprotection. In photosynthetic eukaryotes domains homologous to Fed7 are exclusively found in chloroplast DnaJ-like proteins that are likely involved in remodeling of regulator protein complexes. It is conceivable that the regulatory function of Fed7 evolved in cyanobacteria and was recruited by Viridiplantae as the controller for the chloroplast DnaJ-like proteins.",

     "abstract": "The rapid transfer of electrons in the photosynthetic redox chain is achieved by the formation of short-lived complexes of cytochrome b6f with the electron transfer proteins plastocyanin and cytochrome c6. A balance must exist between fast intermolecular electron transfer and rapid dissociation, which requires the formation of a complex that has limited specificity. The interaction of the soluble fragment of cytochrome f and cytochrome c6 from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. PCC 7119 was studied using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The crystal structures of wild type, M58H and M58C cytochrome c6 were determined. The M58C variant is an excellent low potential mimic of the wild type protein and was used in chemical shift perturbation and paramagnetic relaxation NMR experiments to characterize the complex with cytochrome f. The interaction is highly dynamic and can be described as a pure encounter complex, with no dominant stereospecific complex. Ensemble docking calculations and Monte-Carlo simulations suggest a model in which charge\u2013charge interactions pre-orient cytochrome c6 with its haem edge toward cytochrome f to form an ensemble of orientations with extensive contacts between the hydrophobic patches on both cytochromes, bringing the two haem groups sufficiently close to allow for rapid electron transfer. This model of complex formation allows for a gradual increase and decrease of the hydrophobic interactions during association and dissociation, thus avoiding a high transition state barrier that would slow down the dissociation process.",

In order to understand in detail the proton release events and the subsequent translocation of such energized protons, the protonation pattern of the Mn-cluster need to be elucidated. The new high-resolution PSII crystal structure from Umena, Kawakami, Shen, and Kamiya is an excellent basis to make progress in solving this problem. Following our previous work on oxidation and protonation states of the Mn-cluster, in this work, quantum chemical/electrostatic calculations were performed in order to estimate the pKa of different protons of relevant groups and atoms of the Mn-cluster such as W2, O4, O5 and His337. In broad agreement with previous experimental and theoretical work, our data suggest that W2 and His337 are likely to be in hydroxyl and neutral form, respectively, O5 and O4 to be unprotonated.

ATP synthesis initiated by the addition of a limited amount of either ADP or inorganic phosphate proceeded up to very low residual concentrations of the limiting substrate. Accumulated ATP did not decrease the rate of its synthesis initiated by the addition of ADP. The amount of residual ADP determined at State 4 respiration was independent of ten-fold variation of Pi or the presence of ATP. The pH-dependence of Km for Pi could not be fitted to a simple phosphoric acid dissociation curve. Partial inhibition of respiration resulted in a decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis without affecting the ATP/ADP reached at State 4. At pH\u00a08.0, hydrolysis of ATP accumulated at State 4 was induced by a low concentration of an uncoupler, whereas complete uncoupling results in rapid inactivation of ATPase. At pH\u00a07.0, no reversal of the ATP synthase reaction by the uncoupler was seen.

     "abstract": "Apoptosis in neuronal tissue is an efficient mechanism which contributes to both normal cell development and pathological cell death. The present study explores the effects of extracellular ADP on low [K+]-induced apoptosis in rat cerebellar granule cells. ADP, released into the extracellular space in brain by multiple mechanisms, can interact with its receptor or be converted, through the actions of ectoenzymes, to adenosine. The findings reported in this paper demonstrate that ADP inhibits the proapoptotic stimulus supposedly via: i) inhibition of ROS production during early stages of apoptosis, an effect mediated by its interaction with cell receptor/s. This conclusion is validated by the increase in SOD and catalase activities as well as by the GSSG/GSH ratio value decrease, in conjunction with the drop of ROS level and the prevention of the ADP protective effect by pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2\u2032,4\u2032-disulfonic acid (PPADS), a novel functionally selective antagonist of purine receptor; ii) safeguard of the functionality of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide-1 translocator (ANT-1), which is early impaired during apoptosis. This effect is mediated by its plausible internalization into cell occurring as such or after its hydrolysis, by means of plasma membrane nucleotide metabolizing enzymes, and resynthesis into the cell. Moreover, the findings that ADP also protects ANT-1 from the toxic action of the two Alzheimer's disease peptides, i.e. A\u03b21\u201342 and NH2htau, which are known to be produced in apoptotic cerebellar neurons, further corroborate the molecular mechanism of neuroprotection by ADP, herein proposed.",

Our previous results together with the data from the literature suggest that cytoskeletal proteins, particularly \u03b2II-tubulin, are involved in the formation of complexes between mitochondria and energy consumption sites. The aim of this study was to examine the arrangement of intracellular architecture parallel to the alterations in regulation of mitochondrial respiration in rat cardiomyocytes during postnatal development, from 1\u00a0day to 6\u00a0months.Respirometric measurements were performed to study the developmental alterations of mitochondrial function. Changes in the mitochondrial arrangement and cytoarchitecture of \u03b2II- and \u03b1IV-tubulin were examined by confocal microscopy.Our results show that functional maturation of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is completed much earlier than efficient feedback regulation is established between mitochondria and ATPases via creatine kinase system. These changes are accompanied by significant remodeling of regular intermyofibrillar mitochondrial arrays aligned along the bundles of \u03b2II-tubulin. Additionally, we demonstrate that formation of regular arrangement of mitochondria is not sufficient per se to provide adult-like efficiency in metabolic feed-back regulation, but organized tubulin networks and reduction in mitochondrial outer membrane permeability for ADP are necessary as well. In conclusion, cardiomyocytes in rat heart become mature on the level of intracellular architecture and energy metabolism at the age of 3\u00a0months.",

Transient EPR studies on M688HPsaA indicate a more symmetrical electron spin distribution in the A1A phyllosemiquinone ring consistent with the presence of an H-bond to the C1 carbonyl. Ultrafast optical studies on the variants show that the 150\u00a0fs charge separation between P700 and A0 remains unaffected. Studies on the ns timescale show that 57% of the electrons are transferred from A0A\u2212 to A1A in M688HPsaA and 48% from A0B\u2212 to A1B in M668HPsaB; the remainder recombine with P700+ with 1/e times of 25\u00a0ns and 37\u00a0ns, respectively. Those electrons that reach A1A and A1B in the branch carrying the mutation are not transferred to FX, but recombine with P700+ with 1/e times of ~\u00a015\u00a0\u03bcs and ~\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcs, respectively. Hence, the His is coordinated to A0 in all populations, but in a second population, the His may be additionally H-bonded to A1. Electron transfer from A0 to A1 occurs only in the latter, but the higher redox potentials of A0 and A1 as a result of the stronger coordination bond to A0 and the proposed second H-bond to A1 preclude electron transfer to the Fe/S clusters.",

     "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is currently one of the principal multiple drug resistant bacterial pathogens causing serious infections, many of which are life-threatening. Consequently, new therapeutic targets are required to combat such infections. In the current work, we explore the type 2 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form (NADH) dehydrogenases (NDH-2s) as possible drug targets and look at the effects of phenothiazines, known to inhibit NDH-2 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. NDH-2s are monotopic membrane proteins that catalyze the transfer of electrons from NADH via flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to the quinone pool. They are required for maintaining the NADH/Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) redox balance and contribute indirectly to the generation of proton motive force. NDH-2s are not present in mammals, but are the only form of respiratory NADH dehydrogenase in several pathogens, including S. aureus. In this work, the two putative ndh genes present in the S. aureus genome were identified, cloned and expressed, and the proteins were purified and characterized. Phenothiazines were shown to inhibit both of the S. aureus NDH-2s with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values as low as 8\u00a0\u03bcM. However, evaluating the effects of phenothiazines on whole cells of S. aureus was complicated by the fact that they are also acting as uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation.

     "abstract": "The deep dichotomy of archaea and bacteria is evident in many basic traits including ribosomal protein composition, membrane lipid synthesis, cell wall constituents, and flagellar composition. Here we explore that deep dichotomy further by examining the distribution of genes for the synthesis of the central carriers of one carbon units, tetrahydrofolate (H4F) and tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT), in bacteria and archaea. The enzymes underlying those distinct biosynthetic routes are broadly unrelated across the bacterial\u2013archaeal divide, indicating that the corresponding pathways arose independently. That deep divergence in one carbon metabolism is mirrored in the structurally unrelated enzymes and different organic cofactors that methanogens (archaea) and acetogens (bacteria) use to perform methyl synthesis in their H4F- and H4MPT-dependent versions, respectively, of the acetyl-CoA pathway. By contrast, acetyl synthesis in the acetyl-CoA pathway \u2014 from a methyl group, CO2 and reduced ferredoxin \u2014 is simpler, uniform and conserved across acetogens and methanogens, and involves only transition metals as catalysts. The data suggest that the acetyl-CoA pathway, while being the most ancient of known CO2 assimilation pathways, reflects two phases in early evolution: an ancient phase in a geochemically confined and non-free-living universal common ancestor, in which acetyl thioester synthesis proceeded spontaneously with the help of geochemically supplied methyl groups, and a later phase that reflects the primordial divergence of the bacterial and archaeal stem groups, which independently invented genetically-encoded means to synthesize methyl groups via enzymatic reactions.

The quest to understand the bioenergetic ways of early life therefore is one of the crucial elements to understand the emergence of life on our planet. Over the last few years, several mutually exclusive scenarios for primordial bioenergetics have been put forward, all of which are based on some sort of empirical observation, a remarkable step forward from the previous, essentially untestable, ab initio models. We here try to present and compare these scenarios while at the same time discuss their respective empirical weaknesses.

     "abstract": "Cytochromes c are ubiquitous heme proteins that are found in most living organisms and are essential for various energy production pathways as well as other cellular processes. Their biosynthesis relies on a complex post-translational process, called cytochrome c biogenesis, responsible for the formation of stereo-specific thioether bonds between the vinyl groups of heme b (protoporphyrin IX-Fe) and the thiol groups of apocytochromes c heme-binding site (C1XXC2H) cysteine residues. In some organisms this process involves up to nine (CcmABCDEFGHI) membrane proteins working together to achieve heme ligation, designated the Cytochrome c maturation (Ccm)-System I. Here, we review recent findings related to the Ccm-System I found in bacteria, archaea and plant mitochondria, with an emphasis on protein interactions between the Ccm components and their substrates (apocytochrome c and heme). We discuss the possibility that the Ccm proteins may form a multi subunit supercomplex (dubbed \u201cCcm machine\u201d), and based on the currently available data, we present an updated version of a mechanistic model for Ccm.

     "abstract": "The heme-copper oxidases may be divided into three categories, A, B, and C, which include cytochrome c and quinol-oxidising enzymes. All three types are known to be proton pumps and are found in prokaryotes, whereas eukaryotes only contain A-type cytochrome c oxidase in their inner mitochondrial membrane. However, the bacterial B- and C-type enzymes have often been reported to pump protons with an H+/e- ratio of only one half of the unit stoichiometry in the A-type enzyme. We will show here that these observations are likely to be the result of difficulties with the measuring technique together with a higher sensitivity of the B- and C-type enzymes to the protonmotive force that opposes pumping. We find that under optimal conditions the H+/e- ratio is close to unity in all the three heme-copper oxidase subfamilies. A higher tendency for proton leak in the B- and C-type enzymes may result from less efficient gating of a proton pump mechanism that we suggest evolved before the so-called D-channel of proton transfer. There is also a discrepancy between results using whole bacterial cells vs. phospholipid vesicles inlaid with oxidase with respect to the observed proton pumping after modification of the D-channel residue asparagine-139 (Rhodobacter sphaeroides numbering) to aspartate in A-type cytochrome c oxidase. This discrepancy might also be explained by a higher sensitivity of proton pumping to protonmotive force in the mutated variant.

Similar absorbance changes were observed with this yeast oxidase as with the previously studied Rhodobacter sphaeroides and bovine mitochondrial oxidases, which suggests that the reaction proceeds along the same trajectory. However, notable differences were observed in rates and electron-transfer equilibrium constants of specific reaction steps, for example the ferryl (F) to oxidized (O) reaction was faster with the yeast (0.4\u00a0ms) than with the bovine oxidase (~\u00a01\u00a0ms) and a larger fraction CuA was oxidized with the yeast than with the bovine oxidase in the peroxy (PR) to F reaction.

We recently reported on the crystal structure of a quinol-dependent NOR (qNOR) from Geobacillus stearothermophilus [Y. Matsumoto, T. Tosha, A.V. Pisliakov, T. Hino, H. Sugimoto, S. Nagano, Y. Sugita and Y. Shiro, Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 19 (2012) 238\u2013246], and suggested that a water channel from the cytoplasm, which is not observed in cytochrome c-dependent NOR (cNOR), functions as a pathway transferring catalytic protons. Here, we further investigated the functional and structural properties of qNOR, and compared the findings with those for cNOR. The pH optimum for the enzymatic reaction of qNOR was in the alkaline range, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa cNOR showed a higher activity at an acidic pH. The considerably slower reduction rate, and a correlation of the pH dependence for enzymatic activity and the reduction rate suggest that the reduction process is the rate-determining step for the NO reduction by qNOR, while the reduction rate for cNOR was very fast and therefore is unlikely to be the rate-determining step. A close examination of the heme/non-heme iron binuclear center by resonance Raman spectroscopy indicated that qNOR has a more polar environment at the binuclear center compared with cNOR. It is plausible that a water channel enhances the accessibility of the active site to solvent water, creating a more polar environment in qNOR. This structural feature could control certain properties of the active site, such as redox potential, which could explain the different catalytic properties of the two NORs.

     "abstract": "The ability to dissipate large fractions of their absorbed light energy as heat is a vital photoprotective function of the peripheral light-harvesting pigment\u2013protein complexes in photosystem II of plants. The major component of this process, known as qE, is characterised by the appearance of low-energy (red-shifted) absorption and fluorescence bands. Although the appearance of these red states has been established, the molecular mechanism, their site and particularly their involvement in qE are strongly debated. Here, room-temperature single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the red emission states of the major plant light-harvesting complex (LHCII) in different environments, in particular conditions mimicking qE. It was found that most states correspond to peak emission at around 700\u00a0nm and are unrelated to energy dissipative states, though their frequency of occurrence increased under conditions that mimicked qE. Longer-wavelength emission appeared to be directly related to energy dissipative states, in particular emission beyond 770\u00a0nm. The ensemble average of the red emission bands shares many properties with those obtained from previous bulk in vitro and in vivo studies. We propose the existence of at least three excitation energy dissipating mechanisms in LHCII, each of which is associated with a different spectral signature and whose contribution to qE is determined by environmental control of protein conformational disorder. Emission at 700\u00a0nm is attributed to a conformational change in the Lut 2 domain, which is facilitated by the conformational change associated with the primary quenching mechanism involving Lut 1.",

On the basis of the NhaA crystal structure [21] and experimental data (reviewed in [2,22,38] we have suggested that NhaA is organized into two functional regions: (i) a cluster of amino acids responsible for pH regulation (ii) a catalytic region at the middle of the TM IV/XI assembly, with its unique antiparallel unfolded regions that cross each other forming a delicate electrostatic balance in the middle of the membrane. This unique structure contributes to the cation binding site and allows the rapid conformational changes expected for NhaA. Extended chains interrupting helices appear now a common feature for ion binding in transporters. However the NhaA fold is unique and shared by ASBTNM [30] and NapA [29]. Computation [13], electrophysiology [69] combined with biochemistry [33,47] have provided intriguing models for the mechanism of NhaA.

H+ transport at the subunit a\u2013c interface in trans-membranous Fo drives rotation of the c-ring within the membrane, with subunit c being bound in a complex with the \u03b3 and \u03b5 subunits extending from the membrane. Finally, the rotation of subunit \u03b3 within the \u03b13\u03b23 sector of F1 mechanically drives ATP synthesis within the catalytic sites. In this review, we propose and provide evidence supporting the route of proton transfer via half channels from one side of the membrane to the other, and the mechanism of gating H+ binding to and release from Asp61 of subunit c, via conformational movements of Arg210 in subunit a. We propose that protons are gated from the inside of a four-helix bundle at the periplasmic side of subunit a to drive protonation of cAsp61, and that this gating movement is facilitated by the swiveling of trans-membrane helices (TMHs) 4 and 5 at the site of interaction with cAsp61 on the periphery of the c-ring. Proton release to the cytoplasmic half channel is facilitated by the movement of aArg210 as a consequence of this proposed helical swiveling. Finally, release from the cytoplasmic half channel is mediated by residues in a complex of interacting extra-membraneous loops formed between TMHs of both subunits a and c.

A\u03b2 is produced by sequential action of \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The \u03b3-secretase complex was found in mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) suggesting that this could be a potential site of A\u03b2 production, from which A\u03b2 is further transported into the mitochondria. In vitro, A\u03b2 was shown to be imported into the mitochondria through the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex. The mitochondrial presequence protease (PreP) is responsible for A\u03b2 degradation reducing toxic effects of A\u03b2 on mitochondrial functions. The proteolytic activity of PreP is, however, lower in AD brain temporal lobe mitochondria and in AD transgenic mice models, possibly due to an increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Here, we review the intracellular mechanisms of A\u03b2 production, its mitochondrial import and the intra-mitochondrial degradation. We also discuss the implications of a reduced efficiency of mitochondrial A\u03b2 clearance for AD.

     "abstract": "The presence of two distinct types of adipose tissue, which have opposing functions, has been known for decades. White adipose tissue (WAT) is the main tissue of energy storage, while brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy as heat and is required for non-shivering thermoregulation. In the last few years, a third type of adipocyte was identified, termed the brite (\u201cbrown and white\u201d) or beige adipocyte. Their physiological control and role, however, are not fully clarified. Brite/beige adipocytes have a positive impact on systemic metabolism that is generally explained by the thermogenesis of brite/beige adipocytes; although thermogenesis has not been directly measured but is mostly inferred by gene expression data of typical thermogenic genes such as uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Here we critically review functional evidence for the thermogenic potential of brite/beige adipocytes, leading to the conclusion that direct measurements of brite/beige adipocyte bioenergetics, beyond gene regulation, are pivotal to quantify their thermogenic potential. In particular, we exemplified that the massive induction of UCP1 mRNA during the browning of isolated subcutaneous adipocytes in vitro is not reflected in significant alterations of cellular bioenergetics. Herein, we demonstrate that increases in mitochondrial respiration in response to beta-adrenergic stimulus can be independent of UCP1. Using HEK293 cells expressing UCP1, we show how to directly assess UCP1 function by adequate activation in intact cells. Finally, we provide a guide on the interpretation of UCP1 activity and the pitfalls by solely using respiration measurements. The functional analysis of beige adipocyte bioenergetics will assist to delineate the impact of browning on thermogenesis, possibly elucidating additional physiological roles and its contribution to systemic metabolism, highlighting possible avenues for future research.

     "abstract": "Oxidation of NADH in the mitochondrial matrix of aerobic cells is catalysed by mitochondrial complex I. The regulation of this mitochondrial enzyme is not completely understood. An interesting characteristic of complex I from some organisms is the ability to adopt two distinct states: the so-called catalytically active (A) and the de-active, dormant state (D). The A-form in situ can undergo de-activation when the activity of the respiratory chain is limited (i.e. in the absence of oxygen).The mechanisms and driving force behind the A/D transition of the enzyme are currently unknown, but several subunits are most likely involved in the conformational rearrangements: the accessory subunit 39\u00a0kDa (NDUFA9) and the mitochondrially encoded subunits, ND3 and ND1. These three subunits are located in the region of the quinone binding site.The A/D transition could represent an intrinsic mechanism which provides a fast response of the mitochondrial respiratory chain to oxygen deprivation. The physiological role of the accumulation of the D-form in anoxia is most probably to protect mitochondria from ROS generation due to the rapid burst of respiration following reoxygenation. The de-activation rate varies in different tissues and can be modulated by the temperature, the presence of free fatty acids and divalent cations, the NAD+/NADH ratio in the matrix, the presence of nitric oxide and oxygen availability.Cysteine-39 of the ND3 subunit, exposed in the D-form, is susceptible to covalent modification by nitrosothiols, ROS and RNS. The D-form in situ could react with natural effectors in mitochondria or with pharmacological agents. Therefore the modulation of the re-activation rate of complex I could be a way to ameliorate the ischaemia/reperfusion damage.

     "abstract": "In yeast, there is a constant growth yield during proliferation on non-fermentable substrate where the ATP generated originates from oxidative phosphorylation. This constant growth yield is due to a tight adjustment between the growth rate and the cellular mitochondrial amount. We showed that this cellular mitochondrial amount is strictly controlled by mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, the Ras/cAMP pathway is the cellular signaling pathway involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, with a direct relationship between the activity of this pathway and the cellular amount of mitochondria. The cAMP protein kinase Tpk3p is the catalytic subunit specifically involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of the mitochondrial ROS production. An overflow of mitochondrial ROS decreases mitochondrial biogenesis through a decrease in the transcriptional co-activator Hap4p, which can be assimilated to mitochondria quality control. Moreover, the glutathione redox state is shown as being an intermediate in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.

     "abstract": "Cellular oxidative stress results from the increased generation of reactive oxygen species and/or the dysfunction of the antioxidant systems. Most intracellular reactive oxygen species derive from superoxide radical although the majority of the biological effects of reactive oxygen species are mediated by hydrogen peroxide. In this contribution we overview the major cellular sites of reactive oxygen species production, with special emphasis in the mitochondrial pathways. Reactive oxygen species regulate signaling pathways involved in promoting survival and cell death, proliferation, metabolic regulation, the activation of the antioxidant response, the control of iron metabolism and Ca2\u00a0+ signaling. The reversible oxidation of cysteines in transducers of reactive oxygen species is the primary mechanism of regulation of the activity of these proteins. Next, we present the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase as a core hub in energy and cell death regulation, defining both the rate of energy metabolism and the reactive oxygen species-mediated cell death in response to chemotherapy. Two main mechanisms that affect the expression and activity of the H+-ATP synthase down-regulate oxidative phosphorylation in prevalent human carcinomas. In this context, we emphasize the prominent role played by the ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 in human carcinogenesis as an inhibitor of the H+-ATP synthase activity and a mediator of cell survival. The ATPase Inhibitory Factor 1 promotes metabolic rewiring to an enhanced aerobic glycolysis and the subsequent production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. The generated reactive oxygen species are able to reprogram the nucleus to support tumor development by arresting cell death. Overall, we discuss the cross-talk between reactive oxygen species signaling and mitochondrial function that is crucial in determining the cellular fate.

     "abstract": "We establish the genotype\u2013phenotype correlations for the complete spectrum of POLG syndromes by refining our previously described protocol for mapping pathogenic mutations in the human POLG gene to functional clusters in the catalytic core of the mitochondrial replicase, Pol \u03b3 (1). We assigned 136 mutations to five clusters and identify segments of primary sequence that can be used to delimit the boundaries of each cluster. We report that compound heterozygotes with two mutations from different clusters manifested more severe, earlier-onset POLG syndromes, whereas two mutations from the same cluster are less common and generally are associated with less severe, later onset POLG syndromes. We also show that specific cluster combinations are more severe than others and have a higher likelihood to manifest at an earlier age. Our clustering method provides a powerful tool to predict the pathogenic potential and predicted disease phenotype of novel variants and mutations in POLG, the most common nuclear gene underlying mitochondrial disorders. We propose that such a prediction tool would be useful for routine diagnostics for mitochondrial disorders. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 18th European Bioenergetic Conference.",

     "abstract": "The Klebsiella pneumoniae genome contains genes for two putative flavin transferase enzymes (ApbE1 and ApbE2) that add FMN to protein Thr residues. ApbE1, but not ApbE2, has a periplasm-addressing signal sequence. The genome also contains genes for three target proteins with the Dxx(s/t)gAT flavinylation motif: two subunits of Na+-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR), and a 99.5\u00a0kDa protein, KPK_2907, with a previously unknown function. We show here that KPK_2907 is an active cytoplasmically-localized fumarate reductase. K. pneumoniae cells with an inactivated kpk_2907 gene lack cytoplasmic fumarate reductase activity, while retaining this activity in the membrane fraction. Complementation of the mutant strain with a kpk_2907-containing plasmid resulted in a complete recovery of cytoplasmic fumarate reductase activity. KPK_2907 produced in Escherichia coli cells contains 1\u00a0mol/mol each of covalently bound FMN, noncovalently bound FMN and noncovalently bound FAD. Lesion in the ApbE1 gene in K. pneumoniae resulted in inactive Na+-NQR, but cytoplasmic fumarate reductase activity remained unchanged. On the contrary, lesion in the ApbE2 gene abolished the fumarate reductase but not the Na+-NQR activity. Both activities could be restored by transformation of the ApbE1- or ApbE2-deficient K. pneumoniae strains with plasmids containing the Vibrio cholerae apbE gene with or without the periplasm-directing signal sequence, respectively. Our data thus indicate that ApbE1 and ApbE2 bind FMN to Na+-NQR and fumarate reductase, respectively, and that, contrary to the presently accepted view, the FMN residues are on the periplasmic side of Na+-NQR. A new, \u201celectron loop\u201d mechanism is proposed for Na+-NQR, involving an electroneutral Na+/electron symport.

     "abstract": "Methane-forming archaea are strictly anaerobic microbes and are essential for global carbon fluxes since they perform the terminal step in breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. Major part of methane produced in nature derives from the methyl group of acetate. Only members of the genera Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta are able to use this substrate for methane formation and growth. Since the free energy change coupled to methanogenesis from acetate is only \u2212\u00a036\u00a0kJ/mol CH4, aceticlastic methanogens developed efficient energy-conserving systems to handle this thermodynamic limitation. The membrane bound electron transport system of aceticlastic methanogens is a complex branched respiratory chain that can accept electrons from hydrogen, reduced coenzyme F420 or reduced ferredoxin. The terminal electron acceptor of this anaerobic respiration is a mixed disulfide composed of coenzyme M and coenzyme B. Reduced ferredoxin has an important function under aceticlastic growth conditions and novel and well-established membrane complexes oxidizing ferredoxin will be discussed in depth. Membrane bound electron transport is connected to energy conservation by proton or sodium ion translocating enzymes (F420H2 dehydrogenase, Rnf complex, Ech hydrogenase, methanophenazine-reducing hydrogenase and heterodisulfide reductase). The resulting electrochemical ion gradient constitutes the driving force for adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Methanogenesis, electron transport, and the structure of key enzymes are discussed in this review leading to a concept of how aceticlastic methanogens make a living.

DsrC contains two redox active cysteines in a flexible carboxy-terminal arm that are involved in the process of sulfite reduction or sulfur1 compound oxidation in sulfur-reducing2 or sulfur-oxidizing3 organisms, respectively. In both processes, a disulfide formed between the two cysteines is believed to serve as the substrate of several proteins present in these organisms that are related to heterodisulfide reductases of methanogens. Here, we review the information on DsrC and its possible physiological partners, and discuss the idea that this protein may serve as a redox hub linking oxidation of several substrates to dissimilative sulfur metabolism. In addition, we analyze the distribution of proteins of the DsrC superfamily, including TusE that only requires the last Cys of the C-terminus for its role in the biosynthesis of 2-thiouridine, and a new protein that we name RspA (for regulatory sulfur-related protein) that is possibly involved in the regulation of gene expression and does not need the conserved Cys for its function.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase is a superfamily of membrane bound enzymes catalyzing the exergonic reduction of molecular oxygen to water, producing an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The gradient is formed both by the electrogenic chemistry, taking electrons and protons from opposite sides of the membrane, and by proton pumping across the entire membrane. In the most efficient subfamily, the A-family of oxidases, one proton is pumped in each reduction step, which is surprising considering the fact that two of the reduction steps most likely are only weakly exergonic. Based on a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental information, it is here shown that from both a thermodynamic and a kinetic point of view, it should be possible to pump one proton per electron also with such an uneven distribution of the free energy release over the reduction steps, at least up to half the maximum gradient. A previously suggested pumping mechanism is developed further to suggest a reason for the use of two proton transfer channels in the A-family. Since the rate of proton transfer to the binuclear center through the D-channel is redox dependent, it might become too slow for the steps with low exergonicity. Therefore, a second channel, the K-channel, where the rate is redox-independent is needed. A redox-dependent leakage possibility is also suggested, which might be important for efficient energy conservation at a high gradient. A mechanism for the variation in proton pumping stoichiometry over the different subfamilies of cytochrome oxidase is also suggested.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome bd is a prokaryotic respiratory quinol:O2 oxidoreductase, phylogenetically unrelated to the extensively studied heme\u2013copper oxidases (HCOs). The enzyme contributes to energy conservation by generating a proton motive force, though working with a lower energetic efficiency as compared to HCOs. Relevant to patho-physiology, members of the bd-family were shown to promote virulence in some pathogenic bacteria, which makes these enzymes of interest also as potential drug targets. Beyond its role in cell bioenergetics, cytochrome bd accomplishes several additional physiological functions, being apparently implicated in the response of the bacterial cell to a number of stress conditions. Compelling experimental evidence suggests that the enzyme enhances bacterial tolerance to oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions, owing to its unusually high nitric oxide (NO) dissociation rate and a notable catalase activity; the latter has been recently documented in one of the two bd-type oxidases of Escherichia coli. Current knowledge on cytochrome bd and its reactivity with O2, NO and H2O2 is summarized in this review in the light of the hypothesis that the preferential (over HCOs) expression of cytochrome bd in pathogenic bacteria may represent a strategy to evade the host immune attack based on production of NO and reactive oxygen species (ROS).

     "abstract": "ATP synthase is a ubiquitous enzyme that is largely conserved across the kingdoms of life. This conservation is in accordance with its central role in chemiosmotic energy conversion, a pathway utilized by far by most living cells. On the other hand, in particular pathogenic bacteria whilst employing ATP synthase have to deal with energetically unfavorable conditions such as low oxygen tensions in the human host, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can survive in human macrophages for an extended time. It is well conceivable that such ATP synthases may carry idiosyncratic features that contribute to efficient ATP production. In this review genetic and biochemical data on mycobacterial ATP synthase are discussed in terms of rotary catalysis, stator composition, and regulation of activity. ATP synthase in mycobacteria is of particular interest as this enzyme has been validated as a target for promising new antibacterial drugs. A deeper understanding of the working of mycobacterial ATP synthase and its atypical features can provide insight in adaptations of bacterial energy metabolism. Moreover, pinpointing and understanding critical differences as compared with human ATP synthase may provide input for the design and development of selective ATP synthase inhibitors as antibacterials.

     "abstract": "In the present paper we have investigated the effect of mutagenesis of a number of highly conserved residues (R159, D163, L177 and L267) which we have recently shown to line the hydrophobic inhibitor/substrate cavity in the alternative oxidases (AOXs). Measurements of respiratory activity in rSgAOX expressed in Escherichia coli FN102 membranes indicate that all mutants result in a decrease in maximum activity of AOX and in some cases (D163 and L177) a decrease in the apparent Km (O2). Of particular importance was the finding that when the L177 and L267 residues, which appear to cause a bottleneck in the hydrophobic cavity, are mutated to alanine the sensitivity to AOX antagonists is reduced. When non-AOX anti-malarial inhibitors were also tested against these mutants widening the bottleneck through removal of isobutyl side chain allowed access of these bulkier inhibitors to the active-site and resulted in inhibition. Results are discussed in terms of how these mutations have altered the way in which the AOX's catalytic cycle is controlled and since maximum activity is decreased we predict that such mutations result in an increase in the steady state level of at least one O2-derived AOX intermediate. Such mutations should therefore prove to be useful in future stopped-flow and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments in attempts to understand the catalytic cycle of the alternative oxidase which may prove to be important in future rational drug design to treat diseases such as trypanosomiasis. Furthermore since single amino acid mutations in inhibitor/substrate pockets have been found to be the cause of multi-drug resistant strains of malaria, the decrease in sensitivity to main AOX antagonists observed in the L-mutants studied in this report suggests that an emergence of drug resistance to trypanosomiasis may also be possible. Therefore we suggest that the design of future AOX inhibitors should have structures that are less reliant on the orientation by the two-leucine residues.

     "abstract": "Archaea live under different environmental conditions, such as high salinity, extreme pHs and cold or hot temperatures. How energy is conserved under such harsh environmental conditions is a major question in cellular bioenergetics of archaea. The key enzymes in energy conservation are the archaeal A1AO ATP synthases, a class of ATP synthases distinct from the F1FO ATP synthase ATP synthase found in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts and the V1VO ATPases of eukaryotes. A1AO ATP synthases have distinct structural features such as a collar-like structure, an extended central stalk, and two peripheral stalks possibly stabilizing the A1AO ATP synthase during rotation in ATP synthesis/hydrolysis at high temperatures as well as to provide the storage of transient elastic energy during ion-pumping and ATP synthesis/-hydrolysis. High resolution structures of individual subunits and subcomplexes have been obtained in recent years that shed new light on the function and mechanism of this unique class of ATP synthases. An outstanding feature of archaeal A1AO ATP synthases is their diversity in size of rotor subunits and the coupling ion used for ATP synthesis with H+, Na+ or even H+ and Na+ using enzymes. The evolution of the H+ binding site to a Na+ binding site and its implications for the energy metabolism and physiology of the cell are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Many enzymes involved in bioenergetic processes contain chains of redox centers that link the protein surface, where interaction with electron donors or acceptors occurs, to a secluded catalytic site. In numerous cases these redox centers can transfer only single electrons even when they are associated to catalytic sites that perform two-electron chemistry. These chains provide no obvious contribution to enhance chemiosmotic energy conservation, and often have more redox centers than those necessary to hold sufficient electrons to sustain one catalytic turnover of the enzyme. To investigate the role of such a redox chain we analyzed the transient kinetics of fumarate reduction by two flavocytochromes c3 of Shewanella species while these enzymes were being reduced by sodium dithionite. These soluble monomeric proteins contain a chain of four hemes that interact with a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) catalytic center that performs the obligatory two electron\u2013two proton reduction of fumarate to succinate. Our results enabled us to parse the kinetic contribution of each heme towards electron uptake and conduction to the catalytic center, and to determine that the rate of fumarate reduction is modulated by the redox stage of the enzyme, which is defined by the number of reduced centers. In both enzymes the catalytically most competent redox stages are those least prevalent in a quasi-stationary condition of turnover. Furthermore, the electron distribution among the redox centers during turnover suggested how these enzymes can play a role in the switch between respiration of solid and soluble terminal electron acceptors in the anaerobic bioenergetic metabolism of Shewanella.",

     "abstract": "Chromera velia is an alveolate alga associated with scleractinian corals. Here we present detailed work on chromatic adaptation in C. velia cultured under either blue or red light. Growth of C. velia under red light induced the accumulation of a light harvesting antenna complex exhibiting unusual spectroscopic properties with red-shifted absorption and atypical 710\u00a0nm fluorescence emission at room temperature. Due to these characteristic features the complex was designated \u201cRed-shifted Chromera light harvesting complex\u201d (Red-CLH complex). Its detailed biochemical survey is described in the accompanying paper (Bina et al. 2013, this issue).Here, we show that the accumulation of Red-CLH complex under red light represents a slow acclimation process (days) that is reversible with much faster kinetics (hours) under blue light. This chromatic adaptation allows C. velia to maintain all important parameters of photosynthesis constant under both light colors. We further demonstrated that the C. velia Red-CLH complex is assembled from a 17\u00a0kDa antenna protein and is functionally connected to photosystem II as it shows variability of chlorophyll fluorescence. Red-CLH also serves as an additional locus for non-photochemical quenching. Although overall rates of oxygen evolution and carbon fixation were similar for both blue and red light conditions, the presence of Red-CLH in C. velia cells increases the light harvesting potential of photosystem II, which manifested as a doubled oxygen evolution rate at illumination above 695\u00a0nm. This data demonstrates a remarkable long-term remodeling of C. velia light-harvesting system according to light quality and suggests physiological significance of \u2018red\u2019 antenna complexes.",

Remarkably, G. sulfurreducens can also use as electron donors the reduced forms of some acceptors, such as the humic substance analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), a feature that confers environmentally competitive advantages to the organism. Using UV\u2013visible and stopped-flow kinetic measurements we demonstrate that there is electron exchange between the triheme cytochrome PpcA from Gs and AQDS. 2D-1H\u201315N HSQC NMR spectra were recorded for 15N-enriched PpcA samples, in the absence and presence of AQDS. Chemical shift perturbation measurements, at increasing concentration of AQDS, were used to probe the interaction region and to measure the binding affinity of the PpcA\u2013AQDS complex. The perturbations on the NMR signals corresponding to the PpcA backbone NH and heme substituents showed that the region around heme IV interacts with AQDS through the formation of a complex with a definite life time in the NMR time scale. The comparison of the NMR data obtained for PpcA in the presence and absence of AQDS showed that the interaction is reversible. Overall, this study provides for the first time a clear illustration of the formation of an electron transfer complex between AQDS and a G. sulfurreducens triheme cytochrome, shedding light on the electron transfer pathways underlying the microbial oxidation of humics.",

Between initial IF1 binding and IF1 locking the enzyme experiences large conformational changes. While structural studies give access to analysis of the dead-end inhibited state, transient states have thus far not been described. Here, we studied both initial and final states by reporting, for the first time, the consequences of mutations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATP synthase on its inhibition by IF1. Kinetic studies allowed the identification of amino acids or motifs of the enzyme that are involved in recognition and/or locking of IF1 \u03b1-helical midpart. This led to an outline of IF1 binding process. In the recognition step, protruding parts of \u03b1 and especially \u03b2 subunits grasp IF1, most likely by a few residues of its \u03b1-helical midpart. Locking IF1 within the \u03b1\u03b2 interface involves additional residues of both subunits. Interactions of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits with the foot of the \u03b3 subunit might contribute to locking and stabilizing of the dead-end state.",

At the ensemble level, the absorption and fluorescence spectra show a temperature dependence similar to plant PS II. We report emission spectra of single PS II cc for the first time; the spectra are dominated by zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) in the range between 680 and 705\u00a0nm. The single-molecule experiments show unambiguously that different emitters and not only the lowest energy trap contribute to the low temperature emission spectrum. The average emission spectrum obtained from more than hundred single complexes shows three main contributions that are in good agreement with the reported bands F685, F689 and F695. The intensity of F695 is found to be lower than in conventional ensemble spectroscopy. The reason for the deviation might be due to the accumulation of triplet states on the red-most chlorophylls (e.g. Chl29 in CP47) or on carotenoids close to these long-wavelength traps by the high excitation power used in the single-molecule experiments. The red-most emitter will not contribute to the fluorescence spectrum as long as it is in the triplet state. In addition, quenching of fluorescence by the triplet state may lead to a decrease of long-wavelength emission.",

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle is a key organ of mammalian energy metabolism, and its mitochondria are multifunction organelles that are targets of dietary bioactive compounds. The goal of this work was to examine the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, functionality and cell energy parameters using docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and a combination of both in L6 myocytes. Compounds (at 25\u00a0\u03bcM) were incubated for 4\u00a0h. Cells cultured with DHA displayed less oxygen consumption with higher ADP/ATP ratio levels concomitant with downregulation of Cox and Ant1 gene expression. The disruption of energetic homeostasis by DHA, increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and decreases mitochondrial membrane potential. The defence mechanism to counteract the excess of ROS production was by the upregulation of Ucp2, Ucp3 and MnSod gene expression. Moreover myocytes cultured with DHA had a higher mitochondrial mass with a higher proportion of large and elongated mitochondria, whereas the fission genes Drp1 and Fiss1 and the fusion gene Mfn2 were downregulated. In myocytes co-incubated with DHA and EGCG, ROS levels and the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/adenosine triphosphate (ATP) ratio were similar to untreated myocytes and the decrease of oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial mass and the overexpression of Ucp2 and Ucp3 genes were similar to the DHA-treated cells with also a higher amount of mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and reduced Drp1 and Fiss1 gene expression levels. In conclusion the addition of EGCG to DHA returned the cells to the control conditions in terms of mitochondrial morphology, energy and redox status, which were unbalanced in the DHA-treated myocytes.",

Spectral data allowed the signal changes to be attributed to NAD(P)H and signal linearity vs the chlorophyll concentration was shown to be recoverable after appropriate correction. Parameters associated to reduction of NADP+ to NADPH by ferredoxin\u2013NADP+-oxidoreductase were determined: After single excitation of photosystem I, half of the signal rise is observed in 8\u00a0ms; Evidence for a kinetic limitation which is attributed to an enzyme bottleneck is provided; After two closely separated saturating flashes eliciting two photosystem I turnovers in less than 2\u00a0ms, more than 50% of the cytoplasmic photoreductants (reduced ferredoxin and photosystem I acceptors) are diverted from NADPH formation by competing processes. Signal quantitation in absolute NADPH concentrations was performed by adding exogenous NADPH to the cell suspensions and by estimating the enhancement factor of in vivo fluorescence (between 2 and 4). The size of the visible (light-dependent) NADP (NADP+\u00a0+\u00a0NADPH) pool was measured to be between 1.4 and 4 times the photosystem I concentration. A quantitative discrepancy is found between net oxygen evolution and NADPH consumption by the light-activated Calvin\u2013Benson cycle.

     "abstract": "A novel chlorophyll a containing pigment\u2013protein complex expressed by cells of Chromera velia adapted to growth under red/far-red illumination [1]. Purification of the complex was achieved by means of anion-exchange chromatography and gel-filtration. The antenna is shown to be an aggregate of ~\u00a020\u00a0kDa proteins of the light\u2013harvesting complex (LHC) family, unstable in the isolated form. The complex possesses an absorption maximum at 705\u00a0nm at room temperature in addition to the main chlorophyll a maximum at 677\u00a0nm producing the major emission band at 714\u00a0nm at room temperature. The far-red absorption is shown to be the property of the isolated aggregate in the intact form and lost upon dissociation. The purified complex was further characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. This work thus identified the third different class of antenna complex in C. velia after the recently described FCP-like and LHCr-like antennas. Possible candidates for red antennas are identified in other taxonomic groups, such as eustigmatophytes and the relevance of the present results to other known examples of red-shifted antenna from other organisms is discussed. This work appears to be the first successful isolation of a chlorophyll a-based far-red antenna complex absorbing above 700\u00a0nm unrelated to LHCI.",

We quantitatively explore localization, stoichiometry, and dynamics of key OXPHOS complexes, functionally fluorescent protein-tagged, in Escherichia coli using low-angle fluorescence and superresolution microscopy, applying single-molecule analysis and novel nanoscale co-localization measurements. Mobile 100\u2013200\u00a0nm membrane domains containing tens to hundreds of complexes are indicated. Central to our results is that domains of different functional OXPHOS complexes do not co-localize, but ubiquinone diffusion in the membrane is rapid and long-range, consistent with a mobile carrier shuttling electrons between islands of different complexes. Our results categorically demonstrate that electron transport and proton circuitry in this model bacterium are spatially delocalized over the cell membrane, in stark contrast to mitochondrial bioenergetic supercomplexes. Different organisms use radically different strategies for OXPHOS membrane organization, likely depending on the stability of their environment.",

     "abstract": "In oxygenic photosynthesis, cyclic electron flow around photosystem I denotes the recycling of electrons from stromal electron carriers (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, NADPH, ferredoxin) towards the plastoquinone pool. Whether or not cyclic electron flow operates similarly in Chlamydomonas and plants has been a matter of debate. Here we would like to emphasize that despite the regulatory or metabolic differences that may exist between green algae and plants, the general mechanism of cyclic electron flow seems conserved across species. The most accurate way to describe cyclic electron flow remains to be a redox equilibration model, while the supramolecular reorganization of the thylakoid membrane (state transitions) has little impact on the maximal rate of cyclic electron flow. The maximum capacity of the cyclic pathways is shown to be around 60 electrons transferred per photosystem per second, which is in Chlamydomonas cells treated with 3(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and placed under anoxic conditions.

Widespread representatives of this class of co-solvents are trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and betaine; these small molecules are able to stabilize the native conformation of proteins and prevent their aggregation. Despite their importance, detailed experimental studies on the impact of these co-solvents on the energy landscape of proteins have not yet been carried out. We use single-molecule spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures to examine the influence of these physiological relevant co-solvents on photosystem I (PSI) from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. In contrast to PSI ensemble spectra, which are almost unaffected by the addition of TMAO and betaine, statistical analysis of the fluorescence emission from individual PSI trimers yields insight into the interaction of the co-solvents with PSI. The results show an increased homogeneity upon addition of TMAO or betaine. The number of detectable zero-phonon lines (ZPLs) is reduced, indicating spectral diffusion processes with faster rates. In the framework of energy landscape model these findings indicate that co-solvents lead to reduced barrier heights between energy valleys, and thus efficient screening of protein conformations can take place.",

These ATPases/ATP synthases are functionally conserved and operate as rotary proton-pumping nano-motors, invented by Nature billions of years ago. In the first part of this review we will focus on recent structural findings of eukaryotic V-ATPases and discuss the role of different subunits in the function of the V-ATPase holocomplex. Despite structural and functional similarities between rotary ATPases, the eukaryotic V-ATPases are the most complex enzymes that have acquired some unconventional cellular functions during evolution. In particular, the novel roles of V-ATPases in the regulation of cellular receptors and their trafficking via endocytotic and exocytotic pathways were recently uncovered. In the second part of this review we will discuss these unique roles of V-ATPases in modulation of function of cellular receptors, involved in the development and progression of diseases such as cancer and diabetes as well as neurodegenerative and kidney disorders. Moreover, it was recently revealed that the V-ATPase itself functions as an evolutionarily conserved pH sensor and receptor for cytohesin-2/Arf-family GTP-binding proteins. Thus, in the third part of the review we will evaluate the structural basis for and functional insights into this novel concept, followed by the analysis of the potentially essential role of V-ATPase in the regulation of this signaling pathway in health and disease. Finally, future prospects for structural and functional studies of the eukaryotic V-ATPase will be discussed.",

Being isolated from the sample when it was cooled, the objective lens was maintained at room temperature during the cryogenic measurement. Therefore, the authors were able to use a color-aberration corrected objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.9. The lens is equipped with an air vent for compatibility to the vacuum. The theoretically expected spatial resolutions of 0.39\u00a0\u03bcm along the lateral direction and 1.3\u00a0\u03bcm along the axial direction were achieved by the developed system. The system was applied to the observations of non-uniform distributions of the photosystems in the cells of a green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, at 94\u00a0K. Gaussian decomposition analysis of the fluorescence spectra at all the pixels clearly demonstrated a non-uniform distribution of the two photosystems, as reflected in the variable ratios of the fluorescence intensities assigned to photosystem II and to those assigned to photosystem I. The system was also applied to the fluorescence spectroscopy of single isolated photosystem I complexes at 90\u00a0K. The fluorescence, assigned to be emitted from a single photosystem I trimer, showed an intermittent fluctuation called blinking, which is typical for a fluorescence signal from a single molecule. The vibronic fluorescence bands at around 790\u00a0nm were observed for single photosystem I trimers, suggesting that the color aberration is not serious up to the 800\u00a0nm spectral region.",

Its activity responds to hyperosmotic stress and it harbors two different functions, transport catalysis (betaine uptake) and stimulus sensing, resp. activity regulation. Structural information from 2D and 3D crystals as well as functional analysis of monomerized BetP suggested the presence of conformational crosstalk between the individual protomers. To study whether the oligomeric state is functionally significant on a mechanistic level we generated heterooligomeric complexes of BetP in which single protomers within the trimer can be addressed. By testing dominant negative effects in a trimer of one active protomer combined with two protomers in which transport and regulation were abolished, we provide experimental evidence for the absence of functionally significant conformational crosstalk between the protomers on the level of both transport and regulation. This is supported by experiments using mutant forms of putative interacting signal donor and acceptor domains of individual BetP protomers. This result has important consequences for oligomeric transport proteins in general and BetP in particular.",

Fluorescence-induction measurements on Cyclotella meneghiniana diatoms show two NPQ processes: qE1 relaxes rapidly in the dark while qE2 remains present upon switching to darkness and is related to the presence of the xanthophyll-cycle pigment diatoxanthin (Dtx). We performed picosecond fluorescence measurements on cells locked in different (quenching) states, revealing the following sequence of events during full development of NPQ. At first, trimers of light-harvesting complexes (fucoxanthin\u2013chlorophyll a/c proteins), or FCPa, become quenched, while being part of photosystem II (PSII), due to the induced pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane. This is followed by (partial) detachment of FCPa from PSII after which quenching persists. The pH gradient also causes the formation of Dtx which leads to further quenching of isolated PSII cores and some aggregated FCPa. In subsequent darkness, the pH gradient disappears but Dtx remains present and quenching partly pertains. Only in the presence of some light the system completely recovers to the unquenched state.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome b559 is an essential component of the photosystem II reaction center in photosynthetic oxygen-evolving organisms, but its function still remains unclear. The use of photosystem II preparations from Thermosynechococcus elongatus of high integrity and activity allowed us to measure for the first time the influence of cytochrome b559 mutations on its midpoint redox potential and on the reduction of the cytochrome b559 by the plastoquinone pool (or QB). In this work, five mutants having a mutation in the \u03b1-subunit (I14A, I14S, R18S, I27A and I27T) and one in the \u03b2-subunit (F32Y) of cytochrome b559 have been investigated. All the mutations led to a destabilization of the high potential form of the cytochrome b559. The midpoint redox potential of the high potential form was significantly altered in the \u03b1R18S and \u03b1I27T mutant strains. The \u03b1R18S strain also showed a high sensitivity to photoinhibitory illumination and an altered oxidase activity. This was suggested by measurements of light induced oxidation and dark re-reduction of the cytochrome b559 showing that under conditions of a non-functional water oxidation system, once the cytochrome is oxidized by P680+, the yield of its reduction by QB or the PQ pool was smaller and the kinetic slower in the \u03b1R18S mutant than in the wild-type strain. Thus, the extremely positive redox potential of the high potential form of cytochrome b559 could be necessary to ensure efficient oxidation of the PQ pool and to function as an electron reservoir replacing the water oxidation system when it is not operating.",

Their spectroscopic properties were shown previously to share similar spectral features. In both sensors, the heme group is in the high-spin form in the oxidized state and low-spin after reduction and binding of a methionine residue. Therefore, it was proposed that this redox-linked ligand switch might be related to the signal transduction mechanism. We now report the thermodynamic and kinetic characterization of the sensors GSU582 and GSU935 by visible spectroscopy and stopped-flow techniques, at several pH and ionic strength values. Despite their similar spectroscopic features, the midpoint reduction potentials and the rate constants for reduction by dithionite are considerably different in the two sensors. The reduction potentials of both sensors are negative and well framed within the typical anoxic subsurface environments in which Geobacter species predominate. The midpoint reduction potentials of sensor GSU935 are lower than those of GSU582 at all pH and ionic strength values and the same was observed for the reduction rate constants. The origin of the different functional properties of these closely related sensors is rationalized in the terms of the structures. The results suggest that the sensors are designed to function in different working potential ranges, allowing the bacteria to trigger an adequate cellular response in different anoxic subsurface environments. These findings provide an explanation for the co-existence of two similar methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins in G. sulfurreducens.",

The A/D transition plays an important role in tissue response to the lack of oxygen and hypoxic deactivation of the enzyme is one of the key regulatory events that occur in mitochondria during ischaemia. We demonstrate for the first time that the A/D conformational change of complex I does not affect the macromolecular organisation of supercomplexes in vitro as revealed by two types of native electrophoresis. Cysteine 39 of the mitochondrially-encoded ND3 subunit is known to become exposed upon de-activation. Here we show that even if complex I is a constituent of the I\u00a0+\u00a0III2\u00a0+\u00a0IV (S1) supercomplex, cysteine 39 is accessible for chemical modification in only the D-form. Using lysine-specific fluorescent labelling and a DIGE-like approach we further identified two new subunits involved in structural rearrangements during the A/D transition: ND1 (MT-ND1) and 39\u00a0kDa (NDUFA9). These results clearly show that structural rearrangements during de-activation of complex I include several subunits located at the junction between hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, in the region of the quinone binding site. De-activation of mitochondrial complex I results in concerted structural rearrangement of membrane subunits which leads to the disruption of the sealed quinone chamber required for catalytic turnover.",

     "abstract": "We present a historical overview of research on microbial rhodopsins ranging from the 1960s to the present date. Bacteriorhodopsin (BR), the first identified microbial rhodopsin, was discovered in the context of cell and membrane biology and shown to be an outward directed proton transporter. In the 1970s, BR had a big impact on membrane structural research and bioenergetics, that made it to a model for membrane proteins and established it as a probe for the introduction of various biophysical techniques that are widely used today. Halorhodopsin (HR), which supports BR physiologically by transporting negatively charged Cl\u2212 into the cell, is researched within the microbial rhodopsin community since the late 1970s. A few years earlier, the observation of phototactic responses in halobacteria initiated research on what are known today as sensory rhodopsins (SR). The discovery of the light-driven ion channel, channelrhodopsin (ChR), serving as photoreceptors for behavioral responses in green alga has complemented inquiries into this photoreceptor family. Comparing the discovery stories, we show that these followed quite different patterns, albeit the objects of research being very similar. The stories of microbial rhodopsins present a comprehensive perspective on what can nowadays be considered one of nature's paradigms for interactions between organisms and light. Moreover, they illustrate the unfolding of this paradigm within the broader conceptual and instrumental framework of the molecular life sciences.

     "abstract": "A fundamental design principle of microbial rhodopsins is that they share the same basic light-induced conversion between two conformers. Alternate access of the Schiff base to the outside and to the cytoplasm in the outwardly open \u201cE\u201d conformer and cytoplasmically open \u201cC\u201d conformer, respectively, combined with appropriate timing of pKa changes controlling Schiff base proton release and uptake make the proton path through the pumps vectorial. Phototaxis receptors in prokaryotes, sensory rhodopsins I and II, have evolved new chemical processes not found in their proton pump ancestors, to alter the consequences of the conformational change or modify the change itself. Like proton pumps, sensory rhodopsin II undergoes a photoinduced E\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C transition, with the C conformer a transient intermediate in the photocycle. In contrast, one light-sensor (sensory rhodopsin I bound to its transducer HtrI) exists in the dark as the C conformer and undergoes a light-induced C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0E transition, with the E conformer a transient photocycle intermediate. Current results indicate that algal phototaxis receptors channelrhodopsins undergo redirected Schiff base proton transfers and a modified E\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C transition which, contrary to the proton pumps and other sensory rhodopsins, is not accompanied by the closure of the external half-channel. The article will review our current understanding of how the shared basic structure and chemistry of microbial rhodopsins have been modified during evolution to create diverse molecular functions: light-driven ion transport and photosensory signaling by protein\u2013protein interaction and light-gated ion channel activity.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Retinal Proteins \u2014 You can teach an old dog new tricks.",

The tight control of this intricate reaction network stems from the architecture of the proteins that drive the chemical reactions and mediate protein\u2013protein interactions. Indeed, the structure of these proteins will determine both their function and interaction partners. A detailed understanding of the proximity and orientation of pivotal functional groups can reveal the molecular mechanistic basis for the activity of a protein. Together with X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, NMR spectroscopy plays an important role in solving three-dimensional structures of proteins at atomic resolution. In the challenging field of membrane proteins, retinal-binding proteins are often employed as model systems and prototypes to develop biophysical techniques for the study of structural and functional mechanistic aspects. The recent determination of two 3D structures of seven-helical trans-membrane retinal proteins by solution-state NMR spectroscopy highlights the potential of solution NMR techniques in contributing to our understanding of membrane proteins.

The crystal structures of several type-I rhodopsins were solved and the molecular mechanisms have been investigated based on the atomic structures. However, the crystal structures of proteins of interest are not always available and the basic architectures are sometimes quite similar, which obscures how the proteins achieve different functions. Stimulus-induced difference FTIR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to detect minute structural changes providing a clue for elucidating the molecular mechanisms. In this review, the studies on type-I rhodopsins from fungi and marine bacteria, whose crystal structures have not been solved yet, were summarized. Neurospora rhodopsin and Leptosphaeria rhodopsin found from Fungi have sequence similarity. The former has no proton pumping function, while the latter has. Proteorhodopsin is another example, whose proton pumping machinery is altered at alkaline and acidic conditions.

Besides structural stabilization, they act as proton conductors and even proton storage sites. Currently, the most understood model system exhibiting such features is bacteriorhodopsin (bR). During the last 20\u00a0years, the importance of water molecules for proton transport has been revealed through this protein. It has been shown that water molecules are as essential as amino acids for proton transport and biological function. In this review, we present an overview of the historical development of this research on bR. We furthermore summarize the recently discovered protein-bound water features associated with proton transport. Specifically, we discuss a pentameric water/amino acid arrangement close to the protonated Schiff base as central proton-binding site, a protonated water cluster as proton storage site at the proton-release site, and a transient linear water chain at the proton uptake site. We highlight how protein conformational changes reposition or reorient internal water molecules, thereby guiding proton transport. Last, we compare the water positions in bR with those in other microbial rhodopsins to elucidate how protein-bound water molecules guide the function of microbial rhodopsins.

     "abstract": "The new and vibrant field of optogenetics was founded by the seminal discovery of channelrhodopsin, the first light-gated cation channel. Despite the numerous applications that have revolutionised neurophysiology, the functional mechanism is far from understood on the molecular level. An arsenal of biophysical techniques has been established in the last decades of research on microbial rhodopsins. However, application of these techniques is hampered by the duration and the complexity of the photoreaction of channelrhodopsin compared with other microbial rhodopsins. A particular interest in resolving the molecular mechanism lies in the structural changes that lead to channel opening and closure. Here, we review the current structural and mechanistic knowledge that has been accomplished by integrating the static structure provided by X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy with time-resolved spectroscopic and electrophysiological techniques. The dynamical reactions of the chromophore are effectively coupled to structural changes of the protein, as shown by ultrafast spectroscopy. The hierarchical sequence of structural changes in the protein backbone that spans the time range from 10\u2212\u00a012\u00a0s to 10\u2212\u00a03\u00a0s prepares the channel to open and, consequently, cations can pass. Proton transfer reactions that are associated with channel gating have been resolved. In particular, glutamate 253 and aspartic acid 156 were identified as proton acceptor and donor to the retinal Schiff base. The reprotonation of the latter is the critical determinant for channel closure. The proton pathway that eventually leads to proton pumping is also discussed.

Here we use bioinformatics methods to derive accurate alignments of channelrhodopsin sequences, assess the sequence conservation patterns and find conserved motifs in channelrhodopsins, and use homology modeling to construct three-dimensional structural models of channelrhodopsins. The analyses reveal that helices C and D of channelrhodopsins contain Cys, Ser, and Thr groups that can engage in both intra- and inter-helical hydrogen bonds. We propose that these polar groups participate in inter-helical hydrogen-bonding clusters important for the protein conformational dynamics and for the local water interactions.

     "abstract": "Experimental folding studies of membrane proteins are more challenging than water-soluble proteins because of the higher hydrophobicity content of membrane embedded sequences and the need to provide a hydrophobic milieu for the transmembrane regions. The first challenge is their denaturation: due to the thermodynamic instability of polar groups in the membrane, secondary structures in membrane proteins are more difficult to disrupt than in soluble proteins. The second challenge is to refold from the denatured states. Successful refolding of membrane proteins has almost always been from very subtly denatured states. Therefore, it can be useful to analyze membrane protein folding using computational methods, and we will provide results obtained with simulated unfolding of membrane protein structures using the Floppy Inclusions and Rigid Substructure Topography (FIRST) method. Computational methods have the advantage that they allow a direct comparison between diverse membrane proteins. We will review here both, experimental and FIRST studies of the retinal binding proteins bacteriorhodopsin and mammalian rhodopsin, and discuss the extension of the findings to deriving hypotheses on the mechanisms of folding of membrane proteins in general.

     "abstract": "Cone visual pigments are visual opsins that are present in vertebrate cone photoreceptor cells and act as photoreceptor molecules responsible for photopic vision. Like the rod visual pigment rhodopsin, which is responsible for scotopic vision, cone visual pigments contain the chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which undergoes cis\u2013trans isomerization resulting in the induction of conformational changes of the protein moiety to form a G protein-activating state. There are multiple types of cone visual pigments with different absorption maxima, which are the molecular basis of color discrimination in animals. Cone visual pigments form a phylogenetic sister group with non-visual opsin groups such as pinopsin, VA opsin, parapinopsin and parietopsin groups. Cone visual pigments diverged into four groups with different absorption maxima, and the rhodopsin group diverged from one of the four groups of cone visual pigments. The photochemical behavior of cone visual pigments is similar to that of pinopsin but considerably different from those of other non-visual opsins. G protein activation efficiency of cone visual pigments is also comparable to that of pinopsin but higher than that of the other non-visual opsins. Recent measurements with sufficient time-resolution demonstrated that G protein activation efficiency of cone visual pigments is lower than that of rhodopsin, which is one of the molecular bases for the lower amplification of cones compared to rods. In this review, the uniqueness of cone visual pigments is shown by comparison of their molecular properties with those of non-visual opsins and rhodopsin.

     "abstract": "Rhodopsin, the dim-light photoreceptor present in the rod cells of the retina, is both a retinal-binding protein and a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Due to this conjunction, it benefits from an arsenal of spectroscopy techniques that can be used for its characterization, while being a model system for the important family of Class A (also referred to as \u201crhodopsin-like\u201d) GPCRs. For instance, rhodopsin has been a crucial player in the field of GPCR structural biology. Until 2007, it was the only GPCR for which a high-resolution crystal structure was available, so all structure\u2013activity analyses on GPCRs, from structure-based drug discovery to studies of structural changes upon activation, were based on rhodopsin. At present, about a third of currently available GPCR structures are still from rhodopsin. In this review, I show some examples of how these structures can still be used to gain insight into general aspects of GPCR activation. First, the analysis of the third intracellular loop in rhodopsin structures allows us to gain an understanding of the structural and dynamic properties of this region, which is absent (due to protein engineering or poor electron density) in most of the currently available GPCR structures. Second, a detailed analysis of the structure of the transmembrane domains in inactive, intermediate and active rhodopsin structures allows us to detect early conformational changes in the process of ligand-induced GPCR activation. Finally, the analysis of a conserved ligand-activated transmission switch in the transmembrane bundle of GPCRs in the context of the rhodopsin activation cycle, allows us to suggest that the structures of many of the currently available agonist-bound GPCRs may correspond to intermediate active states. While the focus in GPCR structural biology is inevitably moving away from rhodopsin, in other aspects rhodopsin is still at the forefront. For instance, the first studies of the structural basis of disease mutants in GPCRs, or the most detailed analysis of cellular GPCR signal transduction networks using a systems biology approach, have been carried out in rhodopsin. Finally, due again to its unique properties among GPCRs, rhodopsin will likely play an important role in the application of X-ray free electron laser crystallography to time-resolved structural biology in membrane proteins. Rhodopsin, thus, still remains relevant as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms of GPCR activation.

     "abstract": "Rhodopsin is a classical two-state G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In the dark, its 11-cis retinal chromophore serves as an inverse agonist to lock the receptor in an inactive state. Retinal\u2013protein and protein\u2013protein interactions have evolved to reduce the basal activity of the receptor in order to achieve low dark noise in the visual system. In contrast, absorption of light triggers rapid isomerization of the retinal, which drives the conversion of the receptor to a fully active conformation. Several specific protein\u2013protein interactions have evolved that maintain the lifetime of the active state in order to increase the sensitivity of this receptor for dim-light vision in vertebrates. In this article, we review the molecular interactions that stabilize rhodopsin in the dark-state and describe the use of solid-state NMR spectroscopy for probing the structural changes that occur upon light-activation.

     "abstract": "Most animal opsin-based pigments are typical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and consist of a protein moiety, opsin, and 11-cis retinal as a chromophore. More than several thousand opsins have been identified from a wide variety of animals, which have multiple opsin genes. Accumulated evidence reveals the molecular property of opsin-based pigments, particularly non-conventional visual pigments including non-visual pigments. Opsin-based pigments are generally a bistable pigment having two stable and photointerconvertible states and therefore are bleach-resistant and reusable, unlike vertebrate visual pigments which become bleached. The opsin family contains Gt-coupled, Gq-coupled, Go-coupled, Gs-coupled, Gi-coupled, and Gi/Go-coupled opsins, indicating the existence of a large diversity of light-driven GPCR-signaling cascades. It is suggested that these molecular properties might contribute to different physiologies. In addition, various opsin based-pigments, especially nonconventional visual pigments having different molecular characteristics would facilitate the design and development of promising optogenetic tools for modulating GPCR-signaling, which is involved in a wide variety of physiological responses. We here introduce molecular and functional properties of various kinds of opsins and discuss their physiological function and also their potentials for optogenetic applications.

Considerable progress has recently been made in understanding the role of cardiolipin in mitochondrial function and bioenergetics. This phospholipid is associated with membranes designed to generate an electrochemical gradient that is used to produce ATP, such as bacterial plasma membranes and inner mitochondrial membrane. This ubiquitous and intimate association between cardiolipin and energy transducing membranes indicates an important role for cardiolipin in mitochondrial bioenergetic processes. Cardiolipin has been shown to interact with a number of proteins, including the respiratory chain complexes and substrate carrier proteins. Over the past decade, the significance of cardiolipin in the organization of components of the electron transport chain into higher order assemblies, termed respiratory supercomplexes, has been established. Moreover, cardiolipin is involved in different stages of the mitochondrial apoptotic process, as well as in mitochondrial membrane stability and dynamics.

These supercomplexes were found to be functionally relevant by flux control analysis and to confer a kinetic advantage to NAD-linked respiration (channelling). However, the Coenzyme Q pool is still required for FAD-linked oxidations and for the proper equilibrium with Coenzyme Q bound in the supercomplex. Channelling in the cytochrome c region probably also occurs but does not seem to confer a particular kinetic advantage. The supramolecular association of individual complexes strongly depends on membrane lipid amount and composition and is affected by lipid peroxidation; it also seems to be modulated by membrane potential and protein phosphorylation. Additional properties of supercomplexes are stabilisation of Complex I, as evidenced by the destabilising effect on Complex I of mutations in either Complex III or IV, and prevention of excessive generation of reactive oxygen species.

Mitochondria are dynamic compartments that rearrange under stress response and changes in food availability or oxygen concentrations. The mitochondrial electron transport chain parallels these rearrangements to achieve an optimum performance and therefore requires a plastic organization within the inner mitochondrial membrane. This consists in a balanced distribution between free respiratory complexes and supercomplexes. The mechanisms by which the distribution and organization of supercomplexes can be adjusted to the needs of the cells are still poorly understood.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are double-membraned highly dynamic organelles; the shape, location and function of which are determined by a constant balance between opposing fusion and fission events. A fine modulation of mitochondrial structure is crucial for their correct functionality and for many physiological cell processes, the status of these organelles, being thus a key aspect in a cell's fate. Indeed, the homeostasis of mitochondria needs to be highly regulated for the above mentioned reasons, and since a) they are the major source of energy; b) they participate in various signaling pathways; albeit at the same time c) they are also the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS, the main damaging detrimental players for all cell components). Elaborate mechanisms of mitochondrial quality control have evolved for maintaining a functional mitochondrial network and avoiding cell damage. The first mechanism is the removal of damaged mitochondrial proteins within the organelle via chaperones and protease; the second is the cytosolic ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS), able to eliminate proteins embedded in the outer mitochondrial membrane; the third is the removal of the entire mitochondria through mitophagy, in the case of extensive organelle damage and dysfunction. In this review, we provide an overview of these mitochondria stability and quality control mechanisms, highlighting mitophagy, and emphasizing the central role of mitochondrial dynamics in this context.

In this review I will focus on dynamic features of the hierarchically organized photosynthetic machineries at different levels of structural complexity: (i) isolated light harvesting complexes, (ii) molecular macroassemblies and supercomplexes, (iii) thylakoid membranes and (iv) their multilamellar membrane systems. Special attention will be paid to the most abundant systems, the major light harvesting antenna complex, LHCII, and to grana. Two physical mechanisms, which are less frequently treated in the literature, will receive special attention: (i) thermo-optic mechanism \u2014elementary structural changes elicited by ultrafast local heat transients due to the dissipation of photon energy, which operates both in isolated antenna assemblies and the native thylakoid membranes, regulates important enzymatic functions and appears to play role in light adaptation and photoprotection mechanisms; and (ii) the mechanism by which non-bilayer lipids and lipid phases play key role in the functioning of xanthophyll cycle de-epoxidases and are proposed to regulate the protein-to-lipid ratio in thylakoid membranes and contribute to membrane dynamics.

The mobility of both small molecules (plastoquinone, xanthophylls) as well as large protein supercomplexes is very sensitive to changes in structural boundary conditions. Knowledge about the design principles that govern the mobility of photosynthetic membrane components is essential to understand the dynamic response of the photosynthetic machinery.

The photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains share some components, and their presence in the same membrane opens up the possibility for a variety of \u201cunorthodox\u201d electron transport routes. Many of the theoretically possible electron transport pathways have indeed been detected in particular species and circumstances. Electron transport has a crucial impact on the redox balance of the cell and therefore the pathways of electron flow in the cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane must be tightly regulated. This review summarises what is known of cyanobacterial electron transport components, their interactions and their sub-cellular location. The role of thylakoid membrane organisation in controlling electron transport pathways is discussed with respect to recent evidence that the larger-scale distribution of complexes in the membrane is important for controlling electron exchange between the photosynthetic and respiratory complexes. The distribution of complexes on scales of 100\u00a0nm or more is under physiological control, showing that larger-scale thylakoid membrane re-arrangement is a key factor in controlling the crosstalk between photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport.

Autophagy is a process of bulk degradation and nutrient sequestration that is conserved in all eukaryotes. Autophagy can selectively target chloroplasts as whole organelles and or as Rubisco-containing bodies that are enclosed by the envelope and specifically contain the stromal portion of the chloroplast.

In addition to well-known movement responses such as phototropism, stomatal opening, and nastic leaf movements, chloroplast photorelocation movement is one of the essential cellular responses to optimize photosynthetic ability and avoid photodamage. For these adaptations, chloroplasts accumulate at the areas of cells illuminated with low light (called accumulation response), while they scatter from the area illuminated with strong light (called avoidance response). Plant-specific photoreceptors (phototropin, phytochrome, and/or neochrome) mediate these dynamic directional movements in response to incident light position and intensity. Several factors involved in the mechanisms underlying the processes from light perception to actin-based movements have also been identified through molecular genetic approach.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 coactivator 1 \u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) are pivotal in mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that pre-diabetes disrupts testicular PGC-1\u03b1/Sirt3 axis, compromising testicular mitochondrial function. Using a high-energy-diet induced pre-diabetic rat model, we evaluated testicular levels of PGC-1\u03b1 and its downstream targets, nuclear respiratory factors 1 (NRF-1) and 2 (NRF-2), mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and Sirt3. We also assessed mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, mitochondrial function, energy levels and oxidative stress parameters. Protein levels were quantified by Western Blot, mtDNA content was determined by qPCR. Mitochondrial complex activity and oxidative stress parameters were spectrophotometrically evaluated. Adenine nucleotide levels, adenosine and its metabolites (inosine and hypoxanthine) were determined by reverse-phase HPLC.Pre-diabetic rats showed increased blood glucose levels and impaired glucose tolerance. Both testicular PGC-1\u03b1 and Sirt3 levels were decreased. NRF-1, NRF-2 and TFAM were not altered. Testicular mtDNA content was decreased. Mitochondrial complex I activity was increased, whereas mitochondrial complex III activity was decreased. Adenylate energy charge was decreased in pre-diabetic rats, as were ATP and ADP levels. Conversely, AMP levels were increased, evidencing a decreased ATP/AMP ratio. Concerning to oxidative stress pre-diabetes decreased testicular antioxidant capacity and increased lipid and protein oxidation. In sum, pre-diabetes compromises testicular mitochondrial function by repressing PGC-1\u03b1/Sirt3 axis and mtDNA copy number, declining respiratory capacity and increasing oxidative stress.

A much higher level of superoxide/hydrogen peroxide was generated in the light in thylakoid membranes from the CRTI expressing lines than in wild-type while the level of singlet oxygen generation remained unchanged. The increase in reactive oxygen species was related to the activity of plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) since their generation was inhibited by the PTOX-inhibitor octyl gallate, and since the protein level of PTOX was increased in the CRTI-expressing lines. Furthermore, cyclic electron flow was suppressed in these lines. We propose that PTOX competes efficiently with cyclic electron flow for plastoquinol in the CRTI-expressing lines and that it plays a crucial role in the control of the reduction state of the plastoquinone pool.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to cardiac ischemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) injury but volatile anesthetics (VA) may alter mitochondrial function to trigger cardioprotection. We hypothesized that the VA isoflurane (ISO) mediates cardioprotection in part by altering the function of several respiratory and transport proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). To test this we used fluorescence spectrophotometry to measure the effects of ISO (0, 0.5, 1, 2\u00a0mM) on the time-course of interlinked mitochondrial bioenergetic variables during states 2, 3 and 4 respiration in the presence of either complex I substrate K+-pyruvate/malate (PM) or complex II substrate K+-succinate (SUC) at physiological levels of extra-matrix free Ca2\u00a0+ (~\u00a0200\u00a0nM) and Na+ (10\u00a0mM). To mimic ISO effects on mitochondrial functions and to clearly delineate the possible ISO targets, the observed actions of ISO were interpreted by comparing effects of ISO to those elicited by low concentrations of inhibitors that act at each respiratory complex, e.g. rotenone (ROT) at complex I or antimycin A (AA) at complex III. Our conclusions are based primarily on the similar responses of ISO and titrated concentrations of ETC. inhibitors during state 3. We found that with the substrate PM, ISO and ROT similarly decreased the magnitude of state 3 NADH oxidation and increased the duration of state 3 NADH oxidation, \u0394\u03a8m depolarization, and respiration in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas with substrate SUC, ISO and ROT decreased the duration of state 3 NADH oxidation, \u0394\u03a8m depolarization and respiration. Unlike AA, ISO reduced the magnitude of state 3 NADH oxidation with PM or SUC as substrate. With substrate SUC, after complete block of complex I with ROT, ISO and AA similarly increased the duration of state 3 \u0394\u03a8m depolarization and respiration. This study provides a mechanistic understanding in how ISO alters mitochondrial function in a way that may lead to cardioprotection.",

This protein presents unique opportunities for studying biological electron transfer, as Zn-containing chlorins can exist in 4-, 5-, and (theoretically) 6-coordinate states within the RC. In this paper, the electron transfer perturbations attributed exclusively to coordination state effects are separated from those attributed to the presence, absence, or type of metal in the bacteriochlorin at the HA pocket of the RC. The presence of a 4-coordinate Zn2\u00a0+ ion in the HA bacteriochlorin instead of BPhe results in a small decrease in the rates of the P*\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P+HA\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a0P+QA\u2212 electron transfer, and the charge separation yield is not greatly perturbed; however coordination of the Zn2\u00a0+ by a fifth ligand provided by a histidine residue results in a larger rate decrease and yield loss. We also report the first crystal structure of a Zn-BChl-containing RC, confirming that the HA Zn-BChl was either 4- or 5-coordinate in the two types of Zn-BChl-containing RCs studied here.

Additionally, this class of enzymes also presents residual oxidoreductase activity, reducing O2 to H2O in a four electron/proton reaction. In this work we report, for the first time, steady-state kinetics with the Pseudomonas nautica NOR, either in the presence of its physiological electron donor (cyt. c552) or immobilised on a graphite electrode surface, in the presence of its known substrates, namely NO or O2. The obtained results show that the enzyme has high affinity for its natural substrate, NO, and different kinetic profiles according to the electron donor used. The kinetic data, as shown by the pH dependence, is modelled by ionisable amino acid residues nearby the di-nuclear catalytic site. The catalytic mechanism is revised and a mononitrosyl-non-heme Fe complex (FeBII-NO) species is favoured as the first catalytic intermediate involved on the NO reduction.",

     "abstract": "The major light harvesting complex in cyanobacteria and red algae is the phycobilisome (PBS), comprised of hundreds of seemingly similar chromophores, which are protein bound and assembled in a fashion that enables highly efficient uni-directional energy transfer to reaction centers. The PBS is comprised of a core containing 2\u20135 cylinders surrounded by 6\u20138 rods, and a number of models have been proposed describing the PBS structure. One of the most critical steps in the functionality of the PBS is energy transfer from the rod substructures to the core substructure. In this study we compare the structural and functional characteristics of high-phosphate stabilized PBS (the standard fashion of stabilization of isolated complexes) with cross-linked PBS in low ionic strength buffer from two cyanobacterial species, Thermosynechococcus vulcanus and Acaryochloris marina. We show that chemical cross-linking preserves efficient energy transfer from the phycocyanin containing rods to the allophycocyanin containing cores with fluorescent emission from the terminal emitters. However, this energy transfer is shown to exist in PBS complexes of different structures as characterized by determination of a 2.4\u00a0\u00c5 structure by X-ray crystallography, single crystal confocal microscopy, mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained and cryogenically preserved complexes. We conclude that the PBS has intrinsic structural properties that enable efficient energy transfer from rod substructures to the core substructures without requiring a single unique structure. We discuss the significance of our observations on the functionality of the PBS in vivo.",

The superposition of the Geobacillus CuNiR model on the electron-transfer complex structure of CuNiR with the redox partner cytochrome c551 in other denitrifier system led us to infer that this region contributes to the transient binding with the partner protein during the interprotein electron transfer reaction in the Geobacillus system.

The mutant strain \u0394sigCDE contains the stress responsive SigB as the only functional group 2 \u03c3 factor. The \u2206sigCDE strain grew more slowly than the control strain in methyl-viologen-induced oxidative stress. Furthermore, a fluorescence dye detecting H2O2, hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite, produced a stronger signal in \u2206sigCDE than in the control strain, and immunological detection of carbonylated residues showed more protein oxidation in \u2206sigCDE than in the control strain. These results indicate that \u2206sigCDE suffers from oxidative stress in standard conditions. The oxidative stress may be explained by the findings that \u2206sigCDE had a low content of glutathione and low amount of Flv3 protein functioning in the Mehler-like reaction. Although \u2206sigCDE suffers from oxidative stress, up-regulation of photoprotective carotenoids and Flv4, Sll2018, Flv2 proteins protected PSII against light induced damage by quenching singlet oxygen more efficiently in \u2206sigCDE than in the control strain in visible and in UV-A/B light. However, in UV-C light singlet oxygen is not produced and PSII damage occurred similarly in the \u2206sigCDE and control strains. According to our results, resistance against the light-induced damage of PSII alone does not lead to high light tolerance of the cells, but in addition efficient protection against oxidative stress would be required.",

Previous studies have shown that MOM permeability in cardiomyocytes can be regulated by VDAC interaction with cytoskeletal protein, \u03b2II tubulin. We found that in oxidative soleus skeletal muscle the high apparent Km for ADP is associated with low MOM permeability and high expression of non-polymerized \u03b2II tubulin.

Despite the good knowledge of this catalytic machinery, additional roles can still be envisaged for already reported key residues, and new features are added to residues not previously identified as having a particular role in the mechanism. Here, we analyse for the first time the role of Ser59 in Anabaena FNR, a residue suggested by recent theoretical simulations as putatively involved in competent binding of the coenzyme in the active site by cooperating with Ser80. We show that Ser59 indirectly modulates the geometry of the active site, the interaction with substrates and the electronic properties of the isoalloxazine ring, and in consequence the electron transfer (ET) and HT processes. Additionally, we revise the role of Tyr79 and Ser80, previously investigated in homologous enzymes from plants. Our results probe that the active site of FNR is tuned by a H-bond network that involves the side-chains of these residues and that results to critical optimal substrate binding, exchange of electrons and, particularly, competent disposition of the C4n (hydride acceptor/donor) of the nicotinamide moiety of the coenzyme during the reversible HT event.",

The fluorescence of the crystals is sensitive to the presence of artificial electron acceptors (K3Fe(CN)3) and electron transport inhibitors (DCMU).

With the Sr2\u00a0+ replaced OEC the average fluorescence decay slows down slightly (81\u00a0ps to 85\u00a0ps), and reaction centres are less readily closed, indicating that both energy transfer/trapping and electron transfer are affected by the replacement.",

     "abstract": "Insulin is essential for the regulation of fuel metabolism and triggers the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle. The imported glucose is either stored or broken down, as insulin stimulates glycogenesis and ATP synthesis. The mechanism by which ATP production is increased is incompletely understood at present and, generally, relatively little functional information is available on the effect of insulin on mitochondrial function. In this paper we have exploited extracellular flux technology to investigate insulin effects on the bioenergetics of rat (L6) and human skeletal muscle myoblasts and myotubes. We demonstrate that a 20-min insulin exposure significantly increases (i) the cell respiratory control ratio, (ii) the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and (iii) the glucose sensitivity of anaerobic glycolysis. The improvement of mitochondrial function is explained by an insulin-induced immediate decrease of mitochondrial proton leak. Palmitate exposure annuls the beneficial mitochondrial effects of insulin. Our data improve the mechanistic understanding of insulin-stimulated ATP synthesis, and reveal a hitherto undisclosed insulin sensitivity of cellular bioenergetics that suggests a novel way of detecting insulin responsiveness of cells.",

Phys. Chem., 2008). In the present work, we study the kinetics of the activation process by combining EPR spectroscopy and direct electrochemistry. Upon reduction, the Mo (V) \u201chigh g\u201d resting EPR signal slowly decays while the other redox centers of the protein are rapidly reduced, which we interpret as a slow and gated (or coupled) intramolecular electron transfer between the [4Fe\u20134S] center and the Mo cofactor in the inactive enzyme. Besides, we detect spin\u2013spin interactions between the Mo(V) ion and the [4Fe\u20134S]1\u00a0+ cluster which are modified upon activation of the enzyme, while the EPR signatures associated to the Mo cofactor remain almost unchanged. This shows that the activation process, which modifies the exchange coupling pathway between the Mo and the [4Fe\u20134S]1\u00a0+ centers, occurs further away than in the first coordination sphere of the Mo ion. Relying on structural data and studies on Mo-pyranopterin and models, we propose a molecular mechanism of activation which involves the pyranopterin moiety of the molybdenum cofactor that is proximal to the [4Fe\u20134S] cluster. The mechanism implies both the cyclization of the pyran ring and the reduction of the oxidized pterin to give the competent tricyclic tetrahydropyranopterin form.",

     "abstract": "The Redox-Optimized ROS Balance [R-ORB] hypothesis postulates that the redox environment [RE] is the main intermediary between mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species [ROS]. According to R-ORB, ROS emission levels will attain a minimum vs. RE when respiratory rate (VO2) reaches a maximum following ADP stimulation, a tenet that we test herein in isolated heart mitochondria under forward electron transport [FET]. ROS emission increased two-fold as a function of changes in the RE (~\u00a0400 to ~\u00a0900\u00a0mV\u00b7mM) in state 4 respiration elicited by increasing glutamate/malate (G/M). In G/M energized mitochondria, ROS emission decreases two-fold for RE ~\u00a0500 to ~\u00a0300\u00a0mV\u00b7mM in state 3 respiration at increasing ADP. Stressed mitochondria released higher ROS, that was only weakly dependent on RE under state 3. As a function of VO2, the ROS dependence on RE was strong between ~\u00a0550 and ~\u00a0350\u00a0mV\u00b7mM, when VO2 is maximal, primarily due to changes in glutathione redox potential. A similar dependence was observed with stressed mitochondria, but over a significantly more oxidized RE and ~\u00a03-fold higher ROS emission overall, as compared with non-stressed controls. We conclude that under non-stressful conditions mitochondrial ROS efflux decreases when the RE becomes less reduced within a range in which VO2 is maximal. These results agree with the R-ORB postulate that mitochondria minimize ROS emission as they maximize VO2 and ATP synthesis. This relationship is altered quantitatively, but not qualitatively, by oxidative stress although stressed mitochondria exhibit diminished energetic performance and increased ROS release.",

The inner part of this cavity accommodates the reacting atoms during catalysis. Loops at its edge are highly conserved among plastidic FNRs, suggesting that they might contribute to both flavin stabilization and competent disposition of substrates. Here we pay attention to two of these loops in Anabaena FNR. The first is a sheet\u2013loop\u2013sheet motif, loop102\u2013114, that allocates the FAD adenosine. It was thought to determine the extended FAD conformation, and, indirectly, to modulate isoalloxazine electronic properties, partners binding, catalytic efficiency and even coenzyme specificity. The second, loop261\u2013269, contains key residues for the allocation of partners and coenzyme, including two glutamates, Glu267 and Glu268, proposed as candidates to facilitate the key displacement of the C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr303) from its stacking against the isoalloxazine ring during the catalytic cycle. Our data indicate that the main function of loop102\u2013114 is to provide the inter-domain cavity with flexibility to accommodate protein partners and to guide the coenzyme to the catalytic site, while the extended conformation of FAD must be induced by other protein determinants. Glu267 and Glu268 appear to assist the conformational changes that occur in the loop261\u2013269 during productive coenzyme binding, but their contribution to Tyr303 displacement is minor than expected. Additionally, loop261\u2013269 appears a determinant to ensure reversibility in photosynthetic FNRs.",

Species of this class have been poorly characterized thus far but are now raising increasing interest in the scientific community because of their possible application in biofuel production. Nannochloropsis species have a peculiar photosynthetic apparatus characterized by the presence of only chlorophyll a, with violaxanthin and vaucheriaxanthin esters as the most abundant carotenoids. In this study, the photosynthetic apparatus of this species was analyzed by purifying the thylakoids and isolating the different pigment-binding complexes upon mild solubilization. The results from the biochemical and spectroscopic characterization showed that the photosystem II antenna is loosely bound to the reaction center, whereas the association is stronger in photosystem I, with the antenna-reaction center super-complexes surviving purification. Such a supramolecular organization was found to be conserved in photosystem I from several other photosynthetic eukaryotes, even though these taxa are evolutionarily distant. A hypothesis on the possible selective advantage of different associations of the antenna complexes of photosystems I and II is discussed.",

The global quantum yield of PSI (YI) was measured using low-intensity monochromatic light flashes and the associated transmittance change at 810\u00a0nm. The 810-nm signal change was calibrated based on the number of electrons generated by PSII during the flash (4\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0O2 evolution) which arrived at the PSI donor side after a delay of 2\u00a0ms. The intrinsic quantum yield of PSI (yI, electrons per photon absorbed by PSI) was measured at 712\u00a0nm, where photon absorption by PSII was small. The results were used to resolve the individual spectra of the excitation partitioning coefficients between PSI (aI) and PSII (aII) in leaves. For comparison, pigment\u2013protein complexes for PSII and PSI were isolated, separated by sucrose density ultracentrifugation, and their optical density was measured. A good correlation was obtained for the spectral excitation partitioning coefficients measured by these different methods. The intrinsic yield of PSI was high (yI\u00a0=\u00a00.88), but it absorbed only about 1/3 of quanta; consequently, about 2/3 of quanta were absorbed by PSII, but processed with the low intrinsic yield yII\u00a0=\u00a00.63. In PSII, the quantum yield of charge separation was 0.89 as detected by variable fluorescence Fv/Fm, but 29% of separated charges recombined (Laisk A, Eichelmann H and Oja V, Photosynth.

In this study, the identification of the mitochondrial carrier for adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate (APS) is described. The corresponding gene (YPR011c) was overexpressed in bacteria. The purified protein was reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and its transport properties and kinetic parameters were characterized. It transported APS, 3\u2032-phospho-adenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate, sulfate and phosphate almost exclusively by a counter-exchange mechanism. Transport was saturable and inhibited by bongkrekic acid and other inhibitors. To investigate the physiological significance of this carrier in S. cerevisiae, mutants were subjected to thermal shock at 45\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of sulfate and in the absence of methionine. At 45\u00a0\u00b0C cells lacking YPR011c, engineered cells (in which APS is produced only in mitochondria) and more so the latter cells, in which the exit of mitochondrial APS is prevented by the absence of YPR011cp, were less thermotolerant. Moreover, at the same temperature all these cells contained less methionine and total glutathione than wild-type cells. Our results show that S. cerevisiae mitochondria are equipped with a transporter for APS and that YPR011cp-mediated mitochondrial transport of APS occurs in S. cerevisiae under thermal stress conditions.",

Apart from being the very substrate that needs to be transported in this water oxidation enzyme, water is also vital for the transport of protons to and from the catalytic center as well as other important co-factors and key residues in the enzyme. The latest crystal structural data of PSII have enabled detailed analyses of the location and possible function of water molecules in the enzyme. Significant progress has also been made recently in the investigation of channels and pathways through the protein complex. Through these studies, the mechanistic significance of water for PSII is becoming increasingly clear. An overview and discussion of key aspects of the current research on water in PSII is presented here. The role of water in three other systems (aquaporin, bacteriorhodopsin and cytochrome P450) is also outlined to illustrate further points concerning the central significance that water can have, and potential applications of these ideas for continued research on PSII.

In particular, subunits Asa2, Asa4 and Asa7 seem to constitute a section of the peripheral stalk of the enzyme. Here, we over-expressed and purified subunits Asa2, Asa4 and Asa7 and the corresponding amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal halves of Asa4 and Asa7 in order to explore their interactions in vitro, using immunochemical techniques, blue native electrophoresis and affinity chromatography. Asa4 and Asa7 interact strongly, mainly through their carboxy-terminal halves. Asa2 interacts with both Asa7 and Asa4, and also with subunit \u03b1 in the F1 sector. The three Asa proteins form an Asa2/Asa4/Asa7 subcomplex. The entire Asa7 and the carboxy-terminal half of Asa4 seem to be instrumental in the interaction with Asa2.

     "abstract": "To study the role of the mobile C-terminal extension present in bacterial class of plant type NADP(H):ferredoxin reductases during catalysis, we generated a series of mutants of the Rhodobacter capsulatus enzyme (RcFPR). Deletion of the six C-terminal amino acids beyond alanine 266 was combined with the replacement A266Y, emulating the structure present in plastidic versions of this flavoenzyme. Analysis of absorbance and fluorescence spectra suggests that deletion does not modify the general geometry of FAD itself, but increases exposure of the flavin to the solvent, prevents a productive geometry of FAD:NADP(H) complex and decreases the protein thermal stability. Although the replacement A266Y partially coats the isoalloxazine from solvent and slightly restores protein stability, this single change does not allow formation of active charge-transfer complexes commonly present in the wild-type FPR, probably due to restraints of C-terminus pliability. A proton exchange process is deduced from ITC measurements during coenzyme binding. All studied RcFPR variants display higher affinity for NADP+ than wild-type, evidencing the contribution of the C-terminus in tempering a non-productive strong (rigid) interaction with the coenzyme. The decreased catalytic rate parameters confirm that the hydride transfer from NADPH to the flavin ring is considerably hampered in the mutants. Although the involvement of the C-terminal extension from bacterial FPRs in stabilizing overall folding and bent-FAD geometry has been stated, the most relevant contributions to catalysis are modulation of coenzyme entrance and affinity, promotion of the optimal geometry of an active complex and supply of a proton acceptor acting during coenzyme binding.",

     "abstract": "Active glycolysis and glutaminolysis provide bioenergetic stability of cancer cells in physiological conditions. Under hypoxia, metabolic and mitochondrial disorders, or pharmacological treatment, a deficit of key metabolic substrates may become life-threatening to cancer cells. We analysed the effects of mitochondrial uncoupling by FCCP on the respiration of cells fed by different combinations of Glc, Gal, Gln and Pyr. In cancer PC12 and HCT116 cells, a large increase in O2 consumption rate (OCR) upon uncoupling was only seen when Gln was combined with either Glc or Pyr. Inhibition of glutaminolysis with BPTES abolished this effect. Despite the key role of Gln, addition of FCCP inhibited respiration and induced apoptosis in cells supplied with Gln alone or Gal/Gln. For all substrate combinations, amplitude of respiratory responses to FCCP did not correlate with Akt, Erk and AMPK phosphorylation, cellular ATP, and resting OCR, mitochondrial Ca2\u00a0+ or membrane potential. However, we propose that proton motive force could modulate respiratory response to FCCP by regulating mitochondrial transport of Gln and Pyr, which decreases upon mitochondrial depolarisation. As a result, an increase in respiration upon uncoupling is abolished in cells, deprived of Gln or Pyr (Glc). Unlike PC12 or HCT116 cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts were capable of generating pronounced response to FCCP when deprived of Gln, thus exhibiting lower dependence on glutaminolysis. Overall, the differential regulation of the respiratory response to FCCP by metabolic environment suggests that mitochondrial uncoupling has a potential for substrate-specific inhibition of cell function, and can be explored for selective cancer treatment.",

It participates in the first steps of photosynthesis by harvesting sunlight and transferring excitation energy to the core complex. Here we have analyzed the LHCII complex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and its association with the core of Photosystem II (PSII) to form multiprotein complexes. Several PSII supercomplexes with different antenna sizes have been purified, the largest of which contains three LHCII trimers (named S, M and N) per monomeric core. A projection map at a 13\u00a0\u00c5 resolution was obtained allowing the reconstruction of the 3D structure of the supercomplex. The position and orientation of the S trimer are the same as in plants; trimer M is rotated by 45\u00b0 and the additional trimer (named here as LHCII-N), which is taking the position occupied in plants by CP24, is directly associated with the core. The analysis of supercomplexes with different antenna sizes suggests that LhcbM1, LhcbM2/7 and LhcbM3 are the major components of the trimers in the PSII supercomplex, while LhcbM5 is part of the \u201cextra\u201d LHCII pool not directly associated with the supercomplex. It is also shown that Chlamydomonas LHCII has a slightly lower Chlorophyll a/b ratio than the complex from plants and a blue shifted absorption spectrum.

These monomeric enzymes lack proton pump activity. They are located on the outer face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. NDH2e oxidizes exogenous NADH in a rotenone-insensitive, flavone-sensitive, process. AOX seems to be constitutive; nonetheless, most electrons are transferred to the cytochromic pathway.

In-gel activity of NADH dehydrogenase, mass spectrometry, and cytochrome c oxidase and ATPase activities led to determine the composition of the putative supercomplexes.

     "abstract": "Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that water molecules between redox partners can significantly affect their electron-transfer and possibly also the triplet\u2013triplet energy transfer (TTET) properties when in the vicinity of chromophores. In the present work, the interaction of an intervening water molecule with the peridinin triplet state in the peridinin\u2013chlorophyll a\u2013protein (PCP) from Amphidinium carterae is studied by using orientation selective 2H electron spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy, in conjunction with quantum mechanical calculations. This water molecule is located at the interface between the chlorophyll and peridinin pigments involved in the photoprotection mechanism (Chl601(602)\u2013Per614(624), for nomenclature see reference [1]), based on TTET. The characteristic deuterium modulation pattern is observed in the electron spin-echo envelopes for the PCP complex exchanged against 2H2O. Simulations of the time- and frequency-domain two-pulse and three-pulse ESEEM require two types of coupled 2H. The more strongly coupled 2H has an isotropic coupling constant (aiso) of \u2212\u00a00.4\u00a0MHz. This Fermi contact contribution for one of the two water protons and the precise geometry of the water molecule at the interface between the chlorophyll and peridinin pigments, resulting from the analysis, provide experimental evidence for direct involvement of this structured water molecule in the mechanism of TTET. The PCP antenna, characterised by a unity efficiency of the process, represents a model for future investigations on protein- and solvent-mediated TTET in the field of natural/artificial photosynthesis.",

Mitochondrial flavin dehydrogenases glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGPDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) represent important ROS source, but the mechanism of electron leak is still poorly understood. To investigate the ROS production by the isolated dehydrogenases, we used brown adipose tissue mitochondria solubilized by digitonin as a model. Enzyme activity measurements and hydrogen peroxide production studies by Amplex Red fluorescence, and luminol luminescence in combination with oxygraphy revealed flavin as the most likely source of electron leak in SDH under in vivo conditions, while we propose coenzyme Q as the site of ROS production in the case of mGPDH. Distinct mechanism of ROS production by the two dehydrogenases is also apparent from induction of ROS generation by ferricyanide which is unique for mGPDH. Furthermore, using native electrophoretic systems, we demonstrated that mGPDH associates into homooligomers as well as high molecular weight supercomplexes, which represent native forms of mGPDH in the membrane. By this approach, we also directly demonstrated that isolated mGPDH itself as well as its supramolecular assemblies are all capable of ROS production.",

     "abstract": "PSII antenna size heterogeneity has been intensively studied in the past. Based on DCMU fluorescence rise kinetics, multiple types of photosystems with different properties were described. However, due to the complexity of fluorescence signal analysis, multiple questions remain unanswered. The number of different types of PSII is still debated as well as their degree of connectivity. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii we found that PSII\u03b1 possesses a high degree of connectivity and an antenna 2\u20133 times larger than PSII\u03b2, as described previously. We also found some connectivity for PSII\u03b2 in contrast with the majority of previous studies. This is in agreement with biochemical studies which describe PSII mega-, super- and core-complexes in Chlamydomonas. In these studies, the smallest unit of PSII in vivo would be a dimer of two core complexes hence allowing connectivity. We discuss the possible relationships between PSII\u03b1 and PSII\u03b2 and the PSII mega-, super- and core-complexes. We also showed that strain and medium dependent variations in the half-time of the fluorescence rise can be explained by variations in the proportions of PSII\u03b1 and PSII\u03b2. When analyzing the state transition process in vivo, we found that this process induces an inter-conversion of PSII\u03b1 and PSII\u03b2. During a transition from state 2 to state 1, DCMU fluorescence rise kinetics are satisfactorily fitted by considering two PSII populations with constant kinetic parameters. We discuss our findings about PSII heterogeneity during state transitions in relation with recent results on the remodeling of the pigment-protein PSII architecture during this process.",

This study was undertaken to evaluate the functional pathway and provide insight into the hydrogen bonding features defining an active proton transport pathway. Three pathways were evaluated, two of which consist of water wires and one of predominantly amino acid residues. Our simulations suggest that protons are not transported through water wires. Instead, the five-residue motif (Glu282, Ser319, Glu279, H2O, Cys299) was found to be the likely pathway, consistent with previously made experimental observations. The pathway was found to have a persistent hydrogen bonded core (residues Cys299 to Ser319), with less persistent hydrogen bonds at the ends of the pathway for both H2 release and H2 uptake. Single site mutations of the four residues have been shown experimentally to deactivate the enzyme. The theoretical evaluation of these mutations demonstrates redistribution of the hydrogen bonds in the pathway, resulting in enzyme deactivation. Finally, coupling between the protein dynamics near the proton transport pathway and the redox partner binding regions was also found as a function of H2 uptake and H2 release states, which may be indicative of a correlation between proton and electron movement within the enzyme.",

The resulting PSII (PsbA3/Glu130Gln) was compared with those from the \u201cnative\u201d high-light (PsbA3-PSII) and low-light (PsbA1-PSII) variants, which differ by 21 amino acid including Glu130Gln. H-bonding from D1-Glu130Gln to the primary electron acceptor, PheophytinD1 (PheoD1), is known to affect the Em of the PheoD1/PheoD1\u2212 couple. The Gln130 mutation here had little effect on water splitting, charge accumulation and photosensitivity but did slow down S2QA\u2212 charge recombination and up-shift the thermoluminescence while increasing its yield. These changes were consistent with a \u2248\u00a0\u2212\u00a030\u00a0mV shift of the PheoD1/PheoD1\u2212Em, similar to earlier single site-mutation results from other species and double the \u2248\u00a0\u2212\u00a017\u00a0mV shift seen for PsbA1-PSII versus PsbA3-PSII. This is attributed to the influence of the other 20 amino-acids that differ in PsbA3. A computational model for simulating S2QA\u2212 recombination matched the experimental trend: the S2QA\u2212 recombination rate in PsbA1-PSII differed only slightly from that in PsbA3-PSII, while in Glu130-PsbA3-PSII there was a more pronounced slowdown of the radical pair decay. The simulation predicted a major effect of the PheoD1/PheoD1\u2212 potential on 1O2 yield (~\u00a060% in PsbA1-PSII, ~\u00a020% in PsbA3-PSII and ~\u00a07% in Gln130-PsbA3-PSII), reflecting differential sensitivities to high light.",

With increasing liposomal lipid content, the long-chain alkyl derivatives of fluorescein (C8-FL, C12-FL and commercially available C18-FL), but not C4-FL and unsubstituted fluorescein, exhibited an increase in fluorescence polarization reflecting the dye binding to liposomes. C12-FL induced proton permeability in lipid membranes, while C4-FL was inactive. In contrast to C4-FL and C18-FL, C12-FL and C8-FL increased the respiration rate and decreased the membrane potential of isolated rat liver mitochondria with half-maximal effective concentrations of 700\u00a0nM and 300\u00a0nM, respectively. The effect of Cn-FL on the respiration correlated with that on proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, as measured by induction of mitochondria swelling in the potassium acetate medium. Binding of C8-FL to mitochondria depended on their energization, which was apparently associated with pH gradient generation across the inner mitochondrial membrane in the presence of a respiratory substrate. In wild-type yeast cells, C12-FL localized predominantly in plasma membrane, whereas in AD1-8 mutants lacking MDR pumps, it stained cytoplasmic organelles with some preference for mitochondria. Fluorescent uncouplers can be useful as a tool for determining their localization in a cell or distribution between different tissues in a living animal by fluorescent microscopy.",

On the other hand, the Mn1O5 bond in the Mn3CaO4 cubane region of the Mn4Ca cluster is significantly elongated to 2.6\u00a0\u00c5. Using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach, we investigated factors that are responsible for distortion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane. Removal of Ca led to shortening the Mn1O5 bond by 0.2\u00a0\u00c5; however, Mn1O5 remained significantly elongated, at >\u00a02.5\u00a0\u00c5. Conversely, removal of Mn4 significantly shortens the Mn1O5 distance by 0.5\u00a0\u00c5 to 2.2\u00a0\u00c5, resulting in a more symmetric cubane shape. These results suggest that Mn4, not Ca, is predominantly responsible for distortion of the Mn3CaO4 cubane. It was not the Ca component that was responsible for the existence of the two S2 conformers but two different Mn oxidation states (Mn1, Mn2, Mn3, M4)\u00a0=\u00a0(III, IV, IV, IV) and (IV, IV, IV, III); they were interconvertible by translocation of the O5 atom along the Mn1\u2013O5\u2013Mn4 axis. Depletion of Ca resulted in rearrangement of the H-bond network near TyrZ, which proceeds via a chloride ion (Cl-1 pathway). This may explain why Ca depletion inhibits the S2 to S3 transition, the same process that can also be inhibited by Cl\u2212 depletion.",

     "abstract": "Routinely prepared PS II core samples are often contaminated by a significant (~\u00a01\u20135%) fraction of PS I, as well as related proteins. This contamination is of little importance in many experiments, but masks the optical behaviour of the deep red state in PS II, which absorbs in the same spectral range (700\u2013730\u00a0nm) as PS I (Hughes et al. 2006). When contamination levels are less than ~\u00a01%, it becomes difficult to quantify the PS I related components by gel-based, chromatographic, circular dichroism or EPR techniques. We have developed a fluorescence-based technique, taking advantage of the distinctively different low-temperature emission characteristics of PS II and PS I when excited near 700\u00a0nm. The approach has the advantage of providing the relative concentration of the two photosystems in a single spectral measurement. A sensitivity limit of 0.01% PS I (or better) can be achieved. The procedure is applied to PS II core preparations from spinach and Thermosynechococcus vulcanus. Measurements made of T. vulcanus PS II preparations prepared by re-dissolving crystallised material indicate a low but measurable PS I related content. The analysis provides strong evidence for a previously unreported fluorescence of PS II cores peaking near 780\u00a0nm. The excitation dependence of this emission as well as its appearance in both low PS I cyanobacterial and plant based PS II core preparations suggests its association with the deep red state of PS II.",

Intermediate size enzyme complexes exist in nature that comprise some, but not all of the protein subunits in full size 14-subunit complex I. The membrane spanning complex I subunits NuoL, NuoM and NuoN are homologous to each other and to two proteins from one particular class of Na+/H+ antiporters, denoted MrpA and MrpD. In complex I, these ion transporter protein subunits are prime candidates for harboring important parts of the proton pumping machinery. Using a model system, consisting of Bacillus subtilis MrpA and MrpD deletion strains and a low copy expression plasmid, it was recently demonstrated that NuoN can rescue the strain deleted for MrpD but not that deleted for MrpA, whereas the opposite tendency was seen for NuoL. This demonstrated that the MrpA-type and MrpD-type proteins have unique functional specializations. In this work, the corresponding antiporter-like protein subunits from the smaller enzymes evolutionarily related to complex I were tested in the same model system. The subunits from 11-subunit complex I from Bacillus cereus behaved essentially as those from full size complex I, corroborating that this enzyme should be regarded as a bona fide complex I. The hydrogenase-3 and hydrogenase-4 antiporter-like proteins on the other hand, could substitute equally well for MrpA or MrpD at pH\u00a07.4, suggesting that these enzymes have intermediate forms of the antiporter-like proteins, which seemingly lack the functional specificity.",

Due to the small exposure of the cofactors to the solvent and to charged amino acids, the outer sphere contribution to the reorganization energy almost vanishes. Interheme effective electronic couplings are estimated using ab initio wave functions and a well-parameterized semiempirical scheme for long-range interactions. From the resulting charge transfer rates, we conclude that at most the two heme molecules closest to the membrane participate in a fast recharging of the photoreaction center, whereas the remaining hemes are likely to have a different function, such as intermediate electron storage.

     "abstract": "Carbon monoxide is continuously produced in small quantities in tissues and is an important signaling mediator in mammalian cells. We previously demonstrated that CO delivered to isolated rat heart mitochondria using a water-soluble CO-releasing molecule (CORM-3) is able to uncouple mitochondrial respiration. The aim of this study was to explore more in depth the mechanism(s) of this uncoupling effect. We found that acceleration of mitochondrial O2 consumption and decrease in membrane potential induced by CORM-3 were associated with an increase in mitochondrial swelling. This effect was independent of the opening of the mitochondrial transition pore as cyclosporine A was unable to prevent it. Interestingly, removal of phosphate from the incubation medium suppressed the effects mediated by CORM-3. Blockade of the dicarboxylate carrier, which exchanges dicarboxylate for phosphate, decreased the effects induced by CORM-3 while direct inhibition of the phosphate carrier with N-ethylmaleimide completely abolished the effects of CORM-3. In addition, CORM-3 was able to enhance the transport of phosphate into mitochondria as evidenced by changes in mitochondrial phosphate concentration and mitochondrial swelling that evaluates the activity of the phosphate carrier in de-energized conditions.

     "abstract": "Photodamage of Photosystem II (PSII) has been considered as an unavoidable and harmful reaction that decreases plant productivity. PSII, however, has an efficient and dynamically regulated repair machinery, and the PSII activity becomes inhibited only when the rate of damage exceeds the rate of repair. The speed of repair is strictly regulated according to the energetic state in the chloroplast. In contrast to PSII, Photosystem I (PSI) is very rarely damaged, but when occurring, the damage is practically irreversible. While PSII damage is linearly dependent on light intensity, PSI gets damaged only when electron flow from PSII exceeds the capacity of PSI electron acceptors to cope with the electrons. When electron flow to PSI is limited, for example in the presence of DCMU, PSI is extremely tolerant against light stress. Proton gradient (\u0394pH)-dependent slow-down of electron transfer from PSII to PSI, involving the PGR5 protein and the Cyt b6f complex, protects PSI from excess electrons upon sudden increase in light intensity. Here we provide evidence that in addition to the \u0394pH-dependent control of electron transfer, the controlled photoinhibition of PSII is also able to protect PSI from permanent photodamage. We propose that regulation of PSII photoinhibition is the ultimate regulator of the photosynthetic electron transfer chain and provides a photoprotection mechanism against formation of reactive oxygen species and photodamage in PSI.",

     "abstract": "Structure\u2013function properties of the cytochrome b6f complex are sufficiently unique compared to those of the cytochrome bc1 complex that b6f should not be considered a trivially modified bc1 complex. A unique property of the dimeric b6f complex is its involvement in transmembrane signaling associated with the p-side oxidation of plastoquinol. Structure analysis of lipid binding sites in the cyanobacterial b6f complex prepared by hydrophobic chromatography shows that the space occupied by the H transmembrane helix in the cytochrome b subunit of the bc1 complex is mostly filled by a lipid in the b6f crystal structure. It is suggested that this space can be filled by the domain of a transmembrane signaling protein. The identification of lipid sites and likely function defines the intra-membrane conserved central core of the b6f complex, consisting of the seven trans-membrane helices of the cytochrome b and subunit IV polypeptides. The other six TM helices, contributed by cytochrome f, the iron\u2013sulfur protein, and the four peripheral single span subunits, define a peripheral less conserved domain of the complex. The distribution of conserved and non-conserved domains of each monomer of the complex, and the position and inferred function of a number of the lipids, suggests a model for the sequential assembly in the membrane of the eight subunits of the b6f complex, in which the assembly is initiated by formation of the cytochrome b6-subunit IV core sub-complex in a monomer unit.

Based on X-ray crystallographic studies of cytochrome bc1, a mechanism has been proposed in which the extrinsic domain of the iron\u2013sulfur protein first binds to cytochrome b where it accepts an electron from ubiquinol in the Qo site, and then rotates by 57\u00b0 to a position close to cytochrome c1 where it transfers an electron to cytochrome c1. This review describes the development of a ruthenium photooxidation technique to measure key electron transfer steps in cytochrome bc1, including rapid electron transfer from the iron\u2013sulfur protein to cytochrome c1. It was discovered that this reaction is rate-limited by the rotational dynamics of the iron\u2013sulfur protein rather than true electron transfer. A conformational linkage between the occupant of the Qo ubiquinol binding site and the rotational dynamics of the iron\u2013sulfur protein was discovered which could play a role in the bifurcated oxidation of ubiquinol.

Mitochondrial ROS are generally linked to oxidative stress, aging and other pathophysiological settings like in neurodegenerative diseases. However, ROS produced at the ubiquinol oxidation center (center P, Qo site) of complex III seem to have additional physiological functions as signaling molecules during cellular processes like the adaptation to hypoxia. The molecular mechanism of superoxide production that is mechanistically linked to the electron bifurcation during ubiquinol oxidation is still a matter of debate. Some insight comes from extensive kinetic studies with mutated complexes from yeast and bacterial cytochrome bc1 complexes.

In particular, we discuss the \u201cforward\u201d and \u201creverse\u201d electron transfer pathways that lead to superoxide generation at the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of CIII, and the components that affect these reactions. We then describe and compare the properties of a bacterial (Rhodobacter capsulatus) mutant enzyme producing ROS with its mitochondrial (human cybrids) counterpart associated with a disease. The mutation under study is located at a highly conserved tyrosine residue of cytochrome b (Y302C in R. capsulatus and Y278C in human mitochondria) that is at the heart of the quinol oxidation (Qo) site of CIII. Similarities of the major findings of bacterial and human mitochondrial cases, including decreased catalytic activity of CIII, enhanced ROS production and ensuing cellular responses and damages, are remarkable. This case illustrates the usefulness of undertaking parallel and complementary studies using biologically different yet evolutionarily related systems, such as \u03b1-proteobacteria and human mitochondria. It progresses our understanding of CIII mechanism of function and ROS production, and underlines the possible importance of supra-molecular organization of bacterial and mitochondrial respiratory chains (i.e., respirasomes) and their potential disease-associated protective roles.

     "abstract": "1. Recent results suggest that the major flux is carried by a monomeric function, not by an intermonomer electron flow. 2. The bifurcated reaction at the Qo-site involves sequential partial processes, \u2014 a rate limiting first electron transfer generating a semiquinone (SQ) intermediate, and a rapid second electron transfer in which the SQ is oxidized by the low potential chain. 3. The rate constant for the first step in a strongly endergonic, proton-first-then-electron mechanism, is given by a Marcus\u2013Br\u00f8nsted treatment in which a rapid electron transfer is convoluted with a weak occupancy of the proton configuration needed for electron transfer. 4. A rapid second electron transfer pulls the overall reaction over. Mutation of Glu-295 of cyt b shows it to be a key player. 5. In more crippled mutants, electron transfer is severely inhibited and the bell-shaped pH dependence of wildtype is replaced by a dependence on a single pK at ~\u00a08.5 favoring electron transfer. Loss of a pK ~\u00a06.5 is explained by a change in the rate limiting step from the first to the second electron transfer; the pK ~\u00a08.5 may reflect dissociation of QH. 6. A rate constant (<\u00a0103\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) for oxidation of SQ in the distal domain by heme bL has been determined, which precludes mechanisms for normal flux in which SQ is constrained there. 7. Glu-295 catalyzes proton exit through H+ transfer from QH, and rotational displacement to deliver the H+ to exit channel(s). This opens a volume into which Q\u2212 can move closer to the heme to speed electron transfer. 8. A kinetic model accounts well for the observations, but leaves open the question of gating mechanisms.

We discuss the predicted redox properties of the Rieske cluster in relation to the nature of the pool quinone. It appears that acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria specialized one of their two copies for reverse electron transfer, archaeal Thermoprotei adapted their three copies to the interaction with different oxidases and several, phylogenetically unrelated species imported a second complex with a putative heme ci that may confer some yet to be determined properties to the complex.

     "abstract": "This review traces the evolution of the cytochrome bc complexes from their early spread among prokaryotic lineages and up to the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex (complex III) and its role in apoptosis. The results of phylogenomic analysis suggest that the bacterial cytochrome b6f-type complexes with short cytochromes b were the ancient form that preceded in evolution the cytochrome bc1-type complexes with long cytochromes b. The common ancestor of the b6f-type and the bc1-type complexes probably resembled the b6f-type complexes found in Heliobacteriaceae and in some Planctomycetes. Lateral transfers of cytochrome bc operons could account for the several instances of acquisition of different types of bacterial cytochrome bc complexes by archaea. The gradual oxygenation of the atmosphere could be the key evolutionary factor that has driven further divergence and spread of the cytochrome bc complexes. On the one hand, oxygen could be used as a very efficient terminal electron acceptor. On the other hand, auto-oxidation of the components of the bc complex results in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which necessitated diverse adaptations of the b6f-type and bc1-type complexes, as well as other, functionally coupled proteins. A detailed scenario of the gradual involvement of the cardiolipin-containing mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complex into the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is proposed, where the functioning of the complex as an apoptotic trigger is viewed as a way to accelerate the elimination of the cells with irreparably damaged, ROS-producing mitochondria. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Respiratory complex III and related bc complexes.",

     "abstract": "The Escherichia coli respiratory complex II paralogs succinate dehydrogenase (SdhCDAB) and fumarate reductase (FrdABCD) catalyze interconversion of succinate and fumarate coupled to quinone reduction or oxidation, respectively. Based on structural comparison of the two enzymes, equivalent residues at the interface between the highly homologous soluble domains and the divergent membrane anchor domains were targeted for study. This included the residue pair SdhB-R205 and FrdB-S203, as well as the conserved SdhB-K230 and FrdB-K228 pair. The close proximity of these residues to the [3Fe\u20134S] cluster and the quinone binding pocket provided an excellent opportunity to investigate factors controlling the reduction potential of the [3Fe\u20134S] cluster, the directionality of electron transfer and catalysis, and the architecture and chemistry of the quinone binding sites. Our results indicate that both SdhB-R205 and SdhB-K230 play important roles in fine tuning the reduction potential of both the [3Fe\u20134S] cluster and the heme. In FrdABCD, mutation of FrdB-S203 did not alter the reduction potential of the [3Fe\u20134S] cluster, but removal of the basic residue at FrdB-K228 caused a significant downward shift (>\u00a0100\u00a0mV) in potential. The latter residue is also indispensable for quinone binding and enzyme activity. The differences observed for the FrdB-K228 and Sdh-K230 variants can be attributed to the different locations of the quinone binding site in the two paralogs. Although this residue is absolutely conserved, they have diverged to achieve different functions in Frd and Sdh.",

     "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) catalyzes the oxidation of water in the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in photosynthesis. Water delivery and oxygen removal from the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), buried deep within PSII, are critical requirements to facilitate the reaction and minimize reactive oxygen damage. It has often been assumed that water and oxygen travel through separate channels within PSII, as demonstrated in cytochrome c oxidase. This study describes all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of PSII designed to investigate channels by fully characterizing the distribution and permeation of both water and oxygen. Interestingly, most channels found in PSII were permeable to both oxygen and water, however individual channels exhibited different energetic barriers for the two solutes. Several routes for oxygen diffusion within PSII with low energy permeation barriers were found, ensuring its fast removal from the OEC. In contrast, all routes for water showed significant energy barriers, corresponding to a much slower permeation rate for water through PSII. Two major factors were responsible for this selectivity: (1) hydrogen bonds between water and channel amino acids, and (2) steric restraints. Our results reveal the presence of a shared network of channels in PSII optimized to both facilitate the quick removal of oxygen and effectively restrict the water supply to the OEC to help stabilize and protect it from small water soluble inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "The impact of complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) on the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been underestimated for a long time. However, recent studies with intact mitochondria revealed that complex II can be a significant source of ROS. Using submitochondrial particles from bovine heart mitochondria as a system that allows the precise setting of substrate concentrations we could show that mammalian complex II produces ROS at subsaturating succinate concentrations in the presence of Q-site inhibitors like atpenin A5 or when a further downstream block of the respiratory chain occurred. Upon inhibition of the ubiquinone reductase activity, complex II produced about 75% hydrogen peroxide and 25% superoxide. ROS generation was attenuated by all dicarboxylates that are known to bind competitively to the substrate binding site of complex II, suggesting that the oxygen radicals are mainly generated by the unoccupied flavin site. Importantly, the ROS production induced by the Q-site inhibitor atpenin A5 was largely unaffected by the redox state of the Q pool and the activity of other respiratory chain complexes. Hence, complex II has to be considered as an independent source of mitochondrial ROS in physiology and pathophysiology.",

     "abstract": "Proton matrix ENDOR was performed to investigate the protons close to the manganese cluster in oriented samples of photosystem II (PS II). Eight pairs of ENDOR signals were detected in oriented PS II membranes. At an angle of \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 between the membrane normal vector n and the external field H0, five pairs of ENDOR signals were exchangeable in D2O medium and three pairs were not exchangeable in D2O medium. The hyperfine splitting of 3.60\u00a0MHz at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0 increased to 3.80\u00a0MHz at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0. The non-exchangeable signals with 1.73\u00a0MHz hyperfine splitting at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b0, which were assigned to a proton in an amino acid residue, were not detected at \u03b8\u00a0=\u00a090\u00b0 in oriented PS II or in non-oriented PS II. Highly resolved spectra show that only limited numbers of protons were detected by CW-ENDOR spectra, although many protons were located near the CaMn4O5 cluster. The detected exchangeable protons were proposed to arise from the protons belonging to the water molecules, labeled W1-W4 in the 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure, directly ligated to the CaMn4O5 cluster, and nearby amino-acid residue.",

     "abstract": "Cyanobacteria have multiple psbA genes encoding PsbA, the D1 reaction center protein of the Photosystem II (PSII) complex. The thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus has three psbA genes differently expressed depending on the environmental conditions. Among the 344 residues of PsbA, there are 21 substitutions between PsbA1 and PsbA3, 31 between PsbA1 and PsbA2 and 27 between PsbA2 and PsbA3. In this study, we found a new hemoprotein that is expressed when the T. elongatus genome has only the psbA2 gene for D1. This hemoprotein was found in both the non-membrane proteins and associated to the purified PsbA2-PSII core complex. This protein could be removed by the washing of PSII with Tris-washing or CaCl2-washing. From MALDI-TOF/TOF spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS/MS analysis upon tryptic digestion, the new hemoprotein was identified to be the tll0287 gene product with a molecular mass close to 19\u00a0kDa. Until now, tll0287 was registered as a gene encoding a hypothetical protein with an unknown function. From the amino acid sequence and the EPR spectrum the 5th and 6th axial ligands of the heme iron are the His145 and likely either the Tyr93, Tyr159 or Tyr165, respectively. From EPR, the heme containing Tll0287 protein associated to PsbA2-PSII corresponds to approximately 25% of the Cytc550 content whereas, from SDS page analysis, the total amount of Tll0287 with and without the heme seems almost in a stoichiometric amount with PsbA2-PSII. Homologous genes to tll0287 are found in several cyanobacteria. Possible roles for Tll0287 are suggested.",

     "abstract": "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a photoautotrophic green alga, which can be grown mixotrophically in acetate-supplemented media (Tris\u2013acetate\u2013phosphate). We show that acetate has a direct effect on photosystem II (PSII). As a consequence, Tris\u2013acetate\u2013phosphate-grown mixotrophic C. reinhardtii cultures are less susceptible to photoinhibition than photoautotrophic cultures when subjected to high light. Spin-trapping electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that thylakoids from mixotrophic C. reinhardtii produced less 1O2 than those from photoautotrophic cultures. The same was observed in vivo by measuring DanePy oxalate fluorescence quenching. Photoinhibition can be induced by the production of 1O2 originating from charge recombination events in photosystem II, which are governed by the midpoint potentials (Em) of the quinone electron acceptors. Thermoluminescence indicated that the Em of the primary quinone acceptor (QA/QA\u2212) of mixotrophic cells was stabilised while the Em of the secondary quinone acceptor (QB/QB\u2212) was destabilised, therefore favouring direct non-radiative charge recombination events that do not lead to 1O2 production. Acetate treatment of photosystem II-enriched membrane fragments from spinach led to the same thermoluminescence shifts as observed in C. reinhardtii, showing that acetate exhibits a direct effect on photosystem II independent from the metabolic state of a cell. A change in the environment of the non-heme iron of acetate-treated photosystem II particles was detected by low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. We hypothesise that acetate replaces the bicarbonate associated to the non-heme iron and changes the environment of QA and QB affecting photosystem II charge recombination events and photoinhibition.",

The mutations were engineered both at the donor (L131L, M160L, M197F and M202H) and acceptor (M265I and M234E) sides. While the donor side mutations changed systematically the number of H-bonds to P, the acceptor side mutations modified the energetics of QA by altering the van-der-Waals and electronic interactions (M265IT) and H-bond network to the acidic cluster around QB (M234EH, M234EL, M234EA and M234ER). All mutants decreased the free energy gap of the wild type RC (~\u00a0890\u00a0meV), i.e. destabilized the P+QA\u2212 charge pair by 60\u2013110\u00a0meV at pH\u00a08. Multiple modifications in the hydrogen bonding pattern to P resulted in systematic changes of the free energy gap. The destabilization showed no pH-dependence (M234 mutants) or slight increase (WT, donor-side mutants and M265IT above pH\u00a08) with average slope of 10\u201315\u00a0meV/pH unit over the 6\u201310.5\u00a0pH range. In wild type and donor-side mutants, the free energy change of the charge separation consisted of mainly enthalpic term but the acceptor side mutants showed increased entropic (even above that of enthalpic) contributions.

     "abstract": "The Na+,K+-ATPase is accepted as an important source of heat generation (thermogenesis) in animals. Based on information gained on the kinetics of the enzyme's partial reactions we consider via computer simulation whether modifications to the function of the combined Na+,K+-ATPase/plasma membrane complex system could lead to an increased body temperature, either through the course of evolution or during an individual's lifespan. The enzyme's kinetics must be considered because it is the rate of heat generation which determines body temperature, not simply the amount of heat per enzymatic cycle. The results obtained indicate that a decrease in thermodynamic efficiency of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which could come about by Na+ substituting for K+ on the enzyme's extracellular face, could not account for increased thermogenesis. The only feasible mechanisms are an increase in the enzyme's expression level or an increase in its ion pumping activity. The major source of Na+,K+-ATPase-related thermogenesis (72% of heat production) is found to derive from passive Na+ diffusion into the cell, which counterbalances outward Na+ pumping to maintain a constant Na+ concentration gradient across the membrane. A simultaneous increase in both Na+,K+-ATPase activity and the membrane's passive Na+ permeability could promote a higher body temperature.",

These events were associated with gradual reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. The intracellular ATP levels further declined as a consequence of PEI-mediated plasma membrane damage and subsequent ATP leakage to the extracellular medium. Studies with freshly isolated mouse liver mitochondria corroborated with bioenergetic findings and demonstrated parallel polycation concentration- and time-dependent changes in state 2 and state 4o oxygen flux as well as lowered ADP phosphorylation (state 3) and mitochondrial ATP synthesis. Polycation-mediated reduction of electron transport system activity was further demonstrated in \u2018broken mitochondria\u2019 (freeze-thawed mitochondrial preparations). Moreover, by using both high-resolution respirometry and spectrophotometry analysis of cytochrome c oxidase activity we were able to identify complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) as a likely specific site of PEI mediated inhibition within the electron transport system.

Chloracidobacterium (Cab.) thermophilum\u201d were analysed using PeakForce Tapping atomic force microscopy (PFT-AFM). Gentle PFT-AFM imaging in buffered solutions that maintained the chlorosomes in a near-native state revealed ellipsoids of variable size, with surface bumps and undulations that differ between individual chlorosomes. Cba. tepidum chlorosomes were the largest (133\u00a0\u00d7\u00a057\u00a0\u00d7\u00a036\u00a0nm; 141,000\u00a0nm3 volume), compared with chlorosomes from Cfx. aurantiacus (120\u00a0\u00d7\u00a044\u00a0\u00d7\u00a030\u00a0nm; 84,000\u00a0nm3) and Ca.

Reflecting the contributions of thousands of pigment\u2013pigment stacking interactions to the stability of these supramolecular assemblies, analysis by nanomechanical mapping shows that chlorosomes are highly stable and that their integrity is disrupted only by very strong forces of 1000\u20132000\u00a0pN. AFM topographs of Ca. Cab. thermophilum chlorosomes that had retained their attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane showed that this membrane dynamically changes shape and is composed of protrusions of up to 30\u00a0nm wide and 6\u00a0nm above the mica support, possibly representing different protein domains. Spectral imaging revealed significant heterogeneity in the fluorescence emission of individual chlorosomes, likely reflecting the variations in BChl c homolog composition and internal arrangements of the stacked BChls within each chlorosome.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial carriers are members of a family of transport proteins that mediate solute transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Two isoforms of the glutamate carriers, GC1 and GC2 (encoded by the SLC25A22 and SLC25A18 genes, respectively), have been identified in humans. Two independent mutations in SLC25A22 are associated with severe epileptic encephalopathy. In the present study we show that two genes (CG18347 and CG12201) phylogenetically related to the human GC encoding genes are present in the D. melanogaster genome. We have functionally characterized the proteins encoded by CG18347 and CG12201, designated as DmGC1p and DmGC2p respectively, by overexpression in Escherichia coli and reconstitution into liposomes. Their transport properties demonstrate that DmGC1p and DmGC2p both catalyze the transport of glutamate across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Computational approaches have been used in order to highlight residues of DmGC1p and DmGC2p involved in substrate binding. Furthermore, gene expression analysis during development and in various adult tissues reveals that CG18347 is ubiquitously expressed in all examined D. melanogaster tissues, while the expression of CG12201 is strongly testis-biased. Finally, we identified mitochondrial glutamate carrier orthologs in 49 eukaryotic species in order to attempt the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the glutamate carrier function. Comparison of the exon/intron structure and other key features of the analyzed orthologs suggests that eukaryotic glutamate carrier genes descend from an intron-rich ancestral gene already present in the common ancestor of lineages that diverged as early as bilateria and radiata.",

Their active centres are affine with the structures of minerals presumed to contribute to precipitate membranes produced on the mixing of hydrothermal solutions with the Hadean Ocean ~\u00a04\u00a0billion years ago. These mineral precipitates consist of transition element sulphides and oxides such as nickelian mackinawite ([Fe\u00a0>\u00a0Ni]2S2), a nickel-bearing greigite (~\u00a0FeSS[Fe3NiS4]SSFe), violarite (~\u00a0NiSS[Fe2Ni2S4]SSNi), a molybdenum bearing complex (~\u00a0MoIV/VI2Fe3S0/2\u00a0\u22129) and green rust or fougerite (~[FeIIFeIII(OH)4]+[OH]\u2212).

Most of the error in such an approach arises from inaccurate differential solvation free energies of the acid and conjugate base which is removed in our approach using a correction based on the realization that the gas-phase acidities have only a small systematic error relative to the dominant systematic error in the differential solvation. The methodology is outlined in the context of the calculation of a set of neutral acids with water as the solvent for a reasonably accurate electronic structure level of theory (DFT), basis set, and implicit solvation model. It is then applied to the comparison of results for three different hybrid density functionals to illustrate the insensitivity to the functional. Finally, the approach is applied to the comparison of results for sets of neutral acids and protonated amine cationic acids in both aqueous (water) and nonaqueous (acetonitrile) solvents. The methodology is shown to generally predict the pKa values for all the cases investigated to within 1 pH unit so long as the differential solvation error is larger than the systematic error in the gas-phase acidity calculations. Such an approach is rather general and does not have additional complications that would arise in a cluster-continuum method, thus giving it strength as a simple high-throughput means to calculate absolute pKa values.

     "abstract": "Membrane proteins use the energy of light or high energy substrates to build a transmembrane proton gradient through a series of reactions leading to proton release into the lower pH compartment (P-side) and proton uptake from the higher pH compartment (N-side). This review considers how the proton affinity of the substrates, cofactors and amino acids are modified in four proteins to drive proton transfers. Bacterial reaction centers (RCs) and photosystem II (PSII) carry out redox chemistry with the species to be oxidized on the P-side while reduction occurs on the N-side of the membrane. Terminal redox cofactors are used which have pKas that are strongly dependent on their redox state, so that protons are lost on oxidation and gained on reduction. Bacteriorhodopsin is a true proton pump. Light activation triggers trans to cis isomerization of a bound retinal. Strong electrostatic interactions within clusters of amino acids are modified by the conformational changes initiated by retinal motion leading to changes in proton affinity, driving transmembrane proton transfer. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) catalyzes the reduction of O2 to water. The protons needed for chemistry are bound from the N-side. The reduction chemistry also drives proton pumping from N- to P-side. Overall, in CcO the uptake of 4 electrons to reduce O2 transports 8 charges across the membrane, with each reduction fully coupled to removal of two protons from the N-side, the delivery of one for chemistry and transport of the other to the P-side.",

     "abstract": "As discussed throughout this special issue, oxidation and reduction reactions play critical roles in the function of many organisms. In photosynthetic organisms, the conversion of light energy drives oxidation and reduction reactions through the transfer of electrons and protons in order to create energy-rich compounds. These reactions occur in proteins such as cytochrome c, a heme-containing water-soluble protein, the bacteriochlorophyll-containing reaction center, and photosystem II where water is oxidized at the manganese cluster. A critical measure describing the ability of cofactors in proteins to participate in such reactions is the oxidation/reduction midpoint potential. In this review, the basic concepts of oxidation/reduction reactions are reviewed with a summary of the experimental approaches used to measure the midpoint potential of metal cofactors. For cofactors in proteins, the midpoint potential not only depends upon the specific chemical characteristics of cofactors but also upon interactions with the surrounding protein, such as the nature of the coordinating ligands and protein environment. These interactions can be tailored to optimize an oxidation/reduction reaction carried out by the protein. As examples, the midpoint potentials of hemes in cytochromes, bacteriochlorophylls in reaction centers, and the manganese cluster of photosystem II are discussed with an emphasis on the influence that protein interactions have on these potentials.

Basic principles and recent advances in our understanding of the prokaryotic Fe/S biogenesis ISC and SUF systems are reviewed in the present communication.

Also, the importance of Fe/S biosynthesis systems in mediating soft metal toxicity was documented. A brief account of the Fe/S biosynthesis systems diversity as present in current databases is given here. Moreover, Fe/S biosynthesis factors have themselves been the object of molecular tailoring during evolution and some examples are discussed here.

     "abstract": "The direct conversion of sunlight into biofuels is an intriguing alternative to a continued reliance on fossil fuels. Natural photosynthesis has long been investigated both as a potential solution, and as a model for utilizing solar energy to drive a water-to-fuel cycle. The molecules and organizational structure provide a template to inspire the design of efficient molecular systems for photocatalysis. A clear design strategy is the coordination of molecular interactions that match kinetic rates and energetic levels to control the direction and flow of energy from light harvesting to catalysis. Energy transduction and electron-transfer reactions occur through interfaces formed between complexes of donor\u2013acceptor molecules. Although the structures of several of the key biological complexes have been solved, detailed descriptions of many electron-transfer complexes are lacking, which presents a challenge to designing and engineering biomolecular systems for solar conversion. Alternatively, it is possible to couple the catalytic power of biological enzymes to light harvesting by semiconductor nanomaterials. In these molecules, surface chemistry and structure can be designed using ligands. The passivation effect of the ligand can also dramatically affect the photophysical properties of the semiconductor, and energetics of external charge-transfer. The length, degree of bond saturation (aromaticity), and solvent exposed functional groups of ligands can be manipulated to further tune the interface to control molecular assembly, and complex stability in photocatalytic hybrids. The results of this research show how ligand selection is critical to designing molecular interfaces that promote efficient self-assembly, charge-transfer and photocatalysis.

     "abstract": "Recent investigations of the interconversion of CO2 and formic acid using Ru, Ir and Fe complexes are summarized in this review. During the past several years, both the reaction rates and catalyst stabilities have been significantly improved. Remarkably, the interconversion (i.e., reversibility) has also been achieved under mild conditions in environmentally benign water solvent by slightly changing the pH of the aqueous solution. Only a few catalysts seem to reflect a bio-inspired design such as the use of proton responsive ligands, ligands with pendent bases or acids for a second-coordination-sphere interaction, electroresponsive ligands, and/or ligands having a hydrogen bonding function with a solvent molecule or an added reagent. The most successful of these is an iridium dinuclear complex catalyst that at least has the first three of these characteristics associated with its bridging ligand. By utilizing an acid/base equilibrium for proton removal, the ligand becomes a strong electron donor, resulting in Ir(I) character with a vacant coordination site at each metal center in slightly basic solution. Complemented by DFT calculations, kinetic studies of the rates of formate production using a related family of Ir complexes with and without such functions on the ligand reveal that the rate-determining step for the CO2 hydrogenation is likely to be H2 addition through heterolytic cleavage involving a \u201cproton relay\u201d through the pendent base. The dehydrogenation of formic acid, owing to the proton responsive ligands changing character under slightly acidic pH conditions, is likely to occur by a mechanism with a different rate-determining step.

While organisms that are capable of formatotrophic growth, i.e. growth on formate, exist naturally, they are generally less suitable for bulk cultivation and industrial needs. Hence, it may be helpful to engineer a model organism of industrial relevance, such as E. coli, for growth on formate. There are numerous metabolic pathways that can potentially support formatotrophic growth. Here we analyze these diverse pathways according to various criteria including biomass yield, thermodynamic favorability, chemical motive force, kinetics and the practical challenges posed by their expression. We find that the reductive glycine pathway, composed of the tetrahydrofolate system, the glycine cleavage system, serine hydroxymethyltransferase and serine deaminase, is a promising candidate to support electrosynthesis in E. coli. The approach presented here exemplifies how combining different computational approaches into a systematic analysis methodology provides assistance in redesigning metabolism.

     "abstract": "Over the past two decades, prominent importance of molybdenum-containing enzymes in prokaryotes has been put forward by studies originating from different fields. Proteomic or bioinformatic studies underpinned that the list of molybdenum-containing enzymes is far from being complete with to date, more than fifty different enzymes involved in the biogeochemical nitrogen, carbon and sulfur cycles. In particular, the vast majority of prokaryotic molybdenum-containing enzymes belong to the so-called dimethylsulfoxide reductase family. Despite its extraordinary diversity, this family is characterized by the presence of a Mo/W-bis(pyranopterin guanosine dinucleotide) cofactor at the active site. This review highlights what has been learned about the properties of the catalytic site, the modular variation of the structural organization of these enzymes, and their interplay with the isoprenoid quinones. In the last part, this review provides an integrated view of how these enzymes contribute to the bioenergetics of prokaryotes.

     "abstract": "Molybdenum cofactor (Moco) biosynthesis is an ancient, ubiquitous, and highly conserved pathway leading to the biochemical activation of molybdenum. Moco is the essential component of a group of redox enzymes, which are diverse in terms of their phylogenetic distribution and their architectures, both at the overall level and in their catalytic geometry. A wide variety of transformations are catalyzed by these enzymes at carbon, sulfur and nitrogen atoms, which include the transfer of an oxo group or two electrons to or from the substrate. More than 50 molybdoenzymes were identified in bacteria to date. In molybdoenzymes Mo is coordinated to a dithiolene group on the 6-alkyl side chain of a pterin called molybdopterin (MPT). The biosynthesis of Moco can be divided into four general steps in bacteria: 1) formation of the cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate, 2) formation of MPT, 3) insertion of molybdenum into molybdopterin to form Moco, and 4) additional modification of Moco with the attachment of GMP or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT, forming the dinucleotide variant of Moco. This review will focus on molybdoenzymes, the biosynthesis of Moco, and its incorporation into specific target proteins focusing on Escherichia coli.

Among these alternative substrates are included a wide array of carbon-containing compounds. These compounds have provided unique insights into aspects of the nitrogenase mechanism.

     "abstract": "This review discusses the development of molecular electrocatalysts for H2 production and oxidation based on nickel. A modular approach is used in which the structure of the catalyst is divided into first, second, and outer coordination spheres. The first coordination sphere consists of the ligands bound directly to the metal center, and this coordination sphere can be used to control such factors as the presence or absence of vacant coordination sites, redox potentials, hydride donor abilities and other important thermodynamic parameters. The second coordination sphere includes functional groups such as pendent acids or bases that can interact with bound substrates such as H2 molecules and hydride ligands, but that do not form strong bonds with the metal center. These functional groups can play diverse roles such as assisting the heterolytic cleavage of H2, controlling intra- and intermolecular proton transfer reactions, and providing a physical pathway for coupling proton and electron transfer reactions. By controlling both the hydride donor ability of the catalysts using the first coordination sphere and the proton donor abilities of the functional groups in the second coordination sphere, catalysts can be designed that are biased toward H2 production, oxidation, or bidirectional (catalyzing both H2 oxidation and production). The outer coordination sphere is defined as that portion of the catalytic system that is beyond the second coordination sphere. This coordination sphere can assist in the delivery of protons and electrons to and from the catalytically active site, thereby adding another important avenue for controlling catalytic activity. Many features of these simple catalytic systems are good models for enzymes, and these simple systems provide insights into enzyme function and reactivity that may be difficult to probe in enzymes.

An increasing number of data highlighted their role for cellular differentiation processes. We investigated differences in ATP synthase supra-molecular organization occurring in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts in the course of cardiac-like differentiation, along with ATP synthase biogenesis and maturation of mitochondrial cristae morphology. Using BN-PAGE analysis combined with one-step mild detergent extraction from mitochondria, a significant increase in dimer/monomer ratio was observed, indicating a distinct rise in the stability of the enzyme super-assembly. Remarkably, sub-stoichiometric mean values for ATP synthase subunit e were determined in both parental and cardiac-like H9c2 by an MS-based quantitative proteomics approach. This indicates a similar high proportion of complex molecules lacking subunit e in both cell types, and suggests a minor contribution of this component in the observed changes. 2D BN-PAGE/immunoblotting analysis and MS/MS analysis on single BN-PAGE band showed that the amount of inhibitor protein IF1 bound within the ATP synthase complexes increased in cardiac-like H9c2 and appeared greater in the dimer. In concomitance, a consistent improvement of enzyme activity, measured as both ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis rate, was observed, despite the increase of bound IF1 evocative of a greater inhibitory effect on the enzyme ATPase activity. The results suggest i) a role for IF1 in promoting dimer stabilization and super-assembly in H9c2 with physiological IF1 expression levels, likely unveiled by the fact that the contacts through accessory subunit e appear to be partially destabilized, ii) a link between dimer stabilization and enzyme activation.",

We have used a mouse L-cell fibroblast model harboring Rattus norvegicus mtDNA (Rn xenocybrids) to examine the effects of multiple oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cell death signaling. Blue native-PAGE analyses of Rn xenocybrids revealed defects in OXPHOS complex biogenesis with reduced steady-state levels of complexes I, III and IV. Isolated Rn xenocybrid mitochondria exhibited deficiencies in complex II\u00a0+\u00a0III and III activities, with CIII-stimulated ROS generation 66% higher than in control mitochondria. Rn xenocybrid cells were resistant to staurosporine-induced cell death, but exhibited a four-fold increase in sensitivity to ceramide-induced cell death that was caspase-3 independent and did not induce chromosomal DNA degradation. Furthermore, ceramide directly inhibited Rn xenocybrid complex II\u00a0+\u00a0III activity by 97%, although this inhibition could be completely abolished by exogenous decylubiquinone. Ceramide also induced a further increase in ROS output from Rn xenocybrid complex III by 42%. These results suggest that the interaction of ceramide with OXPHOS complex III is significantly enhanced by the presence of the xenotypic Rattus cytochrome b in complex III, likely due to the increased affinity for ceramide at the ubiquinone binding site. We propose a novel mechanism of altered mitochondrial cell death signaling due to mtDNA mutations whereby ceramide directly induces OXPHOS complex ROS generation to initiate cell death pathways.",

     "publication date": "07-2013",
     "abstract": "The membrane-bound enzyme cNOR (cytochrome c dependent nitric oxide reductase) catalyzes the reduction of NO in a non-electrogenic process. This is in contrast to the reduction of O2 in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the other member of the heme-copper oxidase family, which stores energy by the generation of a membrane gradient. This difference between the two enzymes has not been understood, but it has been speculated to be of kinetic origin, since per electron the NO reduction is more exergonic than the O2 reduction, and the energy should thus be enough for an electrogenic process. However, it has not been clear how and why electrogenicity, which mainly affects the thermodynamics, would slow down the very exergonic NO reduction. Quantum chemical calculations are used to construct a free energy profile for the catalytic reduction of NO in the active site of cNOR. The energy profile shows that the reduction of the NO molecules by the enzyme and the formation of N2O are very exergonic steps, making the rereduction of the enzyme endergonic and rate-limiting for the entire catalytic cycle. Therefore the NO reduction cannot be electrogenic, i.e. cannot take electrons and protons from the opposite sides of the membrane, since it would increase the endergonicity of the rereduction when the gradient is present, thereby increasing the rate-limiting barrier, and the reaction would become too slow. It also means that proton pumping coupled to electron transfer is not possible in cNOR. In CcO the corresponding rereduction of the enzyme is very exergonic.",

We found that, as previously described in the case of the unicellular alga Rhodella violacea (E. Delphin et al., Plant Physiol. 118 (1998) 103\u2013113), a single multi-turnover saturating pulse of light is sufficient to induce a strong quenching of fluorescence.

In addition, we studied the dependence of these various observables upon the excitation wavelength. This led us to identify energy spill-over from Photosystem II to Photosystem I rather than a qE-type non-photochemical quenching as the major source of fluorescence quenching that develops upon a series of 200\u00a0ms pulses of saturating light results, in line with the conclusion of Ley and Butler (Biochim. Biophys. Acta 592 (1980) 349\u2013363) from their studies of the unicellular red alga Porphyridium cruentum.

The rate of ATP appearance outside mitochondria was measured as the increase in NADPH absorbance which occurs, following external addition of ADP, when ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation and exported from mitochondria in the presence of glucose, hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found that the mitochondrial superoxide anions, whose production is induced at the level of Complex I by externally added A\u03b21-42 and whose release from mitochondria is significantly reduced by the addition of the VDAC inhibitor DIDS, modify the thiol group/s present at the active site of mitochondrial ANT-1, impair ANT-1 in a mersalyl-prevented manner and abrogate the toxic effect of NH2htau on ANT-1 when A\u03b21-42 is already present. A molecular mechanism is proposed in which the pathological A\u03b2-NH2htau interplay on ANT-1 in Alzheimer's neurons involves the thiol redox state of ANT-1 and the A\u03b21-42-induced ROS increase.

     "abstract": "Forty-three years ago, Kok and coworkers introduced a phenomenological model describing period-four oscillations in O2 flash yields during photosynthetic water oxidation (WOC), which had been first reported by Joliot and coworkers. The original two-parameter Kok model was subsequently extended in its level of complexity to better simulate diverse data sets, including intact cells and isolated PSII-WOCs, but at the expense of introducing physically unrealistic assumptions necessary to enable numerical solutions. To date, analytical solutions have been found only for symmetric Kok models (inefficiencies are equally probable for all intermediates, called \u201cS-states\u201d). However, it is widely accepted that S-state reaction steps are not identical and some are not reversible (by thermodynamic restraints) thereby causing asymmetric cycles. We have developed a mathematically more rigorous foundation that eliminates unphysical assumptions known to be in conflict with experiments and adopts a new experimental constraint on solutions. This new algorithm termed STEAMM for S-state Transition Eigenvalues of Asymmetric Markov Models enables solutions to models having fewer adjustable parameters and uses automated fitting to experimental data sets, yielding higher accuracy and precision than the classic Kok or extended Kok models. This new tool provides a general mathematical framework for analyzing damped oscillations arising from any cycle period using any appropriate Markov model, regardless of symmetry. We illustrate applications of STEAMM that better describe the intrinsic inefficiencies for photon-to-charge conversion within PSII-WOCs that are responsible for damped period-four and period-two oscillations of flash O2 yields across diverse species, while using simpler Markov models free from unrealistic assumptions.",

     "abstract": "Singlet oxygen production in intact cells of the cynobacterium Synechocystis 6803 was studied using chemical trapping by histidine, which leads to O2 uptake during illumination. The rate of O2 uptake, measured by a standard Clark-type electrode, is enhanced in the presence of D2O, which increases the lifetime of 1O2, and suppressed by the 1O2 quencher NaN3. Due to the limited mobility of 1O2 these data demonstrate that exogenous histidine reaches close vicinity of 1O2 production sites inside the cells. Flash induced chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed that histidine does not inhibit Photosystem II activity up to 5\u00a0mM concentration. By applying the histidine-mediated O2 uptake method we showed that 1O2 production linearly increases with light intensity even above the saturation of photosynthesis. We also studied 1O2 production in site directed mutants in which the Gln residue at the 130th position of the D1 reaction center subunit was changed to either Glu or Leu, which affect the efficiency of nonradiative charge recombination from the primary radical pair (Rappaport et al. 2002, Biochemistry 41: 8518\u20138527; Cser and Vass 2007, BBA 1767:233\u2013243). We found that the D1-Gln130Glu mutant showed decreased 1O2 production concomitant with decreased rate of photodamage relative to the WT, whereas both 1O2 production and photodamage were enhanced in the D1-Gln130Leu mutant. The data are discussed in the framework of the model of photoinhibition in which 3P680 mediated 1O2 production plays a key role in PSII photodamage, and nonradiative charge recombination of the primary charge separated state provides a photoprotective pathway.",

The lack of cytochrome bd oxidase was inhibitory only under conditions of oxygen limitation, whereas the absence of a functional cytochrome bc1\u2013aa3 supercomplex led to decreases in growth rate, biomass yield, respiration and proton-motive force (pmf) and a strongly increased maintenance coefficient under oxygen excess. These results show that the bc1\u2013aa3 supercomplex is of major importance for aerobic respiration. For the first time, a C. glutamicum strain with a completely inactivated aerobic respiratory chain was obtained (\u0394cydAB\u0394qcr), named DOOR ( d evoid o f o xygen r espiration), which was able to grow aerobically in BHI (brain\u2013heart infusion) glucose complex medium with a 70% reduced biomass yield compared to the wild type. Surprisingly, reasonable aerobic growth was also possible in glucose minimal medium after supplementation with peptone. Under these conditions, the DOOR strain displayed a fermentative type of catabolism with l-lactate as major and acetate and succinate as minor products. The DOOR strain had about 2% of the oxygen consumption rate of the wild type, showing the absence of additional terminal oxidases. The pmf of the DOOR mutant was reduced by about 30% compared to the wild type. Candidates for pmf generation in the DOOR strain are succinate:menaquinone oxidoreductase, which probably can generate pmf in the direction of fumarate reduction, and F1FO-ATP synthase, which can couple ATP hydrolysis to the export of protons.",

Although MGDG is believed to be important in sustaining the structure and function of the photosynthetic membrane, its exact role in photosynthesis in vivo requires further investigation. In this study, the transgenic tobacco plant M18, which has an MGDG deficiency of approximately 53%, and which contains many fewer thylakoid membranes and exhibits retarded growth and a chlorotic phenotype, was used to investigate the role of MGDG. Chlorophyll fluorescence analysis of the M18 line revealed that PSII activity was inhibited when the plants were exposed to light. The inactive linear electron transport found in M18 plants was mainly attributed to a block in the intersystem electron transport process that was revealed by P700 redox kinetics and PSI light response analysis. Immunoblotting and Blue Native SDS-PAGE analysis suggested that a reduction in the accumulation of cytochrome b6f in M18 plants is a direct structural effect of MGDG deficiency, and this is likely to be responsible for the inefficiency observed in intersystem electron transport. Although drastic impairments of PSII subunits were detected in M18 plants grown under normal conditions, further investigations of low-light-grown M18 plants indicated that the impairments are not direct structural effects. Instead, they are likely to result from the cumulative photodamage that occurs due to impaired photostability under long-term exposure to relatively high light levels. The study suggests that MGDG plays important roles in maintaining both the linear electron transport process and the photostability of the PSII apparatus.",

The catalytic subunit of this enzyme, DmsA, contains an iron\u2013sulfur cluster (FS0) and a molybdo-bis(pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide) cofactor (Mo-bisPGD). We have identified a variant of DmsA (Cys59Ser) that renders enzyme maturation sensitive to molybdenum cofactor availability. DmsA-Cys59 is a ligand to the FS0 [4Fe\u20134S] cluster. In the presence of trace amounts of molybdate, the Cys59Ser variant assembles normally to the cytoplasmic membrane and supports respiratory growth on DMSO, although the ground state of FS0 as determined by EPR is converted from high-spin (S\u00a0=\u00a03/2) to low-spin (S\u00a0=\u00a01/2). In the presence of the molybdenum antagonist tungstate, wild-type DmsABC lacks Mo-bisPGD, but is translocated via the Tat translocon and assembles on the periplasmic side of the membrane as an apoenzyme. The Cys59Ser variant cannot overcome the dual insults of amino acid substitution plus lack of Mo-bisPGD, leading to degradation of the DmsABC subunits. This indicates that the cofactor can serve as a chemical chaperone to mitigate the destabilizing effects of alteration of the FS0 cluster. These results provide insights into the role of the Mo\u2013bisPGD\u2013protein interaction in stabilizing the tertiary structure of DmsA during enzyme maturation.",

     "abstract": "To protect the photosynthetic apparatus against photo-damage in high sunlight, the photosynthetic antenna of oxygenic organisms can switch from a light-harvesting to a photoprotective mode through the process of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). There is growing evidence that light-harvesting proteins of photosystem II participate in photoprotection by a built-in capacity to switch their conformation between light-harvesting and energy-dissipating states. Here we applied high-resolution Magic-Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance on uniformly 13C-enriched major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in active or quenched states. Our results reveal that the switch into a dissipative state is accompanied by subtle changes in the chlorophyll (Chl) a ground-state electronic structures that affect their NMR responses, particularly for the macrocycle 13C4, 13C5 and 13C6 carbon atoms. Inspection of the LHCII X-ray structures shows that of the Chl molecules in the terminal emitter domain, where excited-state energy accumulates prior to further transfer or dissipation, the C4, 5 and 6 atoms are in closest proximity to lutein; supporting quenching mechanisms that involve altered Chl\u2013lutein interactions in the dissipative state. In addition the observed changes could represent altered interactions between Chla and neoxanthin, which alters its configuration under NPQ conditions. The Chls appear to have increased dynamics in unquenched, detergent-solubilized LHCII. Our work demonstrates that solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is applicable to investigate high-resolution structural details of light-harvesting proteins in varied functional conditions, and represents a valuable tool to address their molecular plasticity associated with photoprotection.",

To determine the relative importance of these factors in controlling the rates, we studied the effect of ionic strength on the redox potential and the rate of reduction by dithionite of native Methylophilus methylotrophus cytochrome c\u2033 and three mutants at different pH values. We found that the main factor determining the rate is the driving force and that Marcus theory describes this satisfactorily.

     "abstract": "To address mechanistic questions about the functioning of dimeric cytochrome bc1 new genetic approaches have recently been developed. They were specifically designed to enable construction of asymmetrically-mutated variants suitable for functional studies. One approach exploited a fusion of two cytochromes b that replaced the separate subunits in the dimer. The fusion protein, built from two copies of the same cytochrome b of purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, served as a template to create a series of asymmetrically-mutated cytochrome bc1-like complexes (B\u2013B) which, through kinetic studies, disclosed several important principles of dimer engineering. Here, we report on construction of another fusion protein complex that adds a new tool to investigate dimeric function of the enzyme through the asymmetrically mutated forms of the protein. This complex (BS\u2013B) contains a hybrid protein that combines two different cytochromes b: one coming from R. capsulatus and the other \u2014 from a closely related species, R. sphaeroides. With this new fusion we addressed a still controversial issue of electron transfer between the two hemes bL in the core of dimer. Kinetic data obtained with a series of BS\u2013B variants provided new evidence confirming the previously reported observations that electron transfer between those two hemes occurs on a millisecond timescale, thus is a catalytically-relevant event. Both types of the fusion complexes (B\u2013B and BS\u2013B) consistently implicate that the heme-bL\u2013bL bridge forms an electronic connection available for inter-monomer electron transfer in cytochrome bc1.",

In this work we address this issue by performing extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with the cyt bc1 complex of Rhodobacter capsulatus embedded in a lipid bilayer. Based on the simulations we are able to show the atom-level binding modes of two substrate forms: quinol (QH2) and quinone (Q). The QH2 binding at the Qo-site involves a coordinated water arrangement that produces an exceptionally close and stable interaction between the cyt b and iron sulfur protein subunits. In this arrangement water molecules are positioned suitably in relation to the hydroxyls of the QH2 ring to act as the primary acceptors of protons detaching from the oxidized substrate. In contrast, water does not have a similar role in the Q binding at the Qo-site. Moreover, the coordinated water molecule is also a prime candidate to act as a structural element, gating for short-circuit suppression at the Qo-site.",

Yet, the atom-scale understanding of these highly charged four-tail lipids in the cyt bc1 function has remained quite unclear. We consider this issue through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that are applied to the entire cyt bc1 dimer of the purple photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus embedded in a lipid bilayer. We find CLs to spontaneously diffuse to the dimer interface to the immediate vicinity of the higher potential heme b groups of the complex's catalytic Qi-sites. This observation is in full agreement with crystallographic studies of the complex, and supports the view that CLs are key players in the proton uptake. The simulation results also allow us to present a refined picture for the dimer arrangement in the cyt bc1 complex, the novelty of our work being the description of the role of the surrounding lipid environment: in addition to the specific CL\u2013protein interactions, we observe the protein domains on the positive side of the membrane to settle against the lipids.

For emission at 680\u2013690\u00a0nm the effective trapping time is close to 17\u201318\u00a0ps, and represents the effective trapping time from the bulk antenna. At wavelengths above 700\u00a0nm the effective trapping time increases in a monotonic way, over the entire emission band, to attain values in the range of 70\u201380\u00a0ps near 760\u00a0nm. This is argued to be caused by \u201cuphill\u201d energy transfer from the low energy states to the core antenna and reaction centre. These data, together with the steady state emission spectrum, permit calculation of the overall trapping time for maize PSI\u2013LHCI, which is estimated to be approximately 40\u00a0ps. The wavelength dependence of the trapping time indicates, that in PSI\u2013LHCI there exists at least one red form which emits at lower energies than the 735\u00a0nm state.

     "abstract": "Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) protects photosynthetic organisms against photodamage by high light. One of the key measuring parameters for characterizing NPQ is the high-light induced decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence. The originally measured data are maximal fluorescence (Fm\u2032) signals as a function of actinic illumination time (Fm\u2032(t)). Usually these original data are converted into the so-called Stern\u2013Volmer quenching function, NPQSV(t), which is then analyzed and interpreted in terms of various NPQ mechanisms and kinetics. However, the interpretation of this analysis essentially depends on the assumption that NPQ follows indeed a Stern\u2013Volmer relationship. Here, we question this commonly assumed relationship, which surprisingly has never been proven. We demonstrate by simulation of quenching data that particularly the conversion of time-dependent quenching curves like Fm\u2032(t) into NPQSV(t) is (mathematically) not \u201cinnocent\u201d in terms of its effects. It distorts the kinetic quenching information contained in the originally measured function Fm\u2032(t), leading to a severe (often sigmoidal) distortion of the time-dependence of quenching and has negative impact on the ability to uncover the underlying quenching mechanisms and their contribution to the quenching kinetics. We conclude that the commonly applied analysis of time-dependent NPQ in NPQSV(t) space should be reconsidered. First, there exists no sound theoretical basis for this common practice. Second, there occurs no loss of information whatsoever when analyzing and interpreting the originally measured Fm\u2032(t) data directly. Consequently, the analysis of Fm\u2032(t) data has a much higher potential to provide correct mechanistic answers when trying to correlate quenching data with other biochemical information related to quenching.",

     "abstract": "With the arrival of the third millennium, in spite of unprecedented progress in molecular medicine, cancer remains as untamed as ever. The complexity of tumours, dictating the potential response of cancer cells to anti-cancer agents, has been recently highlighted in a landmark paper by Weinberg and Hanahan on hallmarks of cancer [1]. Together with the recently published papers on the complexity of tumours in patients and even within the same tumour (see below), the cure for this pathology seems to be an elusive goal. Indisputably, the strategy ought to be changed, searching for targets that are generally invariant across the landscape of neoplastic diseases. One such target appears to be the mitochondrial complex II (CII) of the electron transfer chain, a recent focus of research. We document and highlight this particularly intriguing target in this review paper and give examples of drugs that use CII as their molecular target.

     "abstract": "I review here the evidence that complex II of the respiratory chain (RC) constitutes a general sensor for apoptosis induction. This concept emerged from work on neurodegenerative diseases and from recent data on metabolic alterations in cancer cells affecting the RC and in particular on mutations of complex II subunits. It is also supported by experiments with many anticancer compounds that compared the apoptosis sensitivities of complex II-deficient versus WT cells. These results are explained by the mechanistic understanding of how complex II mediates the diverse range of apoptosis signals. This protein aggregate is specifically activated for apoptosis by pH change as a common and early feature of dying cells. This leads to the dissociation of its SDHA and SDHB subunits from the remaining membrane-anchored subunits and the consequent block of it enzymatic SQR activity, while its SDH activity, which is contained in the SDHA/SDHB subcomplex, remains intact. The uncontrolled SDH activity then generates excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species for the demise of the cell. Future studies on these mitochondrial processes will help refine this model, unravel the contribution of mutations in complex II subunits as the cause of degenerative neurological diseases and tumorigenesis, and aid in discovering novel interference options.

Mutations in SDHD and SDHAF2 cause highly penetrant multifocal tumor development after a paternal transmission, whereas maternal transmission rarely, if ever, leads to tumor development. This transmission pattern is consistent with genomic imprinting. Recent molecular evidence supports a model for tissue-specific imprinted regulation of the SDHD gene by a long range epigenetic mechanism. In addition, there is evidence of SDHB mRNA editing in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and long-term balancing selection operating on the SDHA gene. Regulation of SDH subunit expression by diverse epigenetic mechanisms implicates a crucial dosage-dependent role for SDH in oxygen homeostasis.

Depending on the (patho)physiological situation, ROS produced or triggered by complex II can have either beneficial or deleterious effects. This ambivalence can be explained mechanistically by the diverse role of complex II on mitochondrial ROS production: it can be a source as well as a suppressor or enhancer of ROS generation by other respiratory chain complexes. Since complex II directly links the respiratory chain to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the TCA-cycle intermediates \u2013 especially oxaloacetate that acts as a high affinity endogenous inhibitor \u2013 have major impact on complex II-related ROS release.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria play a role of energy production and produce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), especially superoxide anion (O2\u2212) as a byproduct of energy metabolism at the same time. O2\u2212 is converted from oxygen and is overproduced by excessive electron leakage from the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is well known that mitochondrial complexes I and III in the electron transport system are the major endogenous ROS sources. We have previously demonstrated that mutations in complex II can result in excessive ROS (specifically in SDHC: G71E in Caenorhabditis elegans, I71E in Drosophila and V69E in mouse). Moreover, this results in premature death in C. elegans and Drosophila as well as tumorigenesis in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. In humans, it has been reported that mutations in SDHB, SDHC or SDHD, which are the subunits of mitochondrial complex II, often result in inherited head and neck paragangliomas (PGLs). Recently, we established Tet-mev-1 conditional transgenic mice using our uniquely developed Tet-On/Off system, which can induce the mutated SDHC gene to be equally and competitively expressed compared to the endogenous wild-type SDHC gene. These mice experienced mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction that resulted in oxidative stress. The mitochondrial oxidative stress caused excessive apoptosis in several tissues leading to low-birth-weight infants and growth retardation during neonatal developmental phase in Tet-mev-1 mice. Tet-mev-1 mice also displayed precocious age-dependent corneal physiological changes, delayed corneal epithelialization, decreased corneal endothelial cells, thickened Descemet's membrane and thinning of parenchyma with corneal pathological dysfunctions such as keratitis, Fuchs' corneal dystrophy (FCD) and probably keratoconus after the normal development and growth phase. Here, we review the relationships between mitochondrial oxidative stress and phenomena in mev-1 animal models with mitochondrial complex II SDHC mutations.

These complexes are functionally interdependent, as the import of respiratory chain precursor proteins across and into the inner membrane requires the membrane potential. Vice versa the membrane potential is generated by the proton pumping complexes of the respiratory chain. Besides this basic codependency four different systems for protein import, processing and assembly show further connections to the respiratory chain. The mitochondrial intermembrane space import and assembly machinery oxidizes cysteine residues within the imported precursor proteins and is able to donate the liberated electrons to the respiratory chain. The presequence translocase of the inner membrane physically interacts with the respiratory chain. The mitochondrial processing peptidase is homologous to respiratory chain subunits and the carrier translocase of the inner membrane even shares a subunit with the respiratory chain.

The mechanism of FAD insertion and covalent attachment to Sdh1 is unknown. Our working concept of this flavinylation process has relied mostly on foundational works from the 1990s and by applying the principles learned from other enzymes containing a similarly linked FAD. The discovery of the flavinylation factor Sdh5, however, has provided new insight into the possible mechanism associated with Sdh1 flavinylation.

     "abstract": "Complex II (also known as Succinate dehydrogenase or Succinate\u2013ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is an important respiratory enzyme that participates in both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and electron transport chain. Complex II consists of four subunits including a catalytic flavoprotein (SdhA), an iron\u2013sulphur subunit (SdhB) and two hydrophobic membrane anchors (SdhC and SdhD). Complex II also contains a number of redox cofactors including haem, Fe\u2013S clusters and FAD, which mediate electron transfer from succinate oxidation to the reduction of the mobile electron carrier ubiquinone. The flavin cofactor FAD is an important redox cofactor found in many proteins that participate in oxidation/reduction reactions. FAD is predominantly bound non-covalently to flavoproteins, with only a small percentage of flavoproteins, such as complex II, binding FAD covalently. Aside from a few examples, the mechanisms of flavin attachment have been a relatively unexplored area. This review will discuss the FAD cofactor and the mechanisms used by flavoproteins to covalently bind FAD. Particular focus is placed on the attachment of FAD to complex II with an emphasis on SdhE (a DUF339/SDH5 protein previously termed YgfY), the first protein identified as an assembly factor for FAD attachment to flavoproteins in prokaryotes. The molecular details of SdhE-dependent flavinylation of complex II are discussed and comparisons are made to known cofactor chaperones. Furthermore, an evolutionary hypothesis is proposed to explain the distribution of SdhE homologues in bacterial and eukaryotic species. Mechanisms for regulating SdhE function and how this may be linked to complex II function in different bacterial species are also discussed.

     "abstract": "Parasites have developed a variety of physiological functions necessary for completing at least part of their life cycles in the specialized environments of surrounding the parasites in the host. Regarding energy metabolism, which is essential for survival, parasites adapt to the low oxygen environment in mammalian hosts by using metabolic systems that are very different from those of the hosts. In many cases, the parasite employs aerobic metabolism during the free-living stage outside the host but undergoes major changes in developmental control and environmental adaptation to switch to anaerobic energy metabolism. Parasite mitochondria play diverse roles in their energy metabolism, and in recent studies of the parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum, the mitochondrial complex II plays an important role in anaerobic energy metabolism of parasites inhabiting hosts by acting as a quinol-fumarate reductase. In Trypanosomes, parasite complex II has been found to have a novel function and structure. Complex II of Trypanosoma cruzi is an unusual supramolecular complex with a heterodimeric iron\u2013sulfur subunit and seven additional non-catalytic subunits. The enzyme shows reduced binding affinities for both substrates and inhibitors. Interestingly, this structural organization is conserved in all trypanosomatids. Since the properties of complex II differ across a wide range of parasites, this complex is a potential target for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents. In this regard, structural information on the target enzyme is essential for the molecular design of drugs.

     "abstract": "The di-heme family of succinate:quinone oxidoreductases is of particular interest, because its members support electron transfer across the biological membranes in which they are embedded. In the case of the di-heme-containing succinate:menaquinone reductase (SQR) from Gram-positive bacteria and other menaquinone-containing bacteria, this results in an electrogenic reaction. This is physiologically relevant in that it allows the transmembrane electrochemical proton potential \u0394p to drive the endergonic oxidation of succinate by menaquinone. In the case of the reverse reaction, menaquinol oxidation by fumarate, catalysed by the di-heme-containing quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR), evidence has been obtained that this electrogenic electron transfer reaction is compensated by proton transfer via a both novel and essential transmembrane proton transfer pathway (\u201cE-pathway\u201d). Although the reduction of fumarate by menaquinol is exergonic, it is obviously not exergonic enough to support the generation of a \u0394p. This compensatory \u201cE-pathway\u201d appears to be required by all di-heme-containing QFR enzymes and results in the overall reaction being electroneutral. In addition to giving a brief overview of progress in the characterization of other members of this diverse family, this contribution summarizes key evidence and progress in identifying constituents of the \u201cE-pathway\u201d within the framework of the crystal structure of the QFR from the anaerobic epsilon-proteobacterium Wolinella succinogenes at 1.78\u00a0\u00c5 resolution.

Reduction of oxidized Cyt b559 by plastoquinols proceeds biphasically comprising a fast component with a rate constant higher than (10\u00a0s)\u2212\u00a01, named phase I, followed by a slower dark reaction with a rate constant of (2.7\u00a0min)\u2212\u00a01 at pH\u00a06.5, termed phase II. The extents of both components of Cyt b559 reduction increased with increasing concentrations of the quinols, with that, maximally a half of oxidized Cyt b559 can be photoreduced or chemically reduced in phase I at pH\u00a06.5. The photosystem II herbicide dinoseb but not 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) competed with the quinol reductant in phase I. The results reveal that the two components of the Cyt b559 redox reaction reflect two redox equilibria attaining in different time domains. One-electron redox equilibrium between oxidized Cyt b559 and the photosystem II-bound plastoquinol is established in phase I of Cyt b559 reduction. Phase II is attributed to equilibration of Cyt b559 redox forms with the quinone pool.

     "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer is one of the physiological hallmarks of Geobacteraceae. Most of the Geobacter species encode for more than 100 c-type cytochromes which are, in general, poorly conserved between individual species. An exception to this is the PpcA family of periplasmic triheme c-type cytochromes, which are the most abundant proteins in these bacteria. The functional characterization of PpcA showed that it has the necessary properties to couple electron/proton transfer, a fundamental step for ATP synthesis. The detailed thermodynamic characterization of a PpcA mutant, in which the strictly conserved residue phenylalanine 15 was replaced by leucine, showed that the global redox network of cooperativities among heme groups is altered, preventing the mutant from performing a concerted electron/proton transfer. In this work, we determined the solution structure of PpcA F15L mutant in the fully reduced state using NMR spectroscopy by producing 15N-labeled protein. In addition, pH-dependent conformational changes were mapped onto the structure. The mutant structure obtained is well defined, with an average pairwise root-mean-square deviation of 0.36\u00a0\u00c5 for the backbone atoms and 1.14\u00a0\u00c5 for all heavy atoms. Comparison between the mutant and wild-type structures elucidated the contribution of phenylalanine 15 in the modulation of the functional properties of PpcA.",

     "abstract": "Chlorosomes are light-harvesting antenna complexes that occur in green photosynthetic bacteria which have only been shown naturally to contain bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) c, d, or e as the principal light-harvesting pigments. BChl f has long been thought to be an obvious fourth member of the so-called Chlorobium chlorophylls, because it possesses a C-7 formyl group like BChl e and lacks a methyl group at C-20 like BChl d. In organisms that synthesize BChl c or e, the bchU gene product encodes the enzyme that methylates the C-20 position of these molecules. A bchU null mutant of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum limnaeum strain 1677T, which normally synthesizes BChl e, has recently been generated via insertional inactivation, and it produces chlorosomes containing BChl f [Vogl et al., 2012]. In this study, chlorosomes containing BChl f and monomeric BChl f in pyridine were characterized using a variety of spectroscopic techniques, including fluorescence emission and excitation spectroscopy, fluorescence lifetime and quantum yield determinations, and circular dichroism. These spectroscopic measurements, as well as Gaussian simulation of the data, show that chlorosomes containing BChl f are less efficient in energy transfer than those with BChl e. This can primarily be attributed to the decreased spectral overlap between the oligomeric BChl f (energy donor) fluorescence emission and the BChl a (energy acceptor) absorption in the chlorosome baseplate. This study allows us to hypothesize that, if they exist in nature, BChl f-containing organisms most likely live in rare high-light, anoxic conditions devoid of Chl a, d, or BChl e filtering.K.

In D. africanus, it is believed that the electrons are received by another tetrahaem cytochrome c3, denoted type II, which is associated with the membrane complex. Thermodynamic measurements show that the type I cytochrome c3 has the potential to transfer two electrons at a time.

     "abstract": "We performed spectroscopic and functional characterization on cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 with mutations of charged residues of the cytoplasmic side of cytochrome (Cyt) b559 in photosystem II (PSII). All of the mutant cells grew photoautotrophically and assembled stable PSII. However, R7E\u03b1, R17E\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 mutant cells grew significantly slower and were more susceptible to photoinhibition than wild-type cells. The adverse effects of the arginine mutations on the activity and the stability of PSII were in the following order (R17L\u03b2\u00a0>\u00a0R7E\u03b1\u00a0>\u00a0R17E\u03b1 and R17A\u03b1). All these arginine mutants exhibited normal period-four oscillation in oxygen yield. Thermoluminescence characteristics indicated a slight decrease in the stability of the S3QB\u2212/S2QB\u2212 charge pairs in the R7E\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 mutant cells. R7E\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 PSII core complexes contained predominantly the low potential form of Cyt b559. EPR results indicated the displacement of one of the two axial ligands to the heme of Cyt b559 in R7E\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 mutant reaction centers. Our results demonstrate that the electrostatic interactions between these arginine residues and the heme propionates of Cyt b559 are important to the structure and redox properties of Cyt b559. In addition, the blue light-induced nonphotochemical quenching was significantly attenuated and its recovery was accelerated in the R7L\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 mutant cells. Furthermore, ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry results showed that the PQ pool was more reduced in the R7E\u03b1 and R17L\u03b2 mutant cells than wild-type cells in the dark. Our data support a functional role of Cyt b559 in protection of PSII under photoinhibition conditions in vivo.",

The observations were done at 78\u00a0K by setting the sample in a cryostat to avoid any undesired progress of the greening process during the measurements. The lateral and axial spatial resolutions of the system were 0.64\u00a0\u03bcm and 4.4\u00a0\u03bcm, respectively. The study revealed the spatial distributions of protochlorophyllide (PChld) in both the 632-nm-emitting and 655-nm-emitting forms within etiolated Zea mays leaves. The sizes of the fluorescence spots attributed to the former were larger than those of the latter, validating the assignment of the former and latter to the prothylakoid and prolamellar bodies, respectively. In vivo microspectroscopy observations of mature Zea mays leaves confirmed the different photosystem II (PS I)/photosystem I (PS II) ratio between the bundle sheath (BS) and mesophyll (MS) cells, which is specific for C4-plants. The BS cells in Zea mays leaves 1\u00a0h after the initiation of the greening process tended to show fluorescence spectra at shorter wavelength side (at around 679\u00a0nm) than the MS cells (at around 682\u00a0nm). The 679-nm-emitting chlorophyll-a form observed mainly in the BS cells was attributed to putative precursor complexes to PS I. The BS cells under 3-h greening showed higher relative intensities of the PS I fluorescence band at around 735\u00a0nm, suggesting the reduced PS II amount in the BS cells in this greening stage.",

Mechanisms allowing Fe/S centers to be assembled, and inserted into polypeptides have attracted much attention in the last decade, both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Basic principles and recent advances in our understanding of the prokaryotic Fe/S biogenesis ISC and SUF systems are reviewed in the present communication. Most studies covered stem from investigations in Escherichia coli and Azotobacter vinelandii. Remarkable insights were brought about by complementary structural, spectroscopic, biochemical and genetic studies. Highlights of the recent years include scaffold mediated assembly of Fe/S cluster, A-type carriers mediated delivery of clusters and regulatory control of Fe/S homeostasis via a set of interconnected genetic regulatory circuits. Also, the importance of Fe/S biosynthesis systems in mediating soft metal toxicity was documented. A brief account of the Fe/S biosynthesis systems diversity as present in current databases is given here. Moreover, Fe/S biosynthesis factors have themselves been the object of molecular tailoring during evolution and some examples are discussed here. An effort was made to provide, based on the E. coli system, a general classification associating a given domain with a given function such as to help next search and annotation of genomes.

Three types of bacterial NOR are known, namely cNOR, qNOR and qCuNOR, that differ on the physiological electron donor. cNOR has been purified as a two subunit complex, the NorC, anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane, with a low-spin heme c, and the NorB subunit showing high structural homology with the HCuO subunit I, comprising a bis-histidine low-spin heme b and a binuclear iron centre. The binuclear iron centre is the catalytic site and it is formed by a heme b3 coupled to a non-heme iron (FeB) through a \u03bc-oxo bridge. The catalytic mechanism is still under discussion and three hypotheses have been proposed: the trans-mechanism, the cis-FeB and the cis-heme b3 mechanisms. In the present work, the Pseudomonas nautica cNOR electrochemical behaviour was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using a pyrolytic graphite electrode modified with the immobilised protein. The protein redox centres were observed and the formal redox potentials were determined. The binuclear iron centre presents the lowest redox potential value, and discrimination between the heme b3 and FeB redox processes was attained. Also, the number of electrons involved and correspondent surface electronic transfer rate constants were estimated. The pH dependence of the observed redox processes was determined and some new insights on the NOR catalytic mechanism are discussed.",

Although the mitochondrial electron transport chain is an important target of NO, the role of GSNOR in the functionality of plant mitochondria has not been addressed. Here, we measured SNO content and NO emission in Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension cultures of wild-type (WT) and GSNOR overexpressing (GSNOROE) or antisense (GSNORAS) transgenic lines, grown under optimal conditions and under nutritional stress. Respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria and expression of genes encoding for mitochondrial proteins were also analyzed. Under optimal growth conditions, GSNOROE had the lowest SNO and NO levels and GSNORAS the highest, as expected by the GSNO-consuming activity of GSNOR. Under stress, this pattern was reversed. Analysis of oxygen uptake by isolated mitochondria showed that complex I and external NADH dehydrogenase activities were inhibited in GSNOROE cells grown under nutritional stress. Moreover, GSNOROE could not increase alternative oxidase (AOX) activity under nutritional stress. GSNORAS showed constitutively high activity of external NADH dehydrogenase, and maintained the activity of the uncoupling protein (UCP) under stress. The alterations observed in mitochondrial protein activities were not strictly correlated to changes in gene expression, but instead seemed to be related with the SNO/NO content, suggesting a post-transcriptional regulation. Overall, our results highlight the importance of GSNOR in modulating SNO and NO homeostasis as well mitochondrial functionality, both under normal and adverse conditions in A. thaliana cells.",

     "abstract": "The Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is a photoactive water soluble protein that is crucial for photoprotection in cyanobacteria. When activated by blue-green light, it triggers quenching of phycobilisome fluorescence and regulates energy flow from the phycobilisome to the reaction center. The OCP contains a single pigment, the carotenoid 3\u2032-hydroxyechinenone (hECN). Binding to the OCP causes a conformational change in hECN leading to an extension of its effective conjugation length. We have determined the S1 energy of hECN in organic solvent and compared it with the S1 energy of hECN bound to the OCP. In methanol and n-hexane, hECN has an S1 energy of 14,300\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, slightly higher than carotenoids with shorter conjugation lengths such as zeaxanthin or \u03b2-carotene; this is consistent with the proposal that the presence of the conjugated carbonyl group in hECN increases its S1 energy. The S1 energy of hECN in organic solvent is independent of solvent polarity. Upon binding to the OCP, the S1 energy of hECN is further increased to 14,700\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, underscoring the importance of protein binding which twists the conjugated carbonyl group into s-trans conformation and enhances the effect of the carbonyl group. Activated OCP, however, has an S1 energy of 14,000\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, indicating that significant changes in the vicinity of the conjugated carbonyl group occur upon activation.",

     "abstract": "Acaryochloris marina is the only species known to utilize chlorophyll (Chl) d as a principal photopigment. The peak absorption wavelength of Chl d is redshifted \u2248\u00a040\u00a0nm in vivo relative to Chl a, enabling this cyanobacterium to perform oxygenic phototrophy in niche environments enhanced in far-red light. We present measurements of the in vivo energy-storage (E-S) efficiency of photosynthesis in A. marina, obtained using pulsed photoacoustics (PA) over a 90-nm range of excitation wavelengths in the red and far-red. Together with modeling results, these measurements provide the first direct observation of the trap energies of PSI and PSII, and also the photosystem-specific contributions to the total E-S efficiency. We find the maximum observed efficiency in A. marina (40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% at 735\u00a0nm) is higher than in the Chl a cyanobacterium Synechococcus leopoliensis (35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% at 690\u00a0nm). The efficiency at peak absorption wavelength is also higher in A. marina (36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% at 710\u00a0nm vs. 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% at 670\u00a0nm). In both species, the trap efficiencies are \u2248\u00a040% (PSI) and \u2248\u00a030% (PSII). The PSI trap in A. marina is found to lie at 740\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0nm, in agreement with the value inferred from spectroscopic methods. The best fit of the model to the PA data identifies the PSII trap at 723\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0nm, supporting the view that the primary electron-donor is Chl d, probably at the accessory (ChlD1) site. A decrease in efficiency beyond the trap wavelength, consistent with uphill energy transfer, is clearly observed and fit by the model. These results demonstrate that the E-S efficiency in A. marina is not thermodynamically limited, suggesting that oxygenic photosynthesis is viable in even redder light environments.",

     "abstract": "Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductases (SQRs) are ubiquitous enzymes which have multiple roles: sulfide detoxification, energy generation by providing electrons to respiratory or photosynthetic electron transfer chains, and sulfide homeostasis. A recent structure-based classification defines 6 groups of putative SQRs (I\u2013VI), and representatives of all but group III have been confirmed to have sulfide oxidase activity. In the current work, we report the first characterization of a predicted group III SQR from Caldivirga maquilingensis, and confirm that this protein is a sulfide oxidase. The gene encoding the enzyme was cloned, and the protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. The enzyme oxidizes sulfide using decylubiquinone as an electron acceptor, and is inhibited by aurachin C and iodoacetamide. Analysis of the amino acid sequence indicates that the C. maquilingensis SQR has two amphiphilic helices at the C-terminus but lacks any transmembrane helices. This suggests that C. maquilingensis SQR interacts with the membrane surface and that the interactions are mediated by the C-terminal amphiphilic helices. Mutations within the last C-terminal amphiphilic helix resulted in a water-soluble form of the enzyme which, remarkably, retains full SQR activity using decylubiquinone as the electron acceptor. Mutations at one position, L379, also located in the C-terminal amphiphilic helix, inactivated the enzyme by preventing the interaction with decylubiquinone. It is concluded that the C-terminal amphiphilic helix is important for membrane binding and for forming part of the pathway providing access of the quinone substrate to the protein-bound flavin at the enzyme active site.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal oxidase of cellular respiration, reduces molecular oxygen to water. The mechanism of proton pumping as well as the coupling of proton and electron transfer is still not understood in this redox-linked proton pump. Eleven residues at the aqueous-exposed surfaces of CcO from Paracoccus denitrificans have been exchanged to cysteines in a two-subunit base variant to yield single reactive cysteine variants. These variants are designed to provide unique labeling sites for probes to be used in spectroscopic experiments investigating the mechanism of proton pumping in CcO. To this end we have shown that all cysteine variants are enzymatically active. Cysteine positions at the negative (N-) side of the membrane are located close to the entrance of the D- and K-proton transfer pathways that connect the N-side with the catalytic oxygen reduction site. Labeling of the pH-indicator dye fluorescein to these sites allowed us to determine the surface potential at the cytoplasmic CcO surface, which corresponds to a surface charge density of \u2212\u00a00.5 elementary charge/1000\u00a0\u00c52. In addition, acid\u2013base titrations revealed values of CcO buffer capacity. Polarity measurements of the label environment at the N-side provided (i) site-specific values indicative of a hydrophilic and a more hydrophobic environment dependent on the label position, and (ii) information on a global change to a more apolar environment upon reduction of the enzyme. Thus, the redox state of the copper and heme centers inside the hydrophobic interior of CcO affect the properties at the cytoplasmic surface.",

In their natural environment they have to cope with strong fluctuations of the light climate which can be harmful for photosynthesis. In order to prevent the damage of their photosynthetic machinery, diatoms use fast regulatory processes among which the non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence (NPQ) is one of the most important. In a previous work, we highlighted differences in the kinetics and extent of NPQ between diatom species/strains originating from different aquatic habitats. We proposed that the NPQ differences observed between strains/species could potentially participate to their ecophysiological adaptation to the light environment of their respective natural habitat. In order to better understand the molecular bases of such differences, we compared the NPQ features of four strains/species of diatoms known for their NPQ discrepancy. We could identify new spectroscopic fingerprints concomitant to NPQ and the related xanthophyll cycle. These fingerprints helped us propose a molecular explanation for the NPQ differences observed between the diatom species/strains examined.

We have explored the FCP complexes in Phaeodactylum tricornutum under low light (LL) and high light (HL) conditions. Sub-fractionating the pool of major FCPs yielded different populations of trimeric complexes. Only Lhcf and Lhc-like proteins were found in the trimers. Under LL, the first polypeptide fraction contained six different Lhcfs and was mainly composed of Lhcf10. It was characterised by the highest amount of fucoxanthin (Fx). The second was dominated by Lhcf10, Lhcf5 and Lhcf2, and had a lower Fx/Chl c ratio. Little Fx/Chl c also characterised the most abundant FCP complexes, found in fraction 3, composed mainly of Lhcf5. These FCPs bound Fx molecules with the strongest bathochromic shift. The last two fractions contained FCP complexes that were built mainly of Lhcf4, harbouring more Fx molecules that absorbed at shorter wavelengths. Under HL, the same main polypeptides were retrieved in the different fractions and spectroscopic features were almost identical except for a higher diadinoxanthin content. The total amount of Lhcf5 was reduced under HL, whereas the amount of the last two fractions and thereby Lhcf4 was increased. Lhcf11 was identified in different LL fractions, but not detected in any HL fraction, while two new Lhc-like proteins were only found under HL. This is the first report on different trimeric FCP complexes in pennate diatoms, which differ in polypeptide composition and pigmentation, and are differentially expressed by light.",

All five structures are highly similar to other PC and APC structures on the levels of subunits, monomers and trimers. The Synechococcus APC forms a unique loose hexamer that may show the structural requirements for core assembly and rod attachment. While the Synechococcus PC assembles into the canonical hexamer, it does not further assemble into rods. Unlike most PC structures, the Synechocystis PC fails to form hexamers. Addition of low concentrations of urea to T. vulcanus PC inhibits this proteins propensity to form hexamers, resulting in a crystal lattice composed of trimers.

Its binuclear active center, residing in SU I, contains heme a3 and CuB. Apart from its oxygen reductase activity, the protein possesses a peroxidase and a catalase activity. To compare variants and the wild type (WT) protein in a more stringent way, a recombinant (rec.) WT strain was constructed, carrying the gene for SU I on a low copy number plasmid. This rec. WT showed no difference in oxygen reductase activity compared to the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) WT CcO but surprisingly its catalase activity was increased by a factor of 20. The potential over-production of SU I might impair the correct insertion of heme a3 and CuB because of a deficiency in metal inserting chaperones. An altered distance between heme a3 and CuB and variations in protein structure are possible reasons for the observed increased catalase activity. The availability of chaperones was improved by cloning the genes ctaG and surf1c on the same plasmid as the SU I gene. The new rec. WT CcO showed in fact a reduced catalase activity. Using differential scanning calorimetry no significant difference in thermal stability between the ATCC WT CcO and the rec. WT CcO was detected. However, upon aging the thermal stability of the rec.

To clarify the structural basis of the conformational relaxations and the involvement of bound water molecules, we analyzed light-induced P+QA\u2212/PQA difference FTIR spectra of RC films at two hydration levels (relative humidity r\u00a0=\u00a076% and r\u00a0=\u00a011%).

Other features of the FTIR difference spectrum were affected by partial depletion of the hydration shell (r\u00a0=\u00a011%), including contributions from modes of P (9-keto groups), and from NH or OH stretching modes of amino acidic residues, absorbing in the 3550\u20133150\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 range, a region so far not examined in detail for bacterial RCs.

     "abstract": "Nitrogen limitation forces photosynthetic organisms to reallocate available nitrogen to essential functions. At the same time, it increases the probability of photo-damage by limiting the rate of energy-demanding metabolic processes, downstream of the photosynthetic apparatus. Non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria cope with this situation by decreasing the size of their phycobilisome antenna and by modifying their photosynthetic apparatus. These changes can serve two purposes: to provide extra amino-acids and to decrease excitation pressure. We examined the effects of nitrogen limitation on the form and function of the photosynthetic apparatus. Our aim was to study which of the two demands serve as the driving force for the remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus, under different growth conditions. We found that a drastic reduction in light intensity allowed cells to maintain a more functional photosynthetic apparatus: the phycobilisome antenna was bigger, the activity of both photosystems was higher and the levels of photosystem (PS) proteins were higher. Pre-acclimating cells to Mn limitation, under which the activity of both PSI and PSII is diminished, results in a very similar response. The rate of PSII photoinhibition, in nitrogen limited cells, was found to be directly related to the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus. These data indicate that, under our experimental conditions, photo-damage avoidance was the more prominent determinant during the acclimation process. The combinations of limiting factors tested here is by no means artificial. Similar scenarios can take place under environmental conditions and should be taken into account when estimating nutrient limitations in nature.",

     "abstract": "Under high irradiance, most cyanobacteria induce a photoprotective mechanism that decreases the energy arriving at the photosynthetic reaction centers to avoid the formation of dangerous species of oxygen. This mechanism which rapidly increases the heat dissipation of excess energy at the level of the cyanobacterial antenna, the phycobilisomes, is triggered by the photoactivation of the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Under low light conditions, the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) mediates the recovery of the full antenna capacity by accelerating the deactivation of the OCP. Several FRP Synechocystis mutants were constructed and characterized in terms of the OCP-related photoprotective mechanism. Our results demonstrate that Synechocystis FRP starts at Met26 and not at Met1 (according to notation in Cyanobase) as was previously suggested. Moreover, changes in the genomic region upstream the ATG encoding for Met26 influenced the concentration of OCP in cells. A long FRP (beginning at Met1) is synthesized in Synechocystis cells when the frp gene is under the control of the psbA2 promoter but it is less active than the shorter protein. Overexpression of the short frp gene in Synechocystis enabled short FRP isolation from the soluble fraction. However, the high concentration of FRP in this mutant inhibited the induction of the photoprotective mechanism by decreasing the concentration of the activated OCP. Therefore, the amplitude of photoprotection depends on not only OCP concentration but also on that of FRP. The synthesis of FRP and OCP must be strictly regulated to maintain a low FRP to OCP ratio to allow efficient photoprotection.",

Photoprotection realized via the feedback de-excitation in the pigment\u2013protein light-harvesting complex LHCII, embedded in the chloroplast lipid environment, was studied with use of the steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Illumination of LHCII results in the pronounced singlet excitation quenching, demonstrated by decreased quantum yield of the chlorophyll a fluorescence and shortening of the fluorescence lifetimes. Analysis of the 77\u00a0K chlorophyll a fluorescence emission spectra reveals that the light-driven excitation quenching in LHCII is associated with the intensity increase of the spectral band in the region of 700\u00a0nm, relative to the principal band at 680\u00a0nm. The average chlorophyll a fluorescence lifetime at 700\u00a0nm changes drastically upon temperature decrease: from 1.04\u00a0ns at 300\u00a0K to 3.63\u00a0ns at 77\u00a0K. The results of the experiments lead us to conclude that: (i) the 700\u00a0nm band is associated with the inter-trimer interactions which result in the formation of the chlorophyll low-energy states acting as energy traps and non-radiative dissipation centers; (ii) the Arrhenius analysis, supported by the results of the FTIR measurements, suggests that the photo-reaction can be associated with breaking of hydrogen bonds.

Occupancy of the Qo-site by semiquinone (SQ) was similar in the wildtype and the Glu\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Trp mutant. Since heme bL is initially oxidized in the latter, the bifurcated reaction can still occur, allowing estimation of an empirical rate constant <\u00a0103\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 for reduction of heme bL by SQ from the domain distal from heme bL, a value 1000-fold smaller than that expected from distance. If the pK ~\u00a08.5 in mutant strains is due to deprotonation of the neutral semiquinone, with Q\u2022\u2212 as electron donor to heme bL, then in wildtype this low value would preclude mechanisms for normal flux in which semiquinone is constrained to this domain. A kinetic model in which Glu-295 catalyzes H+ transfer from QH\u2022, and delivery of the H+ to exit channel(s) by rotational displacement, and facilitates rapid electron transfer from SQ to heme bL by allowing Q\u2022\u2212 to move closer to the heme, accounts well for the observations.",

     "abstract": "The photoactive chromophore of photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is p-coumaric acid (pCA). In the ground state, the pCA chromophore exists as a phenolate anion, which is H-bonded by protonated Glu46 (OGlu46\u2013OpCA\u00a0=\u00a0~\u00a02.6\u00a0\u00c5) and protonated Tyr42. On the other hand, the OGlu46\u2013OpCA H-bond was unusually short (OGlu46\u2013OpCA\u00a0=\u00a02.47\u00a0\u00c5) in the intermediate pRCW state observed in time-resolved Laue diffraction studies. To understand how the existence of the unusually short H-bond is energetically possible, we analyzed the H-bond energetics adopting a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach based on the atomic coordinates of the PYP crystal structures. In QM/MM calculations, the OGlu46\u2013OpCA bond is 2.60\u00a0\u00c5 in the ground state, where Tyr42 donates an H-bond to pCA. In contrast, when the hydroxyl group of Tyr42 is flipped away from pCA, the H-bond was significantly shortened to 2.49\u00a0\u00c5 in the ground state. The same H-bond pattern reproduced the unusually short H-bond in the pRCW structure (OGlu46\u2013OpCA\u00a0=\u00a02.49\u00a0\u00c5). Intriguingly, the potential-energy profile resembles that of a single-well H-bond, suggesting that the pKa values of the donor (Glu46) and acceptor (pCA) moieties are nearly equal. The present results indicate that the \u201cequal pKa\u201d requirement for formation of single-well or low-barrier H-bond (LBHB) is satisfied only when Tyr42 does not donate an H-bond to pCA, and argue against the possibility that the OGlu46\u2013OpCA bond is an LBHB in the ground state, where Tyr42 donates an H-bond to pCA.",

     "abstract": "Acetogenesis is one of the oldest metabolic processes on Earth, and still has a major global significance. In this process, acetate is produced via the reduction and condensation of two carbon dioxide molecules. It has long been assumed that acetogenesis requires ferredoxin with an exceptionally low reduction potential of \u2248\u00a0\u2212\u00a0500\u00a0mV in order to drive CO2 reduction to CO and the reductive carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to pyruvate. However, no other metabolic pathway requires electron donors with such low reduction potential. Is acetogenesis a special case, necessitating unique cellular conditions? In this paper, I suggest that it is not. Rather, by keeping CO as a bound metabolite, the CO-dehydrogenase-acetyl-CoA-synthase complex can couple the unfavorable CO2 reduction to CO with the favorable acetyl-CoA synthesis, thus enabling the former process to proceed using ferredoxin of moderate reduction potential of \u2212\u00a0400\u00a0mV. I further show that pyruvate synthesis can also take place using the same ferredoxins. In fact, the synthesis of pyruvate from CO2, methylated-protein-carrier and \u2212\u00a0400\u00a0mV ferredoxins is an energy-neutral process. These findings suggest that acetogenesis can take place at normal cellular redox state. Mechanistic coupling of reactions as suggested here can flatten energetic landscapes and diminish thermodynamic barriers and can be another role for enzymatic complexes common in nature and a useful tool for metabolic engineering.",

Biochemical and structural analysis of isolated thylakoid membranes by electron microscopy indicates a distinctly different response at the level of PSII and LHCII upon plant acclimation. In high light acclimated plants, the C2S2M2 supercomplex, which is the dominating form of PSII in Arabidopsis, is a major target of structural re-arrangement due to the down-regulation of Lhcb3 and Lhcb6 antenna proteins. The PSII ability to form semi-crystalline arrays in the grana membrane is strongly reduced compared to plants grown under optimal light conditions. This is due to the structural heterogeneity of PSII supercomplexes rather than to the action of PsbS protein as its level was unexpectedly reduced in high light acclimated plants. In low light acclimated plants, the architecture of the C2S2M2 supercomplex and its ability to form semi-crystalline arrays remained unaffected but the density of PSII in grana membranes is reduced due to the synthesis of additional LHCII proteins. However, the C2S2M2 supercomplexes in semi-crystalline arrays are more densely packed, which can be important for efficient energy transfer between PSII under light limiting conditions.",

It is generally accepted that LHCII is associated with Photosystem II and only as a short-term response to overexcitation of PSII a subset moves to Photosystem I, triggered by its phosphorylation (state1 to state2 transition). However, here we show that in most natural light conditions LHCII serves as an antenna of both Photosystem I and Photosystem II and it is quantitatively demonstrated that this is required to achieve excitation balance between the two photosystems. This allows for acclimation to different light intensities simply by regulating the expression of LHCII genes only. It is demonstrated that indeed the amount of LHCII that is bound to both photosystems decreases when growth light intensity increases and vice versa. Finally, time-resolved fluorescence measurements on the photosynthetic thylakoid membranes show that LHCII is even a more efficient light harvester when associated with Photosystem I than with Photosystem II.",

     "abstract": "Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of Photosystem II fluorescence is one of the most important photoprotection responses of phototropic organisms. NPQ in Macrocystis pyrifera is unique since the fast induction of this response, the energy dependent quenching (qE), is not present in this alga. In contrast to higher plants, NPQ in this organism is much more strongly related to xanthophyll cycle (XC) pigment interconversion. Characterization of how NPQ is controlled when qE is not present is important as this might represent an ancient response to light stress. Here, we describe the influence of the XC pigment pool (\u03a3XC) size on NPQ induction in M. pyrifera. The sum of violaxanthin (Vx) plus antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin (Zx) represents the \u03a3XC. This pool was three-fold larger in blades collected at the surface of the water column (19\u00a0mol\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01 Chl a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100) than in blades collected at 6\u00a0m depth. Maximum NPQ was not different in samples with a \u03a3XC higher than 12\u00a0mol\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01 Chl a\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100; however, NPQ induction was faster in blades with a large \u03a3XC. The increase in the NPQ induction rate was associated with a faster Vx to Zx conversion. Further, we found that NPQ depends on the de-epoxidation state of the \u03a3XC, not on the absolute concentration of Zx and antheraxanthin. Thus, there was an antagonist effect between Vx and de-epoxidated xanthophylls for NPQ. These results indicate that in the absence of qE, a large \u03a3XC is needed in M. pyrifera to respond faster to light stress conditions.",

     "abstract": "Membrane-bound respiratory complex I in inside-out submitochondrial particles (SMP) catalyzes both superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation in NADH- and/or succinate-supported reactions. At optimal NADH concentration (50\u00a0\u03bcM), the complex I-mediated process results in a formation of two superoxide anions and H2O2 as the reaction products in approximately 0.7 ratio. Almost the same ratio is found for purified complex I (0.6) and for the aerobic succinate-supported reverse electron transfer reaction. Superoxide production is depressed at high, more physiologically relevant NADH concentrations, whereas hydrogen peroxide formation is insensitive to the elevated level of NADH. The rates of H2O2 formation at variable NAD+/NADH ratios satisfactorily fit the Nernst equation for a single reactive two-electron donor component equilibrated with ambient midpoint redox potential of \u2212\u00a0347\u00a0mV (0.13 NAD+/NADH ratio, pH 8.0). Half-maximal superoxide production rate proceeds at significantly higher NAD+/NADH ratio (0.33). Guanidine strongly stimulates NADH-supported hydrogen peroxide and superoxide production at any NADH concentration and activates NADH:ferricyanide and inhibits NADH:hexaammineruthenium (III) reductase activities while showing no effects on NADH oxidase of SMP. In the low range of NADH concentration, superoxide production rate shows a simple hyperbolic dependence on NADH with apparent KmNADH of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas sigmoidal dependence of hydrogen peroxide production is seen with half-maximal rate at 25\u00a0\u03bcM NADH.

That such interactions between hydrothermal fuels and potential oxidants have so far not been accomplished in the lab is because some steps along the necessary metabolic pathways are endergonic and must therefore be driven by being coupled to thermodynamically larger exergonic processes. But coupling of this kind is far from automatic and it is not enough to merely sum the \u0394Gs of two supposedly coupled reactions and show their combined thermodynamic viability.

     "abstract": "The review describes four flavin-containing cytoplasmatic multienzyme complexes from anaerobic bacteria and archaea that catalyze the reduction of the low potential ferredoxin by electron donors with higher potentials, such as NAD(P)H or H2 at \u2264\u00a0100\u00a0kPa. These endergonic reactions are driven by concomitant oxidation of the same donor with higher potential acceptors such as crotonyl-CoA, NAD+ or heterodisulfide (CoM-S-S-CoB). The process called flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) can be regarded as a third mode of energy conservation in addition to substrate level phosphorylation (SLP) and electron transport phosphorylation (ETP). FBEB has been detected in the clostridial butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase/electron transferring flavoprotein complex (BcdA-EtfBC), the multisubunit [FeFe]hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima (HydABC) and from acetogenic bacteria, the [NiFe]hydrogenase/heterodisulfide reductase (MvhADG\u2013HdrABC) from methanogenic archaea, and the transhydrogenase (NfnAB) from many Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and from anaerobic archaea.The Bcd/EtfBC complex that catalyzes electron bifurcation from NADH to the low potential ferredoxin and to the high potential crotonyl-CoA has already been studied in some detail. The bifurcating protein most likely is EtfBC, which in each subunit (\u03b2\u03b3) contains one FAD. In analogy to the bifurcating complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and with the help of the structure of the human ETF, we propose a conformational change by which \u03b3-FADH\u2212 in EtfBC approaches \u03b2-FAD to enable the bifurcating one-electron transfer. The ferredoxin reduced in one of the four electron bifurcating reactions can regenerate H2 or NADPH, reduce CO2 in acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaea, or is converted to \u0394\u03bcH+/Na+ by the membrane-associated enzyme complexes Rnf and Ech, whereby NADH and H2 are recycled, respectively. The mainly bacterial Rnf complexes couple ferredoxin oxidation by NAD+ with proton/sodium ion translocation and the more diverse energy converting [NiFe]hydrogenases (Ech) do the same, whereby NAD+ is replaced by H+. Many organisms also use Rnf and Ech in the reverse direction to reduce ferredoxin driven by \u0394\u03bcH+/Na+. Finally examples are shown, in which the four bifurcating multienzyme complexes alone or together with Rnf and Ech are integrated into energy metabolisms of nine anaerobes.

     "abstract": "Nitrogen is an essential element of life that needs to be assimilated in its most reduced form, ammonium. On the other hand, nitrogen exists in a multitude of oxidation states and, consequently, nitrogen compounds (NCs) serve as electron donor and/or acceptors in many catabolic pathways including various forms of microbial respiration that contribute to the global biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. Some of these NCs are also known as reactive nitrogen species able to cause nitrosative stress because of their high redox reactivity. The best understood processes of the nitrogen cycle are denitrification and ammonification (both beginning with nitrate reduction to nitrite), nitrification (aerobic oxidation of ammonium and nitrite) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). This review presents examples of the diverse architecture, either elucidated or anticipated, and the high degree of modularity of the corresponding respiratory electron transport processes found in Bacteria and Archaea, and relates these to their respective bioenergetic mechanisms of proton motive force generation. In contrast to the multiplicity of enzymes that catalyze NC transformations, the number of proteins or protein modules involved in connecting electron transport to and from these enzymes with the quinone/quinol pool is comparatively small. These quinone/quinol-reactive protein modules consist of cytochromes b and c and iron-sulfur proteins.

     "abstract": "Behind the versatile nature of prokaryotic energy metabolism is a set of redox proteins having a highly modular character. It has become increasingly recognized that a limited number of redox modules or building blocks appear grouped in different arrangements, giving rise to different proteins and functionalities. This modularity most likely reveals a common and ancient origin for these redox modules, and is obviously reflected in similar energy conservation mechanisms. The dissimilation of sulfur compounds was probably one of the earliest biological strategies used by primitive organisms to obtain energy. Here, we review some of the redox proteins involved in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism, focusing on sulfate reducing organisms, and highlight links between these proteins and others involved in different processes of anaerobic respiration. Noteworthy are links to the complex iron\u2013sulfur molybdoenzyme family, and heterodisulfide reductases of methanogenic archaea. We discuss how chemiosmotic and electron bifurcation/confurcation may be involved in energy conservation during sulfate reduction, and how introduction of an additional module, multiheme cytochromes c, opens an alternative bioenergetic strategy that seems to increase metabolic versatility. Finally, we highlight new families of heterodisulfide reductase-related proteins from non-methanogenic organisms, which indicate a widespread distribution for these protein modules and may indicate a more general involvement of thiol/disulfide conversions in energy metabolism.

     "abstract": "Iron is a ubiquitous element in the universe. Ferrous iron (Fe(II)) was abundant in the primordial ocean until the oxygenation of the Earth's atmosphere led to its widespread oxidation and precipitation. This change of iron bioavailability likely put selective pressure on the evolution of life. This element is essential to most extant life forms and is an important cofactor in many redox-active proteins involved in a number of vital pathways. In addition, iron plays a central role in many environments as an energy source for some microorganisms. This review is focused on Fe(II) oxidation. The fact that the ability to oxidize Fe(II) is widely distributed in Bacteria and Archaea and in a number of quite different biotopes suggests that the dissimilatory Fe(II) oxidation is an ancient energy metabolism. Based on what is known today about Fe(II) oxidation pathways, we propose that they arose independently more than once in evolution and evolved convergently. The iron paleochemistry, the phylogeny, the physiology of the iron oxidizers, and the nature of the cofactors of the redox proteins involved in these pathways suggest a possible scenario for the timescale in which each type of Fe(II) oxidation pathways evolved. The nitrate dependent anoxic iron oxidizers are likely the most ancient iron oxidizers. We suggest that the phototrophic anoxic iron oxidizers arose in surface waters after the Archaea/Bacteria-split but before the Great Oxidation Event. The neutrophilic oxic iron oxidizers possibly appeared in microaerobic marine environments prior to the Great Oxidation Event while the acidophilic ones emerged likely after the advent of atmospheric O2.

     "abstract": "Although at low concentrations, arsenic commonly occurs naturally as a local geological constituent. Whereas both arsenate and arsenite are strongly toxic to life, a number of prokaryotes use these compounds as electron acceptors or donors, respectively, for bioenergetic purposes via respiratory arsenate reductase, arsenite oxidase and alternative arsenite oxidase. The recent burst in discovered arsenite oxidizing and arsenate respiring microbes suggests the arsenic bioenergetic metabolisms to be anything but exotic. The first goal of the present review is to bring to light the widespread distribution and diversity of these metabolizing pathways. The second goal is to present an evolutionary analysis of these diverse energetic pathways. Taking into account not only the available data on the arsenic metabolizing enzymes and their phylogenetical relatives but also the palaeogeochemical records, we propose a crucial role of arsenite oxidation via arsenite oxidase in primordial life.

In this review, we discuss the reactions of oxochlorate respiration, the corresponding enzymes, and the relation to respiratory electron transport that can contribute to a proton gradient across the cell membrane. Enzymes specific for oxochlorate respiration are oxochlorate reductases and chlorite dismutase. The former belong to DMSO reductase family of molybdenum-containing enzymes. The heme protein chlorite dismutase, which decomposes chlorite into chloride and molecular oxygen, is only distantly related to other proteins with known functions. Pathways for electron transport may be different in perchlorate and chlorate reducers, but appear in both cases to be similar to pathways found in other respiratory systems.

It catalyzes the oxidation of NADH and the reduction of quinones, coupled to cation translocation across the membrane. The complex has a modular structure composed of several proteins most of which are identified in other complexes. Close relations between complex I and group 4 membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases and some subunits of multiple resistance to pH (Mrp) Na+/H+ antiporters have been observed before and the suggestion that complex I arose from the association of a soluble nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) reducing hydrogenase with a Mrp-like antiporter has been put forward. In this article we performed a thorough taxonomic profile of prokaryotic group 4 membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases, complexes I and complex I-like enzymes. In addition we have investigated the different gene clustering organizations of such complexes. Our data show the presence of complexes related to hydrogenases but which do not contain the binding site of the catalytic centre. These complexes, named before as Ehr ( e nergy-converting h ydrogenases r elated complexes) are a missing link between complex I and group 4 membrane-bound [NiFe] hydrogenases. Based on our observations we put forward a different perspective for the relation between complex I and related complexes.

     "abstract": "Anaerobic metabolic pathways allow unicellular organisms to tolerate or colonize anoxic environments. Over the past ten years, genome sequencing projects have brought a new light on the extent of anaerobic metabolism in eukaryotes. A surprising development has been that free-living unicellular algae capable of photoautotrophic lifestyle are, in terms of their enzymatic repertoire, among the best equipped eukaryotes known when it comes to anaerobic energy metabolism. Some of these algae are marine organisms, common in the oceans, others are more typically soil inhabitants. All these species are important from the ecological (O2/CO2 budget), biotechnological, and evolutionary perspectives. In the unicellular algae surveyed here, mixed-acid type fermentations are widespread while anaerobic respiration, which is more typical of eukaryotic heterotrophs, appears to be rare. The presence of a core anaerobic metabolism among the algae provides insights into its evolutionary origin, which traces to the eukaryote common ancestor. The predicted fermentative enzymes often exhibit an amino acid extension at the N-terminus, suggesting that these proteins might be compartmentalized in the cell, likely in the chloroplast or the mitochondrion. The green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Chlorella NC64 have the most extended set of fermentative enzymes reported so far. Among the eukaryotes with secondary plastids, the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana has the most pronounced anaerobic capabilities as yet. From the standpoints of genomic, transcriptomic, and biochemical studies, anaerobic energy metabolism in C. reinhardtii remains the best characterized among photosynthetic protists.

     "abstract": "We review what has been inferred about the changes at the level of the proteome that accompanied the evolution of the mitochondrion from an alphaproteobacterium. We regard these changes from an alphaproteobacterial perspective: which proteins were lost during mitochondrial evolution? And, of the proteins that were lost, which ones have been replaced by other, non-orthologous proteins with a similar function? Combining literature-supported replacements with quantitative analyses of mitochondrial proteomics data we infer that most of the loss and replacements that separate current day mitochondria in mammals from alphaproteobacteria took place before the radiation of the eukaryotes. Recent analyses show that also the acquisition of new proteins to the large protein complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation and the mitochondrial ribosome occurred mainly before the divergence of the eukaryotes. These results indicate a significant number of pivotal evolutionary events between the acquisition of the endosymbiont and the radiation of the eukaryotes and therewith support an early acquisition of mitochondria in eukaryotic evolution. Technically, advancements in the reconstruction of the evolutionary trajectories of loss, replacement and gain of mitochondrial proteins depend on using profile-based homology detection methods for sequence analysis. We highlight the mitochondrial Holliday junction resolvase endonuclease, for which such methods have detected new \"family members\" and in which function differentiation is accompanied by the loss of catalytic residues for the original enzymatic function and the gain of a protein domain for the new function.

     "abstract": "The time-resolved kinetics of membrane potential generation coupled to oxidation of the fully reduced (five-electron) caa3 cytochrome oxidase from Thermus thermophilus by oxygen was studied in a single-turnover regime. In order to calibrate the number of charges that move across the vesicle membrane in the different reaction steps, the reverse electron transfer from heme a3 to heme a and further to the cytochrome c/CuA has been resolved upon photodissociation of CO from the mixed valence enzyme in the absence of oxygen. The reverse electron transfer from heme a3 to heme a and further to the cytochrome c/CuA pair is resolved as a single transition with \u03c4\u00a0~\u00a040\u00a0\u03bcs. In the reaction of the fully reduced cytochrome caa3 with oxygen, the first electrogenic phase (\u03c4\u00a0~\u00a030\u00a0\u03bcs) is linked to OO bond cleavage and generation of the PR state. The next electrogenic component (\u03c4\u00a0~\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcs) is associated with the PR\u00a0\u2192\u00a0F transition and together with the previous reaction step it is coupled to translocation of about two charges across the membrane. The three subsequent electrogenic phases, with time constants of ~\u00a00.25\u00a0ms, ~\u00a01.4\u00a0ms and ~\u00a04\u00a0ms, are linked to the conversion of the binuclear center through the F\u00a0\u2192\u00a0OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0EH transitions, and result in additional transfer of four charges through the membrane dielectric. This indicates that the delivery of the fifth electron from heme c to the binuclear center is coupled to pumping of an additional proton across the membrane.",

     "abstract": "In this work we have applied picosecond and steady-state fluorescence measurements to study excitation energy transfer and trapping in intact Cyclotella meneghiniana diatom cells grown at different light intensities. Different excitation and detection wavelengths were used to discriminate between Photosystem I and II (PSI and PSII) kinetics and to study excitation energy transfer from the outer antenna to the core of PSI and PSII. It is found that the light-harvesting fucoxanthin chlorophyll proteins (FCPs) transfer their excitation energy predominantly to PSII. It is also observed that the PSII antenna is slightly richer in red-absorbing fucoxanthin than the FCPs associated with PSI. The average excitation trapping time in PSI is around 75\u00a0ps whereas this time is around 450\u00a0ps for PSII in cells grown in 20\u00a0\u03bcmol of photons per m2 per s. The latter time decreases to 425\u00a0ps for 50\u00a0\u03bcmol of photons and 360\u00a0ps for 140\u00a0\u03bcmol of photons. It is concluded that cells grown under higher photon flux densities have a smaller antenna size than the ones grown in low light. At the same time, the increase of growth light intensity leads to a decrease of the relative amount of PSI. This effect is accompanied by a substantial increase in the amount of chlorophyll a that is not active in excitation energy transfer and most probably attached to inactivated/disassembled PSII units.",

     "abstract": "In the Ni-substituted chlorophylls, an ultrafast (<\u00a060\u00a0fs) deactivation channel is created, which is not present in Ni-porphyrins. This observation prompted us to investigate in detail the mechanism of excitation-to-heat conversion in Ni-substituted chlorophylls, experimentally, using time-resolved laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy, and theoretically, using group theory approach. The Ni-substituted chlorophylls show exceptional photostability and the optoacoustic measurements confirm the prompt and very efficient (100%) excitation-into-heat conversion in these complexes. Considering their excellent spectral properties and the loss-free excitation-into-heat conversion they are likely to become a new class of versatile photocalorimetric references. The curious features of the Ni-substituted chlorophylls originate from the symmetry of a ligand field created in the central cavity. The central NNi2\u00a0+ bonds, formed via the donation of two electrons from each of the sp2 orbitals of two central nitrogens to an empty s \u2212 d x 2 \u2212 y 2 hybrid centered on Ni2\u00a0+, have a considerable covalent character. The extreme rate of excited state relaxation is then not due to a ladder of the metal centered d-states, often invoked in metalloporphyrins, but seems to result from a peculiar topology of the potential energy surface (a saddle-shaped crossing) due to the covalent character of the NNi2\u00a0+ bonds. This is confirmed by a strong 0\u00a0\u2192\u00a00 character of electronic transitions in these complexes indicating a similarity of their equilibrium geometries in the ground (S0) and the excited states (both QX and QY). The excitation energy is very efficiently converted into molecular vibrations and dissipated as heat, involving the central Ni2\u00a0+. These Ni-substituted pigments pose a fine exemplification of symmetry control over properties of excited states of transition metal complexes.",

A unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, has two homologs of Psb28, Psb28-1 and Psb28-2. However, the role of these proteins remains poorly understood. In this study, we disrupted the psb28-1 (sll1398) and psb28-2 (slr1739) genes in wild-type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and examined their photosynthetic properties to elucidate the physiological role of Psb28 in photosynthesis. We also disrupted the psb28-1 gene in a dgdA mutant defective in the biosynthesis of digalactosyldiacylglycerol, in which Psb28-1 significantly accumulates in PSII. The disruption of the psb28-1 gene in the wild-type resulted in growth retardation under high-light conditions at high temperatures with a low rate of restoration of photodamaged photosynthetic machinery. Similar phenomena were observed at normal growth temperatures in the psb28-1/dgdA double mutant. In contrast, disruption of psb28-2 in the wild-type and dgdA mutant did not affect host strain phenotype, suggesting that Psb28-2 does not contribute to the recovery of PSII. In addition, protein analysis using strains expressing His-tagged Psb28-1 revealed that Psb28-1 is mainly associated with the CP43-less PSII monomer. In the dgdA mutant, the CP43-less PSII monomer accumulated to a greater extent than in the wild-type, and its accumulation caused greater accumulation of Psb28-1 in PSII. These results demonstrate that Psb28-1 plays an important role in PSII repair through association with the CP43-less monomer, particularly at high temperatures.",

M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy and nuclear inelastic scattering of synchrotron radiation (NIS) were applied to monitor the arrangement and flexibility of the NHFe binding site. In His-tagged RCs, NHFe was stabilized only in a high spin ferrous state. Its hyperfine parameters (IS\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mm/s and QS\u00a0=\u00a02.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mm/s), and Debye temperature (\u03b8D0\u00a0~\u00a0167\u00a0K) are comparable to those detected for the high spin state of NHFe in non-His-tagged RCs. For the first time, pure vibrational modes characteristic of NHFe in a high spin ferrous state are revealed. The vibrational density of states (DOS) shows some maxima between 22 and 33\u00a0meV, 33 and 42\u00a0meV, and 53 and 60\u00a0meV and a very sharp one at 44.5\u00a0meV. In addition, we observe a large contribution of vibrational modes at low energies. This iron atom is directly connected to the protein matrix via all its ligands, and it is therefore extremely sensitive to the collective motions of the RC protein core. A comparison of the DOS spectra of His-tagged and non-His-tagged RCs from Rb. sphaeroides shows that in the latter case the spectrum was overlapped by the vibrations of the heme iron of residual cytochrome c2, and a low spin state of NHFe in addition to its high spin one. This enabled us to pin-point vibrations characteristic for the low spin state of NHFe.",

Here, we focused on identifying the proteases that cleave PSII subunits in thylakoid membranes. Major PSII subunits and fucoxanthin chlorophyll (Chl) a/c\u2010binding proteins (FCPs) were specifically degraded in thylakoid membranes. The PSI subunits, PsaA and PsaB, were slowly degraded, and cytochrome f was barely degraded. Using zymography, proteolytic activities for three metalloproteases (116, 83, and 75\u00a0kDa) and one serine protease (156\u00a0kDa) were detected in thylakoid membranes. Two FCP fractions (FCP-A and FCP-B/C) and a photosystem fraction were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation using dodecyl maltoside\u2010solubilized thylakoids. The FCP-A fraction featured enriched Chl c compared with the bulk of FCP-B/C. Zymography revealed that 116, 83, and 94\u00a0kDa metalloproteases were mostly in the FCP-A fraction along with the 156\u00a0kDa serine protease. When solubilized thylakoids were separated with clear-native PAGE, zymography detected only the 83\u00a0kDa metalloprotease in the FCP-A band. Because FCP-A is selectively associated with PSII, these FCP-A-associated metalloproteases and serine protease may be responsible for the proteolytic degradation of FCPs and PSII in thylakoid membranes.",

     "abstract": "The chemical versatility of flavin cofactors within the flavoprotein environment allows them to play main roles in the bioenergetics of all type of organisms, particularly in energy transformation processes such as photosynthesis or oxidative phosphorylation. Despite the large diversity of properties shown by flavoproteins and of the biological processes in which they are involved, only two flavin cofactors, FMN and FAD (both derived from the 7,8-dimethyl-10-(1\u2032-D-ribityl)-isoalloxazine), are usually found in these proteins. Using theoretical and experimental approaches we have carried out an evaluation of the effects introduced upon substituting the 7- and/or 8-methyls of the isoalloxazine ring in the chemical and oxido-reduction properties of the different atoms of the ring on free flavins and on the photosynthetic Anabaena Flavodoxin (a flavoprotein that replaces Ferredoxin as electron carrier from Photosystem I to Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase). In Anabaena Flavodoxin both the protein environment and the redox state contribute to modulate the chemical reactivity of the isoalloxazine ring. Anabaena apoflavodoxin is shown to be designed to stabilise/destabilise each one of the FMN redox states (but not of the analogues produced upon substitution of the 7- and/or 8-methyls groups) in the adequate proportions to provide Flavodoxin with the particular properties required for the functions in which it is involved in vivo. The 7- and/or 8-methyl groups of the ixoalloxazine can be discarded as the gate for electrons exchange in Anabaena Fld, but a key role in this process is envisaged for the C6 atom of the flavin and the backbone atoms of Asn58.",

     "abstract": "Deletion of the yeast mitochondrial gene COX2 encoding subunit 2 (Cox2) of cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) results in loss of respiration (\u0394cox2 strain). Supekova et al. (2010) [1] transformed a \u0394cox2 strain with a vector expressing Cox2 with a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and the point mutation W56R (Cox2W56R), restoring respiratory growth. Here, the CcO carrying the allotopically-expressed Cox2W56R was characterized. Yeast mitochondria from the wild-type (WT) and the \u0394cox2\u00a0+\u00a0Cox2W56R strains were subjected to Blue Native electrophoresis. In-gel activity of CcO and spectroscopic quantitation of cytochromes revealed that only 60% of CcO is present in the complemented strain, and that less CcO is found associated in supercomplexes as compared to WT. CcOs from the WT and the mutant exhibited similar subunit composition, although activity was 20\u201325% lower in the enzyme containing Cox2W56R than in the one with Cox2WT. Tandem mass spectrometry confirmed that W56 was substituted by R56 in Cox2W56R. In addition, Cox2W56R exhibited the same N-terminus than Cox2WT, indicating that the MTS of Oxa1 and the leader sequence of 15 residues were removed from Cox2W56R during maturation. Thus, Cox2W56R is identical to Cox2WT except for the point mutation W56R. Mitochondrial Cox1 synthesis is strongly reduced in \u0394cox2 mutants, but the Cox2W56R complemented strain led to full restoration of Cox1 synthesis. We conclude that the cytosol-synthesized Cox2W56R follows a rate-limiting process of import, maturation or assembly that yields lower steady-state levels of CcO. Still, the allotopically-expressed Cox2W56R restores CcO activity and allows mitochondrial Cox1 synthesis to advance at WT levels.",

     "abstract": "The physiological role of the plastid terminal oxidase (PTOX) involved in plastoquinol oxidation in chloroplasts has been investigated in vivo in tomato leaves. Enzyme activity was assessed by non-invasive methods based on the analysis of the kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence changes. In the dark, the maximum PTOX rate was smaller than 1 electron per second per PSII. This value was further decreased upon light acclimation, and became almost negligible upon inhibition of the photosynthetic performances by reducing the CO2 availability. In contrast, prolonged exposure to high light resulted in an increase of the overall PTOX activity, which was paralleled by an increased protein accumulation. Under all the conditions tested the enzyme activity always remained about two orders of magnitude lower than that of electron flux through the linear photosynthetic electron pathway. Therefore, PTOX cannot have a role of a safety valve for photogenerated electrons, while it could be involved in acclimation to high light. Moreover, by playing a major role in the control of the stromal redox poise, PTOX is also capable of modulating the balance between linear and cyclic electron flow around PSI during the deactivation phase of carbon assimilation that follows a light to dark transition.",

     "abstract": "[FeFe] hydrogenases are key enzymes for bio(photo)production of molecular hydrogen, and several efforts are underway to understand how their complex active site is assembled. This site contains a [4Fe\u20134S]-2Fe cluster and three conserved maturation proteins are required for its biosynthesis. Among them, HydF has a double task of scaffold, in which the dinuclear iron precursor is chemically modified by the two other maturases, and carrier to transfer this unit to a hydrogenase containing a preformed [4Fe\u20134S]-cluster. This dual role is associated with the capability of HydF to bind and dissociate an iron\u2013sulfur center, due to the presence of the conserved FeS-cluster binding sequence CxHx46\u201353HCxxC. The recently solved three-dimensional structure of HydF from Thermotoga neapolitana described the domain containing the three cysteines which are supposed to bind the FeS cluster, and identified the position of two conserved histidines which could provide the fourth iron ligand. The functional role of two of these cysteines in the activation of [FeFe]-hydrogenases has been confirmed by site-specific mutagenesis. On the other hand, the contribution of the three cysteines to the FeS cluster coordination sphere is still to be demonstrated. Furthermore, the potential role of the two histidines in [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation has never been addressed, and their involvement as fourth ligand for the cluster coordination is controversial. In this work we combined site-specific mutagenesis with EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) and HYSCORE (hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy) to assign a role to these conserved residues, in both cluster coordination and hydrogenase maturation/activation, in HydF proteins from different microorganisms.",

     "abstract": "The PsbS protein is recognised in higher plants as an important component in dissipating excess light energy via its regulation of non-photochemical quenching. We investigated photosynthetic responses in the arabidopsis npq4 mutant, which lacks PsbS, and in a mutant over-expressing PsbS (oePsbS). Growth under low light led to npq4 and wild-type plants being visibly indistinguishable, but induced a phenotype in oePsbS plants, which were smaller and had shorter flowering spikes. Here we report that chloroplasts from npq4 generated more singlet oxygen (1O2) than those from oePsbS. This accompanied a higher extent of photosystem II photoinhibition of leaves from npq4 plants. In contrast, oePsbS was more damaged by high light than npq4 and the wild-type at the level of photosystem I. The plastoquinone pool, as measured by thermoluminescence, was more oxidised in the oePsbS than in npq4, whilst the amount of photo-oxidisable P700, as probed with actinic light or saturating flashes, was higher in oePsbS compared to wild-type and npq4. Taken together, this indicates that the level of PsbS has a regulatory role in cyclic electron flow. Overall, we show that under high light oePsbS plants were more protected from 1O2 at the level of photosystem II, whereas lack of cyclic electron flow rendered them susceptible to damage at photosystem I. Cyclic electron flow is concluded to be essential for protecting photosystem I from high light stress.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) is a well-recognized phenomenon that allows mitochondria to undergo a sudden increase of permeability to solutes with molecular mass \u2264\u00a01500\u00a0Da, leading to organelle swelling and structural modifications. The relevance of PT relies on its master role in the manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD). This function is performed by a mega-channel (in some cases inhibited by cyclosporin A) named permeability transition pore (PTP), whose function could derive from the assembly of different mitochondrial proteins.In this paper we examine the distribution and characteristics of PTP in mitochondria of eukaryotic organisms so far investigated in order to draw a hypothesis on the mechanism of its evolution. As a result, we suggest that PTP may have arisen as a new function linked to a multiple molecular exaptation of different mitochondrial proteins, even though they could nevertheless still play their original role.Furthermore, we suggest that the early appearance of PTP could have had a crucial role in the establishment of endosymbiosis in eukaryotic cells, by the coordinated balancing of ATP production by glycolysis (performed by the primary phagocyte) and oxidative phosphorylation (accomplished by the endosymbiont). Indeed, we argue on the possibility that this new energetic equilibrium could have opened the way to the subsequent evolution toward metazoans.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative phosphorylation disorders are often associated with increased oxidative stress and antioxidant therapy is frequently given as treatment. However, the role of oxidative stress in oxidative phosphorylation disorders or patients is far from clear and consequently the preventive or therapeutic effect of antioxidants is highly anecdotic. Therefore, we performed a systematic study of a panel of oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen species levels, damage and defense) in fibroblasts of twelve well-characterized oxidative phosphorylation patients with a defect in the POLG1 gene, in the mitochondrial DNA-encoded tRNA-Leu gene (m.3243A\u00a0>\u00a0G or m.3302A\u00a0>\u00a0G) and in one of the mitochondrial DNA-encoded NADH dehydrogenase complex I (CI) subunits. All except two cell lines (one POLG1 and one tRNA-Leu) showed increased reactive oxygen species levels compared with controls, but only four (two CI and two tRNA-Leu) cell lines provided evidence for increased oxidative protein damage. The absence of a correlation between reactive oxygen species levels and oxidative protein damage implies differences in damage prevention or correction. This was investigated by gene expression studies, which showed adaptive and compensating changes involving antioxidants and the unfolded protein response, especially in the POLG1 group. This study indicated that patients display individual responses and that detailed analysis of fibroblasts enables the identification of patients that potentially benefit from antioxidant therapy. Furthermore, the fibroblast model can also be used to search for and test novel, more specific antioxidants or explore ways to stimulate compensatory mechanisms.",

We used transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants with severely decreased GR activities by using a gene encoding tobacco chloroplast GR for the RNAi construct to investigate the possible mechanisms of chloroplast GR in protecting photosynthesis against chilling stress. Transgenic plants were highly sensitive to chilling stress and accumulated high levels of H2O2 in chloroplasts. Spectroscopic analysis and electron transport measurements show that PSII activity was significantly reduced in transgenic plants. Flash-induced fluorescence relaxation and thermoluminescence measurements demonstrate that there was a slow electron transfer between QA and QB and decreased redox potential of QB in transgenic plants, whereas the donor side function of PSII was not affected. Immunoblot and blue native gel analyses illustrate that PSII protein accumulation was decreased greatly in transgenic plants. Our results suggest that chloroplast GR plays an important role in protecting PSII function by maintaining the electron transport in PSII acceptor side and stabilizing PSII complexes under chilling stress.

     "abstract": "Ca2+ and Cl\u2212 ions are essential elements for the oxygen evolution activity of photosystem II (PSII). It has been demonstrated that these ions can be exchanged with Sr2+ and Br\u2212, respectively, and that these ion exchanges modify the kinetics of some electron transfer reactions at the Mn4Ca cluster level (Ishida et al., J. Biol. Chem. 283 (2008) 13330\u201313340). It has been proposed from thermoluminescence experiments that the kinetic effects arise, at least in part, from a decrease in the free energy level of the Mn4Ca cluster in the S3 state though some changes on the acceptor side were also observed. Therefore, in the present work, by using thin-layer cell spectroelectrochemistry, the effects of the Ca2+/Sr2+ and Cl\u2212/Br\u2212 exchanges on the redox potential of the primary quinone electron acceptor QA, Em(QA/QA\u2212), were investigated. Since the previous studies on the Ca2+/Sr2+ and Cl\u2212/Br\u2212 exchanges were performed in PsbA3-containing PSII purified from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus, we first investigated the influences of the PsbA1/PsbA3 exchange on Em(QA/QA\u2212). Here we show that i) the Em(QA/QA\u2212) was up-shifted by ca. +\u00a038\u00a0mV in PsbA3-PSII when compared to PsbA1-PSII and ii) the Ca2+/Sr2+ exchange up-shifted the Em(QA/QA\u2212) by ca. +\u00a027\u00a0mV, whereas the Cl\u2212/Br\u2212 exchange hardly influenced Em(QA/QA\u2212). On the basis of the results of Em(QA/QA\u2212) together with previous thermoluminescence measurements, the ion-exchange effects on the energetics in PSII are discussed.",

However, Sco homologues are also found in bacteria like Rhodobacter capsulatus which lack aa3-type cytochrome oxidases and instead use a cbb3-type cytochrome oxidase (cbb3 Cox) without a CuA centre as a terminal oxidase. In the current study, we have analyzed the role of Sco (SenC) during cbb3 Cox assembly in R. capsulatus. In agreement with earlier works, we found a strong cbb3 Cox defect in the absence of SenC that impairs the steady-state stability of the CcoN, CcoO and CcoP core subunits, without the accumulation of detectable assembly intermediates. In vivo cross-linking results demonstrate that SenC is in close proximity to the CcoP and CcoH subunits of cbb3 Cox, suggesting that SenC interacts directly with cbb3 Cox during its assembly. SenC binds copper and the cbb3 Cox assembly defect in the absence of SenC can be rescued by the addition of least 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM Cu. Neither copper nor SenC influenced the transcription of the ccoNOQP operon encoding for cbb3 Cox. Transcription of senC itself was also not influenced by Cu unless the putative Cu-export ATPase CcoI was absent. As CcoI is specifically required for the cbb3 Cox assembly, these data provide a direct link between Cu delivery to cbb3 Cox and SenC function.",

Ycf34 homologues are also encoded in all sequenced genomes of cyanobacteria. To evaluate the role of Ycf34 we have constructed and analysed a cyanobacterial mutant strain. Inactivation of ycf34 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 showed no obvious phenotype under normal light intensity growth conditions. However, when the cells were grown under low light intensity they contained less and smaller phycobilisome antennae and showed a strongly retarded growth, suggesting an essential role of the Ycf34 polypeptide under light limiting conditions. Northern blot analysis revealed a very weak expression of the phycocyanin operon in the ycf34 mutant under light limiting growth in contrast to the wild type and to normal light conditions. Oxygen evolution and P700 measurements showed impaired electron flow between photosystem II and photosystem I under these conditions which suggest that the impaired antenna size is most likely due to a highly reduced plastoquinone pool which triggers regulation on a transcriptional level. Using a FLAG-tagged Ycf34 we found that this protein is tightly bound to the thylakoid membranes. UV\u2013vis and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy of the recombinant Ycf34 protein demonstrate the presence of an iron\u2013sulphur cluster.

Mitochondria house the electron transport chain (ETC) that couples oxidation of organic substrates and electron transfer to proton pumping and synthesis of ATP. The ETC comprises several multiprotein enzyme complexes, all of which have counterparts in bacteria. However, mitochondrial ETC assemblies from animals, plants and fungi are generally more complex than their bacterial counterparts, with a number of \u2018supernumerary\u2019 subunits appearing early in eukaryotic evolution. Little is known, however, about the ETC of unicellular eukaryotes (protists), which are key to understanding the evolution of mitochondria and the ETC. We present an analysis of the ETC proteome from Acanthamoeba castellanii, an ecologically, medically and evolutionarily important member of Amoebozoa (sister to Opisthokonta). Data obtained from tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analyses of purified mitochondria as well as ETC complexes isolated via blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are combined with the results of bioinformatic queries of sequence databases. Our bioinformatic analyses have identified most of the ETC subunits found in other eukaryotes, confirming and extending previous observations. The assignment of proteins as ETC subunits by MS/MS provides important insights into the primary structures of ETC proteins and makes possible, through the use of sensitive profile-based similarity searches, the identification of novel constituents of the ETC along with the annotation of highly divergent but phylogenetically conserved ETC subunits.",

Due to its chemical properties, oxygen can be reduced incompletely which generates several highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are able to oxidize a broad range of biomolecules. In extension to previous studies it could be shown that ROS dramatically decreased ATP synthesis in situ and affected the CF1 portion in vitro. A conserved cluster of three methionines and a cysteine on the chloroplast \u03b3 subunit could be identified by mass spectrometry to be oxidized by ROS. Analysis of amino acid substitutions in a hybrid F1 assembly system indicated that these residues were exclusive catalytic targets for hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen, although it could be deduced that additional unknown amino acid targets might be involved in the latter reaction. The cluster was tightly integrated in catalytic turnover since mutants varied in MgATPase rates, stimulation by sulfite and chloroplast-specific \u03b3 subunit redox-modulation.

Mitochondria are both a source of and target for ONOO\u2212. Our aim was to identify specific mitochondrial proteins that display enhanced tyr-N after cardiac IR injury, and to explore whether inhibiting O2\u2212/ONOO\u2212 during IR decreases mitochondrial protein tyr-N and consequently improves cardiac function. We show here that IR increased tyr-N of 35 and 15\u00a0kDa mitochondrial proteins using Western blot analysis with 3-nitrotyrosine antibody. Immunoprecipitation (IP) followed by LC\u2013MS/MS identified 13 protein candidates for tyr-N. IP and Western blot identified and confirmed that the 35\u00a0kDa tyr-N protein is the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). Tyr-N of native cardiac VDAC with IR was verified on recombinant (r) VDAC with exogenous ONOO\u2212. We also found that ONOO\u2212 directly enhanced rVDAC channel activity, and rVDAC tyr-N induced by ONOO\u2212 formed oligomers. Resveratrol (RES), a scavenger of O2\u2212/ONOO\u2212, reduced the tyr-N levels of both native and recombinant VDAC, while L-NAME, which inhibits NO generation, only reduced tyr-N levels of native VDAC. O2\u2212 and ONOO\u2212 levels were reduced in perfused hearts during IR by RES and L-NAME and this was accompanied by improved cardiac function. These results identify tyr-N of VDAC and show that reducing ONOO\u2212 during cardiac IR injury can attenuate tyr-N of VDAC and improve cardiac function.",

Meanwhile, methodological means must be proposed to gather information on tumor metabolism in order to adapt these potential therapies to the bioenergetic specificities of tumors. Studies performed on tumors and cancer cell lines have shown that cancer cells bioenergetics is highly variable. This profile changes with microenvironmental conditions (eg. substrate availability), the oncogenes activated (and the tumor suppressors inactivated) and the interaction with the stroma (i.e. reverse Warburg effect). Here, we assessed the power of metabolic footprinting (MFP) to unravel the bioenergetics and associated anabolic changes induced by three oncogenes, c-Myc, KLF4 and Oct1. The MFP approach provides a quantitative analysis of the metabolites secreted and consumed by cancer cells. We used ultra performance liquid chromatography for quantifying the amino acid uptake and secretion. To investigate the potential oncogene-mediated alterations in mitochondrial metabolism, we measured oxygen consumption rate and ATP production as well as the glucose uptake and lactate release. Our findings show that c-Myc deficiency initiates the Warburg effect along with a reduction of mitochondrial respiration. KLF4 deficiency also stimulated glycolysis, albeit without cellular respiration impairment. In contrast, Oct1 deficiency reduced glycolysis and enhanced oxidative phosphorylation efficiency. MFP revealed that c-Myc, KLF4 and Oct1 altered amino acid metabolism with specific patterns. We identified isoleucine, \u03b1-aminoadipic acid and GABA (\u03b3-aminoisobutyric acid) as biomarkers related. Our findings establish the impact of Oct1, KLF4 and c-Myc on cancer bioenergetics and evidence a link between oncosecretomics and cellular bioenergetics profile.",

     "abstract": "Elastic conformational changes of the protein backbone are essential for catalytic activities of enzymes. To follow relative movements within the protein, F\u00f6rster-type resonance energy transfer (FRET) between two specifically attached fluorophores can be applied. FRET provides a precise ruler between 3 and 8\u00a0nm with subnanometer resolution. Corresponding submillisecond time resolution is sufficient to identify conformational changes in FRET time trajectories. Analyzing single enzymes circumvents the need for synchronization of various conformations. FOF1-ATP synthase is a rotary double motor which catalyzes the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A proton-driven 10-stepped rotary FO motor in the Escherichia coli enzyme is connected to a 3-stepped F1 motor, where ATP is synthesized. To operate the double motor with a mismatch of step sizes smoothly, elastic deformations within the rotor parts have been proposed by W. Junge and coworkers. Here we extend a single-molecule FRET approach to observe both rotary motors simultaneously in individual FOF1-ATP synthases at work. We labeled this enzyme with two fluorophores specifically, that is, on the \u03b5- and c-subunits of the two rotors. Alternating laser excitation was used to select the FRET-labeled enzymes. FRET changes indicated associated transient twisting within the rotors of single enzyme molecules during ATP hydrolysis and ATP synthesis. Supported by Monte Carlo simulations of the FRET experiments, these studies reveal that the rotor twisting is greater than 36\u00b0 and is largely suppressed in the presence of the rotation inhibitor DCCD.

Thirteen proteins coded by mtDNA are crucial for oxidative phosphorylation, 11 of them constitute key components of the respiratory chain complexes I, III and IV and 2 of mitochondrial ATP synthase. Moreover, pathogenic point mutations in mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs generate abnormal synthesis of the mtDNA coded proteins. Thus, pathogenic point mutations in mtDNA usually disturb the level of key parameter of the oxidative phosphorylation, i.e. the electric potential on the inner mitochondrial membrane (\u0394\u03c8), and in a consequence calcium signalling and mitochondrial dynamics in the cell. Mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species is also modified in the mutated cells. The results obtained with cultured cells and describing biochemical consequences of mtDNA point mutations are full of contradictions. Still they help elucidate the biochemical basis of pathologies and provide a valuable tool for finding remedies in the future.

     "abstract": "Existing literature on estradiol indicates that it affects mitochondrial functions at low micromolar concentrations. Particularly blockade of the permeability transition pore (PTP) or modulation of the enzymatic activity of one or more complexes of the respiratory chain were suspicious. We prepared mitoplasts from rat liver mitochondria (RLM) to study by single-channel patch-clamp techniques the PTP, and from rat astrocytes to study the potassium BK-channel said to modulate the PTP. Additionally, we measured respiration of intact RLM. After application of 17\u03b2-estradiol (\u03b2E) our single-channel results reveal a transient increase of activity of both, the BK-channel and the PTP followed by their powerful inhibition. Respiration measurements demonstrate inhibition of the Ca2\u00a0+-induced permeability transition, as well, though only at higher concentrations (\u2265\u00a030\u00a0\u03bcM). At lower concentrations, we observed an increase of endogenous- and state 2-respiration. Furthermore, we show that \u03b2E diminishes the phosphorylating respiration supported by complex I-substrates (glutamate/malate) or by the complex II-substrate succinate. Taken together the results suggest that \u03b2E affects mitochondria by several modes, including partial inhibition of the activities of ion channels of the inner membrane and of respiration.

     "abstract": "In this study we show that mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and thymus mitochondria can be ubiquitinylated and degraded by the cytosolic proteasome. Using a ubiquitin conjugating system, we show that UCP1 can be ubiquitinylated in vitro. We demonstrate that UCP1 is ubiquitinylated in vivo using isolated mitochondria from brown adipose tissue, thymus and whole brown adipocytes. Using an in vitro ubiquitin conjugating\u2013proteasome degradation system, we show that the cytosolic proteasome can degrade UCP1 at a rate commensurate with the half-life of UCP1 (i.e. 30\u201372\u00a0h in brown adipocytes and ~\u00a03\u00a0h, in thymocytes). In addition, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic proteasome is required for UCP1 degradation from mitochondria that the process is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and that dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential inhibits degradation of UCP1. There also appears to be a greater amount of ubiquitinylated UCP1 associated with BAT mitochondria from cold-acclimated animals. We have also identified (using immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry) ubiquitinylated proteins with molecular masses greater than 32\u00a0kDa, as being UCP1. We conclude that there is a role for ubiquitinylation and the cytosolic proteasome in turnover of mitochondrial UCP1.

     "abstract": "While metformin has been widely used to treat type 2 diabetes for the last fifty years, its mode of action remains unclear. Hence, we investigated the short-term alterations in energy metabolism caused by metformin administration in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We found that metformin inhibited mitochondrial respiration, although ATP levels remained constant as the decrease in mitochondrial production was compensated by an increase in glycolysis. While AMP/ATP ratios were unaffected by metformin, phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase augmented. The inhibition of respiration provoked a rapid and sustained increase in superoxide levels, despite the increase in UCP2 and superoxide dismutase activity. The inhibition of respiration was rapidly reversed by fatty acids and thus respiration was lower in treated cells in the presence of pyruvate and glucose while rates were identical to control cells when palmitate was the substrate. We conclude that metformin reversibly inhibits mitochondrial respiration, it rapidly activates AMPK without altering the energy charge, and it inhibits fatty acid synthesis. Mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation is facilitated by reversing the inhibition of complex I and, presumably, by releasing the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial complex I (proton pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the largest and most complicated component of the respiratory electron transfer chain. Despite its central role in biological energy conversion the structure and function of this membrane integral multiprotein complex is still poorly understood. Recent insights into the structure of complex I by X-ray crystallography have shown that iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2, the immediate electron donor for ubiquinone, resides about 30\u00a0\u00c5 above the membrane domain and mutagenesis studies suggested that the active site for the hydrophobic substrate is located next to this redox-center. To trace the path for the hydrophobic tail of ubiquinone when it enters the peripheral arm of complex I, we performed an extensive structure/function analysis of complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica monitoring the interaction of site-directed mutants with five ubiquinone derivatives carrying different tails. The catalytic activity of a subset of mutants was strictly dependent on the presence of intact isoprenoid moieties in the tail. Overall a consistent picture emerged suggesting that the tail of ubiquinone enters through a narrow path at the interface between the 49-kDa and PSST subunits. Most notably we identified a set of methionines that seems to form a hydrophobic gate to the active site reminiscent to the M-domains involved in the interaction with hydrophobic targeting sequences with the signal recognition particle of the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, two of the amino acids critical for the interaction with the ubiquinone tail are different in bovine complex I and we could show that one of these exchanges is responsible for the lower sensitivity of Y. lipolytica complex I towards the inhibitor rotenone.

     "abstract": "Complex I is a key enzyme of the respiratory chain in many organisms. This multi-protein complex with an intricate evolutionary history originated from the unification of prebuilt modules of hydrogenases and transporters. Using recently determined crystallographic structures of complex I we reanalyzed evolutionarily related complexes that couple oxidoreduction to trans-membrane ion translocation. Our analysis points to the previously unnoticed structural homology of the electron input module of formate dehydrogenlyases and subunit NuoG of complex I. We also show that all related to complex I hydrogenases likely operate via a conformation driven mechanism with structural changes generated in the conserved coupling site located at the interface of subunits NuoB/D/H. The coupling apparently originated once in evolutionary history, together with subunit NuoH joining hydrogenase and transport modules. Analysis of quinone oxidoreduction properties and the structure of complex I allows us to suggest a fully reversible coupling mechanism. Our model predicts that: 1) proton access to the ketone groups of the bound quinone is rigorously controlled by the protein, 2) the negative electric charge of the anionic ubiquinol head group is a major driving force for conformational changes.

In a number of the cases, CNVs were found to alter the copy number of genes that are important in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), ion and especially calcium transport, and synaptic structure.

In this mini-review of 35\u00a0years' history of my laboratory and collaborators, we characterized the function of protein-associated semiquinone molecules in the proton-pumping mechanism in complex I (NADH-quinone oxidoreductase). We have constructed most of the frame work of our hypothesis, utilizing EPR techniques before the X-ray structures of complex I were reported by Sazanov's and Brandt's groups. One of the semiquinones (SQNf) is extremely sensitive to a proton motive force imposed on the energy-transducing membrane, while the other (SQNs) is insensitive. Their sensitivity to rotenone inhibition also differs. These differences were exploited using tightly coupled bovine heart submitochondrial particles with a high respiratory control ratio (>\u00a08). We determined the distance between SQNf and iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2 on the basis of their direct spin\u2013spin interaction. We are extending this line of work using reconstituted bovine heart complex I proteoliposomes which shows a respiratory control ratio >\u00a05. Two frontier research groups support our view point based on their mutagenesis studies. High frequency (33.9\u00a0GHz; Q-band) EPR experiments appear to favor our two-semiquinone model.

Most attention is now dedicated to the investigation of the energy coupling mechanism(s). The proton has been identified as the coupling ion, although in the case of some bacterial complexes I Na+ has been proposed to have that role. We have addressed the relation of some complexes I with Na+ and developed an innovative methodology using 23Na NMR spectroscopy. This allowed the investigation of Na+ transport taking the advantage of directly monitoring changes in Na+ concentration. Methodological aspects concerning the use of 23Na NMR spectroscopy to measure accurately sodium transport in bacterial membrane vesicles are discussed here. External-vesicle Na+ concentrations were determined by two different methods: 1) by integration of the resonance frequency peak and 2) using calibration curves of resonance frequency shift dependence on Na+ concentration. Although the calibration curves are a suitable way to determine Na+ concentration changes under conditions of fast exchange, it was shown not to be applicable to the bacterial membrane vesicle systems. In this case, the integration of the resonance frequency peak is the most appropriate analysis for the quantification of external-vesicle Na+ concentration.

This membrane-bound, respiratory complex also contains one non-covalently bound FAD, one non-covalently bound riboflavin, ubiquinone-8 and a [2Fe\u20132S] cluster. Here, we report the quantitative analysis of the full set of flavin cofactors in the Na+-NQR and characterize the mode of linkage of the riboflavin phosphate to the membrane-bound NqrB and NqrC subunits. Release of the flavin by \u03b2-elimination and analysis of the cofactor demonstrates that the phosphate group is attached at the 5'-position of the ribityl as in authentic FMN and that the Na+-NQR contains approximately 1.7\u00a0mol covalently bound FMN per mol non-covalently bound FAD. Therefore, each of the single NqrB and NqrC subunits in the Na+-NQR carries a single FMN. Elimination of the phosphodiester bond yields a dehydro-2-aminobutyrate residue, which is modified with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol by Michael addition. Proteolytic digestion followed by mass determination of peptide fragments reveals exclusive modification of threonine residues, which carry FMN in the native enzyme. The described reactions allow quantification and localization of the covalently attached FMNs in the Na+-NQR and in related proteins belonging to the Rhodobacter nitrogen fixation (RNF) family of enzymes.

     "abstract": "Proton-translocating transhydrogenase is found in the inner membranes of animal mitochondria, and in the cytoplasmic membranes of many bacteria. It catalyses hydride transfer from NADH to NADP+ coupled to inward proton translocation. Evidence is reviewed suggesting the enzyme operates by a \u201cbinding-change\u201d mechanism. Experiments with Escherichia coli transhydrogenase indicate the enzyme is driven between \u201copen\u201d and \u201coccluded\u201d states by protonation and deprotonation reactions associated with proton translocation. In the open states NADP+/NADPH can rapidly associate with, or dissociate from, the enzyme, and hydride transfer is prevented. In the occluded states bound NADP+/NADPH cannot dissociate, and hydride transfer is allowed. Crystal structures of a complex of the nucleotide-binding components of Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase show how hydride transfer is enabled and disabled at appropriate steps in catalysis, and how release of NADP+/NADPH is restricted in the occluded state. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies indicate that the equilibrium constant for hydride transfer on the enzyme is elevated as a consequence of the tight binding of NADPH relative to NADP+. The protonation site in the translocation pathway must face the outside if NADP+ is bound, the inside if NADPH is bound. Chemical shift changes detected by NMR may show where alterations in protein conformation resulting from NADP+ reduction are initiated.

We observed that mitochondria of \u03c10 cells maintain a membrane potential and that this is readily dissipated after displacement of hexokinase (HK) II from the mitochondrial surface by treatment with either the drug clotrimazole or with a cell-permeant HK II peptide, or by placing \u03c10 cells in a medium without serum and glucose. The PTP inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) could decrease the mitochondrial depolarization induced by either HK II displacement or by nutrient depletion. We also found that a fraction of the kinases ERK1/2 and GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 is located in the mitochondrial matrix of \u03c10 cells, and that glucose and serum deprivation caused concomitant ERK1/2 inhibition and GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 activation with the ensuing phosphorylation of cyclophilin D, the mitochondrial target of CsA. GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibition with indirubin-3\u2032-oxime decreased PTP-induced cell death in \u03c10 cells following nutrient ablation. These findings indicate that \u03c10 cells are equipped with a functioning PTP, whose regulatory mechanisms are similar to those observed in cancer cells, and suggest that escape from PTP opening is a survival factor in this model of mitochondrial diseases.

At positive voltages, this channel displayed a conductance of 67.84\u00a0pS and a strong voltage dependence at holding potentials from \u2212\u00a080\u00a0mV to +\u00a080\u00a0mV. The open probability was higher at positive than at negative voltages. Patch-clamp studies at the mitoplast-attached mode showed that the channel was not sensitive to activators and inhibitors of mitochondrial potassium channels but was regulated by pH. Moreover, we demonstrated that the channel activity was not affected by the application of lidocaine, an inhibitor of two-pore domain potassium channels, or by tertiapin, an inhibitor of inwardly rectifying potassium channels. In summary, based on the single-channel recordings, we characterised for the first time mitochondrial pH-sensitive ion channel that is selective for cations, permeable to potassium ions, displays voltage sensitivity and does not correspond to any previously described potassium ion channels in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

The latter depends on the presenilin associated rhomboid like (PARL) protease, essential for the accumulation of a soluble intermembrane space form of OPA1 (IMS-OPA1). Here we show that OPA1 and PARL participate in the heat shock response, a stereotypical cellular process of adaptation to thermal stress. Upon heat shock, long forms of OPA1 are lost and mitochondria fragment. However, mitochondrial fusion is dispensable to maintain viability, whereas IMS-OPA1 is required. Upon conditioning\u2014a process of mild heat shock and recovery\u2014IMS-OPA1 accumulates, OPA1 oligomers increase and mitochondria release less cytochrome c, ultimately resulting in cellular resistance to subsequent apoptotic inducers. In Parl\u2212/\u2212 cells accumulation of IMS-OPA1 is blunted and conditioning fails to protect from cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Thus, the OPA1/PARL dependent pathway of cristae remodeling is implicated in heat shock. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: 17th European Bioenergetics Conference (EBEC 2012).",

In this study, the oxidation of horse cyt c2\u00a0+ by CcO from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, was monitored using stopped-flow spectrophotometry. A novel analytic procedure was applied in which the spectra were deconvoluted into the reduced and oxidized forms of cyt c by a least-squares fitting method, yielding the reaction rates at various concentrations of cyt c2\u00a0+ and cyt c3\u00a0+. This allowed an analysis of the effects of cyt c3\u00a0+ on the steady-state kinetics between CcO and cyt c2\u00a0+. The results show that cyt c3\u00a0+ exhibits product inhibition by two mechanisms: competition with cyt c2\u00a0+ at the catalytic site and, in addition, an interaction at a second site which further modulates the reaction of cyt c2\u00a0+ at the catalytic site. These results are generally consistent with previous reports, indicating the reliability of the new procedure. We also find that a 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0His-tag at the C-terminus of the subunit II of CcO affects the binding of cyt c at both sites.

     "abstract": "Brain mitochondria are not only major producers of reactive oxygen species but they also considerably contribute to the removal of toxic hydrogen peroxide by the glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin-2 (Trx2) antioxidant systems. In this work we estimated the relative contribution of both systems and catalase to the removal of intrinsically produced hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by rat brain mitochondria. By using the specific inhibitors auranofin and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB), the contribution of Trx2- and GSH-systems to reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification in rat brain mitochondria was determined to be 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020% and 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015%, respectively. Catalase contributed to a non-significant extent only, as revealed by aminotriazole inhibition. In digitonin-treated rat hippocampal homogenates inhibition of Trx2- and GSH-systems affected mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production rates to a much higher extent than the endogenous extramitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production, pointing to a strong compartmentation of ROS metabolism. Imaging experiments of hippocampal slice cultures showed on single cell level substantial heterogeneity of hydrogen peroxide detoxification reactions. The strongest effects of inhibition of hydrogen peroxide removal by auranofin or DNCB were detected in putative interneurons and microglial cells, while pyramidal cells and astrocytes showed lower effects. Thus, our data underline the important contribution of the Trx2-system to hydrogen peroxide detoxification in rat hippocampus.

     "abstract": "Bacterial nitric oxide reductases (NOR) are integral membrane proteins that catalyse the reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide, often as a step in the process of denitrification. Most functional data has been obtained with NORs that receive their electrons from a soluble cytochrome c in the periplasm and are hence termed cNOR. Very recently, the structure of a different type of NOR, the quinol-dependent (q)-NOR from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus stearothermophilus was solved to atomic resolution [Y. Matsumoto, T. Tosha, A.V. Pisliakov, T. Hino, H. Sugimoto, S. Nagano, Y. Sugita and Y. Shiro, Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 19 (2012) 238\u2013246]. In this study, we have investigated the reaction between this qNOR and oxygen. Our results show that, like some cNORs, the G. stearothermophilus qNOR is capable of O2 reduction with a turnover of ~\u00a03\u00a0electrons\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, using the so-called flow-flash technique, we show that the fully reduced (with three available electrons) qNOR reacts with oxygen in a reaction with a time constant of 1.8\u00a0ms that oxidises the low-spin heme b. This reaction is coupled to proton uptake from solution and presumably forms a ferryl intermediate at the active site. The pH dependence of the reaction is markedly different from a corresponding reaction in cNOR from Paracoccus denitrificans, indicating that possibly the proton uptake mechanism and/or pathway differs between qNOR and cNOR. This study furthermore forms the basis for investigation of the proton transfer pathway in qNOR using both variants with putative proton transfer elements modified and measurements of the vectorial nature of the proton transfer.

     "abstract": "Human mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency is associated with progressive neurological disorders. To better understand the CI pathomechanism, we here studied how deletion of the CI gene NDUFS4 affects cell metabolism. To this end we compared immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from wildtype (wt) and whole-body NDUFS4 knockout (KO) mice. Mitochondria from KO cells lacked the NDUFS4 protein and mitoplasts displayed virtually no CI activity, moderately reduced CII, CIII and CIV activities and normal citrate synthase and CV (FoF1-ATPase) activity. Native electrophoresis of KO cell mitochondrial fractions revealed two distinct CI subcomplexes of ~\u00a0830\u00a0kDa (enzymatically inactive) and ~\u00a0200\u00a0kDa (active). The level of fully-assembled CII\u2013CV was not affected by NDUFS4 gene deletion. KO cells exhibited a moderately reduced maximal and routine O2 consumption, which was fully inhibited by acute application of the CI inhibitor rotenone. The aberrant CI assembly and reduced O2 consumption in KO cells were fully normalized by NDUFS4 gene complementation. Cellular [NAD+]/[NADH] ratio, lactate production and mitochondrial tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) accumulation were slightly increased in KO cells. In contrast, NDUFS4 gene deletion did not detectably alter [NADP+]/[NADPH] ratio, cellular glucose consumption, the protein levels of hexokinases (I and II) and phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase (P-PDH), total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, free cytosolic [ATP], cell growth rate, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. We conclude that the NDUFS4 subunit is of key importance in CI stabilization and that, due to the metabolic properties of the immortalized MEFs, NDUFS4 gene deletion has only modest effects at the live cell level.

     "abstract": "The structural and functional integrity of biological membranes is vital to life. The interplay of lipids and membrane proteins is crucial for numerous fundamental processes ranging from respiration, photosynthesis, signal transduction, solute transport to motility. Evidence is accumulating that specific lipids play important roles in membrane proteins, but how specific lipids interact with and enable membrane proteins to achieve their full functionality remains unclear. X-ray structures of membrane proteins have revealed tight and specific binding of lipids. For instance, cardiolipin, an anionic phospholipid, has been found to be associated to a number of eukaryotic and prokaryotic respiratory complexes. Moreover, polar and septal accumulation of cardiolipin in a number of prokaryotes may ensure proper spatial segregation and/or activity of proteins. In this review, we describe current knowledge of the functions associated with cardiolipin binding to respiratory complexes in prokaryotes as a frame to discuss how specific lipid binding may tune their reactivity towards quinone and participate to supercomplex formation of both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory chains.

     "abstract": "An enzyme's activity is the consequence of its structure. The stochastic approach we developed to study the functioning of the respiratory complexes is based upon their 3D structure and their physical and chemical properties. Consequently it should predict their kinetic properties. In this paper we compare the predictions of our stochastic model derived for the complex I with a number of experiments performed with a large range of complex I substrates and products. A good fit was found between the experiments and the prediction of our stochastic approach. We show that, due to the spatial separation of the two half redox reactions (NADH/NAD and Q/QH2), the kinetics cannot necessarily obey a simple mechanism (ordered or ping-pong for instance). A plateau in the kinetics is observed at high substrates concentrations, well evidenced in the double reciprocal plots, which is explained by the limiting rate of quinone reduction as compared with the oxidation of NADH at the other end of complex I. Moreover, we show that the set of the seven redox reactions in between the two half redox reactions (NADH/NAD and Q/QH2) acts as an electron buffer. An inhibition of complex I activity by quinone is observed at high concentration of this molecule, which cannot be explained by a simple stochastic model based on the known structure. We hypothesize that the distance between the catalytic site close to N2 (iron/sulfur redox center that transfers electrons to quinone) and the membrane forces the quinone/quinol to take several positions in between these sites. We represent these possible positions by an extra site necessarily occupied by the quinone/quinol molecules on their way to the redox site. With this hypothesis, we are able to fit the kinetic experiments over a large range of substrates and products concentrations. The slow rate constants derived for the transition between the two sites could be an indication of a conformational change of the enzyme during the quinone/quinol movement.

The results suggest that during low temperature incubation, i.e., when cells are shifted from 34\u00a0\u00b0C to 24\u00a0\u00b0C, wild type cells exhibited light-induced state transitions, whereas the mutant deficient in CrhR failed to perform the same. At low temperature, wild type cells maintained the plastoquinone (PQ) pool in the reduced state due to enhanced respiratory electron flow to the PQ pool, whereas in \u2206crhR mutant cells the PQ pool was in the oxidized state. Wild type cells were in state 2 and \u2206crhR cells were locked in state 1 at low temperature. In both wild type and \u2206crhR cells, a fraction of PSI trimers were changed to PSI monomers.

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) plays an important role in cell death. The MPT is triggered by calcium and promoted by oxidative stress, which is often catalyzed by iron. We investigated the induction of the MPT by physiological concentrations of iron. Isolated rat liver mitochondria were initially stabilized with EDTA and bovine serum albumin and energized by succinate or malate/pyruvate. The MPT was induced by 20\u00a0\u03bcM calcium or ferrous chloride. We measured mitochondrial swelling, the inner membrane potential, NAD(P)H oxidation, iron and calcium in the recording medium. Iron effectively triggered the MPT; this effect differed from non-specific oxidative damage and required some residual EDTA in the recording medium. Evidence in the literature suggested two mechanisms of action for the iron: NAD(P)H oxidation due to loading of the mitochondrial antioxidant defense systems and uptake of iron to the mitochondrial matrix via a calcium uniporter. Both of these events occurred in our experiments but were only marginally involved in the MPT induced by iron. The primary mechanism observed in our experiments was the displacement of adventitious/endogenous calcium from the residual EDTA by iron. Although artificially created, this interplay between iron and calcium can well reflect conditions in vivo and could be considered as an important mechanism of iron toxicity in the cells.",

     "abstract": "NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I), the electron input enzyme in the respiratory chain of mitochondria and many bacteria, couples electron transport to proton translocation across the membrane. Complex I is a primary proton pump; although its proton translocation mechanism is yet to be known, it is considered radically different from any other mechanism known for redox-driven proton pumps: no redox centers have been found in its membrane domain where the proton translocation takes place. Here we studied the properties and the catalytic role of the enzyme-bound ubiquinone in the solubilized, purified Complex I from Escherichia coli. The ubiquinone content in the enzyme preparations was 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 per bound FMN residue. Rapid mixing of Complex I with NADH, traced optically, demonstrated that both reduction and re-oxidation kinetics of ubiquinone coincide with the respective kinetics of the majority of Fe\u2013S clusters, indicating kinetic competence of the detected ubiquinone. Optical spectroelectrochemical redox titration of Complex I followed at 270\u2013280\u00a0nm, where the redox changes of ubiquinone contribute, did not reveal any transition within the redox potential range typical for the membrane pool, or loosely bound ubiquinone (ca. +\u00a050\u2013+\u00a0100\u00a0mV vs. NHE, pH 6.8). The transition is likely to take place at much lower potentials (Em \u2264\u2212200\u00a0mV). Such perturbed redox properties of ubiquinone indicate that it is tightly bound to the enzyme's hydrophobic core. The possibility of two ubiquinone-binding sites in Complex I is discussed.",

Higher growth light intensities resulted in increased steady state levels of both diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin. However, it also resulted in the conversion of a significant fraction of fucoxanthin to 19\u2032-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin without a change in the total F pool. The increase in 19\u2032-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin was paralleled by a decrease in the effective antenna size, determined from the slope of the change in F0 as a function of increasing light intensity. Transfer of acclimated cultures to a higher light intensity showed that the conversion of fucoxanthin to its derivative was a relatively slow process (time-frame of hours). We suggest the replacement of fucoxanthin with the bulkier 19\u2032-butanoyloxyfucoxanthin results in a decrease in the light-harvesting efficiency of the FCP antenna and is part of the long-term acclimative response to growth at higher light intensities.",

     "abstract": "Group 1 hydrogenases are periplasmic enzymes and are thus strongly affected by the \u201coutside world\u201d the cell experiences. This exposure has brought about an extensive heterogeneity in their cofactors and redox partners. Whereas in their majority they are very O2-sensitive, several enzymes of this group have been recently reported to be O2-tolerant. Structural and biochemical studies have shown that this O2-tolerance is conferred by the presence of an unusual iron\u2013sulfur cofactor with supernumerary cysteine ligation (6 instead of 4 Cys, hence called \u20186C cluster\u2019). This atypical cluster coordination affords redox plasticity (i.e. two-redox transitions), unprecedented for this type of cofactors and likely involved in resistance to O2. Genomic screening and phylogenetic tree reconstruction revealed that 6C hydrogenases form a monophyletic clade and are unexpectedly widespread among bacteria. However, several other well-defined clades are observed, which indicate early diversification of the enzyme into different subfamilies. The various idiosyncrasies thereof are shown to comply with a very simple rule: phylogenetic grouping of hydrogenases directly correlates with their specific functions and hence biochemical characteristics. The observed variability results from gene duplication, gene shuffling and subsequent adaptation of the diversified enzymes to specific environments. An important factor for this diversification seems to have been the emergence of molecular oxygen. Hydrogenases appear to have dealt with oxidative stress in various ways, the most successful of which, however, was the innovation of the 6C-cluster conferring pronounced O2-tolerance to the parent enzymes.",

The complexes contain bacteriochlorophyll a (BChl a) and multiple species of carotenoids. The composition of carotenoids depends on the light conditions applied during growth of the cultures. In addition, LH2 grown under high light has a noticeable split of the B800 absorption band. The influence of the change of carotenoid distribution as well as the spectral change of the excitonic absorption of the bacteriochlorophylls on the light-harvesting ability was studied using steady-state absorption, fluorescence and femtosecond time-resolved absorption at 77\u00a0K. The results demonstrate that the change of the distribution of the carotenoids when cells were grown at low light adapts the absorptive properties of the complex to the light conditions and maintains maximum photon-capture performance. In addition, an explanation for the origin of the enigmatic split of the B800 absorption band is provided. This spectral splitting is also observed in LH2 complexes from other photosynthetic sulfur purple bacterial species. According to results obtained from transient absorption spectroscopy, the B800 band split originates from two spectral forms of the associated BChl a monomeric molecules bound within the same complex.",

     "abstract": "Plants live in variable environments in which light intensity can rapidly change, from limiting to excess conditions. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is a regulatory mechanism which protects plants from oxidative stress by dissipating excess Chl singlet excitation. In this work, the physiological role of NPQ was assessed by monitoring its influence on the population of the direct source of light excess damage, i.e., Chl triplets (3Chl*). 3Chl* formation was evaluated in vivo, with the moss Physcomitrella patens, by exploiting the high sensitivity of fluorescence-detected magnetic resonance (FDMR). A dark adapted sample was compared with a pre-illuminated sample in which NPQ was activated, the latter showing a strong reduction in 3Chl* yield. In line with this result, mutants unable to activate NPQ showed only a minor effect in 3Chl* yield upon pre-illumination.The decrease in 3Chl* yield is equally experienced by all the Chl pools associated with PSII, suggesting that NPQ is effective in protecting both the core and the peripheral antenna complexes. Moreover, the FDMR results show that the structural reorganization in the photosynthetic apparatus, required by NPQ, does not lead to the formation of new 3Chl* traps in the LHCs. This work demonstrates that NPQ activation leads to effective photoprotection, promoting a photosystem II state characterized by a reduced probability of 3Chl* formation, due to a decreased singlet excited state population, while maintaining an efficient quenching of the 3Chl* eventually formed by carotenoids.",

We studied the effects of high- and low-light growth conditions, where BChl levels increased approximately four-fold from 1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 to 6.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 molecules per cell. Most of this extra pigment is accommodated in the proliferating ICM system, which increases from approximately 274 to 1468 vesicles per cell. Thus, 16\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0nm2 of specialised membrane surface area is made available for harvesting and utilising solar energy compared to 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0nm2 under high-light conditions. Membrane mapping using atomic force microscopy revealed closely packed dimeric and monomeric reaction centre-light harvesting 1-PufX (RC-LH1-PufX) complexes in high-light ICM with room only for small clusters of LH2, whereas extensive LH2-only domains form during adaptation to low light, with the LH2/RC ratio increasing three-fold. The number of upper pigmented band (UPB) sites where membrane invagination is initiated hardly varied; 704 (5.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 BChls/cell) and 829 (4.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 BChls/cell) UPB sites per cell were estimated under high- and low-light conditions, respectively. Thus, the lower ICM content in high-light cells is a consequence of fewer ICM invaginations reaching maturity. Taking into account the relatively poor LH2-to-LH1 energy transfer in UPB membranes it is likely that high-light cells are relatively inefficient at energy trapping, but can grow well enough without the need to fully develop their photosynthetic membranes from the relatively inefficient UPB to highly efficient mature ICM.",

     "abstract": "Inhibition of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) has proved to be an effective strategy for preventing oxidative stress-induced cell death, and the pore represents a viable cellular target for drugs. Here, we report that inhibition of complex I by rotenone is more effective at PTP inhibition than cyclosporin A in tissues that express low levels of the cyclosporin A mitochondrial target, cyclophilin D; and, conversely, that tissues in which rotenone does not affect the PTP are characterized by high levels of expression of cyclophilin D and sensitivity to cyclosporin A. Consistent with a regulatory role of complex I in the PTP-inhibiting effects of rotenone, the concentrations of the latter required for PTP inhibition precisely match those required to inhibit respiration; and a similar effect is seen with the antidiabetic drug metformin, which partially inhibits complex I. Remarkably (i) genetic ablation of cyclophilin D or its displacement with cyclosporin A restored PTP inhibition by rotenone in tissues that are otherwise resistant to its effects; and (ii) rotenone did not inhibit the PTP unless phosphate was present, in striking analogy with the phosphate requirement for the inhibitory effects of cyclosporin A [Basso et al. (2008) J. Biol. Chem. 283, 26307\u201326311]. These results indicate that inhibition of complex I by rotenone or metformin and displacement of cyclophilin D by cyclosporin A affect the PTP through a common mechanism; and that cells can modulate their PTP response to complex I inhibition by modifying the expression of cyclophilin D, a finding that has major implications for pore modulation in vivo.",

These proteins and their surrounding medium have been carefully analysed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. A high value of 550\u00a0mg/ml was determined for the overall solute content of the cell soluble compartment. PSI and Fd are present at similar concentrations, around 500\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas the FNR associated to phycobilisome is about 4 fold less concentrated. Membrane densities of FNR and trimeric PSI have been estimated to 2000 and 2550 per \u03bcm2, respectively. An artificial confinement of Fd to PSI was designed using fused constructs between Fd and PsaE, a peripheral and stroma located PSI subunit. The best covalent system in terms of photocatalysed NADPH synthesis can be equivalent to the free system in a dilute medium. In a macrosolute crowded medium (375\u00a0mg/ml), this optimized PSI/Fd covalent complex exhibited a huge superiority compared to the free system. This is a likely consequence of restrained diffusion constraints due to the vicinity of two out of the three protein partners. In vivo, Fd is the free partner, but the constant proximity between PSI and the phycobilisome associated FNR creates a similar situation, with two closely associated partners. This organization seems well adapted for an efficient in vivo production of the stable and fast diffusing NADPH.",

     "abstract": "Thermodynamics impose a major constraint on the structure of metabolic pathways. Here, we use carbon fixation pathways to demonstrate how thermodynamics shape the structure of pathways and determine the cellular resources they consume. We analyze the energetic profile of prototypical reactions and show that each reaction type displays a characteristic change in Gibbs energy. Specifically, although carbon fixation pathways display a considerable structural variability, they are all energetically constrained by two types of reactions: carboxylation and carboxyl reduction. In fact, all adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules consumed by carbon fixation pathways \u2013 with a single exception \u2013 are used, directly or indirectly, to power one of these unfavorable reactions. When an indirect coupling is employed, the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to establish another chemical bond with high energy of hydrolysis, e.g. a thioester. This bond is cleaved by a downstream enzyme to energize an unfavorable reaction. Notably, many pathways exhibit reduced ATP requirement as they couple unfavorable carboxylation or carboxyl reduction reactions to exergonic reactions other than ATP hydrolysis. In the most extreme example, the reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway bypasses almost all ATP-consuming reactions. On the other hand, the reductive pentose phosphate pathway appears to be the least ATP-efficient because it is the only carbon fixation pathway that invests ATP in metabolic aims other than carboxylation and carboxyl reduction. Altogether, our analysis indicates that basic thermodynamic considerations accurately predict the resource investment required to support a metabolic pathway and further identifies biochemical mechanisms that can decrease this requirement.",

     "abstract": "Mechanistic studies on uncoupling proteins (UCPs) not only are important to identify their cellular function but also are pivotal to identify potential drug targets to manipulate mitochondrial energy transduction. So far, functional and comparative studies of uncoupling proteins in their native environment are hampered by different mitochondrial, cellular and genetic backgrounds. Artificial systems such as yeast ectopically expressing UCPs or liposomes with reconstituted UCPs were employed to address crucial mechanistic questions but these systems also produced inconsistencies with results from native mitochondria. We here introduce a novel mammalian cell culture system (Human Embryonic Kidney 293 \u2014 HEK293) to study UCP1 function. Stably transfected HEK293 cell lines were derived that contain mouse UCP1 at concentrations comparable to tissue mitochondria. In this cell-based test system UCP1 displays native functional behaviour as it can be activated with fatty acids (palmitate) and inhibited with purine nucleotides guanosine-diphosphate (GDP). The catalytic centre activity of the UCP1 homodimer in HEK293 is comparable to activities in brown adipose tissue supporting functionality of UCP1. Importantly, at higher protein levels than in yeast mitochondria, UCP1 in HEK293 cell mitochondria is fully inhibitable and does not contribute to basal proton conductance, thereby emphasizing the requirement of UCP1 activation for therapeutic purposes. These findings and resulting analysis on UCP1 characteristics demonstrate that the mammalian HEK293 cell system is suitable for mechanistic and comparative functional studies on UCPs and provides a non-confounding mitochondrial, cellular and genetic background.",

The OEC is buried within photosystem II (PSII), a multisubunit integral membrane protein complex, and water must find its way to the Mn4Ca cluster by moving through protein. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to determine the energetic barriers for water permeation though PSII extrinsic proteins. Potentials of mean force (PMFs) for water were derived by using the technique of multiple steered molecular dynamics (MSMD). Calculation of free energy profiles for water permeation allowed us to characterize previously identified water channels, and discover new pathways for water movement toward the Mn4Ca cluster. Our results identify the main constriction sites in these pathways which may serve as selectivity filters that restrict both the access of solutes detrimental to the water oxidation reaction and loss of Ca2\u00a0+ and Cl\u2212 from the active site.",

Cytosolic and mitochondrial l-LDHs were found to differ from one another in their saturation kinetics. Having shown that l-lactate itself can enter Hep G2 cells, we found that Hep G2-M swell in ammonium l-lactate, but not in ammonium pyruvate solutions, in a manner inhibited by mersalyl, this showing the occurrence of a carrier-mediated l-lactate transport in these mitochondria. Occurrence of the l-lactate/pyruvate shuttle and the appearance outside mitochondria of oxaloacetate, malate and citrate arising from l-lactate uptake and metabolism together with the low oxygen consumption and membrane potential generation are in favor of an anaplerotic role for l-LAC in Hep G2-M.",

     "abstract": "The decline in activity energy expenditure underlies a range of age-associated pathological conditions, neuromuscular and neurological impairments, disability, and mortality. The majority (90%) of the energy needs of the human body are met by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). OXPHOS is dependent on the coordinated expression and interaction of genes encoded in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. We examined the role of mitochondrial genomic variation in free-living activity energy expenditure (AEE) and physical activity levels (PAL) by sequencing the entire (~\u00a016.5 kilobases) mtDNA from 138 Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study participants. Among the common mtDNA variants, the hypervariable region 2 m.185G\u00a0>\u00a0A variant was significantly associated with AEE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and PAL (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Several unique nonsynonymous variants were identified in the extremes of AEE with some occurring at highly conserved sites predicted to affect protein structure and function. Of interest is the p.T194M, CytB substitution in the lower extreme of AEE occurring at a residue in the Qi site of complex III. Among participants with low activity levels, the burden of singleton variants was 30% higher across the entire mtDNA and OXPHOS complex I when compared to those having moderate to high activity levels. A significant pooled variant association across the hypervariable 2 region was observed for AEE and PAL. These results suggest that mtDNA variation is associated with free-living AEE in older persons and may generate new hypotheses by which specific mtDNA complexes, genes, and variants may contribute to the maintenance of activity levels in late life.",

     "abstract": "Studies of native arsenite oxidases from Ralstonia sp. S22 and Rhizobium sp. NT-26 raised two major questions. The first one concerns the mode of the enzyme's membrane-association. It has been suggested that a hypothetical not conserved protein could account for this variable association. Expression of the wild type arsenite oxidase in Escherichia coli allowed us to study the cellular localization of this enzyme in the absence of such a hypothetical partner. The results with the Ralstonia sp. S22 enzyme suggest that no additional protein is required for membrane association. The second question addresses the influence of the disulfide bridge in the small Rieske subunit, conspicuously absent in the Rhizobium sp. NT-26 enzyme, on the properties of the [2Fe\u20132S] center. The disulfide bridge is considered to be formed only after translocation of the enzyme to the periplasm. To address this question we thus first expressed the enzyme in the absence of its Twin-arginine translocation signal sequence. The spectral and redox properties of the cytoplasmic enzyme are unchanged compared to the periplasmic one. We finally studied a disulfide bridge mutant, Cys106Ala, devoid of the first Cys involved in the disulfide bridge formation. This mutation, proposed to have a strong effect on redox and catalytic properties of the Rieske protein in Rieske/cytb complexes, had no significant effect on properties of the Rieske protein from arsenite oxidase. Our present results demonstrate that the effects attributed to the disulfide bridge in the Rieske/cytb complexes are likely to be secondary effects due to conformational changes.",

An efficient system for water oxidation exists in the water oxidizing complex in cyanobacteria, algae and plants; further, recently published data on the Manganese\u2013calcium cluster have provided details on the mechanism and structure of the water oxidizing complex. Here, we have briefly reviewed the characteristics of the natural system from the standpoint of what we could learn from it to produce an efficient artificial system.

We demonstrated that the fused PsaJF subunit from the phage, substituted for the two separate subunits in Synechocystis, enabled the mutated PSI to accept electrons from additional electron donors such as respiratory cytochromes. In this way, a type of photorespiration was created in which the cell consumes organic material through respiratory processes and PSI serves as a terminal electron acceptor, substituting for cytochrome oxidase. We designed a hydrogen-producing bioreactor in which this type of photorespiration could utilize the organic material of the cell as an electron source for H2 production.

     "abstract": "Photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII) occurs when the rate of light-induced inactivation (photodamage) of PSII exceeds the rate of repair of the photodamaged PSII. For the quantitative analysis of the mechanism of photoinhibition of PSII, it is essential to monitor the rate of photodamage and the rate of repair separately and, also, to examine the respective effects of various perturbations on the two processes. This strategy has allowed the re-evaluation of the results of previous studies of photoinhibition and has provided insight into the roles of factors and mechanisms that protect PSII from photoinhibition, such as catalases and peroxidases, which are efficient scavengers of H2O2; \u03b1-tocopherol, which is an efficient scavenger of singlet oxygen; non-photochemical quenching, which dissipates excess light energy that has been absorbed by PSII; and the cyclic and non-cyclic transport of electrons. Early studies of photoinhibition suggested that all of these factors and mechanisms protect PSII against photodamage. However, re-evaluation by the strategy mentioned above has indicated that, rather than protecting PSII from photodamage, they stimulate protein synthesis, with resultant repair of PSII and mitigation of photoinhibition.

     "abstract": "In photosynthesis, cyanobacteria, algae and plants fix carbon dioxide (CO2) into carbohydrates; this is necessary to support life on Earth. Over 50\u00a0years ago, Otto Heinrich Warburg discovered a unique stimulatory role of CO2 in the Hill reaction (i.e., O2 evolution accompanied by reduction of an artificial electron acceptor), which, obviously, does not include any carbon fixation pathway; Warburg used this discovery to support his idea that O2 in photosynthesis originates in CO2. During the 1960s, a large number of researchers attempted to decipher this unique phenomenon, with limited success. In the 1970s, Alan Stemler, in Govindjee's lab, perfected methods to get highly reproducible results, and observed, among other things, that the turnover of Photosystem II (PSII) was stimulated by bicarbonate ions (hydrogen carbonate): the effect would be on the donor or the acceptor, or both sides of PSII. In 1975, Thomas Wydrzynski, also in Govindjee's lab, discovered that there was a definite bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor (the plastoquinone) side of PSII. The most recent 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of PSII, unequivocally shows HCO3\u2212 bound to the non-heme iron that sits in-between the bound primary quinone electron acceptor, QA, and the secondary quinone electron acceptor QB. In this review, we focus on the historical development of our understanding of this unique bicarbonate effect on the electron acceptor side of PSII, and its mechanism as obtained by biochemical, biophysical and molecular biological approaches in many laboratories around the World. We suggest an atomic level model in which HCO3\u2212/CO32\u00a0\u2212 plays a key role in the protonation of the reduced QB. In addition, we make comments on the role of bicarbonate on the donor side of PSII, as has been extensively studied in the labs of Alan Stemler (USA) and Vyacheslav Klimov (Russia). We end this review by discussing the uniqueness of bicarbonate's role in oxygenic photosynthesis and its role in the evolutionary development of O2-evolving PSII.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c550 (cyt c550) is a membrane component of the PSII complex in cyanobacteria and some eukaryotic algae, such as red and brown algae. Cyt c550 presents a bis-histidine heme coordination which is very unusual for monoheme c-type cytochromes. In PSII, the cyt c550 with the other extrinsic proteins stabilizes the binding of Cl\u2212 and Ca2\u00a0+ ions to the oxygen evolving complex and protects the Mn4Ca cluster from attack by bulk reductants. The role (if there is one) of the heme of the cyt c550 is unknown. The low midpoint redox potential (Em) of the purified soluble form (from \u2212\u00a0250 to \u2212\u00a0314\u00a0mV) is incompatible with a redox function in PSII. However, more positive values for the Em have been obtained for the cyt c550 bound to the PSII. A very recent work has shown an Em value of +\u00a0200\u00a0mV. These data open the possibility of a redox function for this protein in electron transfer in PSII. Despite the long distance (22\u00a0\u00c5) between cyt c550 and the nearest redox cofactor (Mn4Ca cluster), an electron transfer reaction between these components is possible. Some kind of protective cycle involving a soluble redox component in the lumen has also been proposed. The aim of this article is to review previous studies done on cyt c550 and to consider its function in the light of the new results obtained in recent years.

Comparison of these results with experimental data leads to the following conclusions: 1) The oxidation of tyrosine Yz by the cation radical P680+\u00a0\u00b7 in systems with an intact water oxidizing complex (WOC) is kinetically limited by the non-adiabatic electron transfer step and the extent of this reaction is thermodynamically determined by relaxation processes in the environment including rearrangements of hydrogen bond network(s). In marked contrast, all Yzox induced oxidation steps in the WOC up to redox state S3 are kinetically limited by trigger reactions which are slower by orders of magnitude than the rates calculated for non-adiabatic electron transfer. 3) The overall rate of the triggered reaction sequence of Yzox reduction by the WOC in redox state S3 eventually leading to formation and release of O2 is kinetically limited by an uphill electron transfer step. Alternative models are discussed for this reaction. The protein matrix of the WOC and bound water molecules provide an optimized dynamic landscape of hydrogen bonded protons for catalyzing oxidative water splitting energetically driven by light induced formation of the cation radical P680+\u00a0\u00b7. In this way the PS II core acts as a molecular machine formed during a long evolutionary process.

     "abstract": "Oxidation of water molecules in the photosystem II (PSII) protein complex proceeds at the manganese\u2013calcium complex, which is buried deeply in the lumenal part of PSII. Understanding the PSII function requires knowledge of the intricate coupling between the water-oxidation chemistry and the dynamic proton management by the PSII protein matrix. Here we assess the structural basis for long-distance proton transfer in the interior of PSII and for proton management at its surface. Using the recent high-resolution crystal structure of PSII, we investigate prominent hydrogen-bonded networks of the lumenal side of PSII. This analysis leads to the identification of clusters of polar groups and hydrogen-bonded networks consisting of amino acid residues and water molecules. We suggest that long-distance proton transfer and conformational coupling is facilitated by hydrogen-bonded networks that often involve more than one protein subunit. Proton-storing Asp/Glu dyads, such as the D1-E65/D2-E312 dyad connected to a complex water-wire network, may be particularly important for coupling protonation states to the protein conformation. Clusters of carboxylic amino acids could participate in proton management at the lumenal surface of PSII. We propose that rather than having a classical hydrophobic protein interior, the lumenal side of PSII resembles a complex polyelectrolyte with evolutionary optimized hydrogen-bonding networks.

     "abstract": "The Mn complex of photosystem II (PSII) cycles through 4 semi-stable states (S0 to S3). Laser-flash excitation of PSII in the S2 or S3 state induces processes with time constants around 350\u00a0ns, which have been assigned previously to energetic relaxation of the oxidized tyrosine (YZox). Herein we report monitoring of these processes in the time domain of hundreds of nanoseconds by photoacoustic (or \u2018optoacoustic\u2019) experiments involving pressure-wave detection after excitation of PSII membrane particles by ns-laser flashes. We find that specifically for excitation of PSII in the S2 state, nuclear rearrangements are induced which amount to a contraction of PSII by at least 30\u00a0\u00c53 (time constant of 350\u00a0ns at 25\u00a0\u00b0C; activation energy of 285\u00a0+/\u2212\u00a050\u00a0meV). In the S3 state, the 350-ns-contraction is about 5 times smaller whereas in S0 and S1, no volume changes are detectable in this time domain.

The first step after YZox formation involves a fast nuclear rearrangement of the Mn complex and its protein\u2013water environment (~\u00a0350\u00a0ns), which may serve a dual role: (1) The Mn\u2010 complex entity is prepared for the subsequent proton removal and electron transfer by formation of an intermediate state of specific (but still unknown) atomic structure. (2) Formation of the structural intermediate is associated (necessarily) with energetic relaxation and thus stabilization of YZox so that energy losses by charge recombination with the QA\u2212 anion radical are minimized. The intermediate formed within about 350\u00a0ns after YZox formation in the S2-state is discussed in the context of two recent models of the S2\u00a0=\u00a0>\u00a0S3 transition of the water oxidation cycle.

     "abstract": "In this study we employ isotope ratio membrane-inlet mass spectrometry to probe the turnover efficiency of photosystem II (PSII) membrane fragments isolated from spinach at flash frequencies between 1\u00a0Hz and 50\u00a0Hz in the presence of the commonly used exogenous electron acceptors potassium ferricyanide(III) (FeCy), 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (DCBQ), and 2-phenyl-p-benzoquinone (PPBQ). The data obtained clearly indicate that among the tested acceptors PPBQ is the best at high flash frequencies. If present at high enough concentration, the PSII turnover efficiency is unaffected by flash frequency of up to 30\u00a0Hz, and at 40\u00a0Hz and 50\u00a0Hz only a slight decrease by about 5\u20137% is observed. In contrast, drastic reductions of the O2 yields by about 40% and 65% were found at 50\u00a0Hz for DCBQ and FeCy, respectively. Comparison with literature data reveals that PPBQ accepts electrons from QA\u2212 in PSII membrane fragments with similar efficiency as plastoquinone in intact cells. Our data also confirm that at high flashing rates O2 evolution is limited by the reactions on the electron-acceptor side of PSII. The relevance of these data to the evolutionary development of the water-splitting complex in PSII and with regard to the potential of artificial water-splitting catalysts is discussed.

     "abstract": "Vibrational and conformational protein dynamics of photosystem II (PS II) membrane fragments from spinach were investigated by elastic and inelastic incoherent neutron scattering (EINS and IINS). As to the EINS experiments, the average atomic mean square displacement values of PS II membrane fragments hydrated at a relative humidity of 57% exhibit a dynamical transition at ~\u00a0230\u00a0K. In contrast, the dynamical transition was absent at a relative humidity of 44%. These findings are in agreement with previous studies which reported a \u201cfreezing\u201d of protein mobility due to dehydration (Pieper et al. (2008) Eur. Biophys. J. 37: 657\u2013663) and its correlation with an inhibition of electron transfer from QA\u2212 to QB (Kaminskaya et al. (2003) Biochemistry 42, 8119\u20138132). IINS spectra of a sample hydrated at a relative humidity of 57% show a distinct Boson peak at ~\u00a07.5\u00a0meV at 20\u00a0K, which shifts towards lower energy values upon temperature increase to 250\u00a0K. This unexpected effect is interpreted in terms of a \u201csoftening\u201d of the protein matrix along with the onset of conformational protein dynamics as revealed by the EINS experiments. Information on the density of vibrational states of pigment\u2013protein complexes is important for a realistic calculation of excitation energy transfer kinetics and spectral lineshapes and is often routinely obtained by optical line-narrowing spectroscopy at liquid helium temperature. The data presented here demonstrate that IINS is a valuable experimental tool in determining the density of vibrational states not only at cryogenic, but also at nearly physiological temperatures up to 250\u00a0K.

A broad peak at ~\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00c5\u2212\u00a01 is ascribed to diffraction from domains of ordered, unappressed stroma lamellae, revealing a repeat distance of 294\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0\u00c5 in spinach and 345\u00a0\u00c5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011\u00a0\u00c5 in pea. The peak position and hence the repeat distance of stroma lamellae is strongly dependent on the osmolarity and the ionic strength of the suspension medium, as demonstrated by varying the sorbitol and the Mg++-concentration in the sample. For pea thylakoid membranes, we show that the repeat distance decreases when illuminating the sample with white light, in accordance with our earlier results on spinach, also regarding the observation that addition of an uncoupler prohibits the light-induced structural changes, a strong indication that these changes are driven by the transmembrane proton gradient. We show that the magnitude of the shrinkage is strongly dependent on light intensity and that the repeat distance characteristic of the dark state after illumination is different from the initial dark state. Prolonged strong illumination leads to irreversible changes and swelling as reflected in increased repeat distances. The observed reorganizations are discussed within the frames of the current structural models of the granum-stroma thylakoid membrane assembly and the regulatory mechanisms in response to variations in the environmental conditions in vivo.

Compounds were optimized by semi-empirical PM3 and DFT/B3LYP/6-31G methods. The Heuristic and the Best Multi-Linear Regression (BMLR) method in CODESSA were used to select the most appropriate molecular descriptors and to develop a linear QSAR model between experimental pI50 values and the most significant set of the descriptors. The obtained models were validated by cross-validation (R2cv) and internal validation to confirm the stability and good predictive ability. The obtained eight models with five-parameter show that: (a) coefficient (R2) value of the chloroplast samples are slightly higher than that of the DT-20 samples both of Heuristic and BMLR models; (b) the coefficients of the BMLR models are slightly higher than that of Heuristic models both of chloroplasts and DT-20 samples; (c) The YZ shadow parameter and the indicator parameter, for presence of NO2 substituent in the ring, are the most important descriptor at PM3-based and DFT-based QSAR models, respectively.

     "abstract": "In dark-adapted plants and algae, chlorophyll a fluorescence induction peaks within 1\u00a0s after irradiation due to well documented photochemical and non-photochemical processes. Here we show that the much slower fluorescence rise in cyanobacteria (the so-called \u201cS to M rise\u201d in tens of seconds) is due to state 2 to state 1 transition. This has been demonstrated in particular for Synechocystis PCC6803, using its RpaC\u2212 mutant (locked in state 1) and its wild-type cells kept in hyperosmotic suspension (locked in state 2). In both cases, the inhibition of state changes correlates with the disappearance of the S to M fluorescence rise, confirming its assignment to the state 2 to state 1 transition. The general physiological relevance of the SM rise is supported by its occurrence in several cyanobacterial strains: Synechococcus (PCC 7942, WH 5701) and diazotrophic single cell cyanobacterium (Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142). We also show here that the SM fluorescence rise, and also the state transition changes are less prominent in filamentous diazotrophic cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. (PCC 7120) and absent in phycobilisome-less cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus PCC 9511. Surprisingly, it is also absent in the phycobiliprotein rod containing Acaryochloris marina (MBIC 11017). All these results show that the S to M fluorescence rise reflects state 2 to state 1 transition in cyanobacteria with phycobilisomes formed by rods and core parts. We show that the pronounced SM fluorescence rise may reflect a protective mechanism for excess energy dissipation in those cyanobacteria (e.g. in Synechococcus PCC 7942) that are less efficient in other protective mechanisms, such as blue light induced non-photochemical quenching.

In addition, the effect of CO2 concentration on fatty acid composition of photosynthetic membranes was examined in wild-type cells and in the cia3 mutant. In the cia3 mutant, the rate of growth was lower as compared to wild-type, especially in the cells grown at 0.03% CO2. This might indicate a participation of thylakoid Cah3 in the CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) of chloroplast and reflect the dysfunction of the CCM in the cia3 mutant. In both strains, a decrease in the CO2 concentration from 2% to 0.03% caused an increase in the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane lipids. At the same time, in the cia3 mutant, the increase in the majority of polyunsaturated fatty acids was less pronounced as compared to wild-type cells, whereas the amount of 16:4\u03c93 did not increase at all. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that luminal Cah3 is mostly located in the thylakoid membranes that pass through the pyrenoid. In the cells of CCM-mutant, cia3, the Cah3 protein was much less abundant, and it was evenly distributed throughout the pyrenoid matrix. The results support our hypothesis that CO2 might be generated from HCO3\u2212 by Cah3 in the thylakoid lumen with the following CO2 diffusion into the pyrenoid, where the CO2 fixing Rubisco is located. This ensures the maintenance of active photosynthesis under CO2-limiting conditions, and, as a result, the active growth of cells. The relationships between the induction of CCM and restructuring of the photosynthetic membranes, as well as the involvement of the Cah3 of the pyrenoid in these events, are discussed.

     "abstract": "Terrestrial cyanobacteria have various desiccation-tolerant systems, which are controlled by desiccation tolerance-related genes. Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. strain PCC 7120 is a derivative of the terrestrial cyanobacterium Nostoc and is a useful strain for molecular biological analysis. To identify desiccation tolerance-related genes, we selected and disrupted various genes (all0801, all0875, alr3090, alr3800, all4052, all4477, and alr5182) and examined their gene expression patterns and predicted their functions. Analyses of gene disruptants showed that viability of the disruptants only decreased under N2-fixing conditions during desiccation, and the decrease in viability was negatively correlated with the gene expression pattern during desiccation. These data suggest that terrestrial cyanobacteria may acclimate to desiccation stress via N2 fixation by using desiccation inducible genes, which are not only related to nitrogen fixation or nitrogen metabolism but also to other systems such as metabolism, transcription, and protein repair for protection against desiccation damage under nitrogen-fixing conditions. Further, a photosynthetic gene is required for desiccation tolerance. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosynthesis Research for Sustainability: from Natural to Artificial.",

We used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes that were upregulated by acid stress in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Several of these genes may be response regulators that are directly involved in this type of stress response. We constructed deletion mutants for the response regulator genes and compared the growth rates of cells transfected with mutant and wild-type genes in a low pH medium. Of these mutants, deletion of sphR affected the growth rate under acid stress (pH 6.0) conditions. We examined genome-wide expression in \u0394sphR mutant cells using DNA microarray to determine whether SphR was involved in the regulation of other acid stress responsive genes. Microarray and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses of wild-type cells showed that the expression of phoA, pstS1, and pstS2, which are upregulated under phosphate-limiting conditions, increased (2.48-, 1.88-, and 5.07-fold, respectively) after acid stress treatment for 0.5\u00a0h. In contrast, pstS2 expression did not increase in the \u0394sphR mutant cells after acid stress, whereas the phoA and sphX mRNA levels increased. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and northern blot analysis indicated that downregulation of the acid-responsive genes slr0967 and sll0939 occurred with the deletion of sphR. Indeed, mutants of these genes were more sensitive to acid stress than the wild-type cells. Thus, induction of Slr0967 and Sll0939 by SphR may be essential for growth under acid stress conditions.

Despite comparable iron stress induced phenotypic changes, the inactivation of petE gene expression was accompanied with a significant reduction of the growth rates compared to WT cells. To examine the photosynthetic electron fluxes in vivo, far-red light induced P700 redox state transients at 820\u00a0nm of WT and \u0394petE mutant cells grown under iron sufficient and iron deficient conditions were compared. The extent of the absorbance change (\u0394A820/A820) used for quantitative estimation of photooxidizable P700+ indicated a 2-fold lower level of P700+ in \u0394petE compared to WT cells under control conditions. This was accompanied by a 2-fold slower re-reduction rate of P700+ in the \u0394petE indicating a lower capacity for cyclic electron flow around PSI in the cells lacking plastocyanin. Thermoluminescence (TL) measurements did not reveal significant differences in PSII photochemistry between control WT and \u0394petE cells. However, exposure to iron stress induced a 4.5 times lower level of P700+, 2-fold faster re-reduction rate of P700+ and a temperature shift of the TL peak corresponding to S2/S3QB\u2212 charge recombination in WT cells. In contrast, the iron-stressed \u0394petE mutant exhibited only a 40% decrease of P700+ and no significant temperature shift in S2/S3QB\u2212 charge recombination.

Furthermore, studies on A. marina may provide insights into understanding how the oxygenic photosynthetic organisms adapt after the acquisition of new Chl. To solve the reaction mechanism of its unique photosynthesis, photosystem (PS) II complexes were isolated from A. marina and analyzed. However, the lack of a molecular genetic method for A. marina prevented us from conducting further studies. We recently developed a transformation system for A. marina and we introduced a chlorophyllide a oxygenase gene into A. marina. The resultant transformant accumulated [7-formyl]-Chl d, which has never been found in nature. In the current study, we isolated PS II complexes that contained [7-formyl]-Chl d.

The steady-state fluorescence and excitation spectra of the PS II complexes revealed that energy transfer occurred from [7-formyl]-Chl d to the major Chl d species; however, the electron transfer was not affected by the presence of [7-formyl]-Chl d. These findings demonstrate that artificially produced [7-formyl]-Chl d molecules that are incorporated into PS II replace part of the Chl d molecules and function as the antenna.

     "abstract": "Both chlorophyll f and chlorophyll d are red-shifted chlorophylls in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, which extend photon absorbance into the near infrared region. This expands the range of light that can be used to drive photosynthesis. Quantitative determination of chlorophylls is a crucial step in the investigation of chlorophyll-photosynthetic reactions in the field of photobiology and photochemistry. No methods have yet been worked out for the quantitative determination of chlorophyll f. There is also no method available for the precise quantitative determination of chlorophyll d although it was discovered in 1943. In order to obtain the extinction coefficients (\u03b5) of chlorophyll f and chlorophyll d, the concentrations of chlorophylls were determined by Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry according to the fact that each chlorophyll molecule contains one magnesium (Mg) atom.

     "abstract": "Leaves of tobacco plants grown in short days (8\u00a0h light) generate more reactive oxygen species in the light than leaves of plants grown in long days (16\u00a0h light). A two fold higher level of superoxide production was observed even in isolated thylakoids from short day plants. By using specific inhibitors of photosystem II and of the cytochrome b6f complex, the site of O2 reduction could be assigned to photosystem I. The higher rate of O2 reduction led to the formation of a higher proton gradient in thylakoids from short day plants. In the presence of an uncoupler, the differences in O2 reduction between thylakoids from short day and long day plants were abolished. The pigment content and the protein content of the major protein complexes of the photosynthetic electron transport chain were unaffected by the growth condition. Addition of NADPH, but not of NADH, to coupled thylakoids from long day plants raised the level of superoxide production to the same level as observed in thylakoids from short day plants. The hypothesis is put forward that the binding of an unknown protein permits the higher rate of pseudocyclic electron flow in thylakoids from short-day grown plants and that this putative protein plays an important role in changing the proportions of linear, cyclic and pseudocyclic electron transport in favour of pseudocyclic electron transport.

Accumulation of the radical products of the above reactions has been followed using electron paramagnetic resonance. It is found that the increased production of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide in higher light is due to the enhanced production of these species within the thylakoid membrane, rather than outside the membrane. Fluorescent probe Amplex red, which forms fluorescent product, resorufin, in the reaction with hydrogen peroxide, has been used to detect hydrogen peroxide outside isolated chloroplasts using confocal microscopy. Resorufin fluorescence outside the chloroplasts is found to be suppressed by 60% in the presence of the inhibitor of aquaporins, acetazolamide (AZA), indicating that hydrogen peroxide can diffuse through the chloroplast envelope aquaporins. It is demonstrated that AZA also inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity of the isolated envelope.

When the cells are cultivated under high light conditions the following results were found: (i) The O2 evolution activity decreases faster in WT*1 cells than in WT*3 cells both in the absence and in the presence of lincomycin, a protein synthesis inhibitor; (ii) In WT*1 cells, the rate constant for the decrease of the O2 evolution activity is comparable in the presence and in the absence of lincomycin; (iii) The D1 content revealed by western blot analysis decays similarly in both WT*1 and WT*3 cells and much slowly than O2 evolution; (iv) The faster decrease in O2 evolution in WT*1 than in WT*3 cells correlates with a much faster inhibition of the S2-state formation; (v) The shape of the WT*1 cells is altered. All these results are in agreement with a photo-inhibition process resulting in the loss of the O2 activity much faster than the D1 turnover in PsbA1-PSII and likely to a greater production of reactive oxygen species under high light conditions in WT*1 than in WT*3. This latter result is discussed in view of the known effects of the PsbA1 to PsbA3 substitution on the redox properties of the Photosystem II cofactors. The observation that under low light conditions WT*3 cells are able to express the psbA3 gene, whereas under similar conditions wild type cells are expressing mainly the psbA1 gene is also discussed.

Some of these proteins, such as Psb27 and Psb28, are involved in cofactor assembly for which they are only transiently bound to the preassembled complex. In this work we isolated and analyzed PSII from a \u0394psbJ mutant of the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. From the four different PSII complexes that could be separated the most prominent one revealed a monomeric Psb27\u2013Psb28 PSII complex with greatly diminished oxygen-evolving activity.

     "abstract": "PsbP and PsbQ proteins are extrinsic subunits of photosystem II (PSII) and optimize the oxygen evolution reaction by regulating the binding properties of the essential cofactors Ca2\u00a0+ and Cl\u2212. PsbP induces conformational changes around the catalytic Mn cluster required for Ca2\u00a0+ and Cl\u2212 retention, and the N-terminal region of PsbP is essential for this reaction. It was reported that PsbQ partially restores the functional defect of N-terminal truncated PsbP [Ifuku and Sato (2002) Plant Cell Physiol. 43, 1244\u20131249]; however, the mechanism of this restoration is yet to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that PsbQ is able to restore the functional binding of mutated PsbPs. In the presence of PsbQ, \u220615-PsbP, a truncated PsbP lacking 15 N-terminal residues, was able to specifically bind to NaCl-washed spinach PSII membranes and significantly restore the oxygen evolving activity. Furthermore, PsbQ was also able to compensate for the impaired ion-retention of H144A-PsbP, in which a conserved histidine at position 144 in the C-terminal domain was substituted with an alanine. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy showed that PsbQ restored the ability of \u220615- and H144A-PsbP to induce proper conformational changes during S1 to S2 transition. These data suggest that the major function of PsbQ is to stabilize PsbP binding, thereby contributing to the maintenance of the catalytic Mn cluster of the water oxidation machinery in higher plant PSII.

The expression of cold-induced genes, which are controlled by the cold sensor histidine kinase Hik33, depends on the fluidity of cell membranes and it is regulated by light, though it does not require the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus. The expression of cold-induced genes, which are not controlled by Hik33, does not depend on the membrane fluidity or light. Thus, membrane fluidity determines the temperature dependence of the expression of cold-induced genes that are under control of the Hik33, which might be the sensor of changes in the membrane fluidity.

Numerous ABC transporter-related genes have been found in the Synechocystis sp.

To identify ABC transporters involved in acid tolerance, deletion mutants of ABC transporter genes with unknown substrates were screened for acid stress sensitivities in low pH medium. It was found that cells expressing the deletion mutant of slr1045 were more sensitive to acid stress than the wild-type cells. Moreover, slr1045 expression in the wild-type cells was increased under acid stress. These results indicate that slr1045 is an essential gene for survival under acid stress. The mutant displayed high osmotic stress resistance and high/low temperature stress sensitivity. Considering the temperature-sensitive phenotype and homology to the organic solvent-resistant ABC system, we subsequently compared the lipid profiles of slr1045 mutant and wild-type cells by thin-layer chromatography. In acid stress conditions, the phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content in the slr1045 mutant cells was approximately 40% of that in the wild-type cells. Moreover, the addition of PG to the medium compensated for the growth deficiency of the slr1045 mutant cells under acid stress conditions.

Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) is known to dissipate excessive absorbed light energy as heat to protect plants against photodamage. The main component of NPQ is dependent of the transthylakoid pH gradient and is modulated by zeaxanthin (Zx) synthesis. These processes together with chlorophyll fluorescence induction were used to characterize the response of the genotypes. The mutants were more sensitive to photoinhibition to a small extent but this was more severe for dgd1-3 especially at high light intensity. It was deduced that DGDG was not a main factor to influence photoinhibition but other lipid components could affect PSII sensitivity towards photoinhibition in relation to the physical properties of the thylakoid membrane.

Surprisingly, all plants of transgenic lines exhibited much higher susceptibility to photoinhibition of PSI than wild-type plants. This was accompanied by a 2.5-fold faster re-reduction rate of P700+ in the dark, indicating a higher capacity for cyclic electron flow around PSI in high light treated transgenic leaves. This was associated with a much higher intersystem electron pool size suggesting over-reduction of the PQ pool in tobacco transgenic lines with altered PG unsaturation compared to wild-type plants.

Complex analysis of chloroplast biogenesis was performed on the structural and functional level of its organization during the photoperiodic plant growth after initial growth of seedlings in the darkness. We correlated, at the same time intervals, the structure of etioplasts transforming into mature chloroplasts with the changes in the photosynthetic protein levels (selected core and antenna proteins of PSI and PSII) and with the function of the photosynthetic apparatus in two plant species: bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L). We selected these plant species since we demonstrated previously that the mature chloroplasts differ in the thylakoid organization. We showed that the protein biosynthesis as well as photosynthetic complexes formation proceeds gradually in both plants in spite of periods of darkness. We found that both steady structural differentiation of the bean chloroplast and reformation of prolamellar bodies in pea were accompanied by a gradual increase of the photochemical activity in both species.

     "abstract": "By using low temperature fluorescence spectroscopy, it has been shown that exposing chloroplast thylakoid membranes to acidic pH reversibly decreases the fluorescence of photosystem II while the fluorescence of photosystem I increases [P. Singh-Rawal et al. (2010) Evidence that pH can drive state transitions in isolated thylakoid membranes from spinach, Photochem Photobiol Sci, 9 830\u2013837]. In order to shed light on the origin of these changes, we performed circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy on freshly isolated pea thylakoid membranes. We show that the magnitude of the psi-type CD, which is associated with the presence of chirally ordered macroarrays of the chromophores in intact thylakoid membranes, decreases gradually and reversibly upon gradually lowering the pH of the medium from 7.5 to 4.5 (psi, polymer or salt induced). The same treatment, as shown on thylakoid membranes washed in hypotonic low salt medium possessing no psi-type bands, induces no discernible change in the excitonic CD. These data show that while no change in the pigment\u2013pigment interactions and thus in the molecular organization of the bulk protein complexes can be held responsible for the observed changes in the fluorescence, acidification of the medium significantly alters the macro-organization of the complexes, hence providing an explanation for the pH-induced redistribution of the excitation energy between the two photosystems.

Absorbance increase in the 1060\u20131130\u00a0nm region that is presumably attributed to PA\u03b4+ cation radical molecule as a part of mixed state with a charge transfer character P*(PA\u03b4+PB\u03b4\u2212) was found. This state appears at 120\u2013180\u00a0fs time delay in the wild type RC and even faster in H(L173)L and H(M202)L heterodimer mutants and precedes electron transfer (ET) to BA bacteriochlorophyll with absorption band at 1020\u00a0nm in WT. The formation of the PA\u03b4+BA\u03b4\u2212 state is a result of the electron transfer from P*(PA\u03b4+PB\u03b4\u2212) to the primary electron acceptor BA (still mixed with P*) with the apparent time delay of ~\u00a01.1\u00a0ps. Next step of ET is accompanied by the 3-ps appearance of bacteriopheophytin a\u2212 (HA\u2212) band at 960\u00a0nm. The study of the wave packet formation upon 20-fs illumination has shown that the vibration energy of the wave packet promotes reversible overcoming of an energy barrier between two potential energy surfaces P* and P*(PA\u03b4+BA\u03b4\u2212) at ~\u00a0500\u00a0fs.

     "abstract": "Transient absorption changes induced by excitation of isolated reaction centers (RCs) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides with 600\u00a0nm laser pulses of 20\u00a0fs (full width at half maximum) were monitored in the wavelength region of 420\u2013560\u00a0nm. The spectral features of the spectrum obtained are characteristic for an electrochromic band shift of the single carotenoid (Car) molecule spheroidene, which is an integral constituent of these RCs. This effect is assigned to an electrochromic bandshift of Car due to the local electric field of the dipole moment formed by electronic excitation of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecule(s) in the neighborhood of Car. Based on the known distances between the pigments, the monomeric BChl (BB) in the inactive B-branch is inferred to dominate this effect. The excitation of BB at 600\u00a0nm leads to a transition into the S2 state (Qx band), which is followed by rapid internal conversion to the S1 state (Qy band), thus leading to a change of strength and orientation of the dipole moment, i.e., of the electric field acting on the Car molecule. Therefore, the time course of the electrochromic bandshift reflects the rate of the internal conversion from S2 to S1 of BB. The evaluation of the kinetics leads to a value of 30\u00a0fs for this relaxation process.

     "abstract": "To explore the influence of the I(L177)H single mutation on the properties of the nearest bacteriochlorophylls (BChls), three reaction centers (RCs) bearing double mutations were constructed in the photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, and their properties and pigment content were compared with those of the correspondent single mutant RCs. Each pair of the mutations comprised the amino acid substitution I(L177)H and another mutation altering histidine ligand of BChl PA or BChl BB. Contrary to expectations, the double mutation I(L177)H\u00a0+\u00a0H(L173)L does not bring about a heterodimer RC but causes a 46\u00a0nm blue shift of the long-wavelength P absorbance band. The histidine L177 or a water molecule were suggested as putative ligands for PA in the RC I(L177)H\u00a0+\u00a0H(L173)L although this would imply a reorientation of the His backbone and additional rearrangements in the primary donor environment or even a repositioning of the BChl dimer. The crystal structure of the mutant I(L177)H reaction center determined to a resolution of 2.9\u00a0\u00c5 shows changes at the interface region between the BChl PA and the monomeric BChl BB. Spectral and pigment analysis provided evidence for \u03b2-coordination of the BChl BB in the double mutant RC I(L177)H\u00a0+\u00a0H(M182)L and for its hexacoordination in the mutant reaction center I(L177)H. Computer modeling suggests involvement of two water molecules in the \u03b2-coordination of the BChl BB.

     "abstract": "In cyanobacteria, strong blue-green light induces a photoprotective mechanism involving an increase of energy thermal dissipation at the level of phycobilisome (PB), the cyanobacterial antenna. This leads to a decrease of the energy arriving to the reaction centers. The photoactive Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) has an essential role in this mechanism. The binding of the red photoactivated OCP to the core of the PB triggers energy and PB fluorescence quenching. The core of PBs is constituted of allophycocyanin trimers emitting at 660 or 680\u00a0nm. ApcD, ApcF and ApcE are the responsible of the 680\u00a0nm emission. In this work, the role of these terminal emitters in the photoprotective mechanism was studied. Single and double Synechocystis PCC 6803 mutants, in which the apcD or/and apcF genes were absent, were constructed. The Cys190 of ApcE which binds the phycocyanobilin was replaced by a Ser. The mutated ApcE attached an unusual chromophore emitting at 710\u00a0nm. The activated OCP was able to induce the photoprotective mechanism in all the mutants. Moreover, in vitro reconstitution experiments showed similar amplitude and rates of fluorescence quenching. Our results demonstrated that ApcD, ApcF and ApcE are not required for the OCP-related fluorescence quenching and they strongly suggested that the site of quenching is one of the APC trimers emitting at 660\u00a0nm.

     "abstract": "In cyanobacteria, the thermal dissipation of excess absorbed energy at the level of the phycobilisome (PBS)-antenna is triggered by absorption of strong blue-green light by the photoactive orange carotenoid protein (OCP). This process known as non-photochemical quenching, whose molecular mechanism remains in many respects unclear, is revealed in vivo as a decrease in phycobilisome fluorescence. In vitro reconstituted system on the interaction of the OCP and the PBS isolated from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 presents evidence that the OCP is not only a photosensor, but also an effecter that makes direct contacts with the PBS and causes dissipation of absorbed energy. To localize the site(s) of quenching, we have analyzed the role of chromophorylated polypeptides of the PBS using PBS-deficient mutants in conjunction with in vitro systems of assembled PBS and of isolated components of the PBS core. The results demonstrated that LCM, the core-membrane linker protein and terminal emitter of the PBS, could act as the docking site for OCP in vitro. The ApcD and ApcF terminal emitters of the PBS core are not directly subjected to quenching. The data suggests that there could be close contact between the phycocyanobilin chromophore of LCM and the 3\u2032-hydroxyechinenone chromophore present in OCP and that LCM could be involved in OCP-induced quenching. According to the reduced average life-time of the PBS-fluorescence and linear dependence of fluorescence intensity of the PBS on OCP concentration, the quenching has mostly dynamic character.

     "abstract": "Linear optical spectra of solubilized trimers and small lamellar aggregates of the major light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) of higher plants are simulated employing excitonic couplings and site energies of chlorophylls (Chls) computed on the basis of the two crystal structures by a combined quantum chemical/electrostatic approach. A good agreement between simulation and experiment is achieved (except for the circular dichroism in the Chl b region), if vibronic transitions of Chls are taken into account. Site energies are further optimized by refinement fits of optical spectra. The differences between refined and directly calculated values are not significant enough to decide, whether the crystal structures are closer to trimers or aggregates. Changes in the linear dichroism spectrum upon aggregation are related to site energy shifts of Chls b601, b607, a603, a610, and a613, and are interpreted in terms of conformational changes of violaxanthin and the two luteins involving their ionone rings. Chl a610 is the energy sink at 77\u00a0K in both conformations. An analysis of absorption spectra of trimers perpendicular and parallel to the C3-axis (van Amerongen et al. Biophys. J. 67 (1994) 837\u2013847) shows that only Chl a604 close to neoxanthin is significantly reoriented in trimers compared to the crystal structures. Whether this pigment is orientated in aggregates as in the crystal structures, can presently not be determined faithfully. To finally decide about pigment reorientations that could be of relevance for non-photochemical quenching, further polarized absorption and fluorescence measurements of aggregates or detergent-depleted LHCII would be helpful.

Excitation energy transfer (EET) from QDs to PBP rods was found to take place with varying and highly temperature-dependent efficiencies of up to 90%. Experiments performed at room temperature on hybrid systems with different QDs show that no straightforward correlation exists between the efficiency of EET and the parameter J\u00a0/\u00a0(R126) given by the theory of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), where J is the overlap integral of the normalized QD emission and PBP absorption and R12 the distance between the transition dipole moments of donor and acceptor. The results show that the hybrid systems cannot be described as randomly orientated aggregates consisting of QDs and photosynthetic pigment\u2013protein complexes. Specific structural parameters are inferred to play an essential role. The mode of binding and coupling seems to change with the size of QDs and with temperature. Efficient EET and fluorescence enhancement of the acceptor was observed at particular stoichiometric ratios between QDs and trimeric phycoerythrin (PE). At higher concentrations of PE, a quenching of its fluorescence is observed in the presence of QDs. This effect is explained by the existence of additional quenching channels in aggregates formed within hybrid systems.

Versatile investigations of the properties of membrane-embedded and detergent-isolated proteins are, therefore, required to evaluate the consequences of the solubilization procedure. Herein, the spectroscopic and kinetic fingerprints have been established that distinguish excitons in individual detergent-solubilized LH2 light-harvesting pigment\u2013protein complexes from them in the membrane-embedded complexes of purple photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides. A wide arsenal of spectroscopic techniques in visible optical range that include conventional broadband absorption\u2013fluorescence, fluorescence anisotropy excitation, spectrally selective hole burning and fluorescence line-narrowing, and transient absorption\u2013fluorescence have been applied over broad temperature range between physiological and liquid He temperatures.

It was found that F760, which is the PSI red-chlorophyll characteristic of A. platensis, contributes to slower energy-transfer phase in the PSI of A. platensis. Excitation energy transfers in phycobilisome and those from PSII to PSI were modified depending on the light quality. Existence of quencher was suggested in PSI of the blue-light grown cells. Phycobilisomes in the green-light grown cells and the far-red-light grown cells transferred excitation energy from phycobilisome to chlorophyll without loss of energy. In these cells, excitation energy was shared between two photosystems. Fast energy transfer was established in phycobilisome under the yellow-light condition where only the phycobilisome can absorb the cultivation light.

     "abstract": "Water deficit is one of the most important environmental factors limiting sustainable crop yields and it requires a reliable tool for fast and precise quantification. In this work we use simultaneously recorded signals of photoinduced prompt fluorescence (PF) and delayed fluorescence (DF) as well as modulated reflection (MR) of light at 820\u00a0nm for analysis of the changes in the photosynthetic activity in detached bean leaves during drying. Depending on the severity of the water deficit we identify different changes in the primary photosynthetic processes. When the relative water content (RWC) is decreased to 60% there is a parallel decrease in the ratio between the rate of excitation trapping in the Photosystem (PS) II reaction center and the rate of reoxidation of reduced PSII acceptors. A further decrease of RWC to 20% suppresses the electron transfer from the reduced plastoquinone pool to the PSI reaction center. At RWC below values 15%, the reoxidation of the photoreduced primary quinone acceptor of PSII, QA\u2013, is inhibited and at less than 5%, the primary photochemical reactions in PSI and II are inactivated. Using the collected sets of PF, DF and MR signals, we construct and train an artificial neural network, capable of recognizing the RWC in a series of \u201cunknown\u201d samples with a correlation between calculated and gravimetrically determined RWC values of about R2\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.98.

     "abstract": "Mild non-ionic detergents are indispensable in the isolation of intact integral membrane proteins and protein-complexes from biological membranes. Dodecylmaltoside (DM) belongs to this class of detergents being a glucoside-based surfactant with a bulky hydrophilic head group composed of two sugar rings and a non-charged alkyl glycoside chain. Two isomers of this molecule exist, differing only in the configuration of the alkyl chain around the anomeric center of the carbohydrate head group, axial in \u03b1-DM and equatorial in \u03b2-DM. In this paper, we have investigated the solubilizing properties of \u03b1-DM and \u03b2-DM on the isolation of photosynthetic complexes from pea thylakoids membranes maintaining their native architecture of stacked grana and stroma lamellae. Exposure of these stacked thylakoids to a single step treatment with increasing concentrations (5\u2013100\u00a0mM) of \u03b1-DM or \u03b2-DM resulted in a quick partial or complete solubilization of the membranes. Regardless of the isomeric form used: 1) at the lowest DM concentrations only a partial solubilization of thylakoids was achieved, giving rise to the release of mainly small protein complexes mixed with membrane fragments enriched in PSI from stroma lamellae; 2) at concentrations above 30\u00a0mM a complete solubilization occurred with the further release of high molecular weight protein complexes identified as dimeric PSII, PSI-LHCI and PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes. However, at concentrations of detergent which fully solubilized the thylakoids, the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isomeric forms of DM exerted a somewhat different solubilizing effect on the membranes: higher abundance of larger sized PSII\u2013LHCII supercomplexes retaining a higher proportion of LHCII and lower amounts of PSI\u2013LHCI intermediates were observed in \u03b1-DM treated membranes, reflecting the mildness of \u03b1-DM compared with its isomer.

Drought caused a more pronounced inhibition in photosynthetic parameters in the more sensitive cvs Garagylchyg-2 and Giymatli-2/17 compared with the tolerant cvs Barakatli-95 and Azamatli-95. Upon dehydration, a decline in total chlorophyll and relative water content was evident in all cultivars, especially in later periods of ontogenesis. Potential quantum yield of PS II (Fv/Fm ratio) in cv Azamatli-95 was maximal during stalk emergency stage at the beginning of drought. This parameter increased in cv Garagylchyg-2, while in tolerant cultivar Barakatli-95 significant changes were not observed. Contrary to other wheat genotypes in Giymatli-2/17 drought caused a decrease in PS II quantum yield. Drought-tolerant cultivars showed a significant increase in CAT activity as compared to control plants. In durum wheat cultivars maximal activity of CAT was observed at the milk ripeness and in bread wheat cultivars at the end of flowering. APX activity also increased in drought-treated leaves: in tolerant wheat genotypes maximal activity occurred at the end of flowering, in sensitive ones at the end of ear formation. GR activity increased in the tolerant cultivars under drought stress at all stages of ontogenesis. SOD activity significantly decreased in sensitive cultivars and remained at the control level or increased in resistant ones.

     "abstract": "The photoprotective nature of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) has not been effectively quantified and the major reason is the inability to quantitatively separate NPQ that acts directly to prevent photoinhibition of photosystem II (PSII). Here we describe a technique in which we use the values of the PSII yield and qP measured in the dark following illumination. We expressed the quantum yield of PSII (\u03a6PSII) via NPQ as: \u03a6PSII\u00a0=\u00a0qP\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(Fv/Fo)\u00a0/\u00a0(1\u00a0+\u00a0Fv/Fo\u00a0+\u00a0NPQ). We then tested this theoretical relationship using Arabidopsis thaliana plants that had been exposed to gradually increasing irradiance. The values of qP in the dark immediately after the illumination period (here denoted qPd) were determined using a previously described technique for Fo\u2032 calculation: Fo\u2032calc.\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0/\u00a0(1/Fo\u00a0\u2212\u00a01/Fm\u00a0\u2212\u00a01/Fm\u2032). We found that in every case the actual \u03a6PSII deviated from theoretical values at the same point that qPd deviated from a value of 1.0. In an increasing series of irradiance levels, WT leaves tolerated 1000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 of light before qPd declined. Leaves treated with the uncoupler nigericin, leaves of the mutant lacking PsbS protein and leaves overexpressing PsbS showed a qPd reduction at 100, 600 and 2000\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 respectively, each at an increasing value of NPQ. Therefore we suggest that this simple and timely technique will be instrumental for identifying photoprotective NPQ (pNPQ) and that it is more appropriate than the qE component. Its applications should be broad: for example it will be useful in physiology-based studies to define the optimal level of nonphotochemical quenching for plant protection and productivity.",

We analyzed single and double homozygous mutants in both CYTc-encoding genes from Arabidopsis: CYTC-1 and CYTC-2. While individual mutants were similar to wild-type, knock-out of both genes produced an arrest of embryo development, showing that CYTc function is essential at early stages of plant development. Mutants in which CYTc levels were extremely reduced respective to wild-type had smaller rosettes with a pronounced decrease in parenchymatic cell size and an overall delay in development. Mitochondria from these mutants had lower respiration rates and a relative increase in alternative respiration. Furthermore, the decrease in CYTc severely affected the activity and the amount of Complex IV, without affecting Complexes I and III. Reactive oxygen species levels were reduced in these mutants, which showed induction of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes. Ascorbic acid levels were not affected, suggesting that a small amount of CYTc is enough to support its normal synthesis. We postulate that, in addition to its role as an electron carrier between Complexes III and IV, CYTc influences Complex IV levels in plants, probably reflecting a role of this protein in Complex IV stability. This double function of CYTc most likely explains why it is essential for plant survival.",

     "abstract": "Changes in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) population, together with the expression of a set of genes involved in mtDNA replication and transcription and genes encoding for components of OxPhos complexes, were studied during zebrafish development from early embryo to larval stages. The mtDNA copy number, measured from 1\u00a0h post-fertilization to the adult stage, significantly decreased over time, suggesting that mtDNA replication is not active in early zebrafish embryos and that, as in mammals, there occurs partition of the maternal mtDNA copies. Zebrafish genes involved in mtDNA replication (i.e. catalytic subunit of the mtDNA polymerase \u03b3, mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside kinase) are expressed late in embryo development, further supporting the notion that there is no replication of mtDNA in the early stages of zebrafish development. Notably, as from 4\u00a0days post-fertilization, marked expression of \u201creplication genes\u201d was observed in the exocrine pancreas. Interestingly, the mtDNA helicase, also involved in mtDNA replication, was detected early in development, suggesting diverse regulation of this gene. On the other hand, zebrafish mtDNA transcription genes (i.e. mtDNA-directed RNA polymerase, mitochondrial transcription factor A) were ubiquitously expressed in the early stages of development, suggesting that mitochondrial transcription is already active before mtDNA replication. This hypothesis of early activation of mtDNA transcription fits in with the high early expression of structural OxPhos genes, suggesting that an active OxPhos system is necessary during early embryogenesis. As well as providing the first description of mtDNA distribution during zebrafish development, the present study also represents a step toward the use of Danio rerio as a model for investigation of mitochondrial metabolism and disease.",

     "abstract": "In order to prevent photodestruction by high light, photosynthetic organisms have evolved a number of mechanisms, known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), that deactivate the excited states of light harvesting pigments. Here we investigate the NPQ mechanism in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 mutant deficient in both photosystems. Using non-linear laser fluorimetry, we have determined molecular photophysical characteristics of phycocyanin and spectrally distinct forms of allophycocyanin for the cells in non-quenched and quenched states. Our analysis of non-linear fluorescence characteristics revealed that NPQ activation leads to an ~\u00a02-fold decrease in the relaxation times of both allophycocyanin fluorescence components, F660 and F680, and a 5-fold decrease in the effective excitation cross-section of F680, suggesting an emergence of a pathway of energy dissipation for both types of allophycocyanin. In contrast, NPQ does not affect the rates of singlet\u2013singlet exciton annihilation. This indicates that, upon NPQ activation, the excess excitation energy is transferred from allophycocyanins to quencher molecules (presumably 3\u2032hydroxyechinenone in the orange carotenoid protein), rather than being dissipated due to conformational changes of chromophores within the phycobilisome core. Kinetic measurements of fluorescence quenching in the Synechocystis mutant revealed the presence of several stages in NPQ development, as previously observed in the wild type. However, the lack of photosystems in the mutant enhanced the magnitude of NPQ as compared to the wild type, and allowed us to better characterize this process. Our results suggest a more complex kinetics of the NPQ process, thus clarifying a multistep model for the formation of the quenching center.",

Here, we demonstrate the metal-dependent interactions between BChl-a and the polypeptides within the intact LH1-RC complexes by near-infrared Raman spectroscopy. The wild-type LH1-RC (B915) exhibited Raman bands for the C3-acetyl and C13-keto CO stretching modes at 1637 and 1675\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, respectively. The corresponding bands appeared at 1643 and 1673\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 when Ca2\u00a0+ was biosynthetically replaced with Sr2\u00a0+ (B888) or at 1647 and 1669\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 in the mesophilic counterpart, Allochromatium vinosum. These results indicate the significant difference in the BChl\u2013polypeptide interactions between B915 and B888 and between B915 and the mesophilic counterpart. The removal of the original metal cations from B915 and B888 resulted in marked band shifts of the C3-acetyl/C13-carbonyl \u03bdCO modes to ~\u00a01645/~\u00a01670\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, supporting a model in which the metal cations are involved in the fine-tuning of the hydrogen bonding between the BChl-a and LH1-polypeptides. Interestingly, the interaction modes were almost identical between the Ca2\u00a0+-depleted B915 and Sr2\u00a0+-depleted B888 and between B915 and Ca2\u00a0+-substituted B888, despite the significant differences in their LH1 Qy peak positions and the denaturing temperatures, as revealed by differential scanning calorimetry.

Phycobiliproteins show excellent energy transfer among the chromophores that renders them biomarkers with large Stokes-shifts absorbing over most of the visible spectrum and into the near infrared. Their application is limited, however, due to covalent binding of the chromophores and by solubility problems. We report construction of a water-soluble minimal chromophore-binding unit of the red-absorbing and fluorescing core-membrane linker. This was fused to minimal chromophore-binding units of phycocyanin. After double chromophorylation with phycocyanobilin, in E. coli, the fused phycobiliproteins absorbed light in the range of 610\u2013660\u00a0nm, and fluoresced at ~\u00a0670\u00a0nm, similar to phycobilisomes devoid of phycoerythr(ocyan)in.

FCPa surrounded by high amounts of lipids resembled detergent solubilised complexes and with decreasing lipid levels, i.e. in a situation where protein contacts were increasingly favoured, the fluorescence yield of FCPa gradually decreased. In addition, the yield displayed a strong pH-dependency in case of lower lipid contents. The further reduction in fluorescence yield brought about by the conversion of diadinoxanthin to diatoxanthin was pH independent and only depended on the amount of diatoxanthin synthesised.

     "abstract": "The homodimeric bc1 complexes are membrane proteins essential in respiration and photosynthesis. The ~\u00a011\u00a0\u00c5 distance between the two bL-hemes of the dimer opens the possibility of electron transfer between them, but contradictory reports make such inter-monomer electron transfer controversial. We have constructed in Rhodobacter sphaeroides a heterodimeric expression system similar to those used before, in which the bc1 complex can be mutated differentially in the two copies of cyt b to test for inter-monomer electron transfer, but found that genetic recombination by cross-over then occurs to produce wild-type homodimer. Selection pressure under photosynthetic growth always favored the homodimer over heterodimeric variants enforcing inter-monomer electron transfer, showing that the latter are not competitive. These results, together with kinetic analysis of myxothiazol titrations, demonstrate that inter-monomer electron transfer does not occur at rates competitive with monomeric turnover. We examine the results from other groups interpreted as demonstrating rapid inter-monomer electron transfer, conclude that similar mechanisms are likely to be in play, and suggest that such claims might need to be re-examined.",

     "abstract": "The role of the highly conserved C266 and L268 of pea ferredoxin\u2013NADP+ reductase (FNR) in formation of the catalytically competent complex of the enzyme with NADP(H) was investigated. Previous studies suggest that the volume of these side-chains, situated facing the side of the C-terminal Y308 catalytic residue not stacking the flavin isoalloxazine ring, may be directly involved in the fine-tuning of the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Wild-type pea FNR as well as single and double mutants of C266 and L268 residues were analysed by fast transient-kinetic techniques and their midpoint reduction potentials were determined. For the C266A, C266M and C266A/L268A mutants a significant reduction in the overall hydride transfer (HT) rates was observed along with the absence of charge-transfer complex formation. The HT rate constants for NADPH oxidation were lower than those for NADP+ reduction, reaching a 30-fold decrease in the double mutant. In agreement, these variants exhibited more negative midpoint potentials with respect to the wild-type enzyme. The three-dimensional structures of C266M and L268V variants were solved. The C266M mutant shows a displacement of E306 away from the relevant residue S90 to accommodate the bulky methionine introduced. The overall findings indicate that in FNR the volume of the residue at position 266 is essential to attain the catalytic architecture between the nicotinamide and isoalloxazine rings at the active site and, therefore, for an efficient HT process. In addition, flexibility of the 268\u2013270 loop appears to be critical for FNR to achieve catalytically competent complexes with NADP(H).",

All of the three psbA and one of the three psbD (psbD2) genes, encoding two different isoforms of the D1 and the abundant isoform of the D2 proteins, respectively were induced under exposure to UV-B radiation and high intensity visible light. Under far red light the amount of Photosystem II complexes increased, and expression of the psbE2 gene encoding the alpha-subunit of cytochrome b559 was enhanced. However, the psbF and psbE1 genes encoding the beta- and another isoform of alpha-cytochrome b559, respectively remained lowly expressed under all conditions.

Our results show that differential expression of multigene families encoding different isoforms of D1 and D2 plays an important role in the acclimation of A. marina to contrasting environmental conditions.

Externally added membrane-permeating superoxide dismutase or catalase largely prevented death. Rescue by permeant catalase indicates that the toxicant is H2O2, or reactive species derived from it. Rescue by permeant dismutase suggests the possibility of a chain mechanism of H2O2 production, in which dismutation of superoxide constitutes a termination step. Oxidative stress was due to the presence of free phenolic hydroxyls and to accumulation in mitochondria, since the analogous mitochondriotropic per-O-methylated compound -3,3\u2032,4\u2032,5-tetra-O-methyl,7-O-(4-triphenylphosphoniumbutyl) quercetin iodide (QTM-7BTPI)\u2014or Quercetin itself induced no or little superoxide production and cell death. Q-7BTPI did not cause a significant perturbation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential or of respiration in cells. On the other hand its presence led to inhibition of glutathione peroxidase, an effect expected to accentuate oxidative stress by interfering with the elimination of H2O2. An exogenous permeable glutathione precursor determined a strong increase of cellular glutathione levels but did not rescue the cells. Death induction was selective for fast-growing C-26 tumoral cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) while sparing slow-growing MEFs. This suggests a possible use of Q-7BTPI as a chemotherapeutic agent.",

Eukaryotic complex I consists of 14 conserved subunits, which are homologous to the bacterial subunits, and more than 26 accessory subunits. In mammals, complex I consists of 45 subunits, which must be assembled correctly to form the properly functioning mature complex. Complex I dysfunction is the most common oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorder in humans and defects in the complex I assembly process are often observed. This assembly process has been difficult to characterize because of its large size, the lack of a high resolution structure for complex I, and its dual control by nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. However, in recent years, some of the atomic structure of the complex has been resolved and new insights into complex I assembly have been generated. Furthermore, a number of proteins have been identified as assembly factors for complex I biogenesis and many patients carrying mutations in genes associated with complex I deficiency and mitochondrial diseases have been discovered.

In Escherichia coli the complex is made up of 13 different subunits encoded by the so-called nuo-genes. Mutants, in which each of the nuo-genes was individually disrupted by the insertion of a resistance cartridge were unable to assemble a functional complex I. Each disruption resulted in the loss of complex I-mediated activity and the failure to extract a structurally intact complex. Thus, all nuo-genes are required either for the assembly or the stability of a functional E. coli complex I. The three subunits comprising the soluble NADH dehydrogenase fragment of the complex were detected in the cytoplasm of several nuo-mutants as one distinct band after BN-PAGE. It is discussed that the fully assembled NADH dehydrogenase fragment represents an assembly intermediate of the E. coli complex I. A partially assembled complex I bound to the membrane was detected in the nuoK and nuoL mutants, respectively. Overproduction of the \u0394NuoL variant resulted in the accumulation of two populations of a partially assembled complex in the cytoplasmic membranes. Both populations are devoid of NuoL. One population is enzymatically active, while the other is not. The inactive population is missing cluster N2 and is tightly associated with the inducible lysine decarboxylase.

They are crucial for the onset of many anaerobic biological processes, such as anoxygenic photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation. In addition, they are prevalent in many pathogenic bacteria, and important for colonizing low oxygen tissues. Studies related to cbb3-Cox provide a fascinating paradigm for the biogenesis of sophisticated oligomeric membrane proteins. Complex subunit maturation and assembly machineries, producing the c-type cytochromes and the binuclear heme b3-CuB center, have to be coordinated precisely both temporally and spatially to yield a functional cbb3-Cox enzyme.

Each of the three pathways for the assembly of cytochrome c in nature (called systems I, II, and III) has been shown to function recombinantly in Escherichia coli, covalently attaching heme to the cysteine residues of a CXXCH motif of a c-type cytochrome. However, recombinant systems I (CcmABCDEFGH) and II (CcsBA) function in the E. coli periplasm, while recombinant system III (CCHL) attaches heme to its cognate receptor in the cytoplasm of E. coli, which makes direct comparisons between the three systems difficult.

The human CCHL is specific for the human cytochrome c, whereas recombinant system II can attach heme to multiple non-cognate c-type cytochromes (possessing the CXXCH motif.)

Over the last years, studies on the P. denitrificans Surf1 protein shed some light on this important assembly factor as a heme a binding protein associated with Leigh syndrome in humans. Here, we summarise our current knowledge about Surf1 and its role in heme a incorporation events during bacterial COX biogenesis.

     "abstract": "Copper plays vital roles in the active sites of cytochrome oxidase and in several other enzymes essential for human health. Copper is also highly toxic when dysregulated; because of this an elaborate array of accessory proteins have evolved which act as intracellular carriers or chaperones for the copper ions. In most cases chaperones transport cuprous copper. This review discusses some of the chemistry of these copper sites, with a view to some of the structural factors in copper coordination which are important in the biological function of these chaperones. The coordination chemistry and accessible geometries of the cuprous oxidation state are remarkably plastic and we discuss how this may relate to biological function.

     "abstract": "SCO (synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase) proteins are involved in the assembly of the respiratory chain enzyme cytochrome c oxidase acting to assist in the assembly of the CuA center contained within subunit II of the oxidase complex. The CuA center receives electrons from the reductive substrate ferrocytochrome c, and passes them on to the cytochrome a center. Cytochrome a feeds electrons to the oxygen reaction site composed of cytochrome a3 and CuB. CuA consists of two copper ions positioned within bonding distance and ligated by two histidine side chains, one methionine, a backbone carbonyl and two bridging cysteine residues. The complex structure and redox capacity of CuA present a potential assembly challenge. SCO proteins are members of the thioredoxin family which led to the early suggestion of a disulfide exchange function for SCO in CuA assembly, whereas the copper binding capacity of the Bacillus subtilis version of SCO (i.e., BsSCO) suggests a direct role for SCO proteins in copper transfer. We have characterized redox and copper exchange properties of apo- and metalated-BsSCO. The release of copper (II) from its complex with BsSCO is best achieved by reducing it to Cu(I). We propose a mechanism involving both disulfide and copper exchange between BsSCO and the apo-CuA site.

     "abstract": "The \u03b1 proteobacter Rhodobacter sphaeroides accumulates two cytochrome c oxidases (CcO) in its cytoplasmic membrane during aerobic growth: a mitochondrial-like aa3-type CcO containing a di-copper CuA center and mono-copper CuB, plus a cbb3-type CcO that contains CuB but lacks CuA. Three copper chaperones are located in the periplasm of R. sphaeroides, PCuAC, PrrC (Sco) and Cox11. Cox11 is required to assemble CuB of the aa3-type but not the cbb3-type CcO. PrrC is homologous to mitochondrial Sco1; Sco proteins are implicated in CuA assembly in mitochondria and bacteria, and with CuB assembly of the cbb3-type CcO. PCuAC is present in many bacteria, but not mitochondria. PCuAC of Thermus thermophilus metallates a CuA center in vitro, but its in vivo function has not been explored. Here, the extent of copper center assembly in the aa3- and cbb3-type CcOs of R. sphaeroides has been examined in strains lacking PCuAC, PrrC, or both. The absence of either chaperone strongly lowers the accumulation of both CcOs in the cells grown in low concentrations of Cu2\u00a0+. The absence of PrrC has a greater effect than the absence of PCuAC and PCuAC appears to function upstream of PrrC. Analysis of purified aa3-type CcO shows that PrrC has a greater effect on the assembly of its CuA than does PCuAC, and both chaperones have a lesser but significant effect on the assembly of its CuB even though Cox11 is present. Scenarios for the cellular roles of PCuAC and PrrC are considered. The results are most consistent with a role for PrrC in the capture and delivery of copper to CuA of the aa3-type CcO and to CuB of the cbb3-type CcO, while the predominant role of PCuAC may be to capture and deliver copper to PrrC and Cox11.

Analysis on the light-induced absorption changes of the intact cells of the mutants shows, however, a relatively efficient photo-induced cyclic electron transfer. For the single mutant lacking the reaction center-bound cytochrome, we present evidence that the electron carrier connecting the reaction center and the cytochrome bc1 complex is the High Potential Iron\u2013sulfur Protein. In the double mutant lacking both the reaction center-bound cytochrome and the High Potential Iron\u2013sulfur Protein, this connection is achieved by the high potential cytochrome c8. Under anaerobic conditions, the halftime of re-reduction of the photo-oxidized primary donor by these electron donors is 3 to 4 times faster than the back reaction between P+ and the reduced primary quinone acceptor. This explains the photosynthetic growth of these two mutants. The results are discussed in terms of evolution of the type II RCs and their secondary electron donors.",

In the present studies, we showed for the first time that the plastoquinone-pool undergoes relatively fast oxidation during high light stress of low light-grown Arabidopsis plants. This oxidation was not caused by photoinhibition of photosystem II, but mainly by singlet oxygen generated in photosystem II and non-photochemical quenching in light harvesting complex antenna of the photosystem, as revealed in experiments with a singlet oxygen scavenger and with Arabidopsis npq4 mutant. The latter mechanism suppresses the influx of electrons to the plastoquinone-pool preventing its excessive reduction.

     "abstract": "The first event of photosynthesis is the harvesting of solar energy by a large array of pigments. These pigments are coordinated to proteins that organize them to assure efficient excitation energy transfer. The protein plays an essential role in tuning the spectroscopic properties of the pigments, by determining their site energy and/or by favoring pigment\u2013pigments interactions. Here we investigate how the protein modulates the pigment properties by using a single-point-mutation approach. We monitor changes in the low-energy absorption/emission band of Lhca4, which is well separated from the bulk absorption and thus represents an attractive model system. Moreover, it was recently shown that Lhca4 exists in at least two conformations, a dominating one emitting at 720\u00a0nm and a second one emitting at 685\u00a0nm (Kruger et al. PNAS 2011). Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution (from Asn to Gln, which are both chlorophyll-binding residues and only differ for one C\u2015C bond), moves the equilibrium almost completely towards the 685-nm conformation. This indicates that small changes in the protein can have a large effect on the properties of the pigments. We show that His99, which was suggested to coordinate a red-absorbing chlorophyll (Melkozernov and Blankenship, JBC 2003), is not a chlorophyll ligand. We also show that single amino-acid substitutions nearby the chlorophylls allow to tune the emission spectrum of the pigments over a wide range of wavelengths and to modulate the excited-state lifetimes of the complex. These findings are discussed in the light of previously proposed non-photochemical quenching models.",

     "abstract": "The tyrosine kinase Src is upregulated in several cancer cells. In such cells, there is a metabolic reprogramming elevating aerobic glycolysis that seems partly dependent on Src activation. Src kinase was recently shown to be targeted to mitochondria where it modulates mitochondrial bioenergetics in non-proliferative tissues and cells. The main goal of our study was to determine if increased Src kinase activity could also influence mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells (143B and DU145 cells). We have shown that 143B and DU145 cells produce most of the ATP through glycolysis but also that the inhibition of OXPHOS led to a significant decrease in proliferation which was not due to a decrease in the total ATP levels. These results indicate that a more important role for mitochondria in cancer cells could be ensuring mitochondrial functions other than ATP production. This study is the first to show a putative influence of intramitochondrial Src kinase on oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells. Indeed, we have shown that Src kinase inhibition led to a decrease in mitochondrial respiration via a specific decrease in complex I activities (NADH\u2013ubiquinone oxidoreductase). This decrease is associated with a lower phosphorylation of the complex I subunit NDUFB10. These results suggest that the preservation of complex I function by mitochondrial Src kinase could be important in the development of the overall phenotype of cancer.",

Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, continuum electrostatic approaches, and quantum chemical cluster calculations to identify proton transfer pathways in cytochrome cbb3. In MD simulations we observe formation of stable water chains that connect the highly conserved Glu323 residue on the proximal side of heme b3 both with the N- and the P-sides of the membrane. We propose that such pathways could be utilized for redox-coupled proton pumping in the C-type oxidases. Electrostatics and quantum chemical calculations suggest an increased proton affinity of Glu323 upon reduction of high-spin heme b3. Protonation of Glu323 provides a mechanism to tune the redox potential of heme b3 with possible implications for proton pumping.",

Here we have explored if altered cellular energetics in response to a mild mitochondrial uncoupling stimulus may also contribute to the protection. The addition of 100\u00a0nM FCCP for 30\u00a0min to cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) induced a transient depolarization of the \u0394\u03c8m, that was sufficient to significantly reduce CGN vulnerability to the excitotoxic stimulus, glutamate. On investigation, the mild mitochondrial \u2018uncoupling\u2019 stimulus resulted in a significant increase in the plasma membrane levels of the glucose transporter isoform 3, with a hyperpolarisation of \u0394\u03c8m and increased cellular ATP levels also evident following the washout of FCCP. Furthermore, the phosphorylation state of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (Thr 172) was increased within 5\u00a0min of the uncoupling stimulus and elevated up to 1\u00a0h after washout. Significantly, the physiological changes and protection evident after the mild uncoupling stimulus were lost in CGNs when AMPK activity was inhibited. This study identifies an additional mechanism through which protection is mediated upon mild mitochondrial uncoupling: it implicates increased AMPK signalling and an adaptive shift in energy metabolism as mediators of the preconditioning response associated with FCCP-induced mild mitochondrial uncoupling.",

NPQ is typically characterized by modulated pulse fluorometry and it is often assumed implicitly to be a good proxy for the actual physiological photoprotection capacity of the organism. Using the results of previously published ultrafast fluorescence measurements on intact leaves of w.t. and mutants of Arabidopsis (Holzwarth et al. 2009) we have developed exact relationships for the fluorescence quenching and the corresponding Photosystem II acceptor side photoprotection effects under NPQ conditions. The approach based on the exciton\u2013radical pair equilibrium model assumes that photodamage results from triplet states generated in the reaction center. The derived relationships allow one to distinguish and determine the individual and combined quenching as well as photoprotection contributions of each of the multiple NPQ mechanisms. Our analysis shows inter alia that quenching and photoprotection are not linearly related and that antenna detachment, which can be identified with the so-called qE mechanism, contributes largely to the measured fluorescence quenching but does not correspond to the most efficient photoprotective response. Conditions are formulated which allow simultaneously the maximal photosynthetic electron flow as well as maximal acceptor side photoprotection. It is shown that maximal photoprotection can be achieved if NPQ is regulated in such a way that PSII reaction centers are open under given light conditions. The results are of fundamental importance for a proper interpretation of the physiological relevance of fluorescence-based NPQ data.",

     "abstract": "The effects of changes in the chlorophyll (chl) content on the kinetics of the OJIP fluorescence transient were studied using two different approaches. An extensive chl loss (up to 5-fold decrease) occurs in leaves suffering from either an Mg2+ or SO42\u2212 deficiency. The effects of these treatments on the chl a/b ratio, which is related to antenna size, were very limited. This observation was confirmed by the identical light intensity dependencies of the K, J and I-steps of the fluorescence rise for three of the four treatments and by the absence of changes in the F685 nm/F695 nm-ratio of fluorescence emission spectra measured at 77\u00a0K. Under these conditions, the F0 and FM-values were essentially insensitive to the chl content. A second experimental approach consisted of the treatment of wheat leaves with specifically designed antisense oligodeoxynucleotides that interfered with the translation of mRNA of the genes coding for chl a/b binding proteins. This way, leaves with a wide range of chl a/b ratios were created. Under these conditions, an inverse proportional relationship between the FM values and the chl a/b ratio was observed. A strong effect of the chl a/b ratio on the fluorescence intensity was also observed for barley Chlorina f2 plants that lack chl b. The data suggest that the chl a/b ratio (antenna size) is a more important determinant of the maximum fluorescence intensity than the chl content of the leaf.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial cytochrome c associates with the phosphoplipid cardiolipin (CL) through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The latter occurs by insertion into cytochrome c of an acyl chain, resulting in the dissociation of the axial Met-80 heme-iron ligand. The resulting five coordinate cytochrome c/CL complex has peroxidatic properties leading to peroxidation of CL and dissociation of the complex. These events are considered to be pre-apoptotic and culminate with release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. Two distinct surface regions on cytochrome c have been suggested to mediate CL acyl chain insertion and this study has probed one of these regions. We have constructed a series of alanine mutants aimed at disrupting a surface cleft formed between residues 67\u201371 and 82\u201385. The physicochemical properties, peroxidase activity, CL binding, and kinetics of carbon monoxide (CO) binding to the ferrous cytochrome c/CL complex have been assessed for the individual mutants. Our findings reveal that the majority of mutants are capable of binding CL in the same apparent stoichiometry as the wild-type protein, with the extent to which the Met-80 ligand is bound in the ferrous cytochrome c/CL complex being mutant specific at neutral pH. Mutation of the species conserved Arg-91 residue, that anchors the cleft, results in the greatest changes to physicochemical properties of the protein leading to a change in the CL binding ratio required to effect structural changes and to the ligand-exchange properties of the ferrous cytochrome c/CL complex.",

     "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis in cyanobacteria, algae, and plants requires photosystem II (PSII) to extract electrons from H2O and depends on photosystem I (PSI) to reduce NADP+. Here we demonstrate that mixotrophically-grown mutants of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that lack PSI (\u0394PSI) are capable of net light-induced O2 evolution in vivo. The net light-induced O2 evolution requires glucose and can be sustained for more than 30\u00a0min. Utilizing electron transport inhibitors and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, we show that in these mutants PSII is the source of the light-induced O2 evolution, and that the plastoquinone pool is reduced by PSII and subsequently oxidized by an unidentified electron acceptor that does not involve the plastoquinol oxidase site of the cytochrome b6f complex. Moreover, both O2 evolution and chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics of the \u0394PSI mutants are highly sensitive to KCN, indicating the involvement of a KCN-sensitive enzyme(s). Experiments using 14C-labeled bicarbonate show that the \u0394PSI mutants assimilate more CO2 in the light compared to the dark. However, the rate of the light-minus-dark CO2 assimilation accounts for just over half of the net light-induced O2 evolution rate, indicating the involvement of unidentified terminal electron acceptors. Based on these results we suggest that O2 evolution in \u0394PSI cells can be sustained by an alternative electron transport pathway that results in CO2 assimilation and that includes PSII, the platoquinone pool, and a KCN-sensitive enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The active site for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) goes through five sequential oxidation states (S0 to S4) before O2 is evolved. It consists of a Mn4CaO5 cluster and TyrZ, a redox-active tyrosine residue. Chloride ions have been known for long time to be required for the function of the enzyme. However, X-ray data have shown that they are located about 7\u00a0\u00c5 away from the Mn4CaO5 cluster, a distance that seems too large to be compatible with a direct involvement of chloride in the water splitting chemistry. We have investigated the role of this anion by substituting I\u2212 for Cl\u2212 in the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus with either Ca2\u00a0+ or Sr2\u00a0+ biosynthetically assembled into the Mn4 cluster. The electron transfer steps affected by the exchanges were investigated by time-resolved UV\u2013visible absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved EPR at room temperature and low temperature cw-EPR spectroscopy. In both Ca-PSII and Sr-PSII, the Cl\u2212/I\u2212 exchange considerably slowed down the two S3TyrZ\u2022\u00a0\u2192\u00a0(S3TyrZ\u2022)\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S0 reactions in which the fast phase, S3TyrZ\u2022\u00a0\u2192\u00a0(S3TyrZ\u2022)\u2032, reflects the electrostatically triggered expulsion of one proton from the catalytic center caused by the positive charge near/on TyrZ\u2022 and the slow phase corresponds to the S0 and O2 formations and to a second proton release. The t1/2 for S0 formation increased from 1.1\u00a0ms in Ca/Cl-PSII to \u2248\u00a06\u00a0ms in Ca/I-PSII and from 4.8\u00a0ms in Sr/Cl-PSII to \u2248\u00a045\u00a0ms in Sr/I-PSII. In all cases the TyrZ\u2022 reduction was the limiting step. The kinetic effects are interpreted by a model in which the Ca2\u00a0+ binding site and the Cl\u2212 binding site, although spatially distant, interact. This interaction is likely mediated by the H-bond and/or water molecules network(s) connecting the Cl\u2212 and Ca2\u00a0+ binding sites by which proton release may be channelled.",

A second-site revertant of this mutant that regained photosynthetic capacity was found to have acquired two further mutations\u2014A181T and A200V. The Y152Q mutation did not change the spectral or electrochemical properties of C1, and showed wild-type enzymatic C2 reduction rates, indicating that this mutation did not introduce major structural changes in C1 nor affect overall activity. Mutations Y153Q and Y153A, on the other hand, clearly affect the redox properties of C1 (e.g. by lowering the midpoint potential as much as 117\u00a0mV in Y153Q) and the activity by 90% and 50%, respectively. A more conservative Y153F mutant on the other hand, behaves similarly to wild-type.

However, in some lineages including legumes and chlorophycean algae, the cox2 gene migrated to the nucleus. Furthermore, in chlorophycean algae, this gene was split in two different units. Thereby the COX2 subunit is encoded by two independent nuclear genes, cox2a and cox2b, and mitochondria have to import the cytosol-synthesized COX2A and COX2B subunits and assemble them into the cytochrome c oxidase complex. In the chlorophycean algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Polytomella sp., the COX2A precursor exhibits a long (130\u2013140 residues), cleavable mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS). In contrast, COX2B lacks an MTS, suggesting that mitochondria use different mechanisms to import each subunit. Here, we explored the in vitro import processes of both, the Polytomella sp. COX2A precursor and the COX2B protein. We used isolated, import-competent mitochondria from this colorless alga. Our results suggest that COX2B is imported directly into the intermembrane space, while COX2A seems to follow an energy-dependent import pathway, through which it finally integrates into the inner mitochondrial membrane. In addition, the MTS of the COX2A precursor is eliminated. This is the first time that the in vitro import of split COX2 subunits into mitochondria has been achieved.",

The present study evaluated the role of mitochondrial Complex I in GTN biotransformation and the therapeutic effect of mitochondrial antioxidants. The development of GTN tolerance (in rat and human vessels) produced a decrease in mitochondrial O2 consumption. Co-incubation with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoquinone (MQ, 10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0mol/L) or with glutathione ester (GEE, 10\u2212\u00a04\u00a0mol/L) blocked GTN tolerance and the effects of GTN on mitochondrial respiration and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2) activity. Biotransformation of GTN depended on the mitochondria being functionally active, particularly mitochondrial Complex I. Tolerance induced mitochondrial ROS production and oxidative stress, though these effects were not detected in HUVEC\u03c10 cells or Complex I mutant cells. Experiments performed to evaluate Complex I-dependent respiration demonstrated that its inhibition by GTN was prevented by the antioxidants in control samples. These results point to a key role for mitochondrial Complex I in the adequate functioning of ALDH-2. In addition, we have identified mitochondrial Complex I as one of the targets at which the initial oxidative stress responsible for GTN tolerance takes place. Our data also suggest a role for mitochondrial-antioxidants as therapeutic tools in the control of the tolerance that accompanies chronic nitrate use.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism of dioxygen activation and reduction in cell respiration, as catalysed by cytochrome c oxidase, has a long history. The work by Otto Warburg, David Keilin and Britton Chance defined the dioxygen-binding heme iron centre, viz. das Atmungsferment, or cytochrome a3. Chance brought the field further in the mid-1970's by ingenious low-temperature studies that for the first time identified the primary enzyme-substrate (ES) Michaelis complex of cell respiration, the dioxygen adduct of heme a3, which he termed Compound A. Further work using optical, resonance Raman, EPR, and other sophisticated spectroscopic techniques, some of which with microsecond time resolution, has brought us to the situation today, where major principles of how O2 reduction occurs in respiration are well understood. Nonetheless, some questions have remained open, for example concerning the precise structures, catalytic roles, and spectroscopic properties of the breakdown products of Compound A that have been called P, F (for peroxy and ferryl), and O (oxidised). This nomenclature has been known to be inadequate for some time already, and an alternative will be suggested here. In addition, the multiple forms of P, F and O states have been confusing, a situation that we endeavour to help clarifying. The P and F states formed artificially by reacting cytochrome oxidase with hydrogen peroxide are especially scrutinised, and some novel interpretations will be given that may account for previously unexplained observations.

Single-electron photoreduction experiments carried out with the A-class cytochrome c oxidases of aa3 type from mitochondria, Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus denitrificans as well as with the ba3-type oxidase from Thermus thermophilus indicate that the protonmotive mechanisms, although similar, may not be identical for different partial steps in the same enzyme species, as well as for the same single-electron transition in different oxidases. The pattern of charge translocation coupled to transfer of a single electron in the A-class oxidases confirms major predictions of the original model of proton pumping by cytochrome oxidase [Artzatbanov, V.

     "abstract": "The mechanism for proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase in the respiratory chain, has for decades been one of the main unsolved problems in biochemistry. However, even though several different suggested mechanisms exist, many of the steps in these mechanisms are quite similar and constitute a general consensus framework for discussing proton pumping. When these steps are analyzed, at least three critical gating situations are found, and these points are where the suggested mechanisms in general differ. The requirements for gating are reviewed and analyzed in detail, and a mechanism is suggested, where solutions for all the gating situations are formulated. This mechanism is based on an electrostatic analysis of a kinetic experiment fior the O to E transition. The key component of the mechanism is a positively charged transition state. An electron on heme a opens the gate for proton transfer from the N-side to a pump loading site (PLS). When the negative charge of the electron is compensated by a chemical proton, the positive transition state prevents backflow from the PLS to the N-side at the most critical stage of the pumping process. The mechanism has now been tested by large model DFT calculations, and these calculations give strong support for the suggested mechanism.

The coupling of the chemical proton to the internal electron transfer within the binuclear center is examined for the O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0E transition. The novel features of the His291 pumping model are proposed, which involve timely well-synchronized sequence of the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The obtained pKas and Ems of the key ionizable and redox-active groups at the different stages of the O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0E transition are consistent with available experimental data. The PT step from E242 to H291 is examined in detail for various redox states of the hemes and various conformations of E242 side-chain. Redox potential calculations of the successive steps in the reaction cycle during the O\u00a0\u2192\u00a0E transition are able to explain a cascade of equilibria between the different intermediate states and electron redistribution between the metal centers during the course of the catalytic activity. All four electrometric phases are discussed in the light of the obtained results, providing a robust support for the His291 model of proton pumping in CcO.

     "abstract": "In cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), a redox-driven proton pump, protons are transported by the Grotthuss shuttling via hydrogen-bonded water molecules and protonatable residues. Proton transport through the D-pathway is a complicated process that is highly sensitive to alterations in the amino acids or the solvation structure in the channel, both of which can inhibit proton pumping and enzymatic activity. Simulations of proton transport in the hydrophobic cavity showed a clear redox state dependence. To study the mechanism of proton pumping in CcO, multi-state empirical valence bond (MS-EVB) simulations have been conducted, focusing on the proton transport through the D-pathway and the hydrophobic cavity next to the binuclear center. The hydration structures, transport pathways, effects of residues, and free energy surfaces of proton transport were revealed in these MS-EVB simulations.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase is an efficient energy transducer that reduces oxygen to water and converts the released chemical energy into an electrochemical membrane potential. As a true proton pump, cytochrome c oxidase translocates protons across the membrane against this potential. Based on a wealth of experiments and calculations, an increasingly detailed picture of the reaction intermediates in the redox cycle has emerged. However, the fundamental mechanism of proton pumping coupled to redox chemistry remains largely unresolved. Here we examine and extend a kinetic master-equation approach to gain insight into redox-coupled proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. Basic principles of the cytochrome c oxidase proton pump emerge from an analysis of the simplest kinetic models that retain essential elements of the experimentally determined structure, energetics, and kinetics, and that satisfy fundamental physical principles. The master-equation models allow us to address the question of how pumping can be achieved in a system in which all reaction steps are reversible. Whereas proton pumping does not require the direct modulation of microscopic reaction barriers, such kinetic gating greatly increases the pumping efficiency. Further efficiency gains can be achieved by partially decoupling the proton uptake pathway from the active-site region. Such a mechanism is consistent with the proposed Glu valve, in which the side chain of a key glutamic acid shuttles between the D channel and the active-site region. We also show that the models predict only small proton leaks even in the absence of turnover. The design principles identified here for cytochrome c oxidase provide a blueprint for novel biology-inspired fuel cells, and the master-equation formulation should prove useful also for other molecular machines.

The removal of subunit III from R. sphaeroides CcO makes proton uptake into the D pathway a rate-determining step, such that measurements of the pH dependence of steady-state O2 consumption can be used to compare the rate and functional pKa of proton uptake by D pathways containing different initial proton acceptors. The removal of subunit III also promotes spontaneous suicide inactivation by CcO, greatly shortening its catalytic lifespan. Because the probability of suicide inactivation is controlled by the rate at which the D pathway delivers protons to the active site, measurements of catalytic lifespan provide a second method to compare the relative efficacy of proton uptake by engineered CcO III (\u2212) forms. These simple experimental systems have been used to explore general questions of proton uptake by proteins, such as the functional value of an initial proton acceptor, whether an initial acceptor must be surface-exposed, which side chains will function as initial proton acceptors and whether multiple acceptors can speed proton uptake.

Results are presented showing that the I-R54M mutation in P. denitrificans aa3 oxidase, which decreases by more than 200\u00a0mV the Em of heme a, inhibits proton pumping. Mutational aminoacid replacement in proton channels, at the negative (N) side of membrane-inserted prokaryotic aa3 oxidases, as well as Zn2\u00a0+ binding at this site in the bovine oxidase, uncouples proton pumping.

CcO uses four electrons from Cc to reduce O2 to two waters, and pumps four protons across the membrane. The electron transfer reactions in cytochrome oxidase are very rapid, and cannot be resolved by stopped-flow mixing techniques. Methods have been developed to covalently attach a photoactive tris(bipyridine)ruthenium group [Ru(II)] to Cc to form Ru-39-Cc. Photoexcitation of Ru(II) to the excited state Ru(II*), a strong reductant, leads to rapid electron transfer to the ferric heme group in Cc, followed by electron transfer to CuA in CcO with a rate constant of 60,000\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. Ruthenium kinetics and mutagenesis studies have been used to define the domain for the interaction between Cc and CcO. New ruthenium dimers have also been developed to rapidly inject electrons into CuA of CcO with yields as high as 60%, allowing measurement of the kinetics of electron transfer and proton release at each step in the oxygen reduction mechanism.

Red-excited RR spectra for the fully oxidized \u201cas-isolated\u201d CcO tuned to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorption band at 655\u00a0nm exhibit a Raman band at 755\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 assignable to the \u03bdOO stretching mode of a peroxide. Binding of CN\u2212 diminishes the RR band concomitant with the loss of the charge transfer absorption band. This suggests that a peroxide forms a bridge between heme a3 and CuB. Time-resolved RR spectroscopy of whole mitochondria identified a band at 571\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 arising from the oxygenated intermediate at \u0394t\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 0.6 and 1.4\u00a0ms.

The coordination geometries of the three intermediates are essentially the same as the respective species observed for solubilized CcO. However, the lifetime of the oxygenated intermediate in mitochondria was significantly longer than the lifetime of this intermediate determined for solubilized CcO. This phenomenon is due either to the pH effect of mitochondrial matrix, the effect of \u0394pH and/or \u0394\u03a8 across the membrane, or the effect of interactions with other membrane components and/or phospholipids.

     "abstract": "Among the X-ray structures of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), reported thus far, the highest resolution is 1.8\u00a0\u00c5. CcO includes 13 different protein subunits, 7 species of phospholipids, 7 species of triglycerides, 4 redox-active metal sites (CuA, heme a (Fea), CuB, heme a3 (Fea3)) and 3 redox-inactive metal sites (Mg2\u00a0+, Zn2\u00a0+ and Na+).The effects of various O2 analogs on the X-ray structure suggest that O2 molecules are transiently trapped at the CuB site before binding to Fea32\u00a0+ to provide O2\u2212. This provides three possible electron transfer pathways from CuB, Fea3 and Tyr244 via a water molecule. These pathways facilitate non-sequential 3 electron reduction of the bound O2\u2212 to break the OO bond without releasing active oxygen species.Bovine heart CcO has a proton conducting pathway that includes a hydrogen-bond network and a water-channel which, in tandem, connect the positive side phase with the negative side phase. The hydrogen-bond network forms two additional hydrogen-bonds with the formyl and propionate groups of heme a. Thus, upon oxidation of heme a, the positive charge created on Fea is readily delocalized to the heme peripheral groups to drive proton-transport through the hydrogen-bond network. A peptide bond in the hydrogen-bond network and a redox-coupled conformational change in the water channel are expected to effectively block reverse proton transfer through the H-pathway. These functions of the pathway have been confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of bovine CcO expressed in HeLa cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Respiratory Oxidases.",

     "abstract": "According to theory, present eukaryotic cells originated from a beneficial association between two free-living cells. Due to this endosymbiotic event the pre-eukaryotic cell gained access to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which produces more than 15 times as much ATP as glycolysis. Because cellular ATP needs fluctuate and OXPHOS both requires and produces entities that can be toxic for eukaryotic cells such as ROS or NADH, we propose that the success of endosymbiosis has largely depended on the regulation of endosymbiont OXPHOS. Several studies have presented cytochrome c oxidase as a key regulator of OXPHOS; for example, COX is the only complex of mammalian OXPHOS with known tissue-specific isoforms of nuclear encoded subunits. We here discuss current knowledge about the origin of nuclear encoded subunits and the appearance of different isozymes promoted by tissue and cellular environments such as hypoxia. We also review evidence for recent selective pressure acting on COX among vertebrates, particularly in primate lineages, and discuss the unique pattern of co-evolution between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Finally, even though the addition of nuclear encoded subunits was a major event in eukaryotic COX evolution, this does not lead to emergence of a more efficient COX, as might be expected from an anthropocentric point of view, for the \u201chigher\u201d organism possessing large brains and muscles. The main function of these subunits appears to be \u201conly\u201d to control the activity of the mitochondrial subunits. We propose that this control function is an as yet underappreciated key point of evolution. Moreover, the importance of regulating energy supply may have caused the addition of subunits encoded by the nucleus in a process comparable to a \u201cdomestication scenario\u201d such that the host tends to control more and more tightly the ancestral activity of COX performed by the mtDNA encoded subunits.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c (Cytc) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyze the terminal reaction of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the reduction of oxygen to water. This irreversible step is highly regulated, as indicated by the presence of tissue-specific and developmentally expressed isoforms, allosteric regulation, and reversible phosphorylations, which are found in both Cytc and COX. The crucial role of the ETC in health and disease is obvious since it, together with ATP synthase, provides the vast majority of cellular energy, which drives all cellular processes. However, under conditions of stress, the ETC generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause cell damage and trigger death processes. We here discuss current knowledge of the regulation of Cytc and COX with a focus on cell signaling pathways, including cAMP/protein kinase A and tyrosine kinase signaling. Based on the crystal structures we highlight all identified phosphorylation sites on Cytc and COX, and we present a new phosphorylation site, Ser126 on COX subunit II. We conclude with a model that links cell signaling with the phosphorylation state of Cytc and COX. This in turn regulates their enzymatic activities, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and the production of ATP and ROS. Our model is discussed through two distinct human pathologies, acute inflammation as seen in sepsis, where phosphorylation leads to strong COX inhibition followed by energy depletion, and ischemia/reperfusion injury, where hyperactive ETC complexes generate pathologically high mitochondrial membrane potentials, leading to excessive ROS production. Although operating at opposite poles of the ETC activity spectrum, both conditions can lead to cell death through energy deprivation or ROS-triggered apoptosis.

The perception, however, that NO could be responsible for physiological or pathological effects, including those on mitochondria, lags behind the 80's, when the identity of the endothelial derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and NO synthesis by the NO synthases were discovered. NO controls mitochondrial respiration, and cytotoxic as well as cytoprotective effects have been described. The depression of OXPHOS ATP synthesis has been observed, attributed to the inhibition of mitochondrial Complex I and IV particularly, found responsible of major effects.The review is focused on CcOX and NO with some hints about pathophysiological implications. The reactions of interest are reviewed, with special attention to the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of NO observed on cytochrome c oxidase, particularly during turnover with oxygen and reductants.The NO inhibition of CcOX is rapid and reversible and may occur in competition with oxygen. Inhibition takes place following two pathways leading to formation of either a relatively stable nitrosyl-derivative (CcOX-NO) of the enzyme reduced, or a more labile nitrite-derivative (CcOX-NO2\u2212) of the enzyme oxidized, and during turnover. The pathway that prevails depends on the turnover conditions and concentration of NO and physiological substrates, cytochrome c and O2. All evidence suggests that these parameters are crucial in determining the CcOX vs NO reaction pathway prevailing in vivo, with interesting physiological and pathological consequences for cells.

In this way they contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the transmembrane difference of electrochemical potential, which is vital for solute/nutrient cell import, synthesis of ATP and motility. The HCO enzymes most probably share with the nitric oxide reductases, NORs, a common ancestor. We have proposed the classification of HCOs into three different types, A, B and C; based on the constituents of their proton channels (Pereira, Santana and Teixeira (2001) Biochim Biophys Acta, 1505, 185\u2013208). This classification was recently challenged by the suggestion of other different types of HCOs. Using an enlarged sampling we performed an exhaustive bioinformatic reanalysis of HCOs family. Our results strengthened our previously proposed classification and showed no need for the existence of more divisions. Now, we analyze the taxonomic distribution of HCOs and NORs and the congruence of their sequence trees with the 16S rRNA tree. We observed that HCOs are widely distributed in the two prokaryotic domains and that the different types of enzymes are not confined to a specific taxonomic group or environmental niche.

     "abstract": "Seven years into the completion of the genome sequencing projects of the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus strains HB8 and HB27, many questions remain on its bioenergetic mechanisms. A key fact that is occasionally overlooked is that oxygen has a very limited solubility in water at high temperatures. The HB8 strain is a facultative anaerobe whereas its relative HB27 is strictly aerobic. This has been attributed to the absence of nitrate respiration genes from the HB27 genome that are carried on a mobilizable but highly-unstable plasmid. In T. thermophilus, the nitrate respiration complements the primary aerobic respiration. It is widely known that many organisms encode multiple biochemically-redundant components of the respiratory complexes. In this minireview, the presence of the two cytochrome c oxidases (CcO) in T. thermophilus, the ba3- and caa3-types, is outlined along with functional considerations. We argue for the distinct evolutionary histories of these two CcO including their respective genetic and molecular organizations, with the caa3-oxidase subunits having been initially \u2018fused\u2019. Coupled with sequence analysis, the ba3-oxidase crystal structure has provided evolutionary and functional information; for example, its subunit I is more closely related to archaeal sequences than bacterial and the substrate\u2013enzyme interaction is hydrophobic as the elevated growth temperature weakens the electrostatic interactions common in mesophiles.

     "abstract": "The respiratory heme-copper oxidases catalyze reduction of O2 to H2O, linking this process to transmembrane proton pumping. These oxidases have been classified according to the architecture, location and number of proton pathways. Most structural and functional studies to date have been performed on the A-class oxidases, which includes those that are found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and bacteria such as Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Paracoccus denitrificans (aa3-type oxidases in these bacteria). These oxidases pump protons with a stoichiometry of one proton per electron transferred to the catalytic site. The bacterial A-class oxidases use two proton pathways (denoted by letters D and K, respectively), for the transfer of protons to the catalytic site, and protons that are pumped across the membrane. The B-type oxidases such as, for example, the ba3 oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, pump protons with a lower stoichiometry of 0.5 H+/electron and use only one proton pathway for the transfer of all protons. This pathway overlaps in space with the K pathway in the A class oxidases without showing any sequence homology though. Here, we review the functional properties of the A- and the B-class ba3 oxidases with a focus on mechanisms of proton transfer and pumping.

     "abstract": "The purpose of the work was to provide a crystallographic demonstration of the venerable idea that CO photolyzed from ferrous heme-a3 moves to the nearby cuprous ion in the cytochrome c oxidases. Crystal structures of CO-bound cytochrome ba3-oxidase from Thermus thermophilus, determined at ~\u00a02.8\u20133.2\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, reveal a Fe\u2013C distance of ~\u00a02.0\u00a0\u00c5, a Cu\u2013O distance of 2.4\u00a0\u00c5 and a Fe\u2013C\u2013O angle of ~\u00a0126\u00b0. Upon photodissociation at 100\u00a0K, X-ray structures indicate loss of Fea3\u2013CO and appearance of CuB\u2013CO having a Cu\u2013C distance of ~\u00a01.9\u00a0\u00c5 and an O\u2013Fe distance of ~\u00a02.3\u00a0\u00c5. Absolute FTIR spectra recorded from single crystals of reduced ba3\u2013CO that had not been exposed to X-ray radiation, showed several peaks around 1975\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01; after photolysis at 100\u00a0K, the absolute FTIR spectra also showed a significant peak at 2050\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01. Analysis of the \u2018light\u2019 minus \u2018dark\u2019 difference spectra showed four very sharp CO stretching bands at 1970\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, 1977\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, 1981\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, and 1985\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, previously assigned to the Fea3\u2013CO complex, and a significantly broader CO stretching band centered at ~\u00a02050\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, previously assigned to the CO stretching frequency of CuB bound CO. As expected for light propagating along the tetragonal axis of the P43212 space group, the single crystal spectra exhibit negligible dichroism. Absolute FTIR spectrometry of a CO-laden ba3 crystal, exposed to an amount of X-ray radiation required to obtain structural data sets before FTIR characterization, showed a significant signal due to photogenerated CO2 at 2337\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 and one from traces of CO at 2133\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01; while bands associated with CO bound to either Fea3 or to CuB in \u201clight\u201d minus \u201cdark\u201d FTIR difference spectra shifted and broadened in response to X-ray exposure. In spite of considerable radiation damage to the crystals, both X-ray analysis at 2.8 and 3.2\u00a0\u00c5 and FTIR spectra support the long-held position that photolysis of Fea3\u2013CO in cytochrome c oxidases leads to significant trapping of the CO on the CuB atom; Fea3 and CuB ligation, at the resolutions reported here, are otherwise unaltered.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome ba3 (ba3) of Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) is a member of the heme\u2013copper oxidase family, which has a binuclear catalytic center comprised of a heme (heme a3) and a copper (CuB). The heme\u2013copper oxidases generally catalyze the four electron reduction of molecular oxygen in a sequence involving several intermediates. We have investigated the reaction of the fully reduced ba3 with O2 using stopped-flow techniques. Transient visible absorption spectra indicated that a fraction of the enzyme decayed to the oxidized state within the dead time (~\u00a01\u00a0ms) of the stopped-flow instrument, while the remaining amount was in a reduced state that decayed slowly (k\u00a0=\u00a0400\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) to the oxidized state without accumulation of detectable intermediates. Furthermore, no accumulation of intermediate species at 1\u00a0ms was detected in time resolved resonance Raman measurements of the reaction. These findings suggest that O2 binds rapidly to heme a3 in one fraction of the enzyme and progresses to the oxidized state. In the other fraction of the enzyme, O2 binds transiently to a trap, likely CuB, prior to its migration to heme a3 for the oxidative reaction, highlighting the critical role of CuB in regulating the oxygen reaction kinetics in the oxidase superfamily.

     "abstract": "The reactions of molecular oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO) with reduced Thermus thermophilus (Tt) ba3 and bovine heart aa3 were investigated by time-resolved optical absorption spectroscopy to establish possible relationships between the structural diversity of these enzymes and their reaction dynamics. To determine whether the photodissociated carbon monoxide (CO) in the CO flow-flash experiment affects the ligand binding dynamics, we monitored the reactions in the absence and presence of CO using photolabile O2 and NO complexes. The binding of O2/NO to reduced ba3 in the absence of CO occurs with a second-order rate constant of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. This rate is 10-times faster than for the mammalian enzyme, and which is attributed to structural differences in the ligand channels of the two enzymes. Moreover, the O2/NO binding in ba3 is 10-times slower in the presence of the photodissociated CO while the rates are the same for the bovine enzyme. This indicates that the photodissociated CO directly or indirectly impedes O2 and NO access to the active site in Tt ba3, and that traditional CO flow-flash experiments do not accurately reflect the O2 and NO binding kinetics in ba3. We suggest that in ba3 the binding of O2 (NO) to heme a32\u00a0+ causes rapid dissociation of CO from CuB+ through steric or electronic effects or, alternatively, that the photodissociated CO does not bind to CuB+. These findings indicate that structural differences between Tt ba3 and the bovine aa3 enzyme are tightly linked to mechanistic differences in the functions of these enzymes.

     "abstract": "The crystal structure of the membrane-integrated nitric oxide reductase cNOR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was determined. The smaller NorC subunit of cNOR is comprised of 1 trans-membrane helix and a hydrophilic domain, where the heme c is located, while the larger NorB subunit consists of 12 trans-membrane helices, which contain heme b and the catalytically active binuclear center (heme b3 and non-heme FeB). The roles of the 5 well-conserved glutamates in NOR are discussed, based on the recently solved structure. Glu211 and Glu280 appear to play an important role in the catalytic reduction of NO at the binuclear center by functioning as a terminal proton donor, while Glu215 probably contributes to the electro-negative environment of the catalytic center. Glu135, a ligand for Ca2+ sandwiched between two heme propionates from heme b and b3, and the nearby Glu138 appears to function as a structural factor in maintaining a protein conformation that is suitable for electron-coupled proton transfer from the periplasmic region to the active site. On the basis of these observations, the possible molecular mechanism for the reduction of NO by cNOR is discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Respiratory Oxidases.",

Besides plastoquinol, also its oxidized form, plastoquinone shows antioxidant action during the stress conditions, resulting in formation of plastoquinone-C, whose level can be regarded as an indicator of singlet oxygen oxidative stress in vivo. The pronounced stimulation of \u03b1-tocopherol consumption and \u03b1-tocopherolquinone formation by an uncoupler, FCCP, together with the results of additional model system studies, led to the suggestion that \u03b1-tocopherol can be recycled in thylakoid membranes under high light conditions from 8a-hydroperoxy-\u03b1-tocopherone, the primary oxidation product of \u03b1-tocopherol by singlet oxygen.",

The pigment composition of the purified RCs was carefully analyzed by LCMS. Significant accumulation of both bacteriochlorophyll(BChl)-a and bacteriopheophytin(BPhe)-a esterified with various isoprenoid alcohols in the 17-propionate groups was shown in RCs for the first time. Moreover, a drastic decrease in BPhe-a with the most dehydrogenated and rigid geranylgeranyl(GG) ester was observed, indicating that BPhe-a in RC preferably took partially hydrogenated and flexible ester groups, i.e. dihydro-GG and tetrahydro-GG in addition to phytyl. Based on the reported X-ray crystal structures of purple bacterial RCs, the meaning of flexibility of the ester groups in BChl-a and BPhe-a as the cofactors of RCs is proposed.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial NADPH generation is largely dependent on the inner-membrane nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT), which catalyzes the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH utilizing the proton gradient as the driving force and NADH as the electron donor. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of NNT in PC12 cells results in decreased cellular NADPH levels, altered redox status of the cell in terms of decreased GSH/GSSG ratios and increased H2O2 levels, thus leading to an increased redox potential (a more oxidized redox state). NNT knockdown results in a decrease of oxidative phosphorylation while anaerobic glycolysis levels remain unchanged. Decreased oxidative phosphorylation was associated with a) inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) activity; b) reduction of NADH availability, c) decline of mitochondrial membrane potential, and d) decrease of ATP levels. Moreover, the alteration of redox status actually precedes the impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics. A possible mechanism could be that the activation of the redox-sensitive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and its translocation to the mitochondrion leads to the inhibition of PDH (upon phosphorylation) and induction of intrinsic apoptosis, resulting in decreased cell viability. This study supports the notion that oxidized cellular redox state and decline in cellular bioenergetics \u2013 as a consequence of NNT knockdown \u2013 cannot be viewed as independent events, but rather as an interdependent relationship coordinated by the mitochondrial energy-redox axis. Disruption of electron flux from fuel substrates to redox components due to NNT suppression induces not only mitochondrial dysfunction but also cellular disorders through redox-sensitive signaling.",

The following results were obtained: (1) BATM release large amounts of H2O2 in the coupled as well as in the uncoupled states, several times more than skeletal muscle mitochondria. (2) H2O2 release is especially large with acylcarnitines of medium-chain fatty acids (e.g. octanoylcarnitine). (3) Reverse electron transport does not contribute in a significant extent to the overall ROS generation. (4) Despite the large release of H2O2, the ROS-sensitive matrix enzyme aconitase is not inactivated during acylcarnitine oxidation. (5) In contrast to acylcarnitines, oxidation of \u03b1-glycerophosphate by BATM is characterized by large H2O2 release and a pronounced aconitase inactivation.

In this study, we investigated if ranolazine's protective effect against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury is mediated at the mitochondrial level and specifically if respiratory complex I (NADH Ubiquinone oxidoreductase) function is protected. We treated isolated and perfused guinea pig hearts with ranolazine just before 30\u00a0min ischemia and then isolated cardiac mitochondria at the end of 30\u00a0min ischemia and/or 30\u00a0min ischemia followed by 10\u00a0min reperfusion. We utilized spectrophotometric and histochemical techniques to assay complex I activity, Western blot analysis for complex I subunit NDUFA9, electron paramagnetic resonance for activity of complex I Fe\u2013S clusters, enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) for determination of protein acetylation, native gel histochemical staining for respiratory supercomplex assemblies, and high pressure liquid chromatography for cardiolipin integrity; cardiac function was measured during IR. Ranolazine treated hearts showed higher complex I activity and greater detectable complex I protein levels compared to untreated IR hearts. Ranolazine treatment also led to more normalized electron transfer via Fe\u2013S centers, supercomplex assembly and cardiolipin integrity. These improvements in complex I structure and function with ranolazine were associated with improved cardiac function after IR. However, these protective effects of ranolazine are not mediated by a direct action on mitochondria, but rather indirectly via cytosolic mechanisms that lead to less oxidation and better structural integrity of complex I.",

For R2 proteins from Ct and Mm, either grown in the presence of, or reconstituted with Mn and Fe ions, structural and electronic properties of higher valence MnFe and FeFe sites were determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and complementary techniques, in combination with bond-valence-sum and density functional theory calculations. At least ten different cofactor species could be tentatively distinguished. In Ct R2, two different Mn(IV)Fe(III) site configurations were assigned either L4MnIV(\u03bcO)2FeIIIL4 (metal\u2013metal distance of ~\u00a02.75\u00a0\u00c5, L = ligand) prevailing in metal-grown R2, or L4MnIV(\u03bcO)(\u03bcOH)FeIIIL4 (~\u00a02.90\u00a0\u00c5) dominating in metal-reconstituted R2.

Rapid X-ray photoreduction of iron and shorter metal\u2013metal distances in the high-valent states suggested radiation-induced modifications in most crystal structures of R2. The actual configuration of the MnFe and FeFe cofactors seems to depend on assembly sequences, bound metal type, valence state, and previous catalytic activity involving subunit R1.

     "abstract": "Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy at 1.4\u00a0K was used to investigate the spectral properties of red (long-wavelength) chlorophylls in trimeric Photosystem I (PSI) complexes from the cyanobacterium Arthrospira platensis. Three distinct red antenna states could be identified in the fluorescence spectra of single PSI trimers from A. platensis in the presence of oxidized P700. Two of them are responsible for broad emission bands centered at 726 and 760\u00a0nm. These bands are similar to those found in bulk fluorescence spectra measured at cryogenic temperatures. The broad fluorescence bands at \u2245\u00a0726 and \u2245\u00a0760\u00a0nm belong to individual emitters that are broadened by strong electron\u2013phonon coupling giving rise to a large Stokes-shift of about 20\u00a0nm and rapid spectral diffusion. An almost perpendicular orientation of the transition dipole moments of F726 and F760 has to be assumed because direct excitation energy transfer does not occur between F726 and F760. For the first time a third red state assigned to the pool absorbing around 708\u00a0nm could be detected by its zero-phonon lines. The center of the zero-phonon line distribution is found at \u2245\u00a0714\u00a0nm. The spectral properties of the three red antenna states show a high similarity to the red antenna states found in trimeric PSI of Thermosynechoccocus elongatus. Based on these findings a similar organization of the red antenna states in PSI of these two cyanobacteria is discussed.",

To unravel possible mechanisms by which volatile anesthetics modulate [Ca2\u00a0+]m and mitochondrial bioenergetics, with implications for cardioprotection, experiments were conducted to spectrofluorometrically measure concentration-dependent effects of isoflurane (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2\u00a0mM) on the magnitudes and time-courses of [Ca2\u00a0+]m and mitochondrial redox state (NADH), membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), respiration, and matrix volume. Isolated mitochondria from rat hearts were energized with 10\u00a0mM Na+- or K+-pyruvate/malate (NaPM or KPM) or Na+-succinate (NaSuc) followed by additions of isoflurane, 0.5\u00a0mM CaCl2 (\u2248\u00a0200\u00a0nM free Ca2\u00a0+ with 1\u00a0mM EGTA buffer), and 250\u00a0\u03bcM ADP. Isoflurane stepwise: (a) increased [Ca2\u00a0+]m in state 2 with NaPM, but not with KPM substrate, despite an isoflurane-induced slight fall in \u0394\u03a8m and a mild matrix expansion, and (b) decreased NADH oxidation, respiration, \u0394\u03a8m, and matrix volume in state 3, while prolonging the duration of state 3 NADH oxidation, respiration, \u0394\u03a8m, and matrix contraction with PM substrates. These findings suggest that isoflurane's effects are mediated in part at the mitochondrial level: (1) to enhance the net rate of state 2 Ca2\u00a0+ uptake by inhibiting the Na+/Ca2\u00a0+ exchanger (NCE), independent of changes in \u0394\u03a8m and matrix volume, and (2) to decrease the rates of state 3 electron transfer and ADP phosphorylation by inhibiting complex I. These direct effects of isoflurane to increase [Ca2\u00a0+]m, while depressing NCE activity and oxidative phosphorylation, could underlie the mechanisms by which isoflurane provides cardioprotection against IR injury at the mitochondrial level.",

     "abstract": "CO photolysis from fully reduced Paracoccus denitrificans aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase in the absence of O2 was studied by time-resolved potential electrometry. Surprisingly, photo dissociation of the uncharged carbon monoxide results in generation of a small-amplitude electric potential with the same sign as the physiological charge separation during activity. The number of electrogenic events after CO photolysis depends on the state of the enzyme. CO photolysis following immediately after activation by an enzymatic turnover, showed a two-component potential development. A fast (~\u00a01.5\u00a0\u03bcs) phase was followed by slower potential generation with a time constant varying from 8\u00a0\u03bcs at pH 7 to 250\u00a0\u03bcs at pH 10. The amplitude of the fast phase was independent of the time of incubation after enzyme activation, whereas the slower phase vanished with a time constant of ~\u00a025\u00a0min. CO photolysis from enzyme that had not undergone a prior single turnover showed the fast phase, but the amplitude of the slow phase was reduced to 10\u201330%. The amplitude of the fast phase corresponds to charge movement of 0.83\u00a0\u00c5 perpendicular to the membrane dielectric, and is independent of the time after enzyme activation. Thus it can be used as an internal ruler for normalization of the electrogenic responses of CcO. The slow phase was absent in the K354M mutant with a blocked proton-conducting K channel. We propose that CO photolysis increases the pK of the K354 residue, which results in its partial protonation, and generation of electric potential.",

The suppression was recovered slowly in a week after PG re-addition. Measurements of fluorescence yield indicated the enhanced sensitivity of QB to the inactivation by BQ. It is assumed that the loss of low-affinity PG (PGL) enhances the affinity for BQ that inactivates QB. 2) Oxygen evolution without BQ, supported by the endogenous electron acceptors, was slowly suppressed due to the direct inactivation of QB during 10\u00a0days of PG depletion, and was recovered rapidly within 10\u00a0h upon the PG re-addition. It is concluded that the loss of high-affinity PG (PGH) displaces QB directly. 3) Electron microscopy images of PG-depleted cells showed the specific suppression of division of mutant cells, which had developed thylakoid membranes attaching phycobilisomes (PBS). 4) Although the PG-depletion for 14\u00a0days decreased the chlorophyll/PBS ratio to about 1/4, florescence spectra/lifetimes were not modified indicating the flexible energy transfer from PBS to different numbers of PSII. Longer PG-depletion enhanced allophycocyanin fluorescence at 683\u00a0nm with a long 1.2\u00a0ns lifetime indicating the suppression of energy transfer from PBS to PSII. 5) Action sites of PGH, PGL and other PG molecules on PSII structure are discussed.",

To characterize the eco-physiological properties of this calciphilic red alga, we examined the effects of long-term and short-term Ca2+ depletion on photosynthetic growth of the thallus and on the phycobilisome. Long-term culture experiments suggested that higher Ca2+ concentrations (>\u00a050\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) were required to sustain thallus growth and pigmentation of cells. In short-term Ca2+-depletion treatments, fluorescence derived from phycoerythrin (PE) fluctuated, although the absorption spectra of the thalli did not change. After 30\u00a0min of Ca2+ depletion, the fluorescence lifetime of PE became markedly longer, indicating that the energy transfer from PE to phycocyanin (PC) was suppressed. The fluorescence lifetime of PE returned to its original value within a short time after 4\u00a0h of Ca2+ depletion, however, energy transfer from PE to PC was still suppressed. This suggested that the excitation energy absorbed by PE was quenched during prolonged Ca2+ depletion. The efficient energy transfer from PC and allophycocyanin were unchanged during these treatments.",

Specific mutations cause overlap syndromes combining several phenotypes, but the mechanisms of their biochemical effects are largely unknown. The m.3376G\u00a0>\u00a0A transition leading to p.E24K substitution in ND1 with LHON/MELAS phenotype was modeled here in a homologous position (NuoH-E36K) in the Escherichia coli enzyme and it almost totally abolished complex I activity. The more conservative mutation NuoH-E36Q resulted in higher apparent Km for ubiquinone and diminished inhibitor sensitivity. A NuoH homolog of the m.3865A\u00a0>\u00a0G transition, which has been found concomitantly in the overlap syndrome patient with the m.3376G\u00a0>\u00a0A, had only a minor effect. Consequences of a primary LHON-mutation m.3460G\u00a0>\u00a0A affecting the same extramembrane loop as the m.3376G\u00a0>\u00a0A substitution were also studied in the E. coli model and were found to be mild. The results indicate that the overlap syndrome-associated m.3376G\u00a0>\u00a0A transition in MTND1 is the pathogenic mutation and m.3865A\u00a0>\u00a0G transition has minor, if any, effect on presentation of the disease. The kinetic effects of the NuoH-E36Q mutation suggest its proximity to the putative ubiquinone binding domain in 49\u00a0kD/PSST subunits. In all, m.3376G\u00a0>\u00a0A perturbs ubiquinone binding, a phenomenon found in LHON, and decreases the activity of fully assembled complex I as in MELAS.",

We further show that decoupling is generally followed by disassembly of the antenna complexes and/or their detachment from the thylakoid membrane. Based on a previously proposed mechanism, we suggest that local heat transients generated in the PBSs by non-radiative energy dissipation lead to alterations in thermo-labile elements, likely in certain rod and core linker polypeptides. These alterations disrupt the transfer of excitation energy within and from the PBSs and destabilize the antenna complexes and/or promote their dissociation from the reaction centers and from the thylakoid membranes.

In Rba. veldkampii only monomeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes are assembled in the photosynthetic membrane, whereas in Rba. sphaeroides and Rba. blasticus a dimeric form is also assembled in which two RCs are surrounded by an S-shaped LH1 antenna. The present work established that dimeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes can also be isolated from Rba. azotoformans and Rba. changlensis, but not from Rba. capsulatus or Rba. vinaykumarii. The compositions of the monomers and dimers isolated from these four species of Rhodobacter were similar to those of the well-characterised RC\u2013LH1 complexes present in Rba. sphaeroides. Pigment proteins were also isolated from strains of Rba. sphaeroides expressing chimeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes. Replacement of either the Rba. sphaeroides LH1 antenna or PufX with its counterpart from Rba. capsulatus led to a loss of the dimeric form of the RC\u2013LH1 complex, but the monomeric form had a largely unaltered composition, even in strains in which the expression level of LH1 relative to the RC was reduced. The chimeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes were also functional, supporting bacterial growth under photosynthetic conditions. The findings help to tease apart the different functions of PufX in different species of Rhodobacter, and a specific protein structural arrangement that allows PufX to fulfil these three functions is proposed.",

Direct electron transfer between these proteins is not coupled to ATP synthesis and should be avoided in most physiological conditions. However, under low energy-requiring conditions an uncoupled high rate of oxygen consumption would be beneficial, as it would prevent overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In mitochondria from high energy-requiring, logarithmic-growth phase cells, most NDH2e was associated to cytochrome c oxidase and electrons from NADH were channeled to the cytochromic pathway. In contrast, in the low energy requiring, late stationary-growth phase, complex IV concentration decreased, the cells overexpressed NDH2e and thus a large fraction of this enzyme was found in a non-associated form. Also, the NDH2e\u2013AOX uncoupled pathway was activated and the state IV external NADH-dependent production of ROS decreased. Association/dissociation of NDH2e to/from complex IV is proposed to be the switch that channels electrons from external NADH to the coupled cytochrome pathway or allows them to reach an uncoupled, alternative, \u0394\u03a8-independent pathway.",

Addition of idebenone to HQB17 cells caused mitochondrial depolarization and NADH depletion, which were inhibited by cyclosporin (Cs) A and decylubiquinone, suggesting an involvement of the permeability transition pore (PTP). On the other hand, addition of dithiothreitol together with idebenone did not cause PTP opening and allowed maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential even in the presence of rotenone. Addition of dithiothreitol plus idebenone, or of idebenol, to HQB17, RJ206 and XTC.UC1 cells sustained membrane potential in intact cells and ATP synthesis in permeabilized cells even in the presence of rotenone and malonate, and restored a good level of coupled respiration in complex I-deficient XTC.UC1 cells.

Whereas no growth was observed with acetate as sole carbon source, the \u0394F1FO mutant reached 47% of the growth rate and 65% of the biomass of the wild type during shake-flask cultivation in glucose minimal medium. Initially, the mutant strain showed a strongly increased glucose uptake rate accompanied by a high oxygen consumption rate and pyruvate secretion into the medium. When oxygen became limiting, the glucose consumption rate was reduced below that of the wild type and pyruvate was consumed again. The \u0394F1FO mutant had increased levels of b- and d-type cytochromes and a significantly increased proton motive force. Transcription of genes involved in central carbon metabolism was essentially unchanged, whereas genes for cytochrome bd oxidase, pyruvate:quinone oxidoreductase, oxidative stress response, and others showed increased mRNA levels. On the other hand, genes for amino acid biosynthesis and ribosomal proteins as well as many genes involved in transport displayed decreased mRNA levels. Several of the transcriptional changes were reflected at the protein level, but there were also discrepancies between the mRNA and protein levels suggesting some kind of posttranscriptional regulation. The results prove for the first time that F1FO-ATP synthase and oxidative phosphorylation are in general not essential for growth of C. glutamicum.",

     "abstract": "The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as side products of aerobic metabolism in the mitochondria is an unavoidable consequence. As the capacity of organisms to deal with this exposure declines with age, accumulation of molecular damage caused by ROS has been defined as one of the central events during the ageing process in biological systems as well as in numerous diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Dementia.In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, an ageing model with a clear defined mitochondrial etiology of ageing, in addition to the mitochondrial aconitase the ATP synthase alpha subunit was defined recently as a hot spot for oxidative modifications induced by ROS. In this report we show, that this reactivity is not randomly distributed over the ATP Synthase, but is channeled to a single tryptophan residue 503. This residue serves as an intra-molecular quencher for oxidative species and might also be involved in the metabolic perception of oxidative stress or regulation of enzyme activity. A putative metal binding site in the proximity of this tryptophan residue appears to be crucial for the molecular mechanism for the selective targeting of oxidative damage.",

PSII is organized into large supercomplexes with variable amounts of membrane-bound peripheral antenna complexes. These supercomplexes are dimeric and contain usually 2\u20134 copies of trimeric LHCII complexes and have a further tendency to associate into megacomplexes or into crystalline domains, of which several types have been characterized. This review focuses on the overall composition and structure of the PSII supercomplex of green plants and its organization and interactions within the photosynthetic membrane. Further, we present the current knowledge how the thylakoid membrane is three-dimensionally organized within the chloroplast.

We have also performed co-expression analysis of the genes encoding PSII proteins to see if the low molecular mass proteins form a specific sub-group within the Photosystem II complex.

     "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII), the thylakoid membrane enzyme which uses sunlight to oxidize water to molecular oxygen, holds many organic and inorganic redox cofactors participating in the electron transfer reactions. Among them, two tyrosine residues, Tyr-Z and Tyr-D are found on the oxidizing side of PSII. Both tyrosines demonstrate similar spectroscopic features while their kinetic characteristics are quite different. Tyr-Z, which is bound to the D1 core protein, acts as an intermediate in electron transfer between the primary donor, P680 and the CaMn4 cluster. In contrast, Tyr-D, which is bound to the D2 core protein, does not participate in linear electron transfer in PSII and stays fully oxidized during PSII function. The phenolic oxygens on both tyrosines form well-defined hydrogen bonds to nearby histidine residues, HisZ and HisD respectively. These hydrogen bonds allow swift and almost activation less movement of the proton between respective tyrosine and histidine. This proton movement is critical and the phenolic proton from the tyrosine is thought to toggle between the tyrosine and the histidine in the hydrogen bond. It is found towards the tyrosine when this is reduced and towards the histidine when the tyrosine is oxidized. The proton movement occurs at both room temperature and ultra low temperature and is sensitive to the pH. Essentially it has been found that when the pH is below the pKa for respective histidine the function of the tyrosine is slowed down or, at ultra low temperature, halted. This has important consequences for the function also of the CaMn4 complex and the protonation reactions as the critical Tyr\u2013His hydrogen bond also steer a multitude of reactions at the CaMn4 cluster. This review deals with the discovery and functional assignments of the two tyrosines. The pH dependent phenomena involved in oxidation and reduction of respective tyrosine is covered in detail.

The catalytic site, including the inorganic Mn4CaOnHx core and its protein environment, is denoted as oxygen-evolving complex (OEC). Earlier and recent progress in the endeavor to elucidate the structure of the OEC is reviewed, with focus on recent results obtained by (i) X-ray spectroscopy (specifically by EXAFS analyses), and (ii) X-ray diffraction (XRD, protein crystallography). Very recently, an impressive resolution of 1.9\u00a0\u00c5 has been achieved by XRD. Most likely however, all XRD data on the Mn4CaOnHx core of the OEC are affected by X-ray induced modifications (radiation damage). Therefore and to address (important) details of the geometric and electronic structure of the OEC, a combined analysis of XRD and XAS data has been approached by several research groups. These efforts are reviewed and extended using an especially comprehensive approach. Taking into account XRD results on the protein environment of the inorganic core of the Mn complex, 12 alternative OEC models are considered and evaluated by quantitative comparison to (i) extended-range EXAFS data, (ii) polarized EXAFS of partially oriented PSII membrane particles, and (iii) polarized EXAFS of PSII crystals. We conclude that there is a class of OEC models that is in good agreement with both the recent crystallographic models and the XAS data. On these grounds, mechanistic implications for the OO bond formation chemistry are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II.",

Besides light absorption, these proteins catalyze photoprotective reactions which allowed functioning of oxygenic photosynthetic machinery in the increasingly oxidant environment. In this work we review current knowledge of LHC proteins serving Photosystem II. Balance between light harvesting and photoprotection is critical in Photosystem II, due to the lower quantum efficiency as compared to Photosystem I.

     "abstract": "Photoprotective mechanisms have evolved in photosynthetic organisms to cope with fluctuating light conditions. Under high irradiance, the production of dangerous oxygen species is stimulated and causes photo-oxidative stress. One of these photoprotective mechanisms, non photochemical quenching (qE), decreases the excess absorbed energy arriving at the reaction centers by increasing thermal dissipation at the level of the antenna. In this review we describe results leading to the discovery of this process in cyanobacteria (qEcya), which is mechanistically distinct from its counterpart in plants, and recent progress in the elucidation of this mechanism. The cyanobacterial photoactive soluble orange carotenoid protein is essential for the triggering of this photoprotective mechanism. Light induces structural changes in the carotenoid and the protein leading to the formation of a red active form. The activated red form interacts with the phycobilisome, the cyanobacterial light-harvesting antenna, and induces a decrease of the phycobilisome fluorescence emission and of the energy arriving to the reaction centers. The orange carotenoid protein is the first photoactive protein to be identified that contains a carotenoid as the chromophore. Moreover, its photocycle is completely different from those of other photoactive proteins. A second protein, called the Fluorescence Recovery Protein encoded by the slr1964 gene in Synechocystis PCC 6803, plays a key role in dislodging the red orange carotenoid protein from the phycobilisome and in the conversion of the free red orange carotenoid protein to the orange, inactive, form. This protein is essential to recover the full antenna capacity under low light conditions after exposure to high irradiance. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II.",

The physiological need for photoprotection of photosystem II and the concept of feed-back control of excess light energy are described. The outline of the major component of nonphotochemical quenching, qE, is suggested to comprise four key elements: trigger (\u0394pH), site (antenna), mechanics (antenna dynamics) and quencher(s). The current understanding of the identity and role of these qE components is presented. Existing opinions on the involvement of protons, different LHCII antenna complexes, the PsbS protein and different xanthophylls are reviewed. The evidence for LHCII aggregation and macrostructural reorganization of photosystem II and their role in qE are also discussed. The models describing the qE locus in LHCII complexes, the pigments involved and the evidence for structural dynamics within single monomeric antenna complexes are reviewed. We suggest how PsbS and xanthophylls may exert control over qE by controlling the affinity of LHCII complexes for protons with reference to the concepts of hydrophobicity, allostery and hysteresis. Finally, the physics of the proposed chlorophyll\u2013chlorophyll and chlorophyll\u2013xanthophyll mechanisms of energy quenching is explained and discussed.

     "abstract": "Photoprotection of photosystem II (PSII) is essential to avoid the light-induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus due to the formation of reactive oxygen species (=\u00a0photo-oxidative stress) under excess light. Carotenoids are known to play a crucial role in these processes based on their property to deactivate triplet chlorophyll (3Chl\u204e) and singlet oxygen (1O2\u204e). Xanthophylls are further assumed to be involved either directly or indirectly in the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of excess light energy in the antenna of PSII. This review gives an overview on recent progress in the understanding of the photoprotective role of the xanthophylls zeaxanthin (which is formed in the light in the so-called xanthophyll cycle) and lutein with emphasis on the NPQ processes associated with PSII of higher plants. The current knowledge supports the view that the photoprotective role of Lut is predominantly restricted to its function in the deactivation of 3Chl\u204e, while zeaxanthin is the major player in the deactivation of excited singlet Chl (1Chl\u204e) and thus in NPQ (non-photochemical quenching). Additionally, zeaxanthin serves important functions as an antioxidant in the lipid phase of the membrane and is likely to act as a key component in the memory of the chloroplast with respect to preceding photo-oxidative stress.

     "abstract": "The thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms, which are the sites of oxygenic photosynthesis, are composed of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The identification of many genes involved in the biosynthesis of each lipid class over the past decade has allowed the generation and isolation of mutants of various photosynthetic organisms incapable of synthesizing specific lipids. Numerous studies using such mutants have revealed that deficiency of these lipids primarily affects the structure and function of photosystem II (PSII) but not of photosystem I (PSI). Recent X-ray crystallographic analyses of PSII and PSI complexes from Thermosynechococcus elongatus revealed the presence of 25 and 4 lipid molecules per PSII and PSI monomer, respectively, indicating the enrichment of lipids in PSII. Therefore, lipid molecules bound to PSII may play special roles in the assembly and functional regulation of the PSII complex. This review summarizes our present understanding of the biochemical and physiological roles of lipids in photosynthesis, with a special focus on PSII.

     "abstract": "Light induced damage of the photosynthetic apparatus is an important and highly complex phenomenon, which affects primarily the Photosystem II complex. Here the author summarizes the current state of understanding of the molecular mechanisms, which are involved in the light induced inactivation of Photosystem II electron transport together with the relevant mechanisms of photoprotection. Short wavelength ultraviolet radiation impairs primarily the Mn4Ca catalytic site of the water oxidizing complex with additional effects on the quinone electron acceptors and tyrosine donors of PSII. The main mechanism of photodamage by visible light appears to be mediated by acceptor side modifications, which develop under conditions of excess excitation in which the capacity of light-independent photosynthetic processes limits the utilization of electrons produced in the initial photoreactions. This situation of excess excitation facilitates the reduction of intersystem electron carriers and Photosystem II acceptors, and thereby induces the formation of reactive oxygen species, especially singlet oxygen whose production is sensitized by triplet chlorophyll formation in the reaction center of Photosystem II. The highly reactive singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species, such as H2O2 and O2\u2212, which can also be formed in Photosystem II initiate damage of electron transport components and protein structure. In parallel with the excess excitation dependent mechanism of photodamage inactivation of the Mn4Ca cluster by visible light may also occur, which impairs electron transfer through the Photosystem II complex and initiates further functional and structural damage of the reaction center via formation of highly oxidizing radicals, such as P680+ and Tyr-Z+. However, the available data do not support the hypothesis that the Mn-dependent mechanism would be the exclusive or dominating pathway of photodamage in the visible spectral range.

     "abstract": "Photosystem II (PSII) is a multisubunit protein complex in cyanobacteria, algae and plants that use light energy for oxidation of water and reduction of plastoquinone. The conversion of excitation energy absorbed by chlorophylls into the energy of separated charges and subsequent water\u2013plastoquinone oxidoreductase activity are inadvertently coupled with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Singlet oxygen is generated by the excitation energy transfer from triplet chlorophyll formed by the intersystem crossing from singlet chlorophyll and the charge recombination of separated charges in the PSII antenna complex and reaction center of PSII, respectively. Apart to the energy transfer, the electron transport associated with the reduction of plastoquinone and the oxidation of water is linked to the formation of superoxide anion radical, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. To protect PSII pigments, proteins and lipids against the oxidative damage, PSII evolved a highly efficient antioxidant defense system comprising either a non-enzymatic (prenyllipids such as carotenoids and prenylquinols) or an enzymatic (superoxide dismutase and catalase) scavengers. It is pointed out here that both the formation and the scavenging of ROS are controlled by the energy level and the redox potential of the excitation energy transfer and the electron transport carries, respectively. The review is focused on the mechanistic aspects of ROS production and scavenging by PSII. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Photosystem II.",

     "abstract": "In higher plants, the photosystem (PS) II core and its several light harvesting antenna (LHCII) proteins undergo reversible phosphorylation cycles according to the light intensity. High light intensity induces strong phosphorylation of the PSII core proteins and suppresses the phosphorylation level of the LHCII proteins. Decrease in light intensity, in turn, suppresses the phosphorylation of PSII core, but strongly induces the phosphorylation of LHCII. Reversible and differential phosphorylation of the PSII-LHCII proteins is dependent on the interplay between the STN7 and STN8 kinases, and the respective phosphatases. The STN7 kinase phosphorylates the LHCII proteins and to a lesser extent also the PSII core proteins D1, D2 and CP43. The STN8 kinase, on the contrary, is rather specific for the PSII core proteins. Mechanistically, the PSII-LHCII protein phosphorylation is required for optimal mobility of the PSII-LHCII protein complexes along the thylakoid membrane. Physiologically, the phosphorylation of LHCII is a prerequisite for sufficient excitation of PSI, enabling the excitation and redox balance between PSII and PSI under low irradiance, when excitation energy transfer from the LHCII antenna to the two photosystems is efficient and thermal dissipation of excitation energy (NPQ) is minimised. The importance of PSII core protein phosphorylation is manifested under highlight when the photodamage of PSII is rapid and phosphorylation is required to facilitate the migration of damaged PSII from grana stacks to stroma lamellae for repair. The importance of thylakoid protein phosphorylation is highlighted under fluctuating intensity of light where the STN7 kinase dependent balancing of electron transfer is a prerequisite for optimal growth and development of the plant.

     "abstract": "The Photosystem (PS) II of cyanobacteria, green algae and higher plants is prone to light-induced inactivation, the D1 protein being the primary target of such damage. As a consequence, the D1 protein, encoded by the psbA gene, is degraded and re-synthesized in a multistep process called PSII repair cycle. In cyanobacteria, a small gene family codes for the various, functionally distinct D1 isoforms. In these organisms, the regulation of the psbA gene expression occurs mainly at the level of transcription, but the expression is fine-tuned by regulation of translation elongation. In plants and green algae, the D1 protein is encoded by a single psbA gene located in the chloroplast genome. In chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii the psbA gene expression is strongly regulated by mRNA processing, and particularly at the level of translation initiation. In chloroplasts of higher plants, translation elongation is the prevalent mechanism for regulation of the psbA gene expression. The pre-existing pool of psbA transcripts forms translation initiation complexes in plant chloroplasts even in darkness, while the D1 synthesis can be completed only in the light. Replacement of damaged D1 protein requires also the assistance by a number of auxiliary proteins, which are encoded by the nuclear genome in green algae and higher plants. Nevertheless, many of these chaperones are conserved between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here, we describe the specific features and fundamental differences of the psbA gene expression and the regeneration of the PSII reaction center protein D1 in cyanobacteria, green algae and higher plants.

For this, we have used 2D NMR spectroscopy to study the binding of Mg(II) ions and the isolated luminal domain of PsaF to 15\u00a0N-labelled Pc. From the chemical-shift perturbations in the 1H-15\u00a0N HSQC spectra, dissociation constants of (4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7) mM and (1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2) mM were determined for the Pc-Mg(II) and Pc-PsaF complexes, respectively. In both cases, significant chemical-shift changes were observed for Pc backbone amide groups belonging to the two acidic patches, residues 42\u201345 and 59\u201361. In addition, competitive effects were observed upon the addition of Mg(II) ions to the Pc-PsaF complex, further strengthening that Mg(II) and PsaF bind to the same region on Pc. To structurally elucidate the Mg(II) binding site we have utilized Mn(II) as a paramagnetic analogue of Mg(II). The paramagnetic relaxation enhancement induced by Mn(II) results in line broadening in the Pc HSQC spectra which can be used to estimate distances between the bound ion and the affected nuclear spins. The calculations suggest a location of the bound Mn(II) ion close to Glu43 in the lower acidic patch, and most likely in the form of a hexaquo complex embedded within the hydration shell of Pc. The results presented here suggest a specific binding site for Mg(II) that may regulate the binding of Pc to photosystem 1 in vivo.",

     "abstract": "The aim of our study was to analyze a distribution of metabolic flux controls of all mitochondrial complexes of ATP-Synthasome and mitochondrial creatine kinase (MtCK) in situ in permeabilized cardiac cells. For this we used their specific inhibitors to measure flux control coefficients (CviJATP) in two different systems: A) direct stimulation of respiration by ADP and B) activation of respiration by coupled MtCK reaction in the presence of MgATP and creatine. In isolated mitochondria the CviJATP were for system A: Complex I - 0.19, Complex III \u2013 0.06, Complex IV 0.18, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) \u2013 0.11, ATP synthase \u2013 0.01, Pi carrier - 0.20, and the sum of CviJATP was 0.75. In the presence of 10\u00a0mM creatine (system B) the CviJATP were 0.38 for ANT and 0.80 for MtCK. In the permeabilized cardiomyocytes inhibitors had to be added in much higher final concentration, and the following values of CviJATP were determined for condition A and B, respectively: Complex I - 0.20 and 0.64, Complex III - 0.41 and 0.40, Complex IV - 0.40 and 0.49, ANT - 0.20 and 0.92, ATP synthase - 0.065 and 0.38, Pi carrier - 0.06 and 0.06, MtCK 0.95.

     "abstract": "Flavonoids can protect cells from different insults that lead to mitochondria-mediated cell death, and epidemiological data show that some of these compounds attenuate the progression of diseases associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In this work, a screening of 5 flavonoids representing major subclasses showed that they display different effects on H2O2 production by mitochondria isolated from rat brain and heart. Quercetin, kaempferol and epicatechin are potent inhibitors of H2O2 production by mitochondria from both tissues (IC50\u00a0\u2248\u00a01\u20132\u00a0\u03bcM), even when H2O2 production rate was stimulated by the mitochondrial inhibitors rotenone and antimycin A. Although the rate of oxygen consumption was unaffected by concentrations up to 10\u00a0\u03bcM of these flavonoids, quercetin, kaempferol and apigenin inhibited complex I activity, while up to 100\u00a0\u03bcM epicatechin produced less than 20% inhibition. The extent of this inhibition was found to be dependent on the concentration of coenzyme Q in the medium, suggesting competition between the flavonoids and ubiquinone for close binding sites in the complex. In contrast, these flavonoids did not significantly inhibit the activity of complexes II and III, and did not affect the redox state of complex IV. However, we have found that epicatechin, quercetin and kaempferol are able to stoichiometrically reduce purified cytochrome c. Our results reveal that mitochondria are a plausible main target of flavonoids mediating, at least in part, their reported preventive actions against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction-associated pathologies.",

     "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption results in hepatotoxicity, steatosis, hypoxia, increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and decreased activities of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes. The impact of these changes on cellular respiration and their interaction in a cellular setting is not well understood. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO)-dependent modulation of cellular respiration and the sensitivity to hypoxic stress is increased following chronic alcohol consumption. This is important since NO has been shown to regulate mitochondrial function through its interaction with cytochrome c oxidase, although at higher concentrations, and in combination with reactive oxygen species, can result in mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that hepatocytes isolated from alcohol-fed rats had decreased mitochondrial bioenergetic reserve capacity and were more sensitive to NO-dependent inhibition of respiration under room air and hypoxic conditions. We reasoned that this would result in greater hypoxic stress in vivo, and to test this, wild-type and iNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice were administered alcohol-containing diets. Chronic alcohol consumption resulted in liver hypoxia in the wild-type mice and increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 in the peri-venular region of the liver lobule. These effects were attenuated in the alcohol-fed iNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice suggesting that increased mitochondrial sensitivity to NO and reactive nitrogen species in hepatocytes and iNOS plays a critical role in determining the response to hypoxic stress in vivo. These data support the concept that the combined effects of NO and ethanol contribute to an increased susceptibility to hypoxia and the deleterious effects of alcohol consumption on liver.",

The band position of the negative signature points to a transient deprotonation of Asp-97. In addition, the pH dependence of the acidic photocycle was investigated.

     "abstract": "High light poses a threat to oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Similar to eukaryotes, cyanobacteria evolved a photoprotective mechanism, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), which dissipates excess absorbed energy as heat. An orange carotenoid protein (OCP) has been implicated as a blue-green light sensor that induces NPQ in cyanobacteria. Discovered in vitro, this process involves a light-induced transformation of the OCP from its dark, orange form (OCPo) to a red, active form, however, the mechanisms of NPQ in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we show that the formation of the quenching state in vivo is a multistep process that involves both photoinduced and dark reactions. Our kinetic analysis of the NPQ process reveals that the light induced conversion of OCPo to a quenching state (OCPq) proceeds via an intermediate, non-quenching state (OCPi), and this reaction sequence can be described by a three-state kinetic model. The conversion of OCPo to OCPi is a photoinduced process with the effective absorption cross section of 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0\u00c52 at 470\u00a0nm. The transition from OCPi to OCPq is a dark reaction, with the first order rate constant of ~\u00a00.1\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and the activation energy of 21\u00a0kcal/mol. These characteristics suggest that the reaction rate may be limited by cis-trans proline isomerization of Gln224\u2013Pro225 or Pro225\u2013Pro226, located at a loop near the carotenoid. NPQ decreases the functional absorption cross-section of Photosystem II, suggesting that formation of the quenched centers reduces the flux of absorbed energy from phycobilisomes to the reaction centers by ~\u00a050%.",

     "abstract": "We have investigated the mechanism of rat-selective induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) by norbormide (NRB). We show that the inducing effect of NRB on the PT (i) is inhibited by the selective ligands of the 18\u00a0kDa outer membrane (OMM) translocator protein (TSPO, formerly peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) protoporphyrin IX, N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide and 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one; and (ii) is lost in digitonin mitoplasts, which lack an intact OMM. In mitoplasts the PT can still be induced by the NRB cationic derivative OL14, which contrary to NRB is also effective in intact mitochondria from mouse and guinea pig. We conclude that selective NRB transport into rat mitochondria occurs via TSPO in the OMM, which allows its translocation to PT-regulating sites in the inner membrane. Thus, species-specificity of NRB toward the rat PT depends on subtle differences in the structure of TSPO or of TSPO-associated proteins affecting its substrate specificity.",

     "abstract": "The respiratory cytochrome bc1 complex is a fundamental enzyme in biological energy conversion. It couples electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c with generation of proton motive force which fuels ATP synthesis. The complex from the \u03b1-proteobacterium Paracoccus denitrificans, a model for the medically relevant mitochondrial complexes, lacked structural characterization. We show by LILBID mass spectrometry that truncation of the organism-specific, acidic N-terminus of cytochrome c1 changes the oligomerization state of the enzyme to a dimer. The fully functional complex was crystallized and the X-ray structure determined at 2.7-\u00c5 resolution. It has high structural homology to mitochondrial complexes and to the Rhodobacter sphaeroides complex especially for subunits cytochrome b and ISP. Species-specific binding of the inhibitor stigmatellin is noteworthy. Interestingly, cytochrome c1 shows structural differences to the mitochondrial and even between the two Rhodobacteraceae complexes. The structural diversity in the cytochrome c1 surface facing the ISP domain indicates low structural constraints on that surface for formation of a productive electron transfer complex. A similar position of the acidic N-terminal domains of cytochrome c1 and yeast subunit QCR6p is suggested in support of a similar function. A model of the electron transfer complex with membrane-anchored cytochrome c552, the natural substrate, shows that it can adopt the same orientation as the soluble substrate in the yeast complex. The full structural integrity of the P. denitrificans variant underpins previous mechanistic studies on intermonomer electron transfer and paves the way for using this model system to address open questions of structure/function relationships and inhibitor binding.",

Only three out of the five tyrosine residues of human Cc, namely those at positions 67, 74 and 97, have been detected in vivo as nitrotyrosines. However, nitration of the two other tyrosines, namely those at positions 46 and 48, has never been detected in vivo despite they are both well-exposed to solvent. Here we investigate the changes in heme coordination and alkaline transition, along with the peroxidase activity and in cell degradation of Cc mutants in which all their tyrosine residues \u2013 with the only exception of that at position 46 or 48 \u2013 are replaced by phenylalanines. In Jurkat cell extracts devoid of proteases inhibitors, only the high-spin iron nitrated forms of these monotyrosine mutants are degraded.

     "abstract": "Complex I (CI) of the oxidative phosphorylation system is assembled from 45 subunits encoded by both the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. Defective mitochondrial translation is a major cause of mitochondrial disorders and proper understanding of its mechanisms and consequences is fundamental to rational treatment design. Here, we used a live cell approach to assess its consequences on CI assembly. The approach consisted of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) imaging of the effect of mitochondrial translation inhibition by chloramphenicol (CAP) on the dynamics of AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits NDUFV1, NDUFS3, NDUFA2 and NDUFB6 and assembly factor NDUFAF4. CAP increased the mobile fraction of the subunits, but not NDUFAF4, and decreased the amount of CI, demonstrating that CI is relatively immobile and does not associate with NDUFAF4. CAP increased the recovery kinetics of NDUFV1-AcGFP1 to the same value as obtained with AcGFP1 alone, indicative of the removal of unbound NDUFV1 from the mitochondrial matrix. Conversely, CAP decreased the mobility of NDUFS3-AcGFP1 and, to a lesser extent, NDUFB6-AcGFP1, suggestive of their enrichment in less mobile subassemblies. Little, if any, change in mobility of NDUFA2-AcGFP1 could be detected, suggesting that the dynamics of this accessory subunit of the matrix arm remains unaltered. Finally, CAP increased the mobility of NDUFAF4\u2013AcGFP1, indicative of interaction with a more mobile membrane-bound subassembly.

     "abstract": "Bacterial physiological responses integrate energy-coupling processes at the membrane level with metabolic energy demand. The regulatory design behind these responses remains largely unexplored. Propionigenium modestum is an adequate organism to study these responses because it presents the simplest scheme known integrating membrane potential generation and metabolic ATP consumption. A hypothetical sodium leak is added to the scheme as the sole regulatory site. Allosteric regulation is assumed to be absent. Information of the rate equations is not available. However, relevant features of the patterns of responses may be obtained using Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) and Metabolic Control Design (MCD). With these tools, we show that membrane potential disturbances can be compensated by adjusting the leak flux, without significant perturbations of ATP consumption. Perturbations of membrane potential by ATP demand are inevitable and also require compensatory changes in the leak. Numerical simulations were performed with a kinetic model exhibiting the responses for small changes obtained with MCA and MCD. A modest leak (10% of input) was assumed for the reference state. We found that disturbances in membrane potential and ATP consumption, produced by environmental perturbations of the cation concentration, may be reverted to the reference state adjusting the leak. Leak changes can also compensate for undesirable effects on membrane potential produced by changes in nutrient availability or ATP demand, in a wide range of values. The system is highly robust to parameter fluctuations. The regulatory role of energy dissipating processes and the trade-off between energetic efficiency and regulatory capacity are discussed.",

The latter is a protein with \u03b2-barrel shape, which is suggested to have evolved from a porin-type protein. To obtain structural insights in the absence of a crystal structure the membrane topology of Tom40 from Neurospora crassa was determined by limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry. The results were interpreted on the basis of a structural model that has been generated for NcTom40 by using the structure of mouse VDAC-1 as a template and amino acid sequence information of ~\u00a0270 different Tom40 and ~\u00a0480 VDAC amino acid sequences for refinement. The model largely explains the observed accessible cleavage sites and serves as a structural basis for the investigation of physicochemical properties of the ensemble of our Tom40 sequence data set. By this means we discovered two conserved polar slides in the pore interior. One is possibly involved in the positioning of a pore-inserted helix; the other one might be important for mitochondrial pre-sequence peptide binding as it is only present in Tom40 but not in VDAC proteins. The outer surface of the Tom40 barrel reveals two conserved amino acid clusters. They may be involved in binding other components of the TOM complex or bridging components of the TIM machinery of the mitochondrial inner membrane.",

This work casts doubts over an earlier body of work in which these chemicals were used as spin traps for monitoring 1O2 production when PSII was inhibited by high light intensities.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor in heart failure (HF). We investigated whether the decrease in respirasome organization reported by us previously in cardiac mitochondria in HF is due to changes in the phospholipids of the mitochondrial inner membrane or modifications of the subunits of the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes. The contents of the main phospholipid species, including cardiolipin, as well as the molecular species of cardiolipin were unchanged in cardiac mitochondria in HF. Oxidized cardiolipin molecular species were not observed. In heart mitochondria isolated from HF, complex IV not incorporated into respirasomes exhibits increased threonine phosphorylation. Since HF is associated with increased adrenergic drive to cardiomyocytes, this increased protein phosphorylation might be explained by the involvement of cAMP-activated protein kinase. Does the preservation of cAMP-induced phosphorylation changes of mitochondrial proteins or the addition of exogenous cAMP have similar effects on oxidative phosphorylation? The usage of phosphatase inhibitors revealed a specific decrease in complex I-supported respiration with glutamate. In saponin-permeabilized cardiac fibers, pre-incubation with cAMP decreases oxidative phosphorylation due to a defect localized at complex IV of the ETC inter alia. We propose that phosphorylation of specific complex IV subunits decreases oxidative phosphorylation either by limiting the incorporation of complex IV in supercomplexes or by decreasing supercomplex stability.",

The increasing availability of numerous broadly sampled eukaryotic genomes now enables the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this large protein complex. Here, a combination of profile-based sequence comparisons and basic structural properties analyses at the protein level enabled to pinpoint homology relationships between complex I subunits from fungi, mammals or green plants, previously identified as \"lineage-specific\" subunits. In addition, homologs of at least 40 mammalian complex I subunits are present in representatives of all major eukaryote assemblages, half of them having not been investigated so far (Excavates, Chromalveolates, Amoebozoa). This analysis revealed that complex I was subject to a phenomenal increase in size that predated the diversification of extant eukaryotes, followed by very few lineage-specific additions/losses of subunits. The implications of this subunit conservation for studies of complex I are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome bd is a respiratory quinol:O2 oxidoreductase found in many prokaryotes, including a number of pathogens. The main bioenergetic function of the enzyme is the production of a proton motive force by the vectorial charge transfer of protons. The sequences of cytochromes bd are not homologous to those of the other respiratory oxygen reductases, i.e., the heme\u2013copper oxygen reductases or alternative oxidases (AOX). Generally, cytochromes bd are noteworthy for their high affinity for O2 and resistance to inhibition by cyanide. In E. coli, for example, cytochrome bd (specifically, cytochrome bd-I) is expressed under O2-limited conditions. Among the members of the bd-family are the so-called cyanide-insensitive quinol oxidases (CIO) which often have a low content of the eponymous heme d but, instead, have heme b in place of heme d in at least a majority of the enzyme population. However, at this point, no sequence motif has been identified to distinguish cytochrome bd (with a stoichiometric complement of heme d) from an enzyme designated as CIO. Members of the bd-family can be subdivided into those which contain either a long or a short hydrophilic connection between transmembrane helices 6 and 7 in subunit I, designated as the Q-loop. However, it is not clear whether there is a functional consequence of this difference. This review summarizes current knowledge on the physiological functions, genetics, structural and catalytic properties of cytochromes bd. Included in this review are descriptions of the intermediates of the catalytic cycle, the proposed site for the reduction of O2, evidence for a proton channel connecting this active site to the bacterial cytoplasm, and the molecular mechanism by which a membrane potential is generated.",

The [Fe3S4] composition is, however, of much lower natural abundance than the more typical [Fe4S4]-clusters. In the present study formation of [Fe3S4]-clusters has been examined using chemically synthesized model peptides consisting of 33 amino acids (maquettes). Maquettes are effective synthetic analogs for metal\u2013ion binding sites, allowing for a facile modification of the primary coordination sphere of iron\u2013sulfur clusters. Maquettes have been designed following the [FeS]-cluster-binding motif of dimethyl sulfoxide reductase subunit B (DmsB) from Escherichia coli that carries a [Fe4S4]-cluster, but incorporates a [Fe3S4]-cluster instead upon mutation of one of the coordinating cysteines. The time-dependent formation of iron\u2013sulfur clusters and the effects of exchanging selected amino acids in the model peptides, known to regulate the [Fe3S4] to [Fe4S4] ratio in the DmsB protein, were monitored by UV/Vis- and EPR-spectroscopy. Exchange of cysteines within the conserved CxxCxxC motif has a much stronger effect on cluster formation and stoichiometry than the exchange of a coordinating external cysteine. Amino acid exchange in the binding motif shows a dependence of the cluster stoichiometry on the amino acid side chain. Formation of [Fe3S4]-clusters in maquettes is less favorable compared to native proteins. The [Fe3S4] moiety appears to be a rather transient species towards the more stable (final) incorporation of a [Fe4S4]-cluster. Results are best described by an assembly mechanism that considers a successive coordination of the iron atoms by the peptide, rather than incorporation of an already pre-formed mercaptoethanol-coordinated [Fe4S4]-cluster.",

     "abstract": "A low static dielectric permittivity of proteins causes the low reorganization energies for the charge transfer reactions inside them. This reorganization energy does not depend on the pre-existing intraprotein electric field. The charge transferred inside the protein interacts with its aqueous surroundings; for many globular proteins, the effect of this surroundings on the reorganization energy is comparable with the effect of reorganization of the protein itself while for the charge transfer in the middle of membrane the aqueous phase plays a minor role. Reorganization energy depends strongly on the system considered, and hence there is no sense to speak on the \u201cprotein reorganization energy\u201d as some permanent characteristic parameter. We employed a simple algorithm for calculation of the medium reorganization energy using the numerical solution of the Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation. Namely, the reaction field energy was computed in two versions \u2014 all media having optical dielectric permittivity, and all the media with the static one; the difference of these two quantities gives the reorganization energy. We have calculated reorganization energies for electron transfer in cytochrome c, various ammine-ruthenated cytochromes c, azurin, ferredoxin, cytochrome c oxidase, complex of methylamine dehydrogenase with amicyanin, and for proton transfer in \u03b1-chymotrypsin. It is shown that calculation of the medium reorganization energy can be a useful tool in analysis of the mechanisms of the charge transfer reactions in proteins.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic microbial rhodopsins are widespread bacteriorhodopsin-like proteins found in many lower eukaryotic groups including fungi. Many fungi contain multiple rhodopsins, some significantly diverged from the original bacteriorhodopsin template. Although few fungal rhodopsins have been studied biophysically, both fast-cycling light-driven proton pumps and slow-cycling photosensors have been found. The purpose of this study was to characterize photochemically a new subgroup of fungal rhodopsins, the so-called auxiliary group. The study used the two known rhodopsin genes from the fungal wheat pathogen, Phaeosphaeria nodorum. One of the genes is a member of the auxiliary group while the other is highly similar to previously characterized proton-pumping Leptosphaeria rhodopsin. Auxiliary rhodopsin genes from a range of species form a distinct group with a unique primary structure and are located in carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster. Amino acid conservation pattern suggests that auxiliary rhodopsins retain the transmembrane core of bacteriorhodopsins, including all residues important for proton transport, but have unique polar intramembrane residues. Spectroscopic characterization of the two yeast-expressed Phaeosphaeria rhodopsins showed many similarities: absorption spectra, conformation of the retinal chromophore, fast photocycling, and carboxylic acid protonation changes. It is likely that both Phaeosphaeria rhodopsins are proton-pumping, at least in vitro. We suggest that auxiliary rhodopsins have separated from their ancestors fairly recently and have acquired the ability to interact with as yet unidentified transducers, performing a photosensory function without changing their spectral properties and basic photochemistry.",

The precise structural characterization of Chl-c3 from the haptophyte Emiliania huxleyi was performed. The conformations of the \u03c0-conjugated peripheral substituents, the 3-/8-vinyl, 7-methoxycarbonyl and 17-acrylate moieties were evaluated, in a solution, using nuclear Overhauser enhancement correlations and molecular modeling calculations. The rotation of the 17-acrylate residue was considerably restricted, whereas the other three substituents readily rotated at ambient temperature. Moreover, the stereochemistry at the 132-position was determined by combination of chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Compared with the CD spectra of the structurally related, synthetic (132R)- and (132S)-protochlorophyllide(PChlide)-a, naturally occurring Chl-c3 had exclusively the (132R)-configuration. To elucidate this natural selection of a single enantiomer, we analyzed the three major Chl-c pigments (Chl-c1, c2 and c3) in four phylogenetically distinct classes of Chl-c containing algae, i.e., heterokontophyta, dinophyta, cryptophyta and haptophyta using chiral HPLC. All the photosynthetic organisms contained only the (132R)-enantiomerically pure Chls-c, and lacked the corresponding enantiomeric (132S)-forms. Additionally, Chl-c2 was found in all the organisms as the common Chl-c. These results throw a light on the biosynthesis as well as photosynthetic function of Chl-c pigments: Chl-c2 is derived from 8-vinyl-PChlide-a by dehydrogenation of the 17-propionate to acrylate residues as generally proposed, and the (132R)-enantiomers of Chls-c function as photosynthetically active, light-harvesting pigments together with the principal Chl-a and carotenoids.",

We previously showed that UCP3 turns over rapidly in C2C12 myoblasts, with a half-life of 0.5\u20134\u00a0h, and that turnover can be reconstituted in vitro. We show here that rapid degradation of UCP3 in vitro in isolated brown adipose tissue mitochondria required the 26S proteasome, ubiquitin, ATP, succinate to generate a high membrane potential, and a pH of 7.4 or less. Ubiquitin containing lysine-48 was both necessary and sufficient to support UCP3 degradation, implying a requirement for polyubiquitylation at this residue. The 20S proteasome did not support degradation. UCP3 degradation was prevented by simultaneously blocking matrix ATP generation and import, showing that ATP in the mitochondrial matrix was required. Degradation did not appear to require a transmembrane pH gradient, but was very sensitive to membrane potential: degradation was halved when membrane potential decreased 10\u201320\u00a0mV from its resting value, and was not significant below about 120\u00a0mV. We propose that matrix ATP and a high membrane potential are needed for UCP3 to be polyubiquitylated through lysine-48 of ubiquitin and exported to the cytosolic 26S proteasome, where it is de-ubiquitylated and degraded.",

     "abstract": "The cooperative O2-binding of hemoglobin (Hb) have been assumed to correlate to change in the quaternary structures of Hb: T(deoxy)- and R(oxy)-quaternary structures, having low and high O2-affinities, respectively. Heterotropic allosteric effectors have been shown to interact not only with deoxy- but also oxy-Hbs causing significant reduction in their O2-affinities and the modulation of cooperativity. In the presence of two potent effectors, L35 and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) at pH 6.6, Hb exhibits extremely low O2-affinities (KT\u00a0=\u00a00.0085\u00a0mmHg\u22121 and KR\u00a0=\u00a00.011\u00a0mmHg\u22121) and thus a very low cooperativity (KR/KT\u00a0=\u00a01.3 and L0\u00a0=\u00a02.4). 1H-NMR spectra of human adult Hb with these two effectors were examined in order to determine the quaternary state of Hb in solution and to clarify the correlation between the O2-affinities and the structural change of Hb caused by the heterotropic effectors. At pH 6.9, 1H-NMR spectrum of deoxy-Hb in the presence of L35 and IHP showed a marker of the T-quaternary structure (the T-marker) at 14\u00a0ppm, originated from inter- dimeric \u03b11\u03b22- (or \u03b12\u03b21-) hydrogen-bonds, and hyperfine-shifted (hfs) signals around 15\u201325\u00a0ppm, caused by high-spin heme-Fe(II)s. Upon addition of O2, the hfs signals disappeared, reflecting that the heme-Fe(II)s are ligated with O2, but the T-marker signals still remained, although slightly shifted and broadened, under the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) of 760\u00a0mmHg. These NMR results accompanying with visible absorption spectroscopy and visible resonance Raman spectroscopy reveal that oxy-Hb in the presence of L35 and IHP below pH 7 takes the ligated T-quaternary structure under the PO2 of 760\u00a0mmHg. The L35-concentration dependence of the T-marker in the presence of IHP indicates that there are more than one kind of L35-binding sites in the ligated T-quaternary structure. The stronger binding sites are probably intra-dimeric binding sites between \u03b11G- and \u03b21G-helices, and the other weaker binding site causes the R\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transition without release of O2. The fluctuation of the tertiary structure of Hb seems to be caused by both the structural perturbation of \u03b11\u03b21 (or \u03b12\u03b22) intra-dimeric interface, where the stronger L35-binding sites exist, and by the IHP-binding to the \u03b11\u03b12- (or \u03b21\u03b22-) cavity. The tertiary structural fluctuation induced by the allosteric effectors may contribute to the significant reduction of the O2-affinity of oxy-Hb, which little depends on the quaternary structures. Therefore, the widely held assumptions of the structure-function correlation of Hb \u2014 [the deoxy-state]\u00a0=\u00a0[the T-quaternary structure]\u00a0=\u00a0[the low O2-affinity state] and [the oxy-state]\u00a0=\u00a0[the R-quaternary structure]\u00a0=\u00a0[the high O2-affinity state] and the O2-affiny of Hb being regulated by the T/R-quaternary structural transition \u2014 are no longer sustainable.

Although the extensive body of structural and functional information available is by-and-large consistent with this conceptual framework, some discrepancies between theory and experiment have been extensively discussed and considered to demand modifications of the original hypothesis. More recently the role of tertiary structural changes has been re-analyzed leading to extended kinetic models or indicating that powerful heterotropic effectors may be of paramount importance in controlling the function of human hemoglobin. The aim of this review is to analyze, and possibly reconcile, some discrepancies. We always felt that by looking at hemoglobins other than human HbA, the relative role of tertiary and quaternary allosteric effects may be better understood. The model systems illustrated below are the different hemoglobins from trout's blood, since they are characterized by the most striking variability of heterotropic effects, ranging from totally absent to very extreme with dominant contributions of tertiary effects.

     "abstract": "The D-pathway in A-type cytochrome c oxidases conducts protons from a conserved aspartate on the negatively charged N-side of the membrane to a conserved glutamic acid at about the middle of the membrane dielectric. Extensive work in the past has indicated that all four protons pumped across the membrane on reduction of O2 to water are transferred via the D-pathway, and that it is also responsible for transfer of two out of the four \u201cchemical protons\u201d from the N-side to the binuclear oxygen reduction site to form product water. The function of the D-pathway has been discussed in terms of an apparent pKa of the glutamic acid. After reacting fully reduced enzyme with O2, the rate of formation of the F state of the binuclear heme-copper active site was found to be independent of pH up to pH~9, but to drop off at higher pH with an apparent pKa of 9.4, which was attributed to the glutamic acid. Here, we present an alternative view, according to which the pH-dependence is controlled by proton transfer into the aspartate residue at the N-side orifice of the D-pathway. We summarise experimental evidence that favours a proton pump mechanism in which the proton to be pumped is transferred from the glutamic acid to a proton-loading site prior to proton transfer for completion of oxygen reduction chemistry.

     "abstract": "X-ray structures of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase with bound respiratory inhibitors (O2 analogues) have been determined at 1.8\u20132.05\u00a0\u00c5 resolution to investigate the function of the O2 reduction site which includes two metal sites (Fea32+ and CuB1+). The X-ray structures of the CO- and NO-bound derivatives indicate that although there are three possible electron donors that can provide electrons to the bound O2, located in the O2 reduction site, the formation of the peroxide intermediate is effectively prevented to provide an O2-bound form as the initial intermediate. The structural change induced upon binding of CN\u2212 suggests a non-sequential 3-electoron reduction of the bound O2\u2212 for the complete reduction without release of any reactive oxygen species. The X-ray structure of the derivative with CO bound to CuB1+ after photolysis from Fea32+ demonstrates weak side-on binding. This suggests that CuB controls the O2 supply to Fea32+ without electron transfer to provide sufficient time for collection of protons from the negative side of the mitochondrial membrane. The proton-pumping pathway of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase includes a hydrogen-bond network and a water channel located in tandem between the positive and negative side of the mitochondrial membrane. Binding of a strong ligand to Fea3 induces a conformational change which significantly narrows the water channel and effectively blocks the back-leakage of protons from the hydrogen bond network. The proton pumping mechanism proposed by these X-ray structural analyses has been functionally confirmed by mutagenesis analyses of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase.

     "abstract": "The formation of radicals in bovine cytochrome c oxidase (bCcO), during the O2 redox chemistry and proton translocation, is an unresolved controversial issue. To determine if radicals are formed in the catalytic reaction of bCcO under single turnover conditions, the reaction of O2 with the enzyme, reduced by either ascorbate or dithionite, was initiated in a custom-built rapid freeze quenching (RFQ) device and the products were trapped at 77\u00a0K at reaction times ranging from 50\u00a0\u03bcs to 6\u00a0ms. Additional samples were hand mixed to attain multiple turnover conditions and quenched with a reaction time of minutes. X-band (9\u00a0GHz) continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) spectra of the reaction products revealed the formation of a narrow radical with both reductants. D-band (130\u00a0GHz) pulsed EPR spectra allowed for the determination of the g-tensor principal values and revealed that when ascorbate was used as the reductant the dominant radical species was localized on the ascorbyl moiety, and when dithionite was used as the reductant the radical was the SO2\u2212 ion. When the contributions from the reductants are subtracted from the spectra, no evidence for a protein-based radical could be found in the reaction of O2 with reduced bCcO. As a surrogate for radicals formed on reaction intermediates, the reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with oxidized bCcO was studied at pH 6 and pH 8 by trapping the products at 50\u00a0\u03bcs with the RFQ device to determine the initial reaction events. For comparison, radicals formed after several minutes of incubation were also examined, and X-band and D-band analysis led to the identification of radicals on Tyr-244 and Tyr-129. In the RFQ measurements, a peroxyl (ROO) species was formed, presumably by the reaction between O2 and an amino acid-based radical. It is postulated that Tyr-129 may play a central role as a proton loading site during proton translocation by ejecting a proton upon formation of the radical species and then becoming reprotonated during its reduction via a chain of three water molecules originating from the region of the propionate groups of heme a3.

     "abstract": "Mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics calculations were used to explore the electron pathway of the terminal electron transfer enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase. This enzyme catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to water in a multiple step process. Density functional calculations on the three redox centers allowed for the characterization of the electron transfer mechanism, following the sequence CuA\u00a0\u2192\u00a0heme a\u00a0\u2192\u00a0heme a3. This process is largely affected by the presence of positive charges, confirming the possibility of a proton coupled electron transfer. An extensive mapping of all residues involved in the electron transfer, between the CuA center (donor) and the O2 reduction site heme a3-CuB (receptor), was obtained by selectively activating/deactivating different quantum regions. The method employed, called QM/MM e-pathway, allowed the identification of key residues along the possible electron transfer paths, consistent with experimental data. In particular, the role of arginines 481 and 482 appears crucial in the CuA\u00a0\u2192\u00a0heme a and in the heme a\u00a0\u2192\u00a0heme a3 electron transfer processes.

     "abstract": "The functional roles of the amino acid residues of the CuA site in bovine cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) were investigated by utilizing hybrid quantum mechanics (QM)/molecular mechanics (MM) calculations. The energy levels of the molecular orbitals (MOs) involving Cu dzx orbitals unexpectedly increased, as compared with those found previously with a simplified model system lacking the axial Met residue (i.e., Cu2S2N2). This elevation of MO energies stemmed from the formation of the anti-bonding orbitals, which are generated by hybridization between the dzx orbitals of Cu ions and the p-orbitals of the S and O atoms of the axial ligands. To clarify the roles of the axial Met ligand, the inner-sphere reorganization energies of the CuA site were computed, with the Met residue assigned to either the QM or MM region. The reorganization energy slightly increased when the Met residue was excluded from the QM region. The existing experimental data and the present structural modeling study also suggested that the axial Met residue moderately increased the redox potential of the CuA site. Thus, the role of the Met may be to regulate the electron transfer rate through the fine modulation of the electronic structure of the CuA \u201cplatform\u201d, created by two Cys/His residues coordinated to the Cu ions. This regulation would provide the optimum redox potential/reorganization energy of the CuA site, and thereby facilitate the subsequent cooperative reactions, such as the proton pump and the enzymatic activity, of CcO.

Our models, which are extracted from the fully reduced and oxidized X-ray structures, include His503 as a protonatable site. We find that the protonated His503 with the deprotonated Asp91 [H503\u2013N\u03b41H+ and D91\u2013C\u03b3OO\u03b3] are more energetically favorable than other protonation states, [H503\u2013N\u03b41 and D91\u2013C\u03b3OOH], with an energy difference of about \u2212\u00a05\u00a0kcal/mol in reduced case, while the [H503\u2013N\u03b41H+ and D91\u2013C\u03b3OO\u2212] state is energetically unstable, about +\u00a03\u00a0kcal/mol higher in energy in the oxidized case. The local interaction of His503 with the surrounding polar residues is necessary and sufficient for determining the energetics. The redox-coupled rotation of His503 is found to change the energetics of the protonation states. We also find that this rotation is coupled with the proton transfer from His503 and Asp91, which leads to the transition between the two different protonation states. This study suggests that His503 is involved in the proton supply to the D-path as a proton acceptor and that the redox-controlled proton-transfer-coupled rotation of His503 is a key process for an effective proton supply to the D-path from water bulk.

     "abstract": "A number of missense mutations in subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) have previously been linked to prostate cancer (Petros et al., 2005). To investigate the effects of these mutations at the molecular level, in the present study we prepared four different structural variants of the bacterial Rhodobacter sphaeroides CytcO (cytochrome aa3), each carrying one amino-acid residue replacement corresponding to the following substitutions identified in the above-mentioned study: Asn11Ser, Ala122Thr, Ala341Ser and Val380Ile (residues Asn25, Ser168, Ala384 and Val423 in the R. sphaeroides oxidase). This bacterial CytcO displays essentially the same structural and functional characteristics as those of the mitochondrial counterpart. We investigated the overall activity, proton pumping and internal electron- and proton-transfer reactions in the structural variants. The results show that the turnover activities of the mutant CytcOs were reduced by at most a factor of two. All variants pumped protons, but in Ser168Thr, Ala384Ser and Val423Ile we observed slight internal proton leaks. In all structural variants the internal electron equilibrium was slightly shifted away from the catalytic site at high pH (10), resulting in a slower observed ferryl to oxidized transition. Even though the effects of the mutations were relatively modest, the results suggest that they destabilize the proton-gating machinery. Such effects could be manifested in the presence of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient resulting in less efficient energy conservation.

     "abstract": "Both the aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsCcOaa3) and the closely related bo3-type ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli (EcQObo3) possess a proton-conducting D-channel that terminates at a glutamic acid, E286, which is critical for controlling proton transfer to the active site for oxygen chemistry and to a proton loading site for proton pumping. E286 mutations in each enzyme block proton flux and, therefore, inhibit oxidase function. In the current work, resonance Raman spectroscopy was used to show that the E286A and E286C mutations in RsCcOaa3 result in long range conformational changes that influence the protein interactions with both heme a and heme a3. Therefore, the severe reduction of the steady-state activity of the E286 mutants in RsCcOaa3 to ~\u00a00.05% is not simply a result of the direct blockage of the D-channel, but it is also a consequence of the conformational changes induced by the mutations to heme a and to the heme a3-CuB active site. In contrast, the E286C mutation of EcQObo3 exhibits no evidence of conformational changes at the two heme sites, indicating that its reduced activity (3%) is exclusively a result of the inhibition of proton transfer from the D-channel. We propose that in RsCcOaa3, the E286 mutations severely perturb the active site through a close interaction with F282, which lies between E286 and the heme-copper active site. The local structure around E286 in EcQObo3 is different, providing a rationale for the very different effects of E286 mutations in the two enzymes.

     "abstract": "The modified Q cycle mechanism accounts for the proton and charge translocation stoichiometry of the bc1 complex, and is now widely accepted. However the mechanism by which the requisite bifurcation of electron flow at the Qo site reaction is enforced is not clear. One of several proposals involves conformational gating of the docking of the Rieske ISP at the Qo site, controlled by the stage of the reaction cycle. Effects of different Qo-site inhibitors on the position of the ISP seen in crystals may reflect the same conformational mechanism, in which case understanding how different inhibitors control the position of the ISP may be a key to understanding the enforcement of bifurcation at the Qo site (Table\u00a01). Here we examine the available structures of cytochrome bc1 with different Qo-site inhibitors and different ISP positions to look for clues to this mechanism. The effect of ISP removal on binding affinity of the inhibitors stigmatellin and famoxadone suggest a \u201cmutual stabilization\u201d of inhibitor binding and ISP docking, however this thermodynamic observation sheds little light on the mechanism. The cd1 helix of cytochrome b moves in such a way as to accommodate docking when inhibitors favoring docking are bound, but it is impossible with the current structures to say whether this movement of \u03b1-cd1 is a cause or result of ISP docking. One component of the movement of the linker between E and F helices also correlates with the type of inhibitor and ISP position, and seems to be related to the H-bonding pattern of Y279 of cytochrome b. An H-bond from Y279 to the ISP, and its possible modulation by movement of F275 in the presence of famoxadone and related inhibitors, or its competition with an alternate H-bond to I269 of cytochrome b that may be destabilized by bound famoxadone, suggest other possible mechanisms.

     "abstract": "Despite its central function in oxidative phosphorylation, the molecular mechanism of proton pumping respiratory complex I is still elusive. In recent years, considerable progress has been made towards understanding structure/function relationships in this very large and complicated membrane protein complex. Last year X-ray crystallographic analysis of bacterial and mitochondrial complex I provided important insights into its molecular architecture. Based on this evidence, here a hypothetical molecular mechanism for redox-driven proton pumping of complex I is proposed. According to this mechanism, two pump modules are driven by two conformational strokes that are generated by stabilization of the anionic forms of semiquinone and ubiquinol that are formed in the peripheral arm of complex I during turnover. This results in the experimentally determined pumping stoichiometry of 4 H+/2e\u2212. In the two-state model, electron transfer from iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2 is allowed only in the \u2018E-state,\u2019 while protonation of the substrate is only possible in the stabilizing \u2018P-state.\u2019 In the membrane arm, transition from the E- to the P-state drives the two pump modules via long range conformational energy transfer through the recently discovered helical transmission element connecting them. The proposed two-state stabilization-change mechanism is fully reversible and thus inherently explains the operation of complex I in forward and reverse mode.

The most notable feature is that the large negative IR band at 1674\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 in Rba. sphaeroides R-26, attributable to the loss of the absorption of the 131-keto carbonyl of HA upon the radical anion HA\u2212 formation, exhibits only a very minor upshift to 1675\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01 in Cfl. aurantiacus.

     "abstract": "The functional domain size for efficient excited singlet state quenching was studied in artificial aggregates of the main light-harvesting complex II (LHCIIb) from spinach and in native thylakoid membranes by picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and quantum yield measurements. The domain size was estimated from the efficiency of added exogenous singlet excitation quenchers\u2014phenyl-p-benzoquinone (PPQ) and dinitrobenzene (DNB). The mean fluorescence lifetimes \u03c4av were quantified for a range of quencher concentrations. Applying the Stern\u2013Volmer formalism, apparent quenching rate constants kq were determined from the dependencies on quencher concentration of the ratio \u03c40av/\u03c4av, where \u03c40av is the average fluorescence lifetime of the sample without addition of an exogenous quencher. The functional domain size was gathered from the ratio kq\u2032/kq, i.e., the apparent quenching rate constants determined in aggregates (or membranes), kq\u2032, and in detergent-solubilised LHCII trimers, kq, respectively. In LHCII macroaggregates, the resulting values for the domain size were 15\u201330 LHCII trimers. In native thylakoid membranes the domain size was equivalent to 12\u201324 LHCII trimers, corresponding to 500\u20131000 chlorophylls. Virtually the same results were obtained when membranes were suspended in buffers promoting either membrane stacking or destacking. These domain sizes are orders of magnitude smaller than the number of physically connected pigment\u2013protein complexes.

Lowering the temperature to \u2212\u00a010\u00a0\u00b0C the sigmoidicity is lost. It is shown that the sigmoidicity is due to the kinetic overlap between the reduction kinetics of QA and a second process; an overlap that disappears at low temperature because the temperature dependences of the two processes differ. This second process can still relax at \u2212\u00a060\u00a0\u00b0C where recombination between QA\u2212 and the donor side of photosystem (PS) II is blocked. This suggests that it is not a redox reaction but a conformational change can explain the data. Without DCMU, a reduced photosynthetic electron transport chain (ETC) is a pre-condition for reaching the FM. About 40% of the variable fluorescence relaxes in 100\u00a0ms. Re-induction while the ETC is still reduced takes a few ms and this is a photochemical process. The fact that the process can relax and be re-induced in the absence of changes in the redox state of the plastoquinone (PQ) pool implies that it is unrelated to the QB-occupancy state and PQ-pool quenching. In both +/\u2212DCMU the process studied represents ~\u00a030% of the fluorescence rise. The presented observations are best described within a conformational protein relaxation concept. In untreated leaves we assume that conformational changes are only induced when QA is reduced and relax rapidly on re-oxidation. This would explain the relationship between the fluorescence rise and the ETC-reduction.",

These complexes are housed in spherical intracytoplasmic membranes (ICMs), which are assembled in a stepwise process where biosynthesis of core complexes tends to dominate the early stages of membrane invagination. The kinetics of LH2 assembly were measured in PufX mutants that assemble monomeric core complexes, as a consequence of either a twelve-residue N-terminal truncation of PufX (PufX\u039412) or the complete removal of PufX (PufX\u2212). Lower rates of LH2 assembly and retarded maturation of membrane invagination were observed for the larger and less curved ICM from the PufX\u2212 mutant, consistent with the proposition that local membrane curvature, initiated by arrays of bent RC\u2013LH1\u2013PufX dimers, creates a favourable environment for stable assembly of LH2 complexes. Transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution atomic force microscopy were used to examine ICM morphology and membrane protein organisation in these mutants. Some partitioning of core and LH2 complexes was observed in PufX\u2212 membranes, resulting in locally ordered clusters of monomeric RC\u2013LH1 complexes. The distribution of core and LH2 complexes in the three types of membrane examined is consistent with previous models of membrane curvature and domain formation (Frese et al., 2008), which demonstrated that a combination of crowding and asymmetries in sizes and shapes of membrane protein complexes drives membrane organisation.",

UCP3 is present in mitochondria of thymus and spleen up to at least 16weeks after birth, but levels decrease by a half in thymus and a fifth in spleen after three weeks, probably reflecting the suckling to weaning transition. UCP3 protein levels increase ~\u00a03-fold in thymus on starvation, but expression levels in spleen were unaffected by starvation. Lack of UCP3 had little effect on thymus mass or thymocyte number. However, lack of UCP3 affected spleen mass and splenocyte number (in the fasted state) and results in reduced CD4+ single positive cell numbers and reduced double negative cells in the thymus, but as a 2-fold increase in the proportion of CD4+, CD8+ and DP cells in spleen. Starvation attenuates these proportionate differences in the spleen. A lack of UCP3 had no apparent effect on basal oxygen consumption of thymocytes or splenocytes or on oxygen consumption due to mitochondrial proton leak. Splenocytes from UCP3 knock-out mice are also more resistant to apoptosis than those from wild-type mice. Overall we can conclude that UCP3 affects thymocyte and spleen cell profiles in the fed and fasted states.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) is a membrane-bound enzyme, which catalyzes the reduction of di-oxygen to water and uses a major part of the free energy released in this reaction to pump protons across the membrane. In the Rhodobacter sphaeroides aa3 CytcO all protons that are pumped across the membrane, as well as one half of the protons that are used for O2 reduction, are transferred through one specific intraprotein proton pathway, which holds a highly conserved Glu286 residue. Key questions that need to be addressed in order to understand the function of CytcO at a molecular level are related to the timing of proton transfers from Glu286 to a \u201cpump site\u201d and the catalytic site, respectively. Here, we have investigated the temperature dependencies of the H/D kinetic-isotope effects of intramolecular proton-transfer reactions in the wild-type CytcO as well as in two structural CytcO variants, one in which proton uptake from solution is delayed and one in which proton pumping is uncoupled from O2 reduction. These processes were studied for two specific reaction steps linked to transmembrane proton pumping, one that involves only proton transfer (peroxy\u2013ferryl, P\u00a0\u2192\u00a0F, transition) and one in which the same sequence of proton transfers is also linked to electron transfer to the catalytic site (ferryl\u2013oxidized, F\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O, transition). An analysis of these reactions in the framework of theory indicates that that the simpler, P\u00a0\u2192\u00a0F reaction is rate-limited by proton transfer from Glu286 to the catalytic site. When the same proton-transfer events are also linked to electron transfer to the catalytic site (F\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O), the proton-transfer reactions might well be gated by a protein structural change, which presumably ensures that the proton-pumping stoichiometry is maintained also in the presence of a transmembrane electrochemical gradient. Furthermore, the present study indicates that a careful analysis of the temperature dependence of the isotope effect should help us in gaining mechanistic insights about CytcO.",

Both the components of the protonmotive force, i.e. the voltage (\u0394\u03a8m) and the proton (\u0394pHm) gradient, displayed a similar effect. Quantitative estimation of the \u0394\u03a8m unveiled that the voltage-dependent effect on the control coefficient of cytochrome c oxidase takes place sharply in a narrow range of membrane potential from 170\u2013180 to 200\u2013210\u00a0mV consistent with the physiologic transition from state 3 to state 4 of respiration. Extension of the metabolic flux control analysis to the NADH dehydrogenase and bc1 complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain resulted in a similar effect.

     "abstract": "Autophagy is a cellular housekeeping process that removes damaged or unwanted cellular components and recycles them to build new constituents. It is essential for tumor growth under adverse environment. Mitochondria play an important role in the formation of autophagosome and its subsequent docking and fusion with lysosome. To understand the contribution of mitochondria to the regulation of homeostatic autophagy in cancer cells, we used the transmitochondrial cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) model. Cybrid system allowed us to compare mitochondria from different cell types including highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (c231), less metastatic breast cancer cell lines: MDA-MB-436 (c436) and MDA-MB-468 (c468), as well as non-cancerous mammary epithelial cell MCF-10A (c10A) in a defined nuclear background. The c231 exhibited lower LC3-II levels but higher ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I than c436, c468 and c10A. In addition, c231 displayed more punctate LC3-positive cells and had lower levels of sequestosome 1 (p62/SQSTM1) than other cybrids. These suggested that mitochondria could contribute to the increased autophagy and autophagic flux in metastatic cancer. This increased autophagy was found to be non-selective autophagy instead of selective mitophagy since LC3 puncta in c231 did not co-localize with mitochondria labeled by Mitotracker red or Tomm 20. The promotion of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) in c231 also contributed to increased autophagy. Block of MPT by the inhibition of low-conductance stage of MPT pores resulted in a decrease of LC3 puncta in c231. These results suggested that mitochondria from highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 can promote homeostatic autophagy of cancer through opening low-conductance MPT pores.",

     "abstract": "Natranaerobius thermophilus is an unusual anaerobic extremophile, it is halophilic and alkalithermophilic; growing optimally at 3.3\u20133.9\u00a0M Na+, pH50\u00a0\u00b0C 9.5 and 53\u00a0\u00b0C. The ATPase of N. thermophilus was characterized at the biochemical level to ascertain its role in life under hypersaline, alkaline, thermal conditions. The partially purified enzyme (10-fold purification) displayed the typical subunit pattern for F-type ATPases, with a 5-subunit F1 portion and 3-subunit-FO portion. ATP hydrolysis by the purified ATPase was stimulated almost 4-fold by low concentrations of Na+ (5\u00a0mM); hydrolysis activity was inhibited by higher Na+ concentrations. Partially purified ATPase was alkaliphilic and thermophilic, showing maximal hydrolysis at 47\u00a0\u00b0C and the alkaline pH50\u00a0\u00b0C of 9.3. ATP hydrolysis was sensitive to the F-type ATPase inhibitor N,N\u2032-dicylohexylcarbodiimide and exhibited inhibition by both free Mg2+ and free ATP. ATP synthesis by inverted membrane vesicles proceeded slowly and was driven by a Na+-ion gradient that was sensitive to the Na+-ionophore monensin. Analysis of the atp operon showed the presence of the Na+-binding motif in the c subunit (Q33, E66, T67, T68, Y71), and a complete, untruncated \u03b5 subunit; suggesting that ATP hydrolysis by the enzyme is regulated. Based on these properties, the F1FO-ATPase of N. thermophilus is a Na+-translocating ATPase used primarily for expelling cytoplasmic Na+ that accumulates inside cells of N. thermophilus during alkaline stress. In support of this theory are the presence of the c subunit Na+-binding motif and the low rates of ATP synthesis observed. The complete \u03b5 subunit is hypothesized to control excessive ATP hydrolysis and preserve intracellular Na+ needed by electrogenic cation/proton antiporters crucial for cytoplasmic acidification in the obligately alkaliphilic N. thermophilus.",

PCC 6803 belong to the family of stress-induced light-harvesting-like proteins, but are constitutively expressed in a mutant deficient of Photosystem I (PSI). Using absorption, fluorescence and thermoluminescence measurements this PSI-less strain was compared with a mutant, in which all SCPs were additionally deleted. Depletion of SCPs led to structural rearrangements in Photosystem II (PSII): less photosystems were assembled; and in these, the QB site was modified. Despite the lower amount of PSII, the SCP-deficient cells contained the same amount of phycobilisomes (PBS) as the control. Although the excess PBS were functionally disconnected, their fluorescence was quenched under high irradiance by the activated Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP). Additionally the amount of OCP, but not of the iron-stress induced protein (isiA), was higher in this SCP-depleted mutant compared with the control. As previously described, the lack of SCPs affects the chlorophyll biosynthesis (Vavilin, D., Brune, D. C., Vermaas, W. (2005) Biochim Biophys Acta 1708, 91\u2013101). We demonstrate that chlorophyll synthesis is required for efficient PSII repair and that it is partly impaired in the absence of SCPs. At the same time, the amount of chlorophyll also seems to influence the expression of ScpC and ScpD.",

     "abstract": "Five nitrogen fixing cyanobacterial strains have been found to contain PsaB2, an additional and divergent gene copy for the Photosystem I reaction center protein PsaB. In all five species the divergent gene, psaB2, is located separately from the normal psaAB operon in the genome. The protein, PsaB2, was recently identified in heterocysts of Nostoc punctiforme sp. strain PCC 73102. 12 conserved amino acid replacements and one insertion, were identified by a multiple sequence alignment of several PsaB2 and PsaB1 sequences. Several, including an inserted glutamine, are located close to the iron-sulfur cluster FX in the electron transfer chain. By homology modeling, using the Photosystem I crystal structure as template, we have found that the amino acid composition in PsaB2 will introduce changes in critical parts of the Photosystem I protein structure. The changes are close to FX and the phylloquinone (PhQ) in the B-branch, indicating that the electron transfer properties most likely will be affected. We suggest that the divergent PsaB2 protein produces an alternative Photosystem I reaction center with different structural and electron transfer properties. Some interesting physiologcial consequences that this can have for the function of Photosystem I in heterocysts, are discussed.",

Rate constants, chemical nature and the spectral properties of the catalytic cycle intermediates (Compounds A, P, F) reproduce generally the features typical for the aa3-type oxidases with some distinctive peculiarities caused by the presence of an additional 5-th redox-center\u2014a heme center of the covalently bound cytochrome c. Compound A was formed with significantly smaller yield compared to aa3 oxidases in general and to ba3 oxidase from the same organism. Two electrons, equilibrated between three input redox-centers: heme a, CuA and heme c are transferred in a single transition to the binuclear center during reduction of the compound F, converting the binuclear center through the highly reactive OH state into the final product of the reaction\u2014EH (one-electron reduced) state of the catalytic site. In contrast to previous works on the caa3-type enzymes, we concluded that the finally produced EH state of caa3 oxidase is characterized by the localization of the fifth electron in the binuclear center, similar to the OH\u00a0\u2192\u00a0EH transition of the aa3-type oxidases. So, the fully-reduced caa3 oxidase is competent in rapid electron transfer from the input redox-centers into the catalytic heme-copper site.",

     "abstract": "Natural acetogenins are among the most potent inhibitors of bovine heart mitochondrial NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). Our photoaffinity labeling study suggested that the hydroxylated bis-THF ring moiety of acetogenins binds at \u201csite A\u201d in the third matrix-side loop connecting the fifth and sixth transmembrane helices in the ND1 subunit [Kakutani et al. (2010) Biochemistry 49, 4794\u20134803]. Nevertheless, since this proposition was led using a photoreactive \u0394lac-acetogenin derivative, it needs to be directly verified using a natural acetogenin-type probe. We therefore conducted photoaffinity labeling using a photoreactive natural acetogenin mimic ([125I]diazinylated natural acetogenin, [125I]DANA), which has a small photolabile diazirine group, in place of a hydroxy group, attached to the bis-THF ring moiety. Analysis of the photocross-linked protein in bovine heart submitochondrial particles unambiguously revealed that [125I]DANA binds to the membrane subunit ND1 with high specificity. The photocross-linking was completely blocked in the presence of just a 5-fold excess of bullatacin, indicating that [125I]DANA is an excellent mimic of natural acetogenins and hence binds to the site that accommodates natural products. Careful examination of the fragmentation patterns of the cross-linked ND1 generated by different proteases and their combinations indicated that the cross-linked residue is predominantly located at the supposed site A in the third matrix-side loop.",

     "abstract": "The effect of temperature on the photosynthetic machinery is crucial for the fundamental understanding of plant physiology and the bioengineering of heat-tolerant varieties. In our study, Arabidopsis thaliana was exposed to mild (40\u00a0\u00b0C), short-term heat stress in the dark to evaluate the heat-triggered phosphorylation and migration of light harvesting complex (LHC) II in both wild-type (wt) and mutant lacking STN7 kinase. The 77\u00a0K emission spectra revealed an increase in PSI relative to PSII emission similar to increases observed in light-induced state I to state II transitions in wt but not in stn7 mutant. Immunoblotting results indicated that the major LHCII was phosphorylated at threonine sites under heat stress in wt plants but not in the mutant. These results support the proposition that mild heat stress triggers state transitions in the dark similar to light-induced state transitions, which involve phosphorylation of LHCII by STN7 kinase. Pre-treatment of Arabidopsis leaves with inhibitor DBMIB, altered the extent of LHCII phosphorylation and PSI fluorescence emission suggests that activation of STN7 kinase may be dependent on Cyt b6/f under elevated temperatures in dark. Furthermore, fast Chl a transient of temperature-exposed leaves of wt showed a decrease in the Fv/Fm ratio due to both an increase in Fo and a decrease in Fm. In summary, our findings indicate that a mild heat treatment (40\u00a0\u00b0C) induces state transitions in the dark resulting in the migration of phosphorylated LHCII from the grana to the stroma region.",

     "abstract": "ATP synthases are part of the sophisticated cellular metabolic network and therefore multiple interactions have to be considered. As discussed in this review, ATP synthases form various supramolecular structures. These include dimers and homooligomeric species. But also interactions with other proteins, particularly those involved in energy conversion exist. The supramolecular assembly of the ATP synthase affects metabolism, organellar structure, diseases, ageing and vice versa. The most common approaches to isolate supercomplexes from native membranes by use of native electrophoresis or density gradients are introduced. On the one hand, isolated ATP synthase dimers and oligomers are employed for structural studies and elucidation of specific protein\u2013protein interactions. On the other hand, native electrophoresis and other techniques serve as tool to trace changes of the supramolecular organisation depending on metabolic alterations. Upon analysing the structure, dimer-specific subunits can be identified as well as interactions with other proteins, for example, the adenine nucleotide translocator. In the organellar context, ATP synthase dimers and oligomers are involved in the formation of mitochondrial cristae. As a consequence, changes in the amount of such supercomplexes affect mitochondrial structure and function. Alterations in the cellular power plant have a strong impact on energy metabolism and ultimately play a significant role in pathophysiology. In plant systems, dimers of the ATP synthase have been also identified in chloroplasts. Similar to mammals, a correlation between metabolic changes and the amount of the chloroplast ATP synthase dimers exists. Therefore, this review focusses on the interplay between metabolism and supramolecular organisation of ATP synthase in different organisms.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies represent one of the major causes of metabolic disorders that are related to genetic defects in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. The mitochondrial protein synthesis allows the synthesis of the 13 respiratory chain subunits encoded by mtDNA. Altogether, about 100 different proteins are involved in the translation of the 13 proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genome emphasizing the considerable investment required to maintain mitochondrial genetic system. Mitochondrial protein synthesis deficiency can be caused by mutations in any component of the translation apparatus including tRNA, rRNA and proteins. Mutations in mitochondrial rRNA and tRNAs have been first identified in various forms of mitochondrial disorders. Moreover abnormal translation due to mutation in nuclear genes encoding tRNA-modifying enzymes, ribosomal proteins, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, elongation and termination factors and translational activators have been successively described. These deficiencies are characterized by a huge clinical and genetic heterogeneity hampering to establish genotype\u2013phenotype correlations and an easy diagnosis.

     "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide is enzymatically produced in mammalian tissues and functions as a gaseous transmitter. However, H2S is also highly toxic as it inhibits mitochondrial respiration at the level of cytochrome c oxidase, which additionally is involved in sulfide oxidation. The accumulation of toxic sulfide levels contributes to the pathology of some diseases. This paper demonstrates that sulfide toxicity can be modified, and dehydroascorbic acid functions as an effector in this process. It significantly reduces the inhibitory effect of sulfide on cytochrome c oxidase, resulting in higher rates of respiration and sulfide oxidation in rat mitochondria. After the addition of dehydroascorbic acid mitochondria maintained more than 50% of the oxygen consumption and ATP production rates with different substrates in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide that would normally lead to complete inhibition. Dehydroascorbic acid significantly increased the sulfide concentration necessary to cause half maximal inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and thus completely prevented inhibition at low, physiological sulfide concentrations. In addition, sulfide oxidation was stimulated and led to ATP production even at high concentrations. The decrease in sulfide toxicity was more pronounced when analyzing supermolecular functional units of the respiratory chain than in isolated cytochrome c oxidase activity. Furthermore, the protective effect of dehydroascorbic acid at high sulfide concentrations was completely abolished by quantitative solubilization of mitochondrial membrane proteins with dodeclymaltoside. These results suggest that binding of cytochrome c oxidase to other proteins probably within respiratory chain supercomplexes is involved in the modulation of sulfide oxidation and toxicity by dehydroascorbic acid.",

O2-evolving photosystem II membranes from spinach in the absence of herbicide and in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU) and bromoxynil were subjected to strong white-light illumination at 298\u00a0K, and the illumination-time dependence of the activities of QA, the Mn cluster, and P680 were monitored using light-induced Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) difference spectroscopy. The decrease in the QA activity was suppressed and accelerated by DCMU and bromoxynil, respectively, in comparison with the sample without herbicide. The intensity change in the S2/S1 FTIR signal of the Mn cluster exhibited a time course virtually identical to that in the QA signal in all the three samples, suggesting that the loss of the S1\u00a0\u2192\u00a0S2 transition was ascribed to the QA inactivation and hence the Mn cluster was inactivated not faster than QA. The decrease in the P680 signal was always slower than that of QA keeping the tendency of the herbicide effect. Degradation of the D1 protein occurred after the P680 inactivation. These observations are consistent with the acceptor-side mechanism, in which double reduction of QA triggers the formation of 1O2* to promote further damage to other cofactors and the D1 protein, rather than the recently proposed mechanism that inactivation of the Mn cluster initiates the photodamage. Thus, the results of the present study support the view that the acceptor-side mechanism dominantly occurs in the photodamage to PSII by strong white-light illumination.",

Cyclosis-mediated distant interactions might be particularly noticeable under nonuniform illumination, in the vicinity of light\u2013shade borders where metabolites are transported between functionally distinct cell regions. In support of this notion, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters assessed on a microscopic area of Chara corallina internodal cells (area of inspection, AOI) responded to illumination of nearby regions in asymmetric manner depending on the vector of cytoplasmic streaming. When a beam of white light was applied through a 400-\u03bcm optic fiber upstream of AOI with regard to the direction of cytoplasmic streaming, non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) developed after a lag period in AOI exposed to moderate intensity light. Conversely, no NPQ was induced in the same cell area when the beam position was shifted to an equal distance downstream of AOI. Light\u2013response curves for the efficiency of photosystem II electron transport in chloroplasts differed markedly depending on the illumination pattern (whole-cell versus small area illumination) but these differences were eliminated after the inhibition of cytoplasmic streaming with cytochalasin B. Localized illumination promoted chloroplast fluorescence responses to electrical plasmalemma excitation at high light intensities, which contrasts to the requirement of low to moderate irradiances for observation of the stimulus\u2013response coupling under whole-cell illumination. The results indicate that different photosynthetic capacities of chloroplasts under general and localized illumination are related to lateral transport of nonevenly distributed cytoplasmic components between the cell parts with dominant photosynthetic and respiratory metabolism.",

Plant fitness and productivity depend directly on a balance between excitations in the photosynthetic apparatus, generated by captured light quanta, and the rate of photochemical processes. Excess excitation energy leads to oxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and entire organism and therefore the balance between the excitation density and photosynthesis requires precise and efficient regulation, operating also at the level of antenna complexes. We show that illumination of the isolated LHCII leads to isomerization of the protein-bound neoxanthin from conformation 9\u2032-cis to 9\u2032,13- and 9\u2032,13\u2032-dicis forms. At the same time light-driven excitation quenching is observed, manifested by a decrease in chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity and shortened fluorescence lifetimes. Both processes, the neoxanthin isomerization and the chlorophyll excitation quenching, are reversible in dim light. The results of the 77\u00a0K florescence measurements of LHCII show that illumination is associated with appearance of the low-energy states, which can serve as energy traps in the pigment\u2013protein complex subjected to excess excitation. Possible sequence of the molecular events is proposed, leading to a protective excess excitation energy quenching: neoxanthin photo-isomerization\u00a0\u2192\u00a0formation of LHCII supramolecular structures which potentiate creation of energy traps\u00a0\u2192\u00a0excitation quenching.",

     "abstract": "In this study we assessed \u0394G\u2032ATP hydrolysis, cytosolic [ADP], and the rate of phosphocreatine recovery using Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in the calf muscle of a group of patients affected by glycogen myo-phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease). The goal was to ascertain whether and to what extent the deficit of the glycogenolytic pathway would affect the muscle energy balance. A typical feature of this pathology is the lack of intracellular acidosis. Therefore we posed the question of whether, in the absence of pH decrease, the rate of phosphocreatine recovery depends on the amount of phosphocreatine consumed during exercise. Results showed that at the end of exercise both [ADP] and \u0394G\u2032ATP of patients were significantly higher than those of matched control groups reaching comparable levels of phosphocreatine concentration. Furthermore, in these patients we found that the rate of phosphocreatine recovery is not influenced by the amount of phosphocreatine consumed during exercise. These outcomes provide experimental evidence that: i) the intracellular acidification occurring in exercising skeletal muscle is a protective factor for the energy consumption; and ii) the influence of pH on the phosphocreatine recovery rate is at least in part related to the kinetic mechanisms of mitochondrial creatine kinase enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Because life on earth is governed by the second law of thermodynamics, it is subject to increasing entropy. Oxygenic photosynthesis, the earth's major producer of both oxygen and organic matter, is a principal player in the development and maintenance of life, and thus results in increased order. The primary steps of oxygenic photosynthesis are driven by four multi-subunit membrane protein complexes: photosystem I, photosystem II, cytochrome b6f complex, and F-ATPase. Photosystem II generates the most positive redox potential found in nature and thus capable of extracting electrons from water. Photosystem I generates the most negative redox potential found in nature; thus, it largely determines the global amount of enthalpy in living systems. The recent structural determination of PSII and PSI complexes from cyanobacteria and plants sheds light on the evolutionary forces that shaped oxygenic photosynthesis. This newly available structural information complements knowledge gained from genomic and proteomic data, allowing for a more precise description of the scenario in which the evolution of life systems took place.

     "abstract": "The photosynthetic electron transport chain consists of photosystem II, the cytochrome b6f complex, photosystem I, and the free electron carriers plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Light-driven charge separation events occur at the level of photosystem II and photosystem I, which are associated at one end of the chain with the oxidation of water followed by electron flow along the electron transport chain and concomitant pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen, which is used by the ATP synthase to generate ATP. At the other end of the chain reducing power is generated, which together with ATP is used for CO2 assimilation. A remarkable feature of the photosynthetic apparatus is its ability to adapt to changes in environmental conditions by sensing light quality and quantity, CO2 levels, temperature, and nutrient availability. These acclimation responses involve a complex signaling network in the chloroplasts comprising the thylakoid protein kinases Stt7/STN7 and Stl1/STN7 and the phosphatase PPH1/TAP38, which play important roles in state transitions and in the regulation of electron flow as well as in thylakoid membrane folding. The activity of some of these enzymes is closely connected to the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, and they appear to be involved both in short-term and long-term acclimation.

     "abstract": "Phosphorylation is the most common post-translational modification found in thylakoid membrane proteins of flowering plants, targeting more than two dozen subunits of all multiprotein complexes, including some light-harvesting proteins. Recent progress in mass spectrometry-based technologies has led to the detection of novel low-abundance thylakoid phosphoproteins and localised their phosphorylation sites. Three of the enzymes involved in phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles in thylakoids, the protein kinases STN7 and STN8 and the phosphatase TAP38/PPH1, have been characterised in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Differential protein phosphorylation is associated with changes in illumination and various other environmental parameters, and has been implicated in several acclimation responses, the molecular mechanisms of which are only partly understood. The phenomenon of State Transitions, which enables rapid adaptation to short-term changes in illumination, has recently been shown to depend on reversible phosphorylation of LHCII by STN7-TAP38/PPH1. STN7 is also necessary for long-term acclimation responses that counteract imbalances in energy distribution between PSII and PSI by changing the rates of accumulation of their reaction-centre and light-harvesting proteins. Another aspect of photosynthetic acclimation, the modulation of thylakoid ultrastructure, depends on phosphorylation of PSII core proteins, mainly executed by STN8. Here we review recent advances in the characterisation of STN7, STN8 and TAP38/PPH1, and discuss their physiological significance within the overall network of thylakoid protein phosphorylation.

Two major pathways of cyclic flow have been identified, involving either a complex termed NDH or mediated via a pathway involving a protein PGR5 and two functions have been described\u2014to generate ATP and to provide a pH gradient inducing non-photochemical quenching. The best evidence for the occurrence of the two pathways comes from measurements under stress conditions\u2014high light, drought and extreme temperatures. In this review, the possible relative functions and importance of the two pathways is discussed as well as evidence as to how the flow through these pathways is regulated.

This flexibility probably explains why microalgae show a very high biomass yield, constitute one of the major contributors to primary productivity in the oceans and are considered a promising choice for biotechnological applications. Flexibility results from a combination of several factors including fast changes in the light-harvesting apparatus and a strong interaction between different metabolic processes (e.g. respiration and photosynthesis), which all take place within the same cell. Microalgae are also capable of modifying their photosynthetic electron flow capacity, by changing its maximum rate and/or by diverting photogenerated electrons towards different sinks depending on their growth status.

     "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis uses light as energy source to generate an oxidant powerful enough to oxidize water into oxygen, electrons and protons. Upon linear electron transport, electrons extracted from water are used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH. The oxygen molecule has been integrated into the cellular metabolism, both as the most efficient electron acceptor during respiratory electron transport and as oxidant and/or \u201csubstrate\u201d in a number of biosynthetic pathways. Though photosynthesis of higher plants, algae and cyanobacteria produces oxygen, there are conditions under which this type of photosynthesis operates under hypoxic or anaerobic conditions. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, this condition is induced by sulfur deficiency, and it results in the production of molecular hydrogen. Research on this biotechnologically relevant phenomenon has contributed largely to new insights into additional pathways of photosynthetic electron transport, which extend the former concept of linear electron flow by far. This review summarizes the recent knowledge about various electron sources and sinks of oxygenic photosynthesis besides water and NADP+ in the context of their contribution to hydrogen photoproduction by C. reinhardtii.

The chloroplast targeted FNR isoforms are known to be responsible for the final step of linear electron flow transferring electrons from ferredoxin to NADP+, while the putative role of FNR in cyclic electron transfer has been under discussion for decades. FNR has been found from three distinct chloroplast compartments (i) at the thylakoid membrane, (ii) in the soluble stroma, and (iii) at chloroplast inner envelope. Recent in vivo studies have indicated that besides the membrane-bound FNR, also the soluble FNR is photosynthetically active. Two chloroplast proteins, Tic62 and TROL, were recently identified and shown to form high molecular weight protein complexes with FNR at the thylakoid membrane, and thus seem to act as the long-sought molecular anchors of FNR to the thylakoid membrane. Tic62\u2013FNR complexes are not directly involved in photosynthetic reactions, but Tic62 protects FNR from inactivation during the dark periods.

These genes encode subunits of the chloroplast NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) complex involved in photosystem I (PSI) cyclic electron transport and chlororespiration. Although the chloroplast NDH is believed to be closely and functionally related to the cyanobacterial NDH-1L complex, extensive proteomic, genetic and bioinformatic studies have discovered many novel subunits that are specific to higher plants. On the basis of extensive mutant characterization, the chloroplast NDH complex is divided into four parts, the A, B, membrane and lumen subcomplexes, of which subunits in the B and lumen subcomplexes are specific to higher plants. These results suggest that the structure of NDH has been drastically altered during the evolution of land plants. Furthermore, chloroplast NDH interacts with multiple copies of PSI to form the unique NDH\u2013PSI supercomplex. Two minor light-harvesting-complex I (LHCI) proteins, Lhca5 and Lhca6, are required for the specific interaction between NDH and PSI.

     "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis depends on a highly conserved electron transport system, which must be particularly dynamic in its response to environmental and physiological changes, in order to avoid an excess of excitation energy and subsequent oxidative damage. Apart from cyclic electron flow around PSII and around PSI, several alternative electron transport pathways exist including a plastoquinol terminal oxidase (PTOX) that mediates electron flow from plastoquinol to O2. The existence of PTOX was first hypothesized in 1982 and this was verified years later based on the discovery of a non-heme, di-iron carboxylate protein localized to thylakoid membranes that displayed sequence similarity to the mitochondrial alternative oxidase. The absence of this protein renders higher plants susceptible to excitation pressure dependant variegation combined with impaired carotenoid synthesis. Chloroplasts, as well as other plastids (i.e. etioplasts, amyloplasts and chromoplasts), fail to assemble organized internal membrane structures correctly, when exposed to high excitation pressure early in development. While the role of PTOX in plastid development is established, its physiological role under stress conditions remains equivocal and we postulate that it serves as an alternative electron sink under conditions where the acceptor side of PSI is limited. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the past achievements in this field and to offer directions for future investigative efforts.

Chlorophyll a is essential in photochemistry, while chlorophyll b is apparently dispensable for their photosynthesis. Instead, chlorophyll b is necessary for stabilizing the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins. Chlorophyll b is synthesized from chlorophyll a and is catabolized after it is reconverted to chlorophyll a. This interconversion system between chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b refers to the chlorophyll cycle. The chlorophyll b levels are determined by the activity of the three enzymes participating in the chlorophyll cycle, namely, chlorophyllide a oxygenase, chlorophyll b reductase, and 7-hydroxymethyl-chlorophyll reductase. This article reviews the recent progress on the analysis of the chlorophyll cycle and its enzymes. In particular, we emphasize the impact of genetic modification of chlorophyll cycle enzymes on the construction and destruction of the photosynthetic machinery.

Degradation of chlorophyll was rationalized by the need of a senescing cell to detoxify the potentially phototoxic pigment, yet recent investigations in leaves and fruits indicate that chlorophyll catabolites could have physiological roles.

These enzymes are responsible for the efficient removal of the superoxide formed during photosynthetic electron transport and function in reactive oxygen species metabolism. The availability of copper is a major determinant of Cu/ZnSOD and FeSOD expression. Analysis of the phenotypes of plants that over-express superoxide dismutases in chloroplasts has given support for the proposed roles of these enzymes in reactive oxygen species scavenging. However, over-production of chloroplast superoxide dismutase gives only limited protection to environmental stress and does not result in greatly improved whole plant performance. Surprisingly, plant lines that lack the most abundant Cu/ZnSOD or FeSOD activities perform as well as the wild-type under most conditions tested, indicating that these superoxide dismutases are not limiting to photoprotection or the prevention of oxidative damage. In contrast, a strong defect in chloroplast gene expression and development was seen in plants that lack the two minor FeSOD isoforms, which are expressed predominantly in seedlings and that associate closely with the chloroplast genome.

     "abstract": "Intra-plastid proteases play crucial and diverse roles in the development and maintenance of non-photosynthetic plastids and chloroplasts. Formation and maintenance of a functional thylakoid electron transport chain requires various protease activities, operating in parallel, as well as in series. This review first provides a short, referenced overview of all experimentally identified plastid proteases in Arabidopsis thaliana. We then focus on the Clp protease system which constitutes the most abundant and complex soluble protease system in the plastid, consisting of 15 nuclear-encoded members and one plastid-encoded member in Arabidopsis. Comparisons to the simpler Clp system in photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic bacteria will be made and the role of Clp proteases in the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be briefly reviewed. Extensive molecular genetics has shown that the Clp system plays an essential role in Arabidopsis chloroplast development in the embryo as well as in leaves. Molecular characterization of the various Clp mutants has elucidated many of the consequences of loss of Clp activities. We summarize and discuss the structural and functional aspects of the Clp machinery, including progress on substrate identification and recognition. Finally, the Clp system will be evaluated in the context of the chloroplast protease network. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Regulation of Electron Transport in Chloroplasts.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is the terminal enzyme of the respiratory chain. By reducing oxygen to water, it generates a proton gradient across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. Recently, two independent X-ray crystallographic studies ((Aoyama et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 106 (2009) 2165\u20132169) and (Koepke et al. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1787 (2009) 635\u2013645)), suggested that a peroxide dianion might be bound to the active site of oxidized CcO. We have investigated this hypothesis by combining quantum chemical calculations with a re-refinement of the X-ray crystallographic data and optical spectroscopic measurements. Our data suggest that dianionic peroxide, superoxide, and dioxygen all form a similar superoxide species when inserted into a fully oxidized ferric/cupric binuclear site (BNC). We argue that stable peroxides are unlikely to be confined within the oxidized BNC since that would be expected to lead to bond splitting and formation of the catalytic P intermediate. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that binding of dioxygen to the oxidized binuclear site is weakly exergonic, and hence, the observed structure might have resulted from dioxygen itself or from superoxide generated from O2 by the X-ray beam. We show that the presence of O2 is consistent with the X-ray data. We also discuss how other structures, such as a mixture of the aqueous species (H2O\u00a0+\u00a0OH\u2212 and H2O) and chloride fit the experimental data.",

Cytochrome oxidation changes were measured with multi-wavelength spectroscopy and the ambient redox potential was calculated from the oxidation state of endogenous cytochrome c. Two spectral components were separated in the \u03b1-band range of cytochrome oxidase and they were identified as the difference spectrum of heme a when it has a high (aH) or low (aL) midpoint potential (Em) by comparing their occupancy during redox titrations carried out when the membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) was dissipated with a protonophore to that predicted by the neoclassical model of redox cooperativity. The difference spectrum of aL has a maximum at 605\u00a0nm whereas the spectrum of aH has a maximum at 602\u00a0nm. The \u0394\u03a8-dependent shift in the Em of aH was too great to be accounted for by electron transfer from cytochrome c to heme a against \u0394\u03a8 but was consistent with a model in which aH is formed after proton uptake against \u0394\u03a8 suggesting that the spectral changes are the result of protonation. A stochastic simulation was implemented to model oxidation states, proton uptake and Em changes during redox titrations. The redox anti-cooperativity between heme a and heme a3, and proton binding, could be simulated with a model where the pump proton interacted with heme a and the substrate proton interacted with heme a3 with anti-cooperativity between proton binding sites, but not with a single proton binding site coupled to both hemes.",

     "abstract": "Aspects of the crystal structures of the hetero-oligomeric cytochrome bc1 and b6f (\u201cbc\u201d) complexes relevant to their electron/proton transfer function and the associated redox reactions of the lipophilic quinones are discussed. Differences between the b6f and bc1 complexes are emphasized. The cytochrome bc1 and b6f dimeric complexes diverge in structure from a core of subunits that coordinate redox groups consisting of two bis-histidine coordinated hemes, a heme bn and bp on the electrochemically negative (n) and positive (p) sides of the complex, the high potential [2Fe\u20132S] cluster and c-type heme at the p-side aqueous interface and aqueous phase, respectively, and quinone/quinol binding sites on the n- and p-sides of the complex. The bc1 and b6f complexes diverge in subunit composition and structure away from this core. b6f Also contains additional prosthetic groups including a c-type heme cn on the n-side, and a chlorophyll a and \u03b2-carotene. Common structure aspects; functions of the symmetric dimer. (I) Quinone exchange with the bilayer. An inter-monomer protein-free cavity of approximately 30\u00a0\u00c5 along the membrane normal\u00a0\u00d7\u00a025\u00a0\u00c5 (central inter-monomer distance)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0\u00c5 (depth in the center), is common to both bc1 and b6f complexes, providing a niche in which the lipophilic quinone/quinol (Q/QH2) can be exchanged with the membrane bilayer. (II) Electron transfer. The dimeric structure and the proximity of the two hemes bp on the electrochemically positive side of the complex in the two monomer units allow the possibility of two alternate routes of electron transfer across the complex from heme bp to bn: intra-monomer and inter-monomer involving electron cross-over between the two hemes bp. A structure-based summary of inter-heme distances in seven bc complexes, representing mitochondrial, chromatophore, cyanobacterial, and algal sources, indicates that, based on the distance parameter, the intra-monomer pathway would be favored kinetically. (III) Separation of quinone binding sites. A consequence of the dimer structure and the position of the Q/QH2 binding sites is that the p-side QH2 oxidation and n-side Q reduction sites are each well separated. Therefore, in the event of an overlap in residence time by QH2 or Q molecules at the two oxidation or reduction sites, their spatial separation would result in minimal steric interference between extended Q or QH2 isoprenoid chains. (IV) Trans-membrane QH2/Q transfer. (i) n/p-side QH2/Q transfer may be hindered by lipid acyl chains; (ii) the shorter less hindered inter-monomer pathway across the complex would not pass through the center of the cavity, as inferred from the n-side antimycin site on one monomer and the p-side stigmatellin site on the other residing on the same surface of the complex. (V) Narrow p-side portal for QH2/Q passage. The [2Fe\u20132S] cluster that serves as oxidant, and whose histidine ligand serves as a H+ acceptor in the oxidation of QH2, is connected to the inter-monomer cavity by a narrow extended portal, which is also occupied in the b6f complex by the 20 carbon phytyl chain of the bound chlorophyll.",

Although the inactivation of the recA gene strongly suppressed a homologous recombination in C. tepidum genomic DNA, the mutant grew well under normal photosynthetic conditions. The His-tagged reaction center (RC) complex could be obtained simply by Ni2+-affinity chromatography after detergent solubilization of chlorosome-containing membranes. The complex consisted of three subunits, PscA, PscB, and PscC, in addition to the Fenna\u2013Matthews\u2013Olson protein, but there was no PscD. Low-temperature EPR spectroscopic studies in combination with transient absorption measurements indicated that the complex contained all intrinsic electron transfer cofactors as detected in the wild-type strain. Furthermore, the LC/MS/MS analysis revealed that the core protein consisted of a mixture of a His-/His-tagged PscA homodimer and a non-/His-tagged PscA heterodimer. The development of the pscA gene duplication method presented here, thus, enables not only a quick and large-scale preparation of the RC complex from C. tepidum but also site-directed mutagenesis experiments on the artificially incorporated 6xHis-tag-pscA gene itself, since the expression of the authentic PscA/PscA homodimeric RC complex could complement any defect in mutated His-tagged PscA. This method would provide an invaluable tool for structural and functional analyses of the homodimeric type 1 RC complex.",

     "abstract": "Loss of dopamine (DA) homeostasis may be a contributing factor to cell damage in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past studies showing deleterious effects of DA on mitochondrial function, however, have been inconsistent raising questions about mitochondria as a downstream target for DA. Issues such as the dopamine species i.e., reduced or oxidized, time of exposure and the effect of major metabolites such as 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (DOPAC) may contribute to the disparate findings. The present study used isolated, lysed rat brain mitochondria to characterize the effects of oxidized or reduced DA and DOPAC on complex activities of the electron transport chain (ETC). Time of exposure and quantitation of reduced or oxidized catachols for DA and DOPAC were monitored for all experiments. Reduced DA and DOPAC with or without a 30\u00a0min preincubation had no affect on NADH oxidase activity which monitors the activities of complexes I, III and IV. Complex II activity was inhibited by reduced DA (\u2265\u00a0500\u00a0\u03bcM), but not by reduced DOPAC and was significantly attenuated by SOD suggesting reactive oxygen species involvement. In contrast, fully oxidized DA and DOPAC dose dependently inhibited NADH oxidase, complex I and complex III activities with IC50s in the 50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM range. No preincubation was required for inhibition with the catechols when they were fully oxidized. Oxidized DA inhibited complex I only when exposure occurred during stimulated electron flow, suggesting covalent binding of quinones to proteins within active sites of the complex. In intact, well coupled mitochondria, extramitochondrial DA was shown to access the mitochondrial matrix in a dose, time and energy-dependent fashion. The findings suggest that many of the reported inconsistencies with regards to the effects of DA and DOPAC on ETC function can be attributed to the oxidized state of the catechol at the time of exposure. In addition, the findings provide possible downstream targets for DA that could contribute to the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD.",

The data presented here show that there is very little difference between the two species. Specifically it is shown that: (i) only small changes are seen in the fitted isotropic hyperfine values, suggesting that there is no significant difference in the overall spin distribution (electronic coupling scheme) between the two species; (ii) the inferred fine-structure tensor of the only MnIII ion in the cluster is of the same magnitude and geometry for both species types, suggesting that the MnIII ion has the same coordination sphere in both sample preparations; and (iii) the data from both species are consistent with only one structural model available in the literature, namely the Siegbahn structure [Siegbahn, P. E. M. Accounts Chem. Res.2009, 42, 1871\u20131880, Pantazis, D. A. et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.2009, 11, 6788\u20136798]. These measurements were made in the presence of methanol because it confers favorable magnetic relaxation properties to the cluster that facilitate pulse-EPR techniques. In the absence of methanol the separation of the ground state and the first excited state of the spin system is smaller. For cyanobacteria this effect is minor but in plant PS II it leads to a break-down of the ST\u00a0=\u00a0\u00bd spin model of the S2 state. This suggests that the methanol\u2013OEC interaction is species dependent. It is proposed that the effect of small organic solvents on the electronic structure of the cluster is to change the coupling between the outer Mn (MnA) and the other three Mn ions that form the trimeric part of the cluster (MnB, MnC, MnD), by perturbing the linking bis-\u03bc-oxo bridge. The flexibility of this bridging unit is discussed with regard to the mechanism of O-O bond formation.",

Instead, acclimation to high light intensity seems to involve an increase of alloxanthin.

Both the plastid-encoded gene (hlipP) and the nucleomorph-encoded gene (HlipNm) are expressed, but transcript levels decrease rather than increase during high light exposure, suggesting that they are not involved in a high light stress response.

     "abstract": "Evidence suggests that mitochondrial metabolism may play a key role in controlling cancer cells life and proliferation. Recent evidence also indicates how the altered contribution of these organelles to metabolism and the resistance of cancer mitochondria against apoptosis-associated permeabilization are closely related. The hallmarks of cancer growth, increased glycolysis and lactate production in tumours, have raised attention due to recent observations suggesting a wide spectrum of oxidative phosphorylation deficit and decreased availability of ATP associated with malignancies and tumour cell expansion. More specifically, alteration in signal transduction pathways directly affects mitochondrial proteins playing critical roles in controlling the membrane potential as UCP2 and components of both MPTP and oxphos complexes, or in controlling cells life and death as the Bcl-2 proteins family. Moreover, since mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics, are also involved in processes of cells life and death, proper regulation of these mitochondrial functions is crucial for tumours to grow. Therefore a better understanding of the key pathophysiological differences between mitochondria in cancer cells and in their non-cancer surrounding tissue is crucial to the finding of tools interfering with these peculiar tumour mitochondrial functions and will disclose novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of malignant diseases. Here, we review the peculiarity of tumour mitochondrial bioenergetics and the mode it is linked to the cell metabolism, providing a short overview of the evidence accumulated so far, but highlighting the more recent advances.

This phenotype was first reported by Otto Warburg, who suggested that the increased glucose consumption of cancer cells under aerobic conditions might result from an impaired bioenergetic activity of their mitochondria. A central player in defining the bioenergetic activity of the cell is the mitochondrial H+-ATP synthase. The expression of its catalytic subunit \u03b2-F1-ATPase is tightly regulated at post-transcriptional levels during mammalian development and in the cell cycle. Moreover, the down-regulation of \u03b2-F1-ATPase is a hallmark of most human carcinomas. In this review we summarize our present understanding of the molecular mechanisms that participate in promoting the \u201cabnormal\u201d aerobic glycolysis of prevalent human carcinomas. The role of the ATPase Inhibitor Factor 1 (IF1) and of Ras-GAP SH3 binding protein 1 (G3BP1), controlling the activity of the H+-ATP synthase and the translation of \u03b2-F1-ATPase mRNA respectively in cancer cells is emphasized. Furthermore, we underline the role of mitochondrial dysfunction as a pivotal player of tumorigenesis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bioenergetics of Cancer.",

     "abstract": "A considerable amount of knowledge has been produced during the last five years on the bioenergetics of cancer cells, leading to a better understanding of the regulation of energy metabolism during oncogenesis, or in adverse conditions of energy substrate intermittent deprivation. The general enhancement of the glycolytic machinery in various cancer cell lines is well described and recent analyses give a better view of the changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation during oncogenesis. While some studies demonstrate a reduction of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity in different types of cancer cells, other investigations revealed contradictory modifications with the upregulation of OXPHOS components and a larger dependency of cancer cells on oxidative energy substrates for anabolism and energy production. This apparent conflictual picture is explained by differences in tumor size, hypoxia, and the sequence of oncogenes activated. The role of p53, C-MYC, Oct and RAS on the control of mitochondrial respiration and glutamine utilization has been explained recently on artificial models of tumorigenesis. Likewise, the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from oncogene activation also showed the role of C-MYC and Oct in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS generation. In this review article we put emphasis on the description of various bioenergetic types of tumors, from exclusively glycolytic to mainly OXPHOS, and the modulation of both the metabolic apparatus and the modalities of energy substrate utilization according to tumor stage, serial oncogene activation and associated or not fluctuating microenvironmental substrate conditions. We conclude on the importance of a dynamic view of tumor bioenergetics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bioenergetics of Cancer.",

     "abstract": "Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), a mitochondrial protein that facilitates the exchange of ADP and ATP across the mitochondrial inner membrane, plays an essential role in cellular energy metabolism. Human ANT presents four isoforms (ANT1-4), each with a specific expression depending on the nature of the tissue, cell type, developmental stage and status of cell proliferation. Thus, ANT1 is specific to muscle and brain tissues; ANT2 occurs mainly in proliferative, undifferentiated cells; ANT3 is ubiquitous; and ANT4 is found in germ cells. ANT1 and ANT3 export the ATP produced by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) from the mitochondria into the cytosol while importing ADP. In contrast, the expression of ANT2, which is linked to the rate of glycolytic metabolism, is an important indicator of carcinogenesis. In fact, cancers are characterized by major metabolic changes that switch cells from the normally dual oxidative and glycolytic metabolisms to an almost exclusively glycolytic metabolism. When OxPhos activity is impaired, ANT2 imports glycolytically produced ATP into the mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix, the F1F0-ATPase complex hydrolyzes the ATP, pumping out a proton into the intermembrane space. The reverse operations of ANT2 and F1F0-ATPase under glycolytic conditions contribute to maintaining the mitochondrial membrane potential, ensuring cell survival and proliferation. Unlike the ANT1 and ANT3 isoforms, ANT2 is not pro-apoptotic and may therefore contribute to carcinogenesis. Since the expression of ANT2 is closely linked to the mitochondrial bioenergetics of tumors, it should be taken into account for individualizing cancer treatments and for the development of anticancer strategies.

     "abstract": "During the last decades a considerable amount of research has been focused on cancer. Recently, tumor cell metabolism has been considered as a possible target for cancer therapy. It is widely accepted that tumors display enhanced glycolytic activity and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect). Therefore, it seems reasonable that disruption of glycolysis might be a promising candidate for specific anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the concept of aerobic glycolysis as the paradigm of tumor cell metabolism has been challenged, as some tumor cells exhibit high rates of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial physiology in cancer cells is linked to the Warburg effect. Besides, its central role in apoptosis makes this organelle a promising \u201cdual hit target\u201d to selectively eliminate tumor cells. From a metabolic point of view, the fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tumor cells share several features.

     "abstract": "Malignant brain tumors are a significant health problem in children and adults. Conventional therapeutic approaches have been largely unsuccessful in providing long-term management. As primarily a metabolic disease, malignant brain cancer can be managed through changes in metabolic environment. In contrast to normal neurons and glia, which readily transition to ketone bodies (\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate) for energy under reduced glucose, malignant brain tumors are strongly dependent on glycolysis for energy. The transition from glucose to ketone bodies as a major energy source is an evolutionary conserved adaptation to food deprivation that permits the survival of normal cells during extreme shifts in nutritional environment. Only those cells with a flexible genome and normal mitochondria can effectively transition from one energy state to another. Mutations restrict genomic and metabolic flexibility thus making tumor cells more vulnerable to energy stress than normal cells. We propose an alternative approach to brain cancer management that exploits the metabolic flexibility of normal cells at the expense of the genetically defective and metabolically challenged tumor cells. This approach to brain cancer management is supported from recent studies in mice and humans treated with calorie restriction and the ketogenic diet. Issues of implementation and use protocols are presented for the metabolic management of brain cancer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bioenergetics of Cancer.",

The deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species may be responsible for the impairment of mitochondrial function observed during various pathophysiological states associated with oxidative stress and cancer. These organelles are also targets of oxidative damage (oxidation of mitochondrial DNA, lipids, protein). An important factor for protein maintenance in the presence of oxidative stress is enzymatic reversal of oxidative modifications and/or protein degradation. Failure of these processes is likely a critical component of the cancer process. Mitochondrial proteases degrade misfolded and non-assemble polypeptides, thus performing quality control surveillance in the organelle. Mitochondrial proteases may be directly involved in cancer development as recently shown for HtrA2/Omi or may regulate crucial mitochondrial molecule such as cytochrome c oxidase 4 a subunit of the cytochrome c oxidase complex degraded by the Lon protease.

While enforcing antioxidant defenses by overexpressing catalase, CuZnSOD, or MnSOD could not block the metabolism remodeling, impaired NOX-1 activation abrogates both alteration in ROS levels and modifications of energy metabolism.

     "abstract": "Warburg proposed that cancer originates from irreversible injury to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mtOXPHOS), which leads to an increase rate of aerobic glycolysis in most cancers. However, despite several decades of research related to Warburg effect, very little is known about the underlying genetic cause(s) of mtOXPHOS impairment in cancers. Proteins that participate in mtOXPHOS are encoded by both mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as well as nuclear DNA. This review describes mutations in mtDNA and reduced mtDNA copy number, which contribute to OXPHOS defects in cancer cells. Maternally inherited mtDNA renders susceptibility to cancer, and mutation in the nuclear encoded genes causes defects in mtOXPHOS system. Mitochondria damage checkpoint (mitocheckpoint) induces epigenomic changes in the nucleus, which can reverse injury to OXPHOS. However, irreversible injury to OXPHOS can lead to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction inducing genetic instability in the nuclear genome. Together, we propose that \u201cmitocheckpoint\u201d led epigenomic and genomic changes must play a key role in reversible and irreversible injury to OXPHOS described by Warburg. These epigenetic and genetic changes underlie the Warburg phenotype, which contributes to the development of cancer. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Bioenergetics of Cancer.",

HIT proteins are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. HIT proteins bind nucleotides and exert dinucleotidyl hydrolase, nucleotidylyl transferase or phosphoramidate hydrolase enzymatic activity. In humans, 5 families of HIT proteins are recognized. The accumulated epidemiological and experimental evidence indicates that two branches of the superfamily, the HINT (Histidine Triad Nucleotide Binding) members and FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), have tumor suppressor properties but a conclusive physiological role can still not be assigned to these proteins. Aprataxin forms another discrete branch of the HIT superfamily, is implicated in DNA repair mechanisms and unlike the HINT and FHIT members, a defective protein can be conclusively linked to a disease, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1. The scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme, DcpS, forms a fourth branch of the HIT superfamily. Finally, the GalT enzymes, which exert specific nucleoside monophosphate transferase activity, form a fifth branch that is not implicated in tumorigenesis.

Apoptosis resistance and metabolic reprogramming are linked in many cancer cells and both processes center on mitochondria. Clearly, mutated cancer cells escape surveillance and turn into selfish cells. However, many of the mechanisms that operate cellular metabolic control still function in cancer cells. This review describes the metabolic importance of glucose and glutamine, glycolytic enzymes, oxygen, growth cofactors and mitochondria and focuses on the potential role of bioactive food components, including micronutrients. The role of B- and A-vitamin cofactors in (mitochondrial) metabolism is highlighted and the cancer protective potential of omega-3 fatty acids and several polyphenols is discussed in relation to metabolic reprogramming, including the mechanisms that may be involved. Furthermore, it is shown that cancer cell growth reduction by limiting the growth cofactor folic acid seems to be associated with reversal of metabolic reprogramming. Altogether, reversal of metabolic reprogramming may be an attractive strategy to increase susceptibility to apoptotic surveillance. Food bioactive components that affect various aspects of metabolism may be important tools to reverse glycolytic to oxidative metabolism and enhance sensitivity to apoptosis. The success of such a strategy may depend on several actors, acting in concert. Growth cofactors may be one of these, which call for careful (re)evaluation of their function in normal and in cancer metabolism.

AICAR can also stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in myoblasts, neurons and HeLa cells. Yet, whether the reactivation of oxidative phosphorylation biogenesis by AICAR contributes to the growth arrest of cancer cells remains undetermined. To investigate this possibility, we looked at the impact of 24- and 48-hour treatments with 750\u00a0\u03bcM AICAR on human cancer cell lines (HeLa, DU145, and HEPG2), non-cancer cells (EM64, FM14, and HLF), embryonic cells (MRC5) and Rho0 cells.

We also followed possible changes in metabolic regulators such as Akt and Hif1-\u03b1 stabilization which might participate to the anti-proliferative effect of AICAR. Our results demonstrated a strong and cancer-specific anti-growth effect of AICAR that may be explained by three different modes according to cell type: the first mode included stimulation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway however with compensatory activation of Akt and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation. In the second mode of action of AICAR Akt phosphorylation was reduced. In the third mode of action, apoptosis was activated by different pathways.

Mitochondrial alterations and reduction in energy metabolism have been previously reported in the context of glucocorticoid (GC)-triggered apoptosis, although the mechanism is not yet clarified. We analyzed mitochondrial function in a GC-sensitive precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) model as well as in GC-sensitive and GC-resistant T-ALL model systems. Respiratory activity was preserved in intact GC-sensitive cells up to 24\u00a0h under treatment with 100\u00a0nM dexamethasone before depression of mitochondrial respiration occurred. Severe repression of mitochondrial respiratory function was observed after permeabilization of the cell membrane and provision of exogenous substrates. Several mitochondrial metabolite and protein transporters and two subunits of the ATP synthase were downregulated in the T-ALL and in the precursor B-ALL model at the gene expression level under dexamethasone treatment. These data could partly be confirmed in ALL lymphoblasts from patients, dependent on the molecular abnormality in the ALL cells. GC-resistant cell lines did not show any of these defects after dexamethasone treatment. In conclusion, in GC-sensitive ALL cells, dexamethasone induces changes in membrane properties that together with the reduced expression of mitochondrial transporters of substrates and proteins may lead to repressed mitochondrial respiratory activity and lower ATP levels that contribute to GC-induced apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Normal differentiated cells rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain their viability and functions by using three major bioenergetic fuels: glucose, glutamine and fatty acids. Many cancer cells, however, rely on aerobic glycolysis for their growth and survival, and recent studies indicate that some cancer cells depend on glutamine as well. This altered metabolism in cancers occurs through oncogene activation or loss of tumor suppressor genes in multiple signaling pathways, including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Myc pathways. Relatively little is known, however, about the role of fatty acids as a bioenergetic fuel in growth and survival of cancer cells. Here, we report that human glioblastoma SF188 cells oxidize fatty acids and that inhibition of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation by etomoxir, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 inhibitor, markedly reduces cellular ATP levels and viability. We also found that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation decreases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) levels and the reduced glutathione (GSH) content and elevates intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results suggest that modulation of fatty acid oxidation controls the NADPH level. In the presence of reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron, however, ATP depletion is prevented without restoring fatty acid oxidation. This suggests that oxidative stress may lead to bioenergetic failure and cell death. Our work provides evidence that mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation may provide NADPH for defense against oxidative stress and prevent ATP loss and cell death.

     "abstract": "Metabolic adaptations are associated with changes in enzyme activities. These adaptations are characterized by patterns of positive and negative changes in metabolic fluxes and concentrations of intermediate metabolites. Knowledge of the mechanism and parameters governing enzyme kinetics is rarely available. However, the signs\u2014increases or decreases\u2014of many of these changes can be predicted using the signs of metabolic control coefficients. These signs require the only knowledge of the structure of the metabolic network and a limited qualitative knowledge of the regulatory dependences, which is widely available for carbon metabolism. Here, as a case study, we identified control coefficients with fixed signs in order to predict the pattern of changes in key enzyme activities which can explain the observed changes in fluxes and concentrations underlying the metabolic adaptations in oncogenic K-ras transformation in NIH-3T3 cells. The fixed signs of control coefficients indicate that metabolic changes following the oncogenic transformation\u2014increased glycolysis and oxidative branch of the pentose-phosphate pathway, and decreased concentration in sugar-phosphates\u2014could be associated with increases in activity for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, and decrease for transketolase. These predictions were validated experimentally by measuring specific activities. We conclude that predictions based on fixed signs of control coefficients are a very robust tool for the identification of changes in enzyme activities that can explain observed metabolic adaptations in carbon metabolism.

     "abstract": "Most cancer cells exhibit an accelerated glycolysis rate compared to normal cells. This metabolic change is associated with the over-expression of all the pathway enzymes and transporters (as induced by HIF-1\u03b1 and other oncogenes), and with the expression of hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase type 1 (PFK-1) isoenzymes with different regulatory properties. Hence, a control distribution of tumor glycolysis, modified from that observed in normal cells, can be expected. To define the control distribution and to understand the underlying control mechanisms, kinetic models of glycolysis of rodent AS-30D hepatoma and human cervix HeLa cells were constructed with experimental data obtained here for each pathway step (enzyme kinetics; steady-state pathway metabolite concentrations and fluxes). The models predicted with high accuracy the fluxes and metabolite concentrations found in living cancer cells under physiological O2 and glucose concentrations as well as under hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions prevailing during tumor progression. The results indicated that HK\u00a0\u2265\u00a0HPI\u00a0>\u00a0GLUT in AS-30D whereas glycogen degradation\u00a0\u2265\u00a0GLUT\u00a0>\u00a0HK in HeLa were the main flux- and ATP concentration-control steps. Modeling also revealed that, in order to diminish the glycolytic flux or the ATP concentration by 50%, it was required to decrease GLUT or HK or HPI by 76% (AS-30D), and GLUT or glycogen degradation by 87\u201399% (HeLa), or decreasing simultaneously the mentioned steps by 47%. Thus, these proteins are proposed to be the foremost therapeutic targets because their simultaneous inhibition will have greater antagonistic effects on tumor energy metabolism than inhibition of all other glycolytic, non-controlling, enzymes.

To investigate the molecular environment of pigments after pigment replacement but before optimization of the protein moiety in photosynthetic organisms, we compared the fluorescence properties of the divinyl Chl a-containing cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus marinus (CCMP 1986, CCMP 2773 and CCMP 1375), by a Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Synechocystis) mutant in which monovinyl Chl a was replaced with divinyl Chl a. P. marinus showed a single fluorescence band for photosystem (PS) II at 687\u00a0nm at 77\u00a0K; this was accompanied with change in pigment, because the Synechocystis mutant showed the identical shift. No fluorescence bands corresponding to the PS II 696-nm component and PS I longer-wavelength component were detected in P. marinus, although the presence of the former was suggested using time-resolved fluorescence spectra. Delayed fluorescence (DF) was detected at approximately 688\u00a0nm with a lifetime of approximately 29\u00a0ns. In striking contrast, the Synechocystis mutant showed three fluorescence bands at 687, 696, and 727\u00a0nm, but suppressed DF. These differences in fluorescence behaviors might not only reflect differences in the molecular structure of pigments but also differences in molecular environments of pigments, including pigment\u2013pigment and/or pigment\u2013protein interactions, in the antenna and electron transfer systems.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial permeability transition is an increase of permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane to ions and solutes with an exclusion size of about 1500\u00a0Da. It is generally accepted that the permeability transition is due to opening of a high-conductance channel, the permeability transition pore. Although the molecular nature of the permeability transition pore remains undefined, a great deal is known about its regulation and role in pathophysiology. This review specifically covers the characterization of the permeability transition pore by chemical modification of specific residues through photoirradiation of mitochondria after treatment with porphyrins. The review also illustrates the basic principles of the photodynamic effect and the mechanisms of phototoxicity and discusses the unique properties of singlet oxygen generated by specific porphyrins in discrete mitochondrial domains. These experiments provided remarkable information on the role, interactions and topology of His and Cys residues in permeability transition pore modulation and defined an important role for the outer membrane 18\u00a0kDa translocator protein (formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) in regulation of the permeability transition.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria-derived oxygen-free radical(s) are important mediators of oxidative cellular injury. It is widely hypothesized that excess NO enhances O2\u2022\u2212 generated by mitochondria under certain pathological conditions. In the mitochondrial electron transport chain, succinate\u2013cytochrome c reductase (SCR) catalyzes the electron transfer reaction from succinate to cytochrome c. To gain the insights into the molecular mechanism of how NO overproduction may mediate the oxygen-free radical generation by SCR, we employed isolated SCR, cardiac myoblast H9c2, and endothelial cells to study the interaction of NO with SCR in vitro and ex vivo. Under the conditions of enzyme turnover in the presence of NO donor (DEANO), SCR gained pro-oxidant function for generating hydroxyl radical as detected by EPR spin trapping using DEPMPO. The EPR signal associated with DEPMPO/\u2022OH adduct was nearly completely abolished in the presence of catalase or an iron chelator and partially inhibited by SOD, suggesting the involvement of the iron\u2013H2O2-dependent Fenton reaction or O2\u2022\u2212-dependent Haber\u2013Weiss mechanism. Direct EPR measurement of SCR at 77\u00a0K indicated the formation of a nonheme iron\u2013NO complex, implying that electron leakage to molecular oxygen was enhanced at the FAD cofactor, and that excess NO predisposed SCR to produce \u2022OH. In H9c2 cells, SCR-dependent oxygen-free radical generation was stimulated by NO released from DEANO or produced by the cells following exposure to hypoxia/reoxygenation. With shear exposure that led to overproduction of NO by the endothelium, SCR-mediated oxygen-free radical production was also detected in cultured vascular endothelial cells.",

A concerted mechanism is proposed, where proton transfer in DdH from Glu159 to Glu156 via Ser198 and Glu156 to Cys178 via water460 readily occurred, as well as from Glu282 to Glu279 via Ser319 and Glu279 to Cys299 via water612 in CpI. The theoretical prediction of the proton transfer characteristics is consistent with the assumed biocatalytic mechanism of the [Fe\u2015Fe] hydrogenases in which the proton binds at Fed, providing confirmation that has not been explored so far. The computational results were qualitatively validated by the agreement with experimental hydrogen production activity data for mutated CpI enzymes, relative to the wild-type protein.

Transgenic plants were highly sensitive to photooxidative stress and accumulated increased levels of O2\u2022\u2212 under normal light conditions.

Immunoblot and blue native gel analyses showed that PSII protein accumulation was also decreased in transgenic plants. PSII photodamage and D1 protein degradation under high light treatment was increased in transgenic plants, whereas the PSII repair was not affected, indicating that the stability of the PSII complex was decreased in transgenic plants. The results in this study suggest that FeSOD plays an important role in maintaining PSII function by stabilizing PSII complexes in tobacco plants.",

Dithionite-reduced OmcS was able to transfer electrons to a variety of substrates of environmental importance including insoluble Fe(III) oxide, Mn(IV) oxide and humic substances. Stopped flow analysis revealed that the reaction rate of OmcS oxidation has a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of the studied substrates. A ten-fold faster reaction rate with anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) (25.2\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) was observed as compared to that with Fe(III) citrate (2.9\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01). The results, coupled with previous localization and gene deletion studies, suggest that OmcS is well-suited to play an important role in extracellular electron transfer.",

     "abstract": "Gaining detailed understanding of the energetics of the proton-pumping process in cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) is a problem of great current interest. Despite promising mechanistic proposals, so far, a physically consistent model that would reproduce all the relevant barriers needed to create a working pump has not been presented. In addition, there are major problems in elucidating the origin of key mutational effects and in understanding the nature of the apparent pKa values associated with the pH dependencies of specific proton transfer (PT) reactions in CcO. This work takes a key step in resolving the above problems, by considering mutations, such as the Asn139Asp replacement, that blocks proton pumping without affecting PT to the catalytic site. We first introduce a formulation that makes it possible to relate the apparent pKa of Glu286 to different conformational states of this residue. We then use the new formulation along with the calculated pKa values of Glu286 at these different conformations to reproduce the experimentally observed apparent pKa of the residue. Next, we take the X-ray structures of the native and Asn139Asp mutant of the Paracoccus denitrificans CcO (N131D in this system) and reproduce for the first time the change in the primary PT pathways (and other key features) based on simulations that start with the observed structural changes. We also consider the competition between proton transport to the catalytic site and the pump site, as a function of the bulk pH, as well as the H/D isotope effect, and use this information to explore the relative height of the two barriers. The paper emphasizes the crucial role of energy-based considerations that include the PT process, and the delicate control of PT in CcO.",

     "abstract": "The complex I subunits NuoL, NuoM and NuoN are homologous to two proteins, MrpA and MrpD, from one particular class of Na+/H+ antiporters. In many bacteria MrpA and MrpD are encoded by an operon comprising 6\u20137 conserved genes. In complex I these protein subunits are prime candidates for harboring important parts of the proton pumping machinery. Deletion of either mrpA or mrpD from the Bacillus subtilis chromosome resulted in a Na+ and pH sensitive growth phenotype. The deletion strains could be complemented in trans by their respective Mrp protein, but expression of MrpA in the B. subtilis \u0394mrpD strain and vice versa did not improve growth at pH 7.4. This corroborates that the two proteins have unique specific functions. Under the same conditions NuoL could rescue B. subtilis \u0394mrpA, but improved the growth of B. subtilis \u0394mrpD only slightly. NuoN could restore the wild type properties of B. subtilis \u0394mrpD, but had no effect on the \u0394mrpA strain. Expression of NuoM did not result in any growth improvement under these conditions. This reveals that the complex I subunits NuoL, NuoM and NuoN also demonstrate functional specializations. The simplest explanation that accounts for all previous and current observations is that the five homologous proteins are single ion transporters. Presumably, MrpA transports Na+ whereas MrpD transports H+ in opposite directions, resulting in antiporter activity. This hypothesis has implications for the complex I functional mechanism, suggesting that one Na+ channel, NuoL, and two H+ channels, NuoM and NuoN, are present.",

In particular, we were able to resolve several chlorophyll 131 carbon resonances that are sensitive to hydrogen bonding to the 131-keto carbonyl group.

By applying Corynebacterium glutamicum as model system we provide experimental evidence that under optimal conditions a potassium channel is sufficient in bacteria for the maintenance of internal pH and membrane potential ensuring survival of cells under stress conditions. Under potassium limitation, however, viability of C. glutamicum was increased under acidic stress or during desiccation when a functional KtrAB potassium transporter from the pathogen Corynebacterium jeikeium was heterologously expressed. We provide experimental evidence that the KtrAB mediated enhanced potassium accumulation improved maintenance of internal pH and membrane potential.

The midpoint reduction potentials of the other two metal centres in the enzyme, heme c and heme b, are greater than the dinuclear centre suggesting that they act as an electron receiving/storage module. Reduction of the low-spin heme b causes structural changes at the dinuclear centre which allow access to substrate molecules. In the presence of the substrate analogue, CO, the midpoint reduction potential of heme b3 is raised to a region similar to that of heme c and heme b. This leads us to suggest that reduction of the electron transfer hemes leads to an opening of the active site which allows substrate to bind and in turn raises the reduction potential of the active site such that electrons are only delivered to the active site following substrate binding.",

HL-1 cells are characterized by the absence of \u03b2II-tubulin, by the presence of bundles of filamentous \u03b2IV-tubulin and diffusely distributed \u03b2I- and \u03b2III-tubulins. Mitochondrial isoform of creatine kinase (MtCK), highly expressed in cardiomyocytes, is absent in HL-1 cells. Our results show that high apparent Km for exogenous ADP in regulation of respiration and high expression of MtCK both correlate with the expression of \u03b2II-tubulin. The absence of \u03b2II-tubulin isotype in isolated mitochondria and in HL-1 cells results in increased apparent affinity of oxidative phosphorylation for exogenous ADP. This observation is consistent with the assumption that the binding of \u03b2II-tubulin to mitochondria limits ADP/ATP diffusion through voltage-dependent anion channel of MOM and thus shifts energy transfer via the phosphocreatine pathway. On the other hand, absence of both \u03b2II-tubulin and MtCK in HL-1 cells can be associated with their more glycolysis-dependent energy metabolism which is typical for cancer cells (Warburg effect).",

Screening of the Drosophila melanogaster genome revealed the presence of a mitochondrial carrier subfamily constituted by four potential homologs of mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers designated as DmDic1p, DmDic2p, DmDic3p, and DmDic4p. In this paper, we report that DmDIC1 is broadly expressed at comparable levels in all development stages investigated whereas DmDIC3 and DmDIC4 are expressed only in the pupal stage, no transcripts are detectable for DmDIC2. All expressed proteins are localized in mitochondria. The transport activity of DmDic1-3-4 proteins has been investigated by reconstitution of recombinant purified protein into liposomes. DmDic1p is a typical dicarboxylate carrier showing similar substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity as mammalian and yeast mitochondrial dicarboxylate carriers. DmDic3p seems to be an atypical dicarboxylate carrier being able to transport only inorganic phosphate and certain sulfur-containing compounds. No transport activity was observed for DmDic4p. The biochemical results have been supported at molecular level by computing the protein structures and by structural alignments. All together these results indicate that D. melanogaster dicarboxylate carriers form a protein subfamily but the modifications in the amino acids sequences are indicative of specialized functions.",

The RC consists of L- and M-polypeptides containing three bacteriochlorophyll (BChl), three bacteriopheophytin (BPh) and two quinones (QA and QB), and the Cyt is a tetraheme subunit. Two of the BChls form a dimer P that is the primary electron donor. At 285\u00a0K, the lifetimes of the excited singlet state, P*, and the charge-separated state P+HA\u2212 (where HA is the photoactive BPh) were found to be 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0ps and 200\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0ps, respectively.

For the tetraheme Cyt two distinct midpoint potentials of +\u00a085 and +\u00a0265\u00a0mV were measured, likely reflecting a pair of low-potential hemes and a pair of high-potential hemes, respectively. The time course of electron transfer from reduced Cyt to P+ suggests an arrangement where the highest potential heme is not located immediately adjacent to P.

Under phosphorylating conditions, the coupling parameters were unchanged in the presence of high K+ level, indicating that plant K+ channels function as energy-dissipating systems that are not able to divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation. A potato tuber K+ channel that is ATP-, 5-hydroxydecanonic acid-, glybenclamide-inhibited and diazoxide-stimulated caused low cation flux, modestly decreasing membrane potential (up to a few mV) and increasing respiration in non-phosphorylating mitochondria. Immunological analysis with antibodies raised against the mammalian plasma membrane ATP-regulated K+ channel identified a pore-forming subunit of the Kir-like family in potato tuber mitochondrial inner membrane.

We concluded that E. coli complex I has two energy coupling sites (one Na+ independent and the other Na+ dependent), as previously observed for Rhodothermus marinus complex I, whereas the coupling mechanism of P. denitrificans enzyme is completely Na+ independent. This work thus shows that complex I energy transduction by proton pumping and Na+/H+ antiporting is not exclusive of the R. marinus enzyme.

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic organisms have developed photoprotective mechanisms to protect themselves from lethal high light intensities. One of these mechanisms involves the dissipation of excess absorbed light energy into heat. In cyanobacteria, light activation of a soluble carotenoid protein, the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP), binding a keto carotenoid, is the key inducer of this mechanism. Blue-green light absorption triggers structural changes within the carotenoid and the protein, leading to the conversion of a dark orange form into a red active form. Here we report the role in photoconversion and photoprotection of individual conserved tyrosines and tryptophans surrounding the rings of the carotenoid. Our results demonstrate that the interaction between the keto group of the carotenoid and Tyr201 and Trp288 is essential for OCP photoactivity. In addition, these amino acids are responsible for carotenoid affinity and specificity. We have already demonstrated that the aromatic character of Tyr44 and Trp110 interacting with the hydroxyl ring is critical. Here we show that the replacement of Tyr44 by Ser affects the stability of the red form avoiding its accumulation at any temperature, while Trp110Ser is affected in the energy necessary to the orange to red conversion and in the interaction with the antenna. Collectively our data support the idea that the red form is essential for photoprotection but not sufficient. Specific conformational changes occurring in the protein seem to be critical to the events leading to energy dissipation.",

The analysis of the cytoplasmic side of the oxoglutarate carrier showed that the conserved and symmetric residues of the mitochondrial carrier motif [DE]XX[RK] localized at the C-terminal end of the even-numbered transmembrane \u03b1-helices are important for the function of the carrier, but the non-conserved cytoplasmic loops and termini are not. On the mitochondrial matrix side of the carrier most residues of the three matrix \u03b1-helices that are in the interface with the transmembrane \u03b1-helical bundle are important for function. Among these are the residues of the symmetric [ED]G motif present at the C-terminus of the matrix \u03b1-helices; the tyrosines of the symmetric YK motif at the N-terminus of the matrix \u03b1-helices; and the hydrophobic residues M147, I171 and I247. The functional role of these residues was assessed in the structural context of the homology model of OGC. Furthermore, in this study no evidence was found for the presence of a specific homo-dimerisation interface on the surface of the carrier consisting of conserved, asymmetric and transport-critical residues.",

     "abstract": "Paracoccus denitrificans is a soil bacterium which can respire aerobically and also denitrify if oxygen is absent. Both processes are highly dependent on copper enzymes and copper is therefore likely to be an essential trace element for the bacterium. If copper is not easily available, a copper-acquisition mechanism would be highly beneficial. In this paper, we have addressed the question of whether Paracoccus secretes a copper-acquisition compound functionally analogous to that found in some methanotrophs. Bacteria were grown both in copper-containing and copper-deficient denitrification media, cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was analysed using chromatography and spectroscopy. Bacterial growth yield in the absence of copper was 70\u201380% of that in the copper-containing medium. A notable difference between the two culture conditions was that spent copper-deficient medium was pigmented, whereas the copper-containing medium was not. Spectrophotometry indicated that a red compound with an absorption maximum at 405\u00a0nm was produced under copper-limited conditions. In addition to the strong 405\u00a0nm maximum, the visible spectrum of the purified red molecule had weaker maxima at 535\u00a0nm and 570\u00a0nm, features typical of metallated tetrapyrroles. Mass spectrometry showed that the purified pigment had a molecular mass of 716.18. Moreover, the fine structure of the mass spectrum suggested the presence of zinc and was consistent with the chemical formula of C36H36N4O8Zn. The presence of zinc was also demonstrated using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. Fragmentation analysis with mass spectrometry showed the release of consecutive 59\u00a0Da fragments, assignable to four \u2212\u00a0CH2\u2013COOH moieties. Thin layer chromatography as well as NMR analysis of the C-13/N-15 labelled red pigment suggested that it is predominantly zinc coproporphyrin III with a minor fraction of metal-free coproporphyrin III. We propose that in a copper-poor environment P. denitrificans secretes coproporphyrin III for copper chelation and subsequent uptake of the bound copper into the cell. Consistent with this idea, cell yields of copper-deficient cultures grown in the presence of 1\u00a0\u03bcM copper-coproporphyrin III were 90\u201395% of the yields of cultures grown in the normal copper-containing media. Coproporphyrin III may work as a copper-acquisition compound in P. denitrificans.",

     "abstract": "PsbM and PsbI are two low molecular weight subunits of photosystem II (PSII), with PsbM being located in the center, and PsbI in the periphery, of the PSII dimer. In order to study the functions of these two subunits from a structural point of view, we crystallized and analyzed the crystal structure of PSII dimers from two mutants lacking either PsbM or PsbI. Our results confirmed the location of these two subunits in the current crystal structure, as well as their absence in the respective mutants. The relative contents of PSII dimers were found to be decreased in both mutants, with a concomitant increase in the amount of PSII monomers, suggesting a destabilization of PSII dimers in both of the mutants. On the other hand, the accumulation level of the overall PSII complexes in the two mutants was similar to that in the wild-type strain. Treatment of purified PSII dimers with lauryldimethylamine N-oxide at an elevated temperature preferentially disintegrated the dimers from the PsbM deletion mutant into monomers and CP43-less monomers, whereas no significant degradation of the dimers was observed from the PsbI deletion mutant. These results indicate that although both PsbM and PsbI are required for the efficient formation and stability of PSII dimers in vivo, they have different roles, namely, PsbM is required directly for the formation of dimers and its absence led to the instability of the dimers accumulated. On the other hand, PsbI is required in the assembly process of PSII dimers in vivo; once the dimers are formed, PsbI was no longer required for its stability.",

     "abstract": "In the present study the influence of the lipid environment on the organization of the main light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII) was investigated by 77K fluorescence spectroscopy. Measurements were carried out with a lipid-depleted and highly aggregated LHCII which was supplemented with the different thylakoid membrane lipids. The results show that the thylakoid lipids are able to modulate the spectroscopic properties of the LHCII aggregates and that the extent of the lipid effect depends on both the lipid species and the lipid concentration. Addition of the neutral galactolipids monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) seems to induce a modification of the disorganized structures of the lipid-depleted LHCII and to support the aggregated state of the complex. In contrast, we found that the anionic lipids sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) exert a strong disaggregating effect on the isolated LHCII. LHCII disaggregation was partly suppressed under a high proton concentration and in the presence of cations. The strongest suppression was visible at the lowest pH value (pH 5) and the highest Mg2+ concentration (40\u00a0mM) used in the present study. This suggests that the negative charge of the anionic lipids in conjunction with negatively charged domains of the LHCII proteins is responsible for the disaggregation. Additional measurements by photon correlation spectroscopy and sucrose gradient centrifugation, which were used to gain information about the size and molecular mass of the LHCII aggregates, confirmed the results of the fluorescence spectroscopy. LHCII treated with MGDG and DGDG formed an increased number of aggregates with large particle sizes in the \u03bcm-range, whereas the incubation with anionic lipids led to much smaller LHCII particles (around 40\u00a0nm in the case of PG) with a homogeneous distribution.",

     "abstract": "In this work, we have investigated the effects of atmospheric CO2 and O2 on induction events in Hibiscus rosa-sinensis leaves. These effects manifest themselves as multiphase kinetics of P700 redox transitions and non-monotonous changes in chlorophyll fluorescence. Depletion of CO2 and O2 in air causes a decrease in linear electron flux (LEF) and dramatic lowering of P700+ level. This is explained by the impediment to electron efflux from photosystem 1 (PS1) at low acceptor capacity. With the release of the acceptor deficit, the rate of LEF significantly increases. We have found that oxygen promotes the outflow of electrons from PS1, providing the rise of P700+ level. The effect of oxygen as an alternative electron acceptor becomes apparent at low and ambient concentrations of atmospheric CO2 (\u22640.06\u20130.07%). A decrease in LEF at low CO2 is accompanied by a significant (about 3-fold) rise of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll fluorescence. Such an increase in NPQ can be explained by more significant acidification of the thylakoid lumen. This occurs due to lessening the proton flux through the ATP synthases caused by a decrease in the ATP consumption in the Bassham\u2013Benson\u2013Calvin (BBC) cycle. pH-dependent mechanisms of electron transport control have been described within the frames of our mathematical model. The model describes the reciprocal changes in LEF and NPQ and predicts the redistribution of electron fluxes on the acceptor side of PS1. In particular, the contribution of cyclic electron flow around PS1 (CEF1) and water\u2013water cycle gradually decays during the induction phase. This result is consistent with experimental data indicating that under the steady-state conditions the contribution of CEF1 to photosynthetic electron transport in Hibiscus rosa-sinensis is insignificant (\u2264\u00a010%).",

It enables the calculation of the steady-state turnover rates and enzyme-state populations as functions of the cytochrome c reduction state, oxygen concentration, membrane potential, and pH on either side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We use the model to explain the enigmatic decrease in oxygen affinity of the enzyme that has been observed in mitochondria when the proton-motive force is increased. The importance of the 26 transitions in the mechanism of cytochrome oxidase for the functional properties of cytochrome oxidase is compared through Metabolic Control Analysis. The control of the KM value is distributed mainly between the steps in the mechanism that involve electrogenic proton movements, with both positive and negative contributions. Positive contributions derive from the same steps that control enzyme turnover rate in the model. Limitations and possible further applications of the model are discussed.",

In the present work we provide multiple evidence for the plastid localization of a glutamate receptor, AtGLR3.4, in Arabidopsis and tobacco. Biochemical analysis was performed using an antibody shown to specifically recognize both the native protein in Arabidopsis and the recombinant AtGLR3.4 fused to YFP expressed in tobacco. Western blots indicate the presence of AtGLR3.4 in both the plasmamembrane and in chloroplasts. In agreement, in transformed Arabidopsis cultured cells as well as in agroinfiltrated tobacco leaves, AtGLR3.4::YFP is detected both at the plasmamembrane and at the plastid level by confocal microscopy. The photosynthetic phenotype of mutant plants lacking AtGLR3.4 was also investigated. These results identify for the first time a dual localization of a glutamate receptor, revealing its presence in plastids and chloroplasts and opening the way to functional studies.",

     "abstract": "The photosynthetic electron transport chain consists of photosystem II, the cytochrome b6f complex, photosystem I, and the free electron carriers plastoquinone and plastocyanin. Light-driven charge separation events occur at the level of photosystem II and photosystem I, which are associated at one end of the chain with the oxidation of water followed by electron flow along the electron transport chain and concomitant pumping of protons into the thylakoid lumen, which is used by the ATP synthase to generate ATP. At the other end of the chain reducing power is generated, which together with ATP is used for CO2 assimilation. A remarkable feature of the photosynthetic apparatus is its ability to adapt to changes in environmental conditions by sensing light quality and quantity, CO2 levels, temperature, and nutrient availability. These acclimation responses involve a complex signaling network in the chloroplasts comprising the thylakoid protein kinases Stt7/STN7 and Stl1/STN7 and the phosphatase PPH1/TAP38, which play important roles in state transitions and in the regulation of electron flow as well as in thylakoid membrane folding. The activity of some of these enzymes is closely connected to the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, and they appear to be involved both in short-term and long-term acclimation.

     "abstract": "Secondary active transporters couple the free energy of the electrochemical potential of one solute to the transmembrane movement of another. As a basic mechanistic explanation for their transport function the model of alternating access was put forward more than 40\u00a0years ago, and has been supported by numerous kinetic, biochemical and biophysical studies. According to this model, the transporter exposes its substrate binding site(s) to one side of the membrane or the other during transport catalysis, requiring a substantial conformational change of the carrier protein. In the light of recent structural data for a number of secondary transport proteins, we analyze the model of alternating access in more detail, and correlate it with specific structural and chemical properties of the transporters, such as their assignment to different functional states in the catalytic cycle of the respective transporter, the definition of substrate binding sites, the type of movement of the central part of the carrier harboring the substrate binding site, as well as the impact of symmetry on fold-specific conformational changes. Besides mediating the transmembrane movement of solutes, the mechanism of secondary carriers inherently involves a mechanistic coupling of substrate flux to the electrochemical potential of co-substrate ions or solutes. Mainly because of limitations in resolution of available transporter structures, this important aspect of secondary transport cannot yet be substantiated by structural data to the same extent as the conformational change aspect. We summarize the concepts of coupling in secondary transport and discuss them in the context of the available evidence for ion binding to specific sites and the impact of the ions on the conformational state of the carrier protein, which together lead to mechanistic models for coupling.",

During the long-term cultivation of this mutant under photosynthetic conditions, a suppressor strain recovering the wild-type growth level appeared. In the cells of the suppressor strain, we found significant accumulation of a soluble c-type cytochrome that has not been detected in wild-type cells.

The amino acid sequence of this cytochrome c was 65% identical to that of the high-potential cytochrome c8 of this bacterium. The gene for this cytochrome c was identified as nirM on the basis of its location in the newly identified nir operon, which includes a gene coding cytochrome cd1-type nitrite reductase. Phylogenetic analysis and the well-conserved nir operon gene arrangement suggest that the origin of the three cytochromes c8 in this bacterium is NirM.

To explore its role in the different steps of IF1 binding, kinetics of inhibition of the isolated and membrane-bound enzymes were investigated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae IF1 derivatives modified in N-terminal extremity. First, we studied peptides truncated in Nter up to the amino acid immediately preceding Phe17, a well-conserved residue thought to play a key role. These deletions did not affect or even improve the access of IF1 to its target. They decreased the stability of the inhibited complex but much less than previously proposed. We also mutated IF1-Phe17 and found this amino acid not mandatory for the inhibitory effect. The most striking finding came from experiments in which PsaE, a 8\u00a0kDa globular-like protein, was attached in Nter of IF1. Unexpectedly, such a modification did not appreciably affect the rate of IF1 binding. Taken together, these data show that IF1-Nter plays no role in the recognition step but contributes to stabilize the inhibited complex. Moreover, the data obtained using chimeric PsaE-IF1 suggest that before binding IF1 presents to the enzyme with its middle part facing a catalytic interface and its Nter extremity folded in the opposite direction.",

A large number of mutant lines and genomic resources are available for Arabidopsis. All this makes Arabidopsis a useful tool for studies of photosynthetic reactions in higher plants. In this study, photosystem II (PSII) enriched membranes were successfully isolated from thylakoids of Arabidopsis plants and for the first time the electron transfer cofactors in PSII were systematically studied using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. EPR signals from both of the donor and acceptor sides of PSII, as well as from auxiliary electron donors were recorded. From the acceptor side of PSII, EPR signals from QA\u02c9 Fe2+ and Phe\u02c9 QA\u02c9 Fe2+ as well as from the free Phe\u02c9 radical were observed. The multiline EPR signals from the S0- and S2-states of CaMn4Ox-cluster in the water oxidation complex were characterized. Moreover, split EPR signals, the interaction signals from YZ and CaMn4Ox-cluster in the S0-, S1-, S2-, and the S3-state were induced by illumination of the PSII membranes at 5\u00a0K and characterized. In addition, EPR signals from auxiliary donors YD, Chl+ and cytochrome b559 were observed. In total, we were able to detect about 20 different EPR signals covering all electron transfer components in PSII. Use of this spectroscopic platform opens a possibility to study PSII reactions in the library of mutants available in Arabidopsis.",

     "abstract": "EPR was used to study the influence of formate on the electron acceptor side of photosystem II (PSII) from Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Two new EPR signals were found and characterized. The first is assigned to the semiquinone form of QB interacting magnetically with a high spin, non-heme-iron (Fe2+, S\u00a0=\u00a02) when the native bicarbonate/carbonate ligand is replaced by formate. This assignment is based on several experimental observations, the most important of which were: (i) its presence in the dark in a significant fraction of centers, and (ii) the period-of-two variations in the concentration expected for QB\u2022\u2212 when PSII underwent a series of single-electron turnovers. This signal is similar but not identical to the well-know formate-modified EPR signal observed for the QA\u2022\u2212Fe2+ complex (W.F.J. Vermaas and A.W. Rutherford, FEBS Lett. 175 (1984) 243\u2013248). The formate-modified signals from QA\u2022\u2212Fe2+ and QB\u2022\u2212Fe2+ are also similar to native semiquinone\u2013iron signals (QA\u2022\u2212Fe2+/QB\u2022\u2212Fe2+) seen in purple bacterial reaction centers where a glutamate provides the carboxylate ligand to the iron. The second new signal was formed when QA\u2022\u2212 was generated in formate-inhibited PSII when the secondary acceptor was reduced by two electrons. While the signal is reminiscent of the formate-modified semiquinone\u2013iron signals, it is broader and its main turning point has a major sub-peak at higher field. This new signal is attributed to the QA\u2022\u2212Fe2+ with formate bound but which is perturbed when QB is fully reduced, most likely as QBH2 (or possibly QBH\u2022\u2212 or QB2\u2022\u2212). Flash experiments on formate-inhibited PSII monitoring these new EPR signals indicate that the outcome of charge separation on the first two flashes is not greatly modified by formate. However on the third flash and subsequent flashes, the modified QA\u2022\u2212Fe2+QBH2 signal is trapped in the EPR experiment and there is a marked decrease in the quantum yield of formation of stable charge pairs. The main effect of formate then appears to be on QBH2 exchange and this agrees with earlier studies using different methods.",

     "abstract": "Phycobilisomes (PBS) are the major photosynthetic antenna complexes in cyanobacteria and red algae. In the red microalga Galdieria sulphuraria, action spectra measured separately for photosynthetic activities of photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) demonstrate that PBS fraction attributed to PSI is more sensitive to stress conditions and upon nitrogen starvation disappears from the cell earlier than the fraction of PBS coupled to PSII. Preillumination of the cells by actinic far-red light primarily absorbed by PSI caused an increase in the amplitude of the PBS low-temperature fluorescence emission that was accompanied by the decrease in PBS region of the PSI 77 K fluorescence excitation spectrum. Under the same conditions, fluorescence excitation spectrum of PSII remained unchanged. The amplitude of P700 photooxidation in PBS-absorbed light at physiological temperature was found to match the fluorescence changes observed at 77 K. The far-red light adaptations were reversible within 2\u20135\u00a0min. It is suggested that the short-term fluorescence alterations observed in far-red light are triggered by the redox state of P700 and correspond to the temporal detachment of the PBS antenna from the core complexes of PSI. Furthermore, the absence of any change in the 77 K fluorescence excitation cross-section of PSII suggests that light energy transfer from PBS to PSI in G. sulphuraria is direct and does not occur through PSII. Finally, a novel photoprotective role of PBS in red algae is discussed.",

PCC 6803 that is deficient in the biosynthesis of \u03b1-tocopherol. The activity of PSII in mutant cells was more sensitive to inactivation by strong light than that in wild-type cells, indicating that lack of \u03b1-tocopherol enhances the extent of photoinhibition. However, the rate of photodamage to PSII, as measured in the presence of chloramphenicol, which blocks the repair of PSII, did not differ between the two lines of cells. By contrast, the repair of PSII from photodamage was suppressed in mutant cells. Addition of \u03b1-tocopherol to cultures of mutant cells returned the extent of photoinhibition to that in wild-type cells, without any effect on photodamage. The synthesis de novo of various proteins, including the D1 protein that plays a central role in the repair of PSII, was suppressed in mutant cells under strong light. These observations suggest that \u03b1-tocopherol promotes the repair of photodamaged PSII by protecting the synthesis de novo of the proteins that are required for recovery from inhibition by singlet oxygen.",

     "abstract": "Enzymes belonging to the Sulfite Oxidase (SO) enzyme family are found in virtually all forms of life, and are especially abundant in prokaryotes as shown by analysis of available genome data. Despite this fact, only a limited number of bacterial SO family enzymes has been characterized in detail to date, and these appear to be involved in very different metabolic processes such as energy generation from sulfur compounds, host colonization, sulfite detoxification and organosulfonate degradation. The few characterized bacterial SO family enzymes also show an intriguing range of structural conformations, including monomeric, dimeric and heterodimeric enzymes with varying numbers and types of redox centres. Some of the bacterial enzymes even catalyze novel reactions such as dimethylsulfoxide reduction that previously had been thought not to be catalyzed by SO family enzymes. Classification of the SO family enzymes based on the structure of their Mo domain clearly shows that three distinct groups of enzymes belong to this family, and that almost all SOEs characterized to date are representatives of the same group.The widespread occurrence and obvious structural and functional plasticity of the bacterial SO family enzymes make this an exciting field for further study, in particular the unraveling of the metabolic roles of the three enzyme groups, some of which appear to be associated almost exclusively with pathogenic microorganisms.",

     "abstract": "Metalloradical EPR signals have been found in intact Photosystem II at cryogenic temperatures. They reflect the light-driven formation of the tyrosine Z radical (YZ) in magnetic interaction with the CaMn4 cluster in a particular S state. These so-called split EPR signals, induced at cryogenic temperatures, provide means to study the otherwise transient YZ and to probe the S states with EPR spectroscopy. In the S0 and S1 states, the respective split signals are induced by illumination of the sample in the visible light range only. In the S3 state the split EPR signal is induced irrespective of illumination wavelength within the entire 415\u2013900\u00a0nm range (visible and near-IR region) [Su, J. H., Havelius, K. G. V., Ho, F. M., Han, G., Mamedov, F., and Styring, S. (2007) Biochemistry 46, 10703\u201310712]. An important question is whether a single mechanism can explain the induction of the Split S3 signal across the entire wavelength range or whether wavelength-dependent mechanisms are required. In this paper we confirm that the YZ radical formation in the S1 state, reflected in the Split S1 signal, is driven by P680-centered charge separation. The situation in the S3 state is different. In Photosystem II centers with pre-reduced quinone A (QA), where the P680-centered charge separation is blocked, the Split S3 EPR signal could still be induced in the majority of the Photosystem II centers using both visible and NIR (830\u00a0nm) light. This shows that P680-centered charge separation is not involved. The amount of oxidized electron donors and reduced electron acceptors (QA\u2212) was well correlated after visible light illumination at cryogenic temperatures in the S1 state. This was not the case in the S3 state, where the Split S3 EPR signal was formed in the majority of the centers in a pathway other than P680-centered charge separation. Instead, we propose that one mechanism exists over the entire wavelength interval to drive the formation of the Split S3 signal. The origin for this, probably involving excitation of one of the Mn ions in the CaMn4 cluster in Photosystem II, is discussed.",

     "abstract": "This study demonstrates the effect of high temperature stress on the heterogeneous behavior of PSII in Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves. Photosystem II in green plant chloroplasts displays heterogeneity both in the composition of its light harvesting antenna i.e. on the basis of antenna size (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 centers) and in the ability to reduce the plastoquinone pool i.e. the reducing side of the reaction centers (QB-reducing centers and QB-non-reducing centers). Detached wheat leaves were subjected to high temperature stress of 35\u00a0\u00b0C, 40\u00a0\u00b0C and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) fluorescence transient were recorded in vivo with high time resolution and analyzed according to JIP test which can quantify PS II behavior using Plant efficiency analyzer (PEA). Other than PEA, Biolyzer HP-3 software was used to evaluate different types of heterogeneity in wheat leaves. The results revealed that at high temperature, there was a change in the relative amounts of PSII \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 centers. As judged from the complementary area growth curve, it seemed that with increasing temperature the PSII\u03b2 and PSII\u03b3 centers increased at the expense of PSII\u03b1 centers. The reducing side heterogeneity was also affected as shown by an increase in the number of QB-non-reducing centers at high temperatures. The reversibility of high temperature induced damage on PSII heterogeneity was also studied. Antenna size heterogeneity was recovered fully up to 40\u00a0\u00b0C while reducing side heterogeneity showed partial recovery at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. An irreversible damage to both the types of heterogeneity was observed at 45\u00a0\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "We have studied spectroscopic properties of the 16\u00a0kDa red carotenoid protein (RCP), which is closely related to the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) from cyanobacteria. Both proteins bind the same chromophore, the carotenoid 3\u2032-hydroxyechinenone (hECN), and the major difference between the two proteins is lack of the C-terminal domain in the RCP; this results in exposure of part of the carotenoid. The excited-state lifetime of hECN in the RCP is 5.5\u00a0ps, which is markedly longer than in OCP (3.3\u00a0ps) but close to 6\u00a0ps obtained for hECN in organic solvent. This confirms that the binding of hECN to the C-terminal domain in the OCP changes conformation of hECN, thereby altering its excited-state properties. Hydrogen bonds between the C-terminal domain and the carotenoid are also absent in the RCP. This allows the conformation of hECN in the RCP to be similar to that in solution, which results in comparable excited-state properties of hECN in solution. The red-shift of the RCP absorption spectrum is most likely due to aggregation of RCP induced by hydrophobic nature of hECN that, when exposed to buffer, stimulates formation of assemblies minimizing contact of hECN with water. We suggest that the loss of the C-terminal domain renders the protein amphipathic, containing both hydrophobic (the exposed part of hECN) and hydrophilic (N-terminal domain) regions, and may help the RCP to interact with lipid membranes; exposed hECN can penetrate into the hydrophobic environment of the lipid membrane, possibly to provide additional photoprotection.",

The effect of Mg2+ and Ca2+ on EGTA inhibition of purified Complex I activity indicated that Ca2+ is tightly bound to the enzyme and essential for the activity. Low sensitivity to o-phenanthroline argues against the occupation of this cation binding site by Fe2+ or Zn2+. The sensitivity of Complex I to EDTA/EGTA strongly depends on the presence of monovalent cations in the medium, and on whether the complex is native, membrane-bound, or purified. The data is discussed in terms of a possible loss either of an additional 14th, subunit of E. coli Complex I, analogous to Nqo15 in the T. thermophilus enzyme, or another component of the native membrane that affects the affinity and/or accessibility of the Ca2+ binding site.",

     "abstract": "We compared the influence of different adenine and guanine nucleotides on the free fatty acid-induced uncoupling protein (UCP) activity in non-phosphorylating Acanthamoeba castellanii mitochondria when the membranous ubiquinone (Q) redox state was varied. The purine nucleotides exhibit an inhibitory effect in the following descending order: GTP\u00a0>\u00a0ATP\u00a0>\u00a0GDP\u00a0>\u00a0ADP\u00a0\u226b\u00a0GMP\u00a0>\u00a0AMP. The efficiency of guanine and adenine nucleotides to inhibit UCP-sustained uncoupling in A. castellanii mitochondria depends on the Q redox state. Inhibition by purine nucleotides can be increased with decreasing Q reduction level (thereby ubiquinol, QH2 concentration) even with nucleoside monophosphates that are very weak inhibitors at the initial respiration. On the other hand, the inhibition can be alleviated with increasing Q reduction level (thereby QH2 concentration). The most important finding was that ubiquinol (QH2) but not oxidised Q functions as a negative regulator of UCP inhibition by purine nucleotides. For a given concentration of QH2, the linoleic acid-induced GTP-inhibited H+ leak was the same for two types of A. castellanii mitochondria that differ in the endogenous Q content. When availability of the inhibitor (GTP) or the negative inhibition modulator (QH2) was changed, a competitive influence on the UCP activity was observed. QH2 decreases the affinity of UCP for GTP and, vice versa, GTP decreases the affinity of UCP for QH2. These results describe the kinetic mechanism of regulation of UCP affinity for purine nucleotides by endogenous QH2 in the mitochondria of a unicellular eukaryote.",

The topology of V-PPase as predicted by TopPred II suggests that the catalytic site is putatively located in loop e and exposed to the cytosol. The adjacent transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) is highly conserved and believed to participate in the catalytic function and conformational stability of V-PPase. In this study, alanine-scanning mutagenesis along TM6 of the mung bean V-PPase was carried out to identify its structural and functional role. Mutants Y299A, A306S and L317A exhibited gross impairment in both PPi hydrolysis and proton translocation. Meanwhile, mutations at L307 and N318 completely abolished the targeting of the enzyme, causing broad cytosolic localization and implicating a possible role of these residues in protein translocation. The location of these amino acid residues was on the same side of the helix wheel, suggesting their involvement in maintaining the stability of enzyme conformation. G297A, E301A and A305S mutants showed declines in proton translocation but not in PPi hydrolysis, consequently resulting in decreases in the coupling efficiency. These amino acid residues cluster at one face of the helix wheel, indicating their direct/indirect participation in proton translocation. Taken together, these data indicate that TM6 is crucial to vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase, probably mediating protein targeting, proton transport, and the maintenance of enzyme structure.",

The SQR from the extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus has been isolated, identified and purified to homogeneity. It consists of four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 64, 27, 14 and 15\u00a0kDa, corresponding to SdhA (flavoprotein), SdhB (iron\u2013sulfur protein), SdhC and SdhD (membrane anchor proteins), respectively. The existence of [2Fe\u20132S], [4Fe\u20134S] and [3Fe\u20134S] iron\u2013sulfur clusters within the purified protein was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy which also revealed a previously unnoticed influence of the substrate on the signal corresponding to the [2Fe\u20132S] cluster. The enzyme contains two heme b cofactors of reduction midpoint potentials of \u221220\u00a0mV and \u2212160\u00a0mV for bH and bL, respectively. Circular dichroism and blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the enzyme forms a trimer with a predominantly helical fold. The optimum temperature for succinate dehydrogenase activity is 70\u00a0\u00b0C, which is in agreement with the optimum growth temperature of T. thermophilus. Inhibition studies confirmed sensitivity of the enzyme to the classical inhibitors of the active site, as there are sodium malonate, sodium diethyl oxaloacetate and 3-nitropropionic acid. Activity measurements in the presence of the semiquinone analog, nonyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) showed that the membrane part of the enzyme is functionally connected to the active site. Steady-state kinetic measurements showed that the enzyme displays standard Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics at a low temperature (30\u00a0\u00b0C) with a KM for succinate of 0.21\u00a0mM but exhibits deviation from it at a higher temperature (70\u00a0\u00b0C). This is the first example of complex II with such a kinetic behavior suggesting positive cooperativity with k' of 0.39\u00a0mM and Hill coefficient of 2.105. While the crystal structures of several SQORs are already available, no crystal structure of type A SQOR has been elucidated to date. Here we present for the first time a detailed biophysical and biochemical study of type A SQOR\u2014a significant step towards understanding its structure\u2013function relationship.",

     "abstract": "Cellular respiration is driven by cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), which reduces oxygen to water and couples the released energy to proton pumping across the mitochondrial or bacterial membrane. Proton pumping in CcO involves proton transfer from the negatively charged side of the membrane to a transient proton-loading or pump site (PLS), before it is ejected to the opposite side. Although many details of the reaction mechanism are known, the exact location of the PLS has remained elusive. We report here results from combined classical molecular dynamics simulations and continuum electrostatic calculations, which show that the hydrogen-bonded system around the A-propionate of heme a3 dissociates reversibly upon reduction of heme a. The dissociation increases the pKa value of the propionate to a value above ~\u00a09, making it accessible for redox-state dependent protonation. The redox state of heme a is of key importance in controlling proton leaks by polarizing the PLS both statically and dynamically. These findings suggest that the propionate region of heme a3 fulfills the criteria of the pump site in the proton translocation mechanism of CcO.",

The enzyme has three components: dI and dIII protrude from the membrane and dII spans the membrane. Hydride transfer takes place between nucleotides bound to dI and dIII. Studies on the kinetics of a lag phase at the onset of a \u201ccyclic reaction\u201d catalysed by complexes of the dI and dIII components of transhydrogenase from Rhodospirillum rubrum, and on the kinetics of fluorescence changes associated with nucleotide binding, reveal two features. Firstly, the binding of NADP+ and NADPH to dIII is extremely slow, and is probably limited by the conversion of the occluded to the open state of the complex. Secondly, dIII can also bind NAD+ and NADH. Extrapolating to the intact enzyme this binding to the \u201cwrong\u201d site could lead to slip: proton translocation without change in the nucleotide redox state, which would have important consequences for bacterial and mitochondrial metabolism.",

     "abstract": "The PufX polypeptide is an integral component of some photosynthetic bacterial reaction center-light harvesting 1 (RC\u2013LH1) core complexes. Many aspects of the structure of PufX are unresolved, including the conformation of its long membrane-spanning helix and whether C-terminal processing occurs. In the present report, NMR data recorded on the Rhodobacter sphaeroides PufX in a detergent micelle confirmed previous conclusions derived from equivalent data obtained in organic solvent, that the \u03b1-helix of PufX adopts a bent conformation that would allow the entire helix to reside in the membrane interior or at its surface. In support of this, it was found through the use of site-directed mutagenesis that increasing the size of a conserved glycine on the inside of the bend in the helix was not tolerated. Possible consequences of this bent helical structure were explored using a series of N-terminal deletions. The N-terminal sequence ADKTIFNDHLN on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane was found to be critical for the formation of dimers of the RC\u2013LH1 complex. It was further shown that the C-terminus of PufX is processed at an early stage in the development of the photosynthetic membrane. A model in which two bent PufX polypeptides stabilise a dimeric RC\u2013LH1 complex is presented, and it is proposed that the N-terminus of PufX from one half of the dimer engages in electrostatic interactions with charged residues on the cytoplasmic surface of the LH1\u03b1 and \u03b2 polypeptides on the other half of the dimer.",

     "abstract": "Sulfite dehydrogenase (SDH) from Starkeya novella is a heterodimeric enzyme comprising a Mo active site and a heme c electron relay, which mediates electron transfer from the Mo cofactor to cytochrome c following sulfite oxidation. Studies on the wild type enzyme (SDHWT) and its variants have identified key amino acids at the active site, specifically Arg-55 and His-57. We report the MoVI/V, MoV/IV and FeIII/II (heme) redox potentials of the variants SDHR55K, SDHR55M, SDHR55Q and SDHH57A in comparison with those of SDHWT. For SDHR55M, SDHR55Q and SDHH57A the heme potentials are lowered from ca. 240\u00a0mV in SDHWT to ca. 200\u00a0mV, while the heme potential in SDHR55K remains unchanged and the Mo redox potentials are not affected significantly in any of these variants. Protein film voltammetry reveals a pH dependence of the electrochemical catalytic half-wave potential (Ecat) of \u221259\u00a0mV/pH in SDHWT and SDHR55K which tracks the pH dependence of the MoVI/V redox potential. By contrast, the catalytic potentials for SDHR55M and SDHH57A are pH-independent and follow the potential of the heme cofactor. These results highlight a switch in the pathway of electron exchange as a function of applied potential that is revealed by protein film voltammetry where an actuation of rate limiting intramolecular electron transfer (IET, Mo to heme) at high potential attenuates the catalytic current relative to faster, direct electron transfer (Mo to electrode) at lower potential. The same change in electron transfer pathway is linked to an unusual peak-shaped profile of the ideally sigmoidal steady state voltammogram in SDHWT alone, which has been associated with a potential dependent change in the orientation of the enzyme on the electrode surface. All other variants show purely sigmoidal voltammetry due to their inherently slower turnover numbers which are always lower than IET rates.",

     "abstract": "The main cofactors involved in Photosystem II (PSII) oxygen evolution activity are borne by two proteins, D1 (PsbA) and D2 (PsbD). In Thermosynechococcus elongatus, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, the D1 protein is predominantly encoded by either the psbA1 or the psbA3 gene, the expression of which depends on the environmental conditions. In this work, the QB site properties in PsbA1-PSII and PsbA3-PSII were probed through the binding properties of DCMU, a urea-type herbicide, and bromoxynil, a phenolic-type herbicide. This was done by using helium temperature EPR spectroscopy and by monitoring the time-resolved changes of the redox state of QA by absorption spectroscopy in PSII purified from a His6-tagged WT strain expressing PsbA1 or from a His6-tagged strain in which both the psbA1 and psbA2 genes have been deleted and which therefore only express PsbA3. It is shown that, in both PsbA1-PSII and PsbA3-PSII, bromoxynil does not bind to PSII when QB is in its semiquinone state which indicates a much lower affinity for PSII when QA is in its semiquinone state than when it is in its oxidized state. This is consistent with the midpoint potential of QA\u2212/QA being more negative in the presence of bromoxynil than in its absence [Krieger-Liszkay and Rutherford, Biochemistry 37 (1998) 17339\u201317344]. The addition in the dark of DCMU, but not that of bromoxynil, to PSII with a secondary electron acceptor in the QB\u2212 state induces the oxidation of the non-heme iron in a fraction of PsbA3-PSII but not in PsbA1-PSII. These results are explained as follows: i) bromoxynil has a lower affinity for PSII with the non-heme iron oxidized than DCMU therefore, ii) the midpoint potential of the FeII/FeIII couple is lower with DCMU bound than with bromoxynil bound in PsbA3-PSII; and iii) the midpoint potential of the FeII/FeIII couple is higher in PsbA1-PSII than in PsbA3-PSII. The observation of DCMU-induced oxidation of the non-heme iron leads us to propose that Q2, an electron acceptor identified by Joliot and Joliot [FEBS Lett. 134 (1981) 155\u2013158], is the non-heme iron.",

     "abstract": "The ATP synthase from Escherichia coli was isolated and reconstituted into liposomes. The ATP hydrolysis by these proteoliposomes was coupled to proton pumping, and the ensuing inner volume acidification was measured by the fluorescent probe 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA). The ACMA response was calibrated by acid\u2013base transitions, and converted into internal pH values. The rates of internal acidification and of ATP hydrolysis were measured in parallel, as a function of Pi or ADP concentration. Increasing Pi monotonically inhibited the hydrolysis rate with a half-maximal effect at 510\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas it stimulated the acidification rate up to 100\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM, inhibiting it only at higher concentrations. The ADP concentration in the assay, due both to contaminant ADP in ATP and to the hydrolysis reaction, was progressively decreased by means of increasing pyruvate kinase activities. Decreasing ADP stimulated the hydrolysis rate, whereas it inhibited the internal acidification rate. The quantitative analysis showed that the relative number of translocated protons per hydrolyzed ATP, i.e. the relative coupling ratio, depended on the concentrations of Pi and ADP with apparent Kd values of 220\u00a0\u03bcM and 27\u00a0nM respectively. At the smallest ADP concentrations reached, and in the absence of Pi, the coupling ratio dropped down to 15% relative to the value observed at the highest ADP and Pi concentrations tested. In addition, the data indicate the presence of two ADP and Pi binding sites, of which only the highest affinity one is related to changes in the coupling ratio.",

In the present report we extend the study to VDAC3 deficient muscles and measure the respiratory enzyme activity in both VDAC1 and VDAC3 deficient muscles. While in the heart the absence of VDAC3 causes a decrease in the apparent affinity of in situ mitochondria for ADP, in the gastrocnemius, a mixed glycolytic/oxidative muscle, the affinity of in situ mitochondria for ADP remains unchanged. The absence of VDAC1 causes multiple defects in respiratory complex activities in both types of muscle. However, in VDAC3 deficient mice the defect is restricted to the heart and only to complex IV. These functional alterations correlate with structural aberrations of mitochondria. These results demonstrate that, unlike VDAC1, there is muscle-type specificity for VDAC3 function and therefore in vivo these two isoforms may fulfill different physiologic functions.",

FMO proteins of green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiales) have been extensively studied using a wide range of spectroscopic and theoretical approaches because of their stability, the spectral resolution of their pigments, their water-soluble nature, and the availability of high-resolution structural data. We obtained new structural and spectroscopic insights by studying the FMO protein from the recently discovered, aerobic phototrophic acidobacterium, Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum. Native C. thermophilum FMO is a trimer according to both analytical gel filtration and native-electrospray mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the mass of intact FMO trimer is consistent with the presence of 21\u201324 BChl a in each. Homology modeling of the C. thermophilum FMO was performed by using the structure of the FMO protein from Chlorobaculum tepidum as a template. C. thermophilum FMO differs from C. tepidum FMO in two distinct regions: the baseplate, CsmA-binding region and a region that is proposed to bind the reaction center subunit, PscA. C. thermophilum FMO has two fluorescence emission peaks at room temperature but only one at 77\u00a0K. Temperature-dependent fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the two room-temperature emission peaks result from two excited-state BChl a populations that have identical fluorescence lifetimes.

Yet, despite several lines of evidence corroborating the coupling of the quinone binding active sites to one another, little to no testable hypothesis has been offered to explain how such a \u201csignal\u201d might be transmitted across the presumably rigid hydrophobic domain of the enzyme.

However, this simple model fails to explain both the inhibition by antimycin of the bc1 complex and the accompanying increase in ROS production. To obtain inhibition, we show that it is necessary to block the return of the electron from the reduced haem bL to Qo. With this added hypothesis we obtain a sigmoid inhibition curve due to the fact that when only one antimycin is bound per bc1 dimer, the electron of the inhibited monomer systematically crosses the dimer interface from bL to bL to reduce a quinone or a semiquinone species in the other (free) Qi site. Because this step is not limiting, the activity is unchanged (compared to the activity of the free dimer). Interestingly, this bL\u2013bL pathway is almost exclusively taken in this half-bound antimycin dimer. In the free dimer, the natural faster pathway is bL\u2013bH on the same monomer. The addition of the assumption of half-of-the-sites reactivity to the previous hypothesis leads to a transient activation in the antimycin titration curve preceding a quasi-complete inhibition at antimycin saturation.",

The commonly accepted Q-cycle mechanism suggests that these enzymes oxidize two quinol molecules in their catalytic centers P to yield one quinol molecule in another catalytic center N. Earlier, based upon data on flash-induced redox changes of cytochromes b and c1, voltage generation, and proton transfer in membrane vesicles of Rhodobacter capsulatus, we have put forward a scheme of an \u201cactivated Q-cycle\u201d for the bc1. The scheme suggests that the bc1 dimers, being \u201cactivated\u201d by injection of electrons from the membrane ubiquinol pool via centers N, steadily contain two electrons in their cytochrome b moieties under physiological conditions, most likely, as a bound semiquinone in center N of one monomer and a reduced high-potential heme b in the other monomer. Then the oxidation of each ubiquinol molecule in centers P of an activated bc1 should result in a complete catalytic cycle leading to the formation of a ubiquinole molecule in the one of enzyme's centers N and to voltage generation. Here it is argued that a similar pre-loading by two electrons can explain the available data on flash-induced reactions in cytochrome b6f-complexes of green plants and cyanobacteria.",

     "abstract": "Until recently cytochrome bc1 complexes were the only enzymes known to be able to transfer electrons from reduced quinones to cytochrome c. However, a complex with the same activity and with a unique subunit composition was purified from the membranes of Rhodothermus marinus. This complex, named alternative complex III (ACIII) was then biochemical, spectroscopic and genetically characterized. Later it was observed that the presence of ACIII was not exclusive of R. marinus being the genes coding for ACIII widespread, at least in the Bacteria domain. In this work, a comprehensive description of the current knowledge on ACIII is presented. The relation of ACIII with members of the complex iron-sulfur molybdoenzyme family is investigated by analyzing all the available completely sequenced genomes. It is concluded that ACIII is a new complex composed by a novel combination of modules already identified in other respiratory complexes.",

In the facultative bacterium Escherichia coli both are expressed as part of the aerobic (SQR) and anaerobic (QFR) respiratory chains. SQR from E. coli is homologous to mitochondrial complex II and has proven to be an excellent model system for structure/function studies of the enzyme. Both SQR and QFR from E. coli are tetrameric membrane-bound enzymes that couple succinate/fumarate interconversion with quinone/quinol reduction/oxidation. Both enzymes are capable of binding either ubiquinone or menaquinone, however, they have adopted different quinone binding sites where catalytic reactions with quinones occur. A comparison of the structures of the quinone binding sites in SQR and QFR reveals how the enzymes have adapted in order to accommodate both benzo- and napthoquinones. A combination of structural, computational, and kinetic studies of members of the complex II family of enzymes has revealed that the catalytic quinone adopts different positions in the quinone-binding pocket. These data suggest that movement of the quinone within the quinone-binding pocket is essential for catalysis.",

     "abstract": "Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) has a central function in oxidative phosphorylation and hence for efficient ATP production in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. This huge membrane protein complex transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and couples this exergonic redox reaction to endergonic proton pumping across bioenergetic membranes. Although quinone reduction seems to be critical for energy conversion, this part of the reaction is least understood. Here we summarize and discuss experimental evidence indicating that complex I contains an extended ubiquinone binding pocket at the interface of the 49-kDa and PSST subunits. Close to iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2, the proposed immediate electron donor for ubiquinone, a highly conserved tyrosine constitutes a critical element of the quinone reduction site. A possible quinone exchange path leads from cluster N2 to the N-terminal \u03b2-sheet of the 49-kDa subunit. We discuss the possible functions of a highly conserved HRGXE motif and a redox\u2013Bohr group associated with cluster N2. Resistance patterns observed with a large number of point mutations suggest that all types of hydrophobic complex I inhibitors also act at the interface of the 49-kDa and the PSST subunit. Finally, current controversies regarding the number of ubiquinone binding sites and the position of the site of ubiquinone reduction are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The proton-pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the respiratory complex I, couples the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone with the translocation of protons across the membrane. Electron microscopy revealed the two-part structure of the complex with a peripheral arm involved in electron transfer and a membrane arm most likely involved in proton translocation. It was proposed that the quinone binding site is located at the joint of the two arms. Most likely, proton translocation in the membrane arm is enabled by the energy of the electron transfer reaction in the peripheral arm transmitted by conformational changes. For the detection of the conformational changes and the localization of the quinone binding site, we set up a combination of site-directed spin labeling and EPR spectroscopy. Cysteine residues were introduced to the surface of the Escherichia coli complex I. The spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-\u03943-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) was exclusively bound to the engineered positions. Neither the mutation nor the labeling had an effect on the NADH:decyl-ubiquinone oxidoreductase activity. The characteristic signals of the spin label were detected by EPR spectroscopy, which did not change by reducing the preparation with NADH. A decyl-ubiquinone derivative with the spin label covalently attached to the alkyl chain was synthesized in order to localize the quinone binding site. The distance between a MTSL labeled complex I variant and the bound quinone was determined by continuous-wave (cw) EPR allowing an inference on the location of the quinone binding site. The distances between the labeled quinone and other complex I variants will be determined in future experiments to receive further geometry information by triangulation.",

     "abstract": "Considerable disagreement still exists concerning the superoxide generation sites in the purified bovine heart NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I). Majority of investigators agree that superoxide is generated at the flavin site. Here we present a new hypothesis that the generation of superoxide reflects a dynamic balance between the flavosemiquinone (semiflavin or SF) and the semiquinone (SQ), like a \u201ctug-of-war\u201d through electrons. All preparations of bovine heart complex I, which have been isolated at Yoshikawa's laboratory, have one protein-bound endogenous ubiquinone per complex I (Shinzawa-Itoh et al., Biochemistry, 49 (2010) 487\u2013492). Using these preparations, we measured (i) EPR signals of the SF, the SQ and iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2 simultaneously with cryogenic EPR and (ii) superoxide production with both the room temperature spin-trapping technique and the partially acetylated cytochrome c method. Our experimental evidence was (1) without added decylubiquinone (DBQ), no catalytic oxidation of NADH occurs. The NADH addition produced mostly SF and it generated superoxide as reported by Kussmaul and Hirst (PNAS, 103 (2006) 7607\u20137612). (2) During catalytic electron transfer from NADH to DBQ, the superoxide generation site was mostly shifted to the SQ. (3) A quinone-pocket binding inhibitor (rotenone or piericidin A) inhibits the catalytic formation of the SQ, and it enhances the formation of SF and increases the overall superoxide generation. This suggests that if electron transfer was inhibited under pathological conditions, superoxide generation from the SF would be increased.",

The X-ray structure of the pig liver enzyme has been solved in the presence and absence of a bound ubiquinone. This structure reveals ETF-QO to be a monotopic membrane protein with the cofactors, FAD and a [4Fe\u20134S]+\u00a01+2 cluster, organised to suggests that it is the flavin that serves as the immediate reductant of ubiquinone. ETF-QO is very highly conserved in evolution and the recombinant enzyme from the bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has allowed the mutational analysis of a number of residues that the structure suggested are involved in modulating the reduction potential of the cofactors. These experiments, together with the spectroscopic measurement of the distances between the cofactors in solution have confirmed the intramolecular pathway of electron transfer from ETF to ubiquinone. This approach can be extended as the R. sphaeroides ETF-QO provides a template for investigating the mechanistic consequences of single amino acid substitutions of conserved residues that are associated with a mild and late onset variant of the metabolic disease multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD).",

Cbo3 is inhibited by UQ-10 at concentrations above 5\u201310\u00a0pmol/cm2, while product inhibition is absent. Cyclic voltammetry has also been used to characterise the effects of three inhibitors; cyanide, inhibiting oxygen reduction; 2-n-Heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), inhibiting the quinone oxidation and Zn(II), thought to block the proton channels required for oxygen reduction and proton pumping activity. The electrochemical behaviour of cbo3 inhibited with HQNO and Zn(II) is almost identical, suggesting that Zn(II) ions inhibit the enzyme reduction by quinol, rather than oxygen reduction. This suggests that at Zn(II) concentration below 50\u00a0\u00b5M the proton release of cbo3 is inhibited, but not the proton uptake required to reduce oxygen to water.",

The enzyme catalyzes the 2-electron oxidation of ubiquinol-8 and the 4-electron reduction of dioxygen to water. When solubilized and isolated using dodecylmaltoside, the enzyme contains one equivalent of ubiquinone-8, bound at a high affinity site (QH). The quinone bound at the QH site can form a stable semiquinone, and the amino acid residues which hydrogen bond to the semiquinone have been identified. In the current work, it is shown that the tightly bound ubiquinone-8 at the QH site is not displaced by ubiquinol-1 even during enzyme turnover. Furthermore, the presence of high affinity inhibitors, HQNO and aurachin C1\u201310, does not displace ubiquinone-8 from the QH site. The data clearly support the existence of a second binding site for ubiquinone, the QL site, which can rapidly exchange with the substrate pool. HQNO is shown to bind to a single site on the enzyme and to prevent formation of the stable ubisemiquinone, though without displacing the bound quinone. Inhibition of the steady state kinetics of the enzyme indicates that aurachin C1\u201310 may compete for binding with quinol at the QL site while, at the same time, preventing formation of the ubisemiquinone at the QH site. It is suggested that the two quinone binding sites may be adjacent to each other or partially overlap.",

Bioinformatic searches revealed that, within a putative ubiquinol-binding crevice in AOX, Gln242, Asn247, Tyr253, Ser256, His261 and Arg262 were highly conserved. To confirm that these amino-acid residues are important for ubiquinol-binding and hence activity substitution mutations were generated and characterised. Assessment of AOX activity in isolated Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondria revealed that mutation of either Gln242, Ser256, His261 and Arg262 resulted in >90% inhibition of antimycin A-insensitive respiration suggesting that hydroxyl, guanidino, imidazole groups, polar and charged residues in addition to the size of the amino-acid chain are important for ubiquinone-binding. Substitution of Asn247 with glutamine or Tyr253 with phenylalanine had little effect upon the respiratory rate indicating that these residues are not critical for AOX activity. However replacement of Tyr253 by alanine resulted in a 72% loss of activity suggesting that the benzoquinone group and not hydroxyl group is important for quinol binding.

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic membranes accommodate densely packed light-harvesting complexes which absorb light and convey excitation to the reaction center (RC). The relationship between the fluorescence yield (\u03c6) and the fraction (x) of closed RCs is informative about the probability for an excitation reaching a closed RC to be redirected to another RC. In this work, we have examined in this respect membranes from various bacteria and searched for a correlation with the arrangement of the light-harvesting complexes as known from atomic force or electron microscopies. A first part of the paper is devoted to a theoretical study analyzing the \u03c6(x) relationship in various models: monomeric or dimeric RC\u2013LH1 core complexes, with or without the peripheral LH2 complexes. We show that the simple \u201chomogeneous\u201d kinetic treatment used here agrees well with more detailed master equation calculations. We also discuss the agreement between information derived from the present technique and from singlet annihilation experiments. The experimental results show that the enhancement of the cross section of open RCs due to excitation transfer from closed units varies from 1.5 to 3 depending on species. The ratio of the core to core transfer rate (including the indirect pathway via LH2) to the rate of trapping in open units is in the range of 0.5 to 4. It is about 1 in Rhodobacter sphaeroides and does not increase significantly in mutants lacking LH2\u2014despite the more numerous contacts between the dimeric core complexes expected in this case. The connectivity in this bacterium is due in good part to the fast transfer between the two partners of the dimeric (RC\u2013LH1\u2013PufX)2 complex. The connectivity is however increased in the carotenoidless and LH2-less strain R26, which we ascribe to an anomalous LH1. A relatively high connectivity was found in Rhodospirillum photometricum, although not as high as predicted in the calculations of Fassioli et al. (2010). This illustrates a more general discrepancy between the measured efficiency of core to core excitation transfer and theoretical estimates. We argue that the limited core to core connectivity found in purple bacteria may reflect a trade-off between light-harvesting efficiency and the hindrance to quinone diffusion that would result from too tightly packed LH complexes.",

     "abstract": "BAX cooperates with truncated BID (tBID) and Ca2+ in permeabilizing the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and releasing mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins. The mechanisms of this cooperation are still unclear. Here we show that in isolated brain mitochondria, recombinant BAX readily self-integrates/oligomerizes in the OMM but produces only a minuscule release of cytochrome c, indicating that BAX insertion/oligomerization in the OMM does not always lead to massive OMM permeabilization. Ca2+ in a mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT)-dependent and recombinant tBID in an mPT-independent manner promoted BAX insertion/ oligomerization in the OMM and augmented cytochrome c release. Neither tBID nor Ca2+ induced BAX oligomerization in the solution without mitochondria, suggesting that BAX oligomerization required interaction with the organelles and followed rather than preceded BAX insertion in the OMM. Recombinant Bcl-xL failed to prevent BAX insertion/oligomerization in the OMM but strongly attenuated cytochrome c release. On the other hand, a reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT), inhibited BAX insertion/oligomerization augmented by tBID or Ca2+ and suppressed the BAX-mediated release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO but failed to inhibit Ca2+-induced swelling. Altogether, these data suggest that in brain mitochondria, BAX insertion/oligomerization can be dissociated from OMM permeabilization and that tBID and Ca2+ stimulate BAX insertion/oligomerization and BAX-mediated OMM permeabilization by different mechanisms involving mPT induction and modulation of the SH-redox state.",

     "abstract": "In purple photosynthetic bacteria the initial steps of light energy transduction take place in an RC\u2013LH1 complex formed by the photochemical reaction centre (RC) and the LH1 light harvesting pigment-protein. In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the RC\u2013LH1 complex assembles in a dimeric form in which two RCs are surrounded by an S-shaped LH1 antenna. There is currently debate over the detailed architecture of this dimeric RC\u2013LH1 complex, with particular emphasis on the location and precise function of a minor polypeptide component termed PufX. It has been hypothesised that the membrane-spanning helical region of PufX contains a GxxxG dimerisation motif that facilitates the formation of a dimer of PufX at the interface of the RC\u2013LH1 dimer, and more specifically that the formation of this PufX dimer seeds assembly of the remaining RC\u2013LH1 dimer (J. Busselez et al., 2007). In the present work this hypothesis was tested by site directed mutagenesis of the glycine residues proposed to form the GxxxG motif. Mutation of these glycines to leucine did not decrease the propensity of the RC\u2013LH1 complex to assemble in a dimeric form, as would be expected from experimental studies of the effect of mutation on GxxxG motifs in other membrane proteins. Indeed increased yields of dimer were seen in two of the glycine-to-leucine mutants constructed. It is concluded that the PufX from Rhodobacter sphaeroides does not contain a genuine GxxxG helix dimerisation motif.",

     "publication date": "11-2010",
     "abstract": "In addition to its bioenergetic function of building up proton motive force, cytochrome bc1 can be a source of superoxide. One-electron reduction of oxygen is believed to occur from semiquinone (SQo) formed at the quinone oxidation/reduction Qo site (Qo) as a result of single-electron oxidation of quinol by the iron\u2013sulfur cluster (FeS) (semiforward mechanism) or single-electron reduction of quinone by heme bL (semireverse mechanism). It is hotly debated which mechanism plays a major role in the overall production of superoxide as experimental data supporting either reaction exist. To evaluate a contribution of each of the mechanisms we first measured superoxide production under a broad range of conditions using the mutants of cytochrome bc1 that severely impeded the oxidation of FeS by cytochrome c1, changed density of FeS around Qo by interfering with its movement, or combined these two effects together. We then compared the amount of generated superoxide with mathematical models describing either semiforward or semireverse mechanism framed within a scheme assuming competition between the internal reactions at Qo and the leakage of electrons on oxygen. We found that only the model of semireverse mechanism correctly reproduced the experimentally measured decrease in ROS for the FeS motion mutants and increase in ROS for the mutants with oxidation of FeS impaired. This strongly suggests that this mechanism dominates in setting steady-state levels of SQo that present a risk of generation of superoxide by cytochrome bc1. Isolation of this reaction sequence from multiplicity of possible reactions at Qo helps to better understand conditions under which complex III might contribute to ROS generation in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Non-heme iron is a conservative component of type II photosynthetic reaction centers of unknown function. We found that in the reaction center from Rba. sphaeroides it exists in two forms, high and low spin ferrous states, whereas in Rsp. rubrum mostly in a low spin state, in line with our earlier finding of its low spin state in the algal photosystem II reaction center (Burda et al., 2003). The temperature dependence of the non-heme iron displacement studied by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy shows that the surrounding of the high spin iron is more flexible (Debye temperature ~\u00a0165\u00a0K) than that of the low spin atom (~\u00a0207\u00a0K). Nuclear inelastic scattering measurements of the collective motions in the Rba. sphaeroides reaction center show that the density of vibrational states, originating from non-heme iron, has well-separated modes between lower (4\u201317\u00a0meV) and higher (17\u201325\u00a0meV) energies while in the one from Rsp. rubrum its distribution is more uniform with only little contribution of low energy (~\u00a06\u00a0meV) vibrations. It is the first experimental evidence that the fluctuations of the protein matrix in type II reaction center are correlated to the spin state of non-heme iron. We propose a simple mechanism in which the spin state of non-heme iron directly determines the strength of coupling between the two quinone acceptors (QA and QB) and fast collective motions of protein matrix that play a crucial role in activation and regulation of the electron and proton transfer between these two quinones. We suggest that hydrogen bond network on the acceptor side of reaction center is responsible for stabilization of non-heme iron in different spin states.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential anti-apoptotic function of Grx2 by examining its ability to protect complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport system using human lens epithelial cells as a model. We found that cells treated with 200\u00a0\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for 24\u00a0h exhibited decreased viability and became apoptotic with corresponding Bax up-regulation, Bcl-2 down-regulation, caspase 3 activation and mitochondrial cytochrome c leakage. Grx2 over-expression (OE) could protect cells against H2O2-induced damage while Grx2 knockdown (KD) showed the opposite effect. Under the same conditions, H2O2 treatment caused 50% inactivation of complex I activity in control cells (vector only), 75% in Grx2 KD cells but only 20% in Grx2 OE cells. Furthermore, the inactivated complex I in the H2O2-treated cells could be protected mostly by importing the purified nascent Grx2 protein, but not the Grx2 protein mutated at the active site with C70S, or C73S, or with C70S plus C73S. Immunoprecipitation study also revealed that Grx2 co-precipitated with complex I, but not complex II, in the mitochondrial lysate. Thus, the mechanism of Grx2 protection against H2O2-induced apoptosis is likely associated with its ability to preserve complex I.",

To clarify this we isolated mitochondria from skeletal muscle and heart of wild-type and Ucp3 knockout (Ucp3KO) mice. To increase UCP3 expression, some mice were i.p. injected with LPS (12\u00a0mg/kg body weight). In spite of the increased UCP3 expression levels, basal proton conductance did not change. HNE increased the proton conductance of skeletal muscle and heart mitochondria. In skeletal muscle, this increase was lower in Ucp3KO mice and higher in LPS-treated wild-type mice, and was partially abolished by GDP (UCPs inhibitor) and completely abolished by carboxyatractylate (ANT inhibitor) or addition of both inhibitors. GDP had no effect on HNE-induced conductance in heart mitochondria, but carboxyatractylate or administration of both inhibitors had a partial effect. GDP-mediated inhibition of HNE-activated proton conductance in skeletal muscle mitochondria was not observed in Ucp3KO mice, indicating that GDP is specific for UCP3, at least in muscle. Carboxyatractylate was able to inhibit UCP3, probably through an indirect mechanism. Our results are consistent with the conclusion that, in skeletal muscle, HNE-induced increase in proton conductance is mediated by UCP3 (30%) and ANT, whereas in the heart the increase is mediated by ANT and other carriers, possibly including UCP3.",

The rate of Ca2+ release from mitochondria increased linearly with mitochondrial [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]M). Na+-dependent Ca2+ release was predominant al low [Ca2+]M but saturated at [Ca2+]M around 400\u00a0\u03bcM, while Na+-independent Ca2+ release was very slow at [Ca2+]M below 200\u00a0\u03bcM, and then increased at higher [Ca2+]M, perhaps through the opening of a new pathway. Half-maximal activation of Na+-dependent Ca2+ release occurred at 5\u201310\u00a0mM [Na+], within the physiological range of cytosolic [Na+]. Ca2+ entry rates were comparable in size to Ca2+ exit rates at cytosolic [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]c) below 7\u00a0\u03bcM, but the rate of uptake was dramatically accelerated at higher [Ca2+]c. As a consequence, the presence of [Na+] considerably reduced the rate of [Ca2+]M increase at [Ca2+]c below 7\u00a0\u03bcM, but its effect was hardly appreciable at 10\u00a0\u03bcM [Ca2+]c. Exit rates were more dependent on the temperature than uptake rates, thus making the [Ca2+]M transients to be much more prolonged at lower temperature. Our kinetic data suggest that mitochondria have little high affinity Ca2+ buffering, and comparison of our results with data on total mitochondrial Ca2+ fluxes indicate that the mitochondrial Ca2+ bound/Ca2+ free ratio is around 10- to 100-fold for most of the observed [Ca2+]M range and suggest that massive phosphate precipitation can only occur when [Ca2+]M reaches the millimolar range.",

Pea chloroplasts contain large distinctly separated appressed domains while less distinguished appressed regions are present in bean chloroplasts. Different magnesium ion treatments were used to study thylakoid membrane stacking and arrangement. In pea chloroplasts, as demonstrated by 3D modelling, the increase of magnesium ion concentration changed the degree of membrane appression from wrinkled continuous surface to many distinguished stacked areas and significant increase of the inter-grana area. On the other hand 3D models of bean chloroplasts exhibited similar but less pronounced tendencies towards formation of appressed regions. Additionally, we studied arrangements of thylakoid membranes and chlorophyll\u2013protein complexes by various spectroscopic methods, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) among others.

In intact cardiomyocytes, we followed the dynamics of electron fluxes along specific sites of the electron transport chain (ETC) by simultaneous detection of NAD(P)H and flavoprotein (FP) fluorescence intensities using a laser-scanning confocal microscope. This method was used to delineate the effects of isoflurane, a volatile anesthetic and cardioprotective agent, on the ETC. Comparison to the effects of well-characterized ETC inhibitors and uncoupling agent revealed two distinct effects of isoflurane: uncoupling-induced mitochondrial depolarization and inhibition of ETC at the level of complex I. In correlation, oxygen consumption measurements in cardiomyocytes confirmed a dose-dependent, dual effect of isoflurane, and in isolated mitochondria an obstruction of the ETC primarily at the level of complex I. These effects are likely responsible for the reported mild stimulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production required for the cardioprotective effects of isoflurane. In conclusion, isoflurane exhibits complex effects on the ETC in intact cardiomyocytes, altering its electron fluxes, and thereby enhancing ROS production. The NAD(P)H-FP fluorometry is a useful method for exploring the effect of drugs on mitochondria and identifying their specific sites of action within the ETC of intact cardiomyocytes.",

Employing laser flash-quench triggering methods, we have shown that 20\u00a0\u00c5, coupling-limited Fe(II) to Ru(III) and Cu(I) to Ru(III) electron tunneling in Ru-modified cytochromes and blue copper proteins can occur on the microsecond timescale both in solutions and crystals; and, further, that analysis of these rates suggests that distant donor\u2013acceptor electronic couplings are mediated by a combination of sigma and hydrogen bonds in folded polypeptide structures. Redox equivalents can be transferred even longer distances by multistep tunneling, often called hopping, through intervening amino acid side chains. In recent work, we have found that 20\u00a0\u00c5 hole hopping through an intervening tryptophan is several hundred-fold faster than single-step electron tunneling in a Re-modified blue copper protein.",

These compounds are composed of a hydrophilic head group and an apolar isoprenoid side chain, giving the molecules a lipid-soluble character. Isoprenoid quinones function mainly as electron and proton carriers in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chains and these compounds show also additional functions, such as antioxidant function. Most of naturally occurring isoprenoid quinones belong to naphthoquinones or evolutionary younger benzoquinones. Among benzoquinones, the most widespread and important are ubiquinones and plastoquinones. Menaquinones, belonging to naphthoquinones, function in respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chains of bacteria. Phylloquinone K1, a phytyl naphthoquinone, functions in the photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I. Ubiquinones participate in respiratory chains of eukaryotic mitochondria and some bacteria. Plastoquinones are components of photosynthetic electron transport chains of cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts.

The annihilation-free femtosecond absorption data can be described by surprisingly simple sequential kinetic models, in which the excitation energy transfer between blue and red states in both antenna complexes is dominated by sub-picosecond processes and is completed in less than 2\u00a0ps. The slowest energy transfer steps with lifetimes in the range of 1\u20132\u00a0ps are assigned to transfer steps between the chlorophyll layers located on the stromal and lumenal sides. We conclude that these ultrafast intra-antenna energy transfer steps do not represent a bottleneck in the rate of the primary processes in intact photosystem II.

     "abstract": "High-field electron paramagnetic resonance (HF EPR) has been employed to investigate the primary electron donor electronic structure of Blastochloris viridis heterodimer mutant reaction centers (RCs). In these mutants the amino acid substitution His(M200)Leu or His(L173)Leu eliminates a ligand to the primary electron donor, resulting in the loss of a magnesium in one of the constituent bacteriochlorophylls (BChl). Thus, the native BChl/BChl homodimer primary donor is converted into a BChl/bacteriopheophytin (BPhe) heterodimer. The heterodimer primary donor radical in chemically oxidized RCs exhibits a broadened EPR line indicating a highly asymmetric distribution of the unpaired electron over both dimer constituents. Observed triplet state EPR signals confirm localization of the excitation on the BChl half of the heterodimer primary donor. Theoretical simulation of the triplet EPR lineshapes clearly shows that, in the case of mutants, triplet states are formed by an intersystem crossing mechanism in contrast to the radical pair mechanism in wild type RCs. Photooxidation of the mutant RCs results in formation of a BPhe anion radical within the heterodimer pair. The accumulation of an intradimer BPhe anion is caused by the substantial loss of interaction between constituents of the heterodimer primary donor along with an increase in the reduction potential of the heterodimer primary donor D/D+ couple. This allows oxidation of the cytochrome even at cryogenic temperatures and reduction of each constituent of the heterodimer primary donor individually. Despite a low yield of primary donor radicals, the enhancement of the semiquinone\u2013iron pair EPR signals in these mutants indicates the presence of kinetically viable electron donors.",

Using fluorescence-based intracellular oxygen sensing technique, we demonstrate that depletion of extracellular Ca2+ from 1.8 to \u2264\u00a00.6\u00a0mM by chelation with EGTA induces a marked spike in O2 consumption in differentiated PC12 cells. This respiratory response is associated with the reduction in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+, minor depolarization on the mitochondrial membrane, moderate depolarization of plasma membrane, and no changes in NAD(P)H and ATP. The response is linked to the influx of extracellular Na+ and the subsequent activation of mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ and Na+/H+ exchange. The mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX) activated by Na+ influx reduces Ca2+ and increases Na+ levels in the mitochondrial matrix. The excess of Na+ activates the mitochondrial Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) increasing the outward pumping of protons, electron transport and O2 consumption. Reduction in extracellular Na+ and inhibition of Na+ influx through the receptor operated calcium channels and plasmalemmal NHE reduce the respiratory response. Inhibition of the mNCX, L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels or the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum also reduces the respiratory spike, indicating that unimpaired intercompartmental Ca2+ exchange is critical for response development.",

Spectral properties of both CTCs, as well as the corresponding interconversion HT rates, are here reported for several Anabaena FNR site-directed mutants. The need for an adequate initial interaction between the 2\u2032P-AMP portion of NADP+/H and FNR that provides subsequent conformational changes leading to CTC formation is further confirmed. Stronger interactions between the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings might relate with faster HT processes, but exceptions are found upon distortion of the active centre. Thus, within the analyzed FNR variants, there is no strict correlation between the stability of the transient CTCs formation and the rate of the subsequent HT. Kinetic isotope effects suggest that, while in the WT, vibrational enhanced modulation of the active site contributes to the tunnel probability of HT; complexes of some of the active site mutants with the coenzyme hardly allow the relative movement of isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings along the HT reaction. The architecture of the WT FNR active site precisely contributes to reduce the stacking probability between the isoalloxazine and nicotinamide rings in the catalytically competent complex, modulating the angle and distance between the N5 of the FAD isoalloxazine and the C4 of the coenzyme nicotinamide to values that ensure efficient HT processes.",

Importantly, two different Chl-c2s are identified in both FCPatrim and FCPbolig from their signature ring-breathing modes at \u223c\u00a01360\u00a0cm\u22121. In addition, the C131-keto carbonyl peaks indicate the presence of more than four Chl-a's in both FCP complexes and are broadly classified into three groups with strong, medium and weak external hydrogen bonds. Together, they provide the strongest spectroscopic evidence so far that there may be up to double the number of pigments previously estimated at 4Fx:4Chl-a:1Chl-c2 per FCP monomer. Careful analysis of the protein sequences also strongly support the higher pigment content by showing that at least six Chl-a, and one Chl-b, binding sites found in LHCII are retained in the FCPs. The relative enhancement of the RR bands for 406.7 versus 413.1 nm further allows some distinction of blue- versus red-absorbing Chl-a\u2019s, respectively. Further differences between the Chls in FCPbolig and FCPatrim are present in the amino-acid sequences and the RR signals. Information about the Chl-binding sites, complemented by information about the structures and interactions of the Chls are used to characterize their local environments, and assign pigment locations (and functions) in FCPbolig and FCPatrim, which along with the earlier characterization of the carotenoids (J.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome bd is a terminal quinol:O2 oxidoreductase of respiratory chains of many bacteria. It contains three hemes, b558, b595, and d. The role of heme b595 remains obscure. A CO photolysis/recombination study of the membranes of Escherichia coli containing either wild type cytochrome bd or inactive E445A mutant was performed using nanosecond absorption spectroscopy. We compared photoinduced changes of heme d\u2013CO complex in one-electron-reduced, two-electron-reduced, and fully reduced states of cytochromes bd. The line shape of spectra of photodissociation of one-electron-reduced and two-electron-reduced enzymes is strikingly different from that of the fully reduced enzyme. The difference demonstrates that in the fully reduced enzyme photolysis of CO from heme d perturbs ferrous heme b595 causing loss of an absorption band centered at 435\u00a0nm, thus supporting interactions between heme b595 and heme d in the di-heme oxygen-reducing site, in agreement with previous works. Photolyzed CO recombines with the fully reduced enzyme monoexponentially with \u03c4\u00a0\u223c\u00a012\u00a0\u03bcs, whereas recombination of CO with one-electron-reduced cytochrome bd shows three kinetic phases, with \u03c4\u00a0\u223c\u00a014\u00a0ns, 14\u00a0\u03bcs, and 280\u00a0\u03bcs. The spectra of the absorption changes associated with these components are different in line shape. The 14\u00a0ns phase, absent in the fully reduced enzyme, reflects geminate recombination of CO with part of heme d. The 14-\u03bcs component reflects bimolecular recombination of CO with heme d and electron backflow from heme d to hemes b in \u223c\u00a04% of the enzyme population. The final, 280-\u03bcs component, reflects return of the electron from hemes b to heme d and bimolecular recombination of CO in that population. The fact that even in the two-electron-reduced enzyme, a nanosecond geminate recombination is observed, suggests that namely the redox state of heme b595, and not that of heme b558, controls the pathway(s) by which CO migrates between heme d and the medium.",

The intrinsic potentials could be determined with an uncertainty of less than \u00b1\u00a010\u00a0mV at a 95% confidence level for best fit assignments.

Only by using the ATP-regenerating system phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase full ATP-inhibition of CcO could be demonstrated by kinetic measurements. The mechanism was proposed to keep the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u2206\u03a8m) in living cells and tissues at low values (100\u2013140\u00a0mV), when the matrix ATP/ADP ratios are high. In contrast, high \u2206\u03a8m values (180\u2013220\u00a0mV) are generally measured in isolated mitochondria. By using a tetraphenyl phosphonium electrode we observed in isolated rat liver mitochondria with glutamate plus malate as substrates a reversible decrease of \u2206\u03a8m from 233 to 123\u00a0mV after addition of phosphoenolpyruvate and pyruvate kinase. The decrease of \u2206\u03a8m is explained by reversal of the gluconeogenetic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase yielding ATP and GTP, thus increasing the matrix ATP/ADP ratio. With rat heart mitochondria, which lack these enzymes, no decrease of \u2206\u03a8m was found. From the data we conclude that high matrix ATP/ADP ratios keep \u2206\u03a8m at low values by the allosteric ATP-inhibition of CcO, thus preventing the generation of reactive oxygen species which could generate degenerative diseases. It is proposed that respiration in living eukaryotic organisms is normally controlled by the \u2206\u03a8m-independent \u201callosteric ATP-inhibition of CcO.\u201d Only when the allosteric ATP-inhibition is switched off under stress, respiration is regulated by \u201crespiratory control,\u201d based on \u2206\u03a8m according to the Mitchell Theory.",

They are composed of a membrane extrinsic (F1 or V1) and a membrane intrinsic (Fo or Vo) sector, and couple catalysis of ATP synthesis or hydrolysis to proton transport by a rotational mechanism. The mechanism of rotation has been extensively studied by kinetic, thermodynamic and physiological approaches. Techniques for observing subunit rotation have been developed. Observations of micron-length actin filaments, or polystyrene or gold beads attached to rotor subunits have been highly informative of the rotational behavior of ATP hydrolysis-driven rotation. Single molecule FRET experiments between fluorescent probes attached to rotor and stator subunits have been used effectively in monitoring proton motive force-driven rotation in the ATP synthesis reaction. By using small gold beads with diameters of 40\u201360\u00a0nm, the E. coli F1 sector was found to rotate at surprisingly high speeds (>\u00a0400\u00a0rps).

One model considers mitochondria as an organised network of oscillators and indicates that communication between mitochondria involves mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production acting as synchronisers of the energy status of the whole population of mitochondria. An alternative model proposes that extramitochondrial pH variations could lead to mitochondrial oscillations. Oscillatory phenomena in energy metabolism have also been investigated in vivo on the basis of 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measurements of phosphocreatine post-exercise recovery in human and animal skeletal muscle. The corresponding results provide experimental evidences about the role exerted by cytosolic pH on oscillations. Finally a new simple non-linear mathematical model describing the overall chemical reaction of phosphocreatine recovery predicting oscillatory recovery pattern under certain experimental conditions is presented and discussed in the light of the experimental results reported so far.",

     "abstract": "This review focuses on the ATP synthases of alkaliphilic bacteria and, in particular, those that successfully overcome the bioenergetic challenges of achieving robust H+-coupled ATP synthesis at external pH values >\u00a010. At such pH values the protonmotive force, which is posited to provide the energetic driving force for ATP synthesis, is too low to account for the ATP synthesis observed. The protonmotive force is lowered at a very high pH by the need to maintain a cytoplasmic pH well below the pH outside, which results in an energetically adverse pH gradient. Several anticipated solutions to this bioenergetic conundrum have been ruled out. Although the transmembrane sodium motive force is high under alkaline conditions, respiratory alkaliphilic bacteria do not use Na+- instead of H+-coupled ATP synthases. Nor do they offset the adverse pH gradient with a compensatory increase in the transmembrane electrical potential component of the protonmotive force. Moreover, studies of ATP synthase rotors indicate that alkaliphiles cannot fully resolve the energetic problem by using an ATP synthase with a large number of c-subunits in the synthase rotor ring. Increased attention now focuses on delocalized gradients near the membrane surface and H+ transfers to ATP synthases via membrane-associated microcircuits between the H+ pumping complexes and synthases. Microcircuits likely depend upon proximity of pumps and synthases, specific membrane properties and specific adaptations of the participating enzyme complexes. ATP synthesis in alkaliphiles depends upon alkaliphile-specific adaptations of the ATP synthase and there is also evidence for alkaliphile-specific adaptations of respiratory chain components.",

     "abstract": "Calorie restriction (CR), without malnutrition, consistently increases lifespan in all species tested, and reduces age-associated pathologies in mammals. Alterations in mitochondrial content and function are thought to underlie some of the effects of CR. Previously, we reported that rats subjected to variable durations of 40% CR demonstrated a rapid and sustained decrease in maximal leak-dependent respiration in skeletal muscle mitochondria. This was accompanied by decreased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and increased uncoupling protein-3 protein (UCP3) expression. The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of UCP3, as well as the adenine nucleotide translocase to these functional changes in skeletal muscle mitochondria. Consistent with previous findings in rats, short-term CR (2\u00a0weeks) in wild-type (Wt) mice resulted in a lowering of the maximal leak-dependent respiration in skeletal muscle mitochondria, without any change in proton conductance. In contrast, skeletal muscle mitochondria from Ucp3-knockout (KO) mice similarly subjected to short-term CR showed no change in maximal leak-dependent respiration, but displayed an increased proton conductance. Determination of ANT activity (by measurement of inhibitor-sensitive leak) and protein expression revealed that the increased proton conductance in mitochondria from CR Ucp3-KO mice could be entirely attributed to a greater acute activation of ANT. These observations implicate UCP3 in CR-induced mitochondrial remodeling. Specifically, they imply the potential for an interaction, or some degree of functional redundancy, between UCP3 and ANT, and also suggest that UCP3 can minimize the induction of the ANT-mediated \u2018energy-wasting\u2019 process during CR.",

     "abstract": "We have previously shown that the V-ATPase a2-subunit isoform interacts specifically, and in an intra-endosomal acidification-dependent manner, with the Arf-GEF ARNO. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanism of this interaction using synthetic peptides and purified recombinant proteins in protein-association assays. In these experiments, we revealed the involvement of multiple sites on the N-terminus of the V-ATPase a2-subunit (a2N) in the association with ARNO. While six a2N-derived peptides interact with wild-type ARNO, only two of them (named a2N-01 and a2N-03) bind to its catalytic Sec7-domain. However, of these, only the a2N-01 peptide (MGSLFRSESMCLAQLFL) showed specificity towards the Sec7-domain compared to other domains of the ARNO protein. Surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis revealed a very strong binding affinity between this a2N-01 peptide and the Sec7-domain of ARNO, with dissociation constant KD\u00a0=\u00a03.44\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M, similar to the KD\u00a0=\u00a03.13\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M binding affinity between wild-type a2N and the full-length ARNO protein. In further pull-down experiments, we also revealed the involvement of multiple sites on ARNO itself in the association with a2N. However, while its catalytic Sec7-domain has the strongest interaction, the PH-, and PB-domains show much weaker binding to a2N. Interestingly, an interaction of the a2N to a peptide corresponding to ARNO's PB-domain was abolished by phosphorylation of ARNO residue Ser392. The 3D-structures of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides were resolved by NMR spectroscopy, and we have identified rearrangements resulting from Ser392 phosphorylation. Homology modeling suggests that these alterations may modulate the access of the a2N to its interaction pocket on ARNO that is formed by the Sec7 and PB-domains. Overall, our data indicate that the interaction between the a2-subunit of V-ATPase and ARNO is a complex process involving various binding sites on both proteins. Importantly, the binding affinity between the a2-subunit and ARNO is in the same range as those previously reported for the intramolecular association of subunits within V-ATPase complex itself, indicating an important cell biological role for the interaction between the V-ATPase and small GTPase regulatory proteins.",

     "abstract": "The ultrafast (<\u00a0100\u00a0fs) conversion of delocalized exciton into charge-separated state between the primary donor P700 (bleaching at 705\u00a0nm) and the primary acceptor A0 (bleaching at 690\u00a0nm) in photosystem I (PS I) complexes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was observed. The data were obtained by application of pump\u2013probe technique with 20-fs low-energy pump pulses centered at 720\u00a0nm. The earliest absorbance changes (close to zero delay) with a bleaching at 690\u00a0nm are similar to the product of the absorption spectrum of PS I complex and the laser pulse spectrum, which represents the efficiency spectrum of the light absorption by PS I upon femtosecond excitation centered at 720\u00a0nm. During the first \u223c\u00a060\u00a0fs the energy transfer from the chlorophyll (Chl) species bleaching at 690\u00a0nm to the Chl bleaching at 705\u00a0nm occurs, resulting in almost equal bleaching of the two forms with the formation of delocalized exciton between 690-nm and 705-nm Chls. Within the next \u223c\u00a040\u00a0fs the formation of a new broad band centered at \u223c\u00a0660\u00a0nm (attributed to the appearance of Chl anion radical) is observed. This band decays with time constant simultaneously with an electron transfer to A1 (phylloquinone). The subtraction of kinetic difference absorption spectra of the closed (state P700+A0A1) PS I reaction center (RC) from that of the open (state P700A0A1) RC reveals the pure spectrum of the P700+A0\u2212 ion\u2013radical pair. The experimental data were analyzed using a simple kinetic scheme: An* \u2192 k 1 [(PA0)*A1 \u2192 < 100 fs P+A0\u2212A1] \u2192 k 2 P+A0A1\u2212, and a global fitting procedure based on the singular value decomposition analysis. The calculated kinetics of transitions between intermediate states and their spectra were similar to the kinetics recorded at 694 and 705\u00a0nm and the experimental spectra obtained by subtraction of the spectra of closed RCs from the spectra of open RCs. As a result, we found that the main events in RCs of PS I under our experimental conditions include very fast (<\u00a0100\u00a0fs) charge separation with the formation of the P700+A0\u2212A1 state in approximately one half of the RCs, the \u223c\u00a05-ps energy transfer from antenna Chl* to P700A0A1 in the remaining RCs, and \u223c\u00a025-ps formation of the secondary radical pair P700+A0A1\u2212.",

We have investigated this issue by studying the effects of Cl\u2212 replacement by Br\u2212 in active PSII. In Br\u2212 substituted samples, Cl\u2212 is effectively replaced by Br\u2212 in the presence of 1.2\u00a0M NaBr under room light with protection of anaerobic atmosphere followed by dialysis. The following results have been obtained. i) The oxygen-evolving activities of the Br\u2212-PSII samples are significantly lower than that of the Cl\u2212-PSII samples; ii) The same S2 multiline EPR signals are observed in both Br\u2212 and Cl\u2212-PSII samples; iii) The amplitudes of the visible light induced S1TyrZ\u2022 and S2TyrZ\u2022 EPR signals are significantly decreased after Br\u2212 substitution; the S1TyrZ\u2022 EPR signal is up-shifted about 8\u00a0G, whereas the S2TyrZ\u2022 signal is down-shifted about 12\u00a0G after Br\u2212 substitution. These results imply that the redox properties of TyrZ and spin interactions between TyrZ\u2022 and Mn-cluster could be significantly modified due to Br\u2212 substitution.

The amount of Lhcx6 protein was low under low light, but increased continuously during 10\u00a0h of HL exposure, then slowly dropped to background levels in the dark.

PCC 6803 that had a lower than wild-type level of enoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase FabI, a key component of the type-II fatty acid synthase system. The mutant exhibited marked impairment in the tolerance and acclimation of cells to high temperature: photoautotrophic growth of the mutant was severely inhibited at 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Moreover, mutant cells were unable to achieve wild-type enhancement of the thermal stability of photosystem II (PSII) when the growth temperature was raised from 25\u00a0\u00b0C to 38\u00a0\u00b0C. Enhancement of the thermal stability of PSII was abolished when wild-type cells were treated with triclosan, a specific inhibitor of FabI, and the enhancement of thermal stability was also blocked in darkness and in the presence of chloramphenicol. Analysis of fatty acids in thylakoid membranes revealed that levels of unsaturated fatty acids did not differ between mutant and wild-type cells, indicating that the saturation of fatty acids in membrane lipids might not be responsible for the enhancement of thermal stability at elevated temperatures. Our observations suggest that the synthesis de novo of fatty acids, as well as proteins, is required for the enhancement of the thermal stability of PSII during the acclimation of Synechocystis cells to high temperature.",

     "abstract": "The main cofactors involved in the function of Photosystem II (PSII) are borne by the D1 and D2 proteins. In some cyanobacteria, the D1 protein is encoded by different psbA genes. In Thermosynechococcus elongatus the amino acid sequence deduced from the psbA3 gene compared to that deduced from the psbA1 gene points a difference of 21 residues. In this work, PSII isolated from a wild type T. elongatus strain expressing PsbA1 or from a strain in which both the psbA1 and psbA2 genes have been deleted were studied by a range of spectroscopies in the absence or the presence of either a urea type herbicide, DCMU, or a phenolic type herbicide, bromoxynil. Spectro-electrochemical measurements show that the redox potential of PheoD1 is increased by 17\u00a0mV from \u2212522\u00a0mV in PsbA1-PSII to \u2212505\u00a0mV in PsbA3-PSII. This increase is about half that found upon the D1-Q130E single site directed mutagenesis in Synechocystis PCC 6803. This suggests that the effects of the D1-Q130E substitution are, at least partly, compensated for by some of the additional amino-acid changes associated with the PsbA3 for PsbA1 substitution. The thermoluminescence from the S2QA\u2212\u2022 charge recombination and the C\u00a0\u2261\u00a0N vibrational modes of bromoxynil detected in the non-heme iron FTIR difference spectra support two binding sites (or one site with two conformations) for bromoxynil in PsbA3-PSII instead of one in PsbA1-PSII which suggests differences in the QB pocket. The temperature dependences of the S2QA\u2212\u2022 charge recombination show that the strength of the H-bond to PheoD1 is not the only functionally relevant difference between the PsbA3-PSII and PsbA1-PSII and that the environment of QA (and, as a consequence, its redox potential) is modified as well. The electron transfer rate between P680+\u2022 and YZ is found faster in PsbA3 than in PsbA1 which suggests that the redox potential of the P680/P680+\u2022 couple (and hence that of 1P680*/P680+\u2022) is tuned as well when shifting from PsbA1 to PsbA3. In addition to D1-Q130E, the non-conservative amongst the 21 amino acid substitutions, D1-S270A and D1-S153A, are proposed to be involved in some of the observed changes.",

     "abstract": "Sulfide (H2S) is an inhibitor of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase comparable to cyanide. In this study, poisoning of cells was observed with sulfide concentrations above 20\u00a0\u00b5M. Sulfide oxidation has been shown to take place in organisms/cells naturally exposed to sulfide. Sulfide is released as a result of metabolism of sulfur containing amino acids. Although in mammals sulfide exposure is not thought to be quantitatively important outside the colonic mucosa, our study shows that a majority of mammalian cells, by means of the mitochondrial sulfide quinone reductase (SQR), avidly consume sulfide as a fuel. The SQR activity was found in mitochondria isolated from mouse kidneys, liver, and heart. We demonstrate the precedence of the SQR over the mitochondrial complex I. This explains why the oxidation of the mineral substrate sulfide takes precedence over the oxidation of other (carbon-based) mitochondrial substrates. Consequently, if sulfide delivery rate remains lower than the SQR activity, cells maintain a non-toxic sulfide concentration (<\u00a01\u00a0\u00b5M) in their external environment. In the colonocyte cell line HT-29, sulfide oxidation provided the first example of reverse electron transfer in living cells, such a transfer increasing sulfide tolerance. However, SQR activity was not detected in brain mitochondria and neuroblastoma cells. Consequently, the neural tissue would be more sensitive to sulfide poisoning. Our data disclose new constraints concerning the emerging signaling role of sulfide.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome cbb3 is a distinct member of the superfamily of respiratory heme-copper oxidases, and is responsible for driving the respiratory chain in many pathogenic bacteria. Like the canonical heme-copper oxidases, cytochrome cbb3 reduces oxygen to water and couples the released energy to pump protons across the bacterial membrane. Homology modeling and recent electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies on wild type and a mutant cbb3 enzyme [V. Rauham\u00e4ki et al. J. Biol. Chem. 284 (2009) 11301-11308] have led us to perform high-level quantum chemical calculations on the active site. These calculations bring molecular insight into the unique hydrogen bonding between the proximal histidine ligand of heme b3 and a conserved glutamate, and indicate that the catalytic mechanism involves redox-coupled proton transfer between these residues. The calculated spin densities give insight in the difference in EPR spectra for the wild type and a recently studied E383Q-mutant cbb3-enzyme. Furthermore, we show that the redox-coupled proton movement in the proximal cavity of cbb3-enzymes contributes to the low redox potential of heme b3, and suggest its potential implications for the high apparent oxygen affinity of these enzymes.",

Premium) leaves under various pre-excitation conditions. Prolonged adaptation in the dark terminated by a short PSII\u00a0+\u00a0PSI\u2212 exciting light pulse guarantees pre-conditions in which the initial photochemical events in PSI RCs are carried out by cyclic electron transfer (CET). Pre-excitation with one or more 10\u00a0s FR pulses creates conditions for induction of linear electron transport (LET). These converse conditions give rise to totally different, but reproducible responses of P700\u2212 oxidation. System analyses of these responses were made based on quantitative solutions of the rate equations dictated by the associated reaction scheme for each of the relevant conditions. These provide the mathematical elements of the P700 induction algorithm (PIA) with which the distinguishable components of the P700+ response can be resolved and interpreted. It enables amongst others the interpretation and understanding of the characteristic kinetic profile of the P700+ response in intact leaves upon 10\u00a0s illumination with far-red light under the promotive condition for CET. The system analysis provides evidence that this unique kinetic pattern with a non-responsive delay followed by a steep S-shaped signal increase is caused by a photoelectrochemically controlled suppression of the electron transport from Fd to the PQ-reducing Qr site of the cytb6f complex in the cyclic pathway. The photoelectrochemical control is exerted by the PSI-powered proton pump associated with CET. It shows strong similarities with the photoelectrochemical control of LET at the acceptor side of PSII which is reflected by release of photoelectrochemical quenching of chlorophyll a fluorescence.",

We demonstrate that in the absence of \u03b2 subunit, complex V is not assembled, respiratory rate is decreased by half and ATP synthesis coupled to the respiratory activity is fully impaired. Lack of ATP synthase also affects the morphology of mitochondria which are deprived of cristae. We also show that mutants are obligate phototrophs and that rearrangements of the photosynthetic apparatus occur in the chloroplast as a response to ATP synthase deficiency in mitochondria.

     "abstract": "Isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) is shown here to be a sensitive and accurate method for assaying the steady-state enzyme activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Single ATP injection experiments yield an apparent enthalpy change for the ATP hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by the enzyme of \u221251 (\u00b1\u00a01) kJ mol\u22121. This value is independent of the amount of ADP accumulated in the sample cell, which indicates that under the experimental conditions studied here (saturating Na+ and K+ concentrations) ADP does not inhibit enzyme activity by reversal of the phosphorylation reaction and resynthesizing ATP. Multiple ATP injection titration experiments in which varying concentrations of ADP were initially included in the sample cell could be adequately explained by a Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetic model incorporating noncompetitive inhibition. This suggests that ADP inhibits the enzyme by binding to more than one enzyme intermediate and inhibiting forward reactions of the enzyme. Values of Km and KI obtained for the fits agree with literature values obtained by other methods. Because ITC is a direct method of continually monitoring enzyme activity, it is a valuable supplement to less direct or noncontinuous methods such as colorimetric, enzyme-coupled or radioactivity-based assays.",

     "abstract": "A number of findings in the 1950s had offered indirect indications that mitochondria could accumulate Ca2+. In 1961, the phenomenon was directly demonstrated using isolated mitochondria: the uptake process was driven by respiratory chain activity or by the hydrolysis of added ATP. It could be accompanied by the simultaneous uptake of inorganic phosphate, in which case precipitates of hydroxyapatite were formed in the matrix, buffering its free Ca2+ concentration. The properties of the uptake process were established in the 1960s and 1970s: the uptake of Ca2+ occurred electrophoretically on a carrier that has not yet been molecularly identified, and was released from mitochondria via a Na+/Ca2+ antiporter. A H+/Ca2+ release exchanger was also found to operate in some mitochondrial types. The permeability transition pore was later also found to mediate the efflux of Ca2+ from mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix two TCA cycle dehydrogenases and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphate phosphatase were found to be regulated in the matrix by the cycling of Ca2+ across the inner membrane. In conditions of cytoplasmic Ca2+ overload mitochondria could store for a time large amounts of precipitated Ca2+-phosphate, thus permitting cells to survive situations of Ca2+ emergency. The uptake process was found to have very low affinity for Ca2+: since the bulk concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is in the low to mid-nM range, it became increasingly difficult to postulate a role of mitochondria in the regulation of cytoplsmic Ca2+. A number of findings had nevertheless shown that energy linked Ca2+ transport occurred efficiently in mitochondria of various tissues in situ. The paradox was only solved in the 1990s, when it was found that the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is not uniform: perimitochondrial micropools are created by the agonist-promoted discharge of Ca2+ from vicinal stores in which the concentration of Ca2+ is high enough to activate the low affinity mitochondrial uniporter. Mitochondria thus regained center stage as important regulators of cytoplasmic Ca2+ (not only of their own internal Ca2+). Their Ca2+ uptake systems was found to react very rapidly to cytoplasmic Ca2+ demands, even in the 150-200 msec time scale of processes like the contraction and relaxation of heart. An important recent development in the area of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport is its involvement in the disease process. Ca2+ signaling defects are now gaining increasing importance in the pathogenesis of diseases, e.g., neurodegenerative diseases. Since mitochondria have now regained a central role in the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca2+, dysfunctions of their Ca2+ controlling systems have expectedly been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous disease processes.",

     "abstract": "The K-pathway is one of the two proton-input channels required for function of cytochrome c oxidase. In the Rhodobacter sphaeroides cytochrome c oxidase, the K-channel starts at Glu101 in subunit II, which is at the surface of the protein exposed to the cytoplasm, and runs to Tyr288 at the heme a3/CuB active site. Mutations of conserved, polar residues within the K-channel block or inhibit steady state oxidase activity. A large body of research has demonstrated that the K-channel is required to fully reduce the heme/Cu binuclear center, prior to the reaction with O2, presumably by providing protons to stabilize the reduced metals (ferrous heme a3 and cuprous CuB). However, there are conflicting reports which raise questions about whether blocking the K-channel blocks both electrons or only one electron from reaching the heme/Cu center. In the current work, the rate and extent of the anaerobic reduction of the heme/Cu center were monitored by optical and EPR spectroscopies, comparing the wild type and mutants that block the K-channel. The new data show that when the K-channel is blocked, one electron will still readily enter the binuclear center. The one-electron reduction of the resting oxidized (\u201cO\u201d) heme/Cu center of the K362M mutant, results in a partially reduced binuclear center in which the electron is distributed about evenly between heme a3 and CuB in the R. sphaeroides oxidase. Complete reduction of the heme/Cu center requires the uptake of two protons which must be delivered through the K-channel.",

At a distance of only \u223c\u00a07\u00a0\u00c5 in the 49-kDa subunit, a highly conserved tyrosine is found at the bottom of the previously characterized quinone binding pocket. To get insight into the function of this residue, we have exchanged it for six different amino acids in complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica. Mitochondrial membranes from all six mutants contained fully assembled complex I that exhibited very low dNADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activities with n-decylubiquinone. With the most conservative exchange Y144F, no alteration in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of complex I was detectable. Remarkably, high dNADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase activities were observed with ubiquinones Q1 and Q2 that were coupled to proton pumping. Apparent Km values for Q1 and Q2 were markedly increased and we found pronounced resistance to the complex I inhibitors decyl-quinazoline-amine (DQA) and rotenone. We conclude that Y144 directly binds the head group of ubiquinone, most likely via a hydrogen bond between the aromatic hydroxyl and the ubiquinone carbonyl. This places the substrate in an ideal distance to its electron donor iron\u2013sulfur cluster N2 for efficient electron transfer during the catalytic cycle of complex I.",

The formation of this supramolecular unit largely depends on the lipid content and composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The function of the super-complexes appears not to be restricted to kinetic advantages in electron transfer: we discuss evidence on their role in the stability and assembly of the individual complexes, particularly Complex I, and in preventing excess oxygen radical formation.

     "abstract": "A stochastic approach based on the Gillespie algorithm is particularly well adapted to describe the time course of the redox reactions that occur inside the respiratory chain complexes because they involve the motion of single electrons between the individual unique redox centres of a given complex. We use this approach to describe the molecular functioning of the peripheral arm of complex I based on its known crystallographic structure and the rate constants of electron tunnelling derived from the Moser and Dutton phenomenological equations. There are several possible electrons pathways but we show that most of them take the route defined by the successive sites and redox centres: NADH+ site \u2013 FMN \u2013 N3 \u2013 N1b \u2013 N4 \u2013 N5 \u2013 N6a \u2013 N6b \u2013 N2 \u2013 Q site. However, the electrons do not go directly from NADH towards the ubiquinone molecule. They frequently jump back and forth between neighbouring redox centres with the result that the net flux of electrons through complex I (i.e. net number of electrons reducing a ubiquinone) is far smaller than the number of redox reactions which actually occur. While most of the redox centres are reduced in our simulations the degree of reduction can vary according to the individual midpoint potentials. The high turnover number observed in our simulation seems to indicate that, in the whole complex I, one or several slower step(s) follow(s) the redox reactions involved in the peripheral arm. It also appears that the residence time of FMNH\u2022 and SQ\u2022 (possible producers of ROS) is low (around 4% and between 1.6% and 5% respectively according to the values of the midpoint potentials). We did not find any evidence for a role of N7 which remains mainly reduced in our simulations. The role of N1a is complex and depends upon its midpoint potential. In all cases its presence slightly decreases the life time of the flavosemiquinone species. These simulations demonstrate the interest of this type of model which links the molecular physico-chemistry of the individual redox reactions to the more global level of the reaction, as is observed experimentally.",

The import promotion appears to be associated with the observed cAMP-dependent stimulation of the catalytic activity of complex I. These effects of PKA are counteracted by activation of protein phosphatase(s). PKA and the transcription factor CREB play a critical role in the biosynthesis of complex I subunits.

Signals observed in the amide I range are partially attributed to local rearrangements that occur as an electrostatic response to the redox reactions of the FeS clusters.

     "abstract": "In mitochondria isolated from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, under non-phosphorylating conditions, we have previously shown that there is a right of way for electrons coming from the external NADH dehydrogenase, Nde1p. In this work, we show that the electron competition process is identical under more physiological conditions i.e. oxidative phosphorylation. Such a competition generates a priority for cytosolic NADH reoxidation. Furthermore, this electron competition process is associated with an energy wastage (the \u201cactive leak\u201d) that allows an increase in redox equivalent oxidation when the redox pressure increases. When this redox pressure is decreased, i.e. under phosphorylating conditions, most of this energy wastage is alleviated. By studying mutant strains affected either in respiratory chain supramolecular organization or in electron competition activity, we show that the respiratory chain supramolecular organization is not responsible for the electron competition processes. Moreover, we show two distinct relationships between the respiratory rate and the quinone redox state that seem to indicate two quinone pools that are involved in the electron right of way. Indeed, the more reduced pool would be associated to the electron right of way for the external dehydrogenases whereas the less reduced pool would be associated to the electron right of way for the internal dehydrogenases.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this review is to analyze the results of experimental research of mechanisms of regulation of mitochondrial respiration in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells in vivo obtained by using the permeabilized cell technique. Such an analysis in the framework of Molecular Systems Bioenergetics shows that the mechanisms of regulation of energy fluxes depend on the structural organization of the cells and interaction of mitochondria with cytoskeletal elements. Two types of cells of cardiac phenotype with very different structures were analyzed: adult cardiomyocytes and continuously dividing cancerous HL-1 cells. In cardiomyocytes mitochondria are arranged very regularly, and show rapid configuration changes of inner membrane but no fusion or fission, diffusion of ADP and ATP is restricted mostly at the level of mitochondrial outer membrane due to an interaction of heterodimeric tubulin with voltage dependent anion channel, VDAC. VDAC with associated tubulin forms a supercomplex, Mitochondrial Interactosome, with mitochondrial creatine kinase, MtCK, which is structurally and functionally coupled to ATP synthasome. Due to selectively limited permeability of VDAC for adenine nucleotides, mitochondrial respiration rate depends almost linearly upon the changes of cytoplasmic ADP concentration in their physiological range. Functional coupling of MtCK with ATP synthasome amplifies this signal by recycling adenine nucleotides in mitochondria coupled to effective phosphocreatine synthesis. In cancerous HL-1 cells this complex is significantly modified: tubulin is replaced by hexokinase and MtCK is lacking, resulting in direct utilization of mitochondrial ATP for glycolytic lactate production and in this way contributing in the mechanism of the Warburg effect. Systemic analysis of changes in the integrated system of energy metabolism is also helpful for better understanding of pathogenesis of many other diseases.",

Yet, much is still unknown about the mutual interaction between mitochondrial energy state, biogenesis, dynamics and degradation. Meanwhile, clinical research into metabolic abnormalities in tumors as diverse as renal carcinoma, glioblastomas, paragangliomas or skin leiomyomata, has designated new genes, oncogenes and oncometabolites involved in the regulation of cellular and mitochondrial energy production. Furthermore, the examination of rare neurological diseases such as Charcot-Marie Tooth type 2a, Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy, Lethal Defect of Mitochondrial and Peroxisomal Fission, or Spastic Paraplegia suggested involvement of MFN2, OPA1/3, DRP1 or Paraplegin, in the auxiliary control of mitochondrial energy production. Lastly, advances in the understanding of mitochondrial apoptosis have suggested a supplementary role for Bcl2 or Bax in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration and dynamics, which has fostered the investigation of alternative mechanisms of energy regulation.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c oxidase is a multisubunit membrane-bound enzyme, which catalyzes oxidation of four molecules of cytochrome c2+ and reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The electrons are taken from one side of the membrane while the protons are taken from the other side. This topographical arrangement results in a charge separation that is equivalent to moving one positive charge across the membrane for each electron transferred to O2. In this reaction part of the free energy available from O2 reduction is conserved in the form of an electrochemical proton gradient. In addition, part of the free energy is used to pump on average one proton across the membrane per electron transferred to O2. Our understanding of the molecular design of the machinery that couples O2 reduction to proton pumping in oxidases has greatly benefited from studies of so called \u201cuncoupled\u201d structural variants of the oxidases. In these uncoupled oxidases the catalytic O2-reduction reaction may display the same rates as in the wild-type CytcO, yet the electron/proton transfer to O2 is not linked to proton pumping. One striking feature of all uncoupled variants studied to date is that the (apparent) pKa of a Glu residue, located deeply within a proton pathway, is either increased or decreased (from 9.4 in the wild-type oxidase). The altered pKa presumably reflects changes in the local structural environment of the residue and because the Glu residue is found near the catalytic site as well as near a putative exit pathway for pumped protons these changes are presumably important for controlling the rates and trajectories of the proton transfer. In this paper we summarize data obtained from studies of uncoupled structural oxidase variants and present a hypothesis that in quantitative terms offers a link between structural changes, modulation of the apparent pKa and uncoupling of proton pumping from O2 reduction.",

These enzymes reduce oxygen to water and use the free energy from this reaction to maintain a proton-motive force across the membrane in which they are embedded. The heme\u2013copper oxidases of the cbb3-type are only found in bacteria, often pathogenic ones since they have a low Km for O2, enabling the bacteria to colonize semi-anoxic environments. Cbb3-type (C) oxidases are highly divergent from the mitochondrial-like aa3-type (A) oxidases, and within the heme\u2013copper oxidase family, cbb3 is the closest relative to the most divergent member, the bacterial nitric oxide reductase (NOR). Nitric oxide reductases reduce NO to N2O without coupling the reaction to the generation of any electrochemical proton gradient. The significant structural differences between A- and C-type heme\u2013copper oxidases are manifested in the lack in cbb3 of most of the amino acids found to be important for proton pumping in the A-type, as well as in the different binding characteristics of ligands such as CO, O2 and NO. Investigations of the reasons for these differences at a molecular level have provided insights into the mechanism of O2 and NO reduction as well as the proton-pumping mechanism in all heme\u2013copper oxidases. In this paper, we discuss results from these studies with the focus on the relationship between proton transfer and ligand binding and reduction. In addition, we present new data, which show that CO binding to one of the c-type hemes of CcoP is modulated by protein\u2013lipid interactions in the membrane.

     "abstract": "A b-type heme is conserved in membrane-bound complex II enzymes (SQR, succinate\u2013ubiquinone reductase). The axial ligands for the low spin heme b in Escherichia coli complex II are SdhC His84 and SdhD His71. E. coli SdhD His71 is separated by 10 residues from SdhD Asp82 and Tyr83 which are essential for ubiquinone catalysis. The same His-10x-AspTyr motif dominates in homologous SdhD proteins, except for Saccharomyces cerevisiae where a tyrosine is at the axial position (Tyr-Cys-9x-AspTyr). Nevertheless, the yeast enzyme was suggested to contain a stoichiometric amount of heme, however, with the Cys ligand in the aforementioned motif acting as heme ligand. In this report, the role of Cys residues for heme coordination in the complex II family of enzymes is addressed. Cys was substituted to the SdhD-71 position and the yeast Tyr71Cys72 motif was also recreated. The Cys71 variant retained heme, although it was high spin, while the Tyr71Cys72 mutant lacked heme. Previously the presence of heme in S. cerevisiae was detected by a spectral peak in fumarate-oxidized, dithionite-reduced mitochondria. Here it is shown that this method must be used with caution. Comparison of bovine and yeast mitochondrial membranes shows that fumarate induced reoxidation of cytochromes in both SQR and the bc1 complex (ubiquinol\u2013cytochrome c reductase). Thus, this report raises a concern about the presence of low spin heme b in S. cerevisiae complex II.",

     "abstract": "In the ATP synthases of Escherichia coli ADP and phosphate exert an apparent regulatory role on the efficiency of proton transport coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP. Both molecules induce clearly biphasic effects on hydrolysis and proton transfer. At intermediate concentrations (\u223c\u00a00.5\u20131\u00a0\u00b5M and higher) ADP inhibits hydrolysis and proton transfer; a quantitative analysis of the fluxes however proves that the coupling efficiency remains constant in this concentration range. On the other hand at nanomolar concentrations of ADP (a level obtainable only using an enzymatic ATP regenerating system) the efficiency of proton transport drops progressively, while the rate of hydrolysis remains high. Phosphate, at concentrations \u2265\u00a00.1\u00a0mM, inhibits hydrolysis only if ADP is present at sufficiently high concentrations, keeping the coupling efficiency constant. At lower ADP levels phosphate is, however, necessary for an efficiently coupled catalytic cycle. We present a model for a catalytic cycle of ATP hydrolysis uncoupled from the transport of protons. The model is based on the available structures of bovine and yeast F1 and on the known binding affinities for ADP and Pi of the catalytic sites in their different functional states. The binding site related to the inhibitory effects of Pi (in association with ADP) is identified as the \u03b1HC\u03b2HC site, the pre-release site for the hydrolysis products. We suggest, moreover, that the high affinity site, associated with the operation of an efficient proton transport, could coincide with a conformational state intermediate between the \u03b1TP\u03b2TP and the \u03b1DP\u03b2DP (similar to the transition state of the hydrolysis/synthesis reaction) that does not strongly bind the ligands and can exchange them rather freely with the external medium. The emptying of this site can lead to an unproductive hydrolysis cycle that occurs without a net rotation of the central stalk and, consequently, does not translocate protons.",

     "publication date": "07-2010",
     "abstract": "The functional mechanism of the F1Fo ATP synthase, like many membrane transporters and pumps, entails a conformational cycle that is coupled to the movement of H+ or Na+ ions across its transmembrane domain, down an electrochemical gradient. This coupling is an efficient means of energy transduction and regulation, provided that ion binding to the membrane domain, known as Fo, is appropriately selective. In this study we set out to establish the structural and energetic basis for the ion-binding selectivity of the membrane-embedded Fo rotors of two representative ATP synthases. First, we use a biochemical approach to demonstrate the inherent binding selectivity of these rotors, that is, independently from the rest of the enzyme. We then use atomically detailed computer simulations of wild-type and mutagenized rotors to calculate and rationalize their selectivity, on the basis of the structure, dynamics and coordination chemistry of the binding sites. We conclude that H+ selectivity is most likely a robust property of all Fo rotors, arising from the prominent presence of a conserved carboxylic acid and its intrinsic chemical propensity for protonation, as well as from the structural plasticity of the binding sites. In H+-coupled rotors, the incorporation of hydrophobic side chains to the binding sites enhances this inherent H+ selectivity. Size restriction may also favor H+ over Na+, but increasing size alone does not confer Na+ selectivity. Rather, the degree to which Fo rotors may exhibit Na+ coupling relies on the presence of a sufficient number of suitable coordinating side chains and/or structural water molecules. These ligands accomplish a shift in the relative binding energetics, which under some physiological conditions may be sufficient to provide Na+ dependence.",

     "abstract": "The activity of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) is rate-limiting for nonshivering thermogenesis and diet-induced thermogenesis. Characteristically, this activity is inhibited by GDP experimentally and presumably mainly by cytosolic ATP within brown-fat cells. The issue as to whether UCP1 has a residual proton conductance even when fully saturated with GDP/ATP (as has recently been suggested) has not only scientific but also applied interest, since a residual proton conductance would make overexpressed UCP1 weight-reducing even without physiological/pharmacological activation. To examine this question, we have here established optimal conditions for studying the bioenergetics of wild-type and UCP1(\u2212/\u2212) brown-fat mitochondria, analysing UCP1-mediated differences in parallel preparations of brown-fat mitochondria from both genotypes. Comparing different substrates, we find that pyruvate (or palmitoyl-l-carnitine) shows the largest relative coupling by GDP. Comparing albumin concentrations, we find the range 0.1\u20130.6% optimal; higher concentrations are inhibitory. Comparing basic medium composition, we find 125\u00a0mM sucrose optimal; an ionic medium (50\u2013100\u00a0mM KCl) functions for wild-type but is detrimental for UCP1(\u2212/\u2212) mitochondria. Using optimal conditions, we find no evidence for a residual proton conductance (not a higher post-GDP respiration, a lower membrane potential or an altered proton leak at highest common potential) with either pyruvate or glycerol-3-phosphate as substrates, nor by a 3\u20134-fold alteration of the amount of UCP1. We could demonstrate that certain experimental conditions, due to respiratoty inhibition, could lead to the suggestion that UCP1 possesses a residual proton conductance but find that under optimal conditions our experiments concur with implications from physiological observations that in the presence of inhibitory nucleotides, UCP1 is not leaky.",

     "abstract": "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are members of the mitochondrial anion carrier protein family that are present in the mitochondrial inner membrane and mediate free fatty acid (FFA)-activated, purine nucleotide (PN)-inhibited proton conductance. Since 1999, the presence of UCPs has been demonstrated in some non-photosynthesising unicellular eukaryotes, including amoeboid and parasite protists, as well as in non-fermentative yeast and filamentous fungi. In the mitochondria of these organisms, UCP activity is revealed upon FFA-induced, PN-inhibited stimulation of resting respiration and a decrease in membrane potential, which are accompanied by a decrease in membranous ubiquinone (Q) reduction level. UCPs in unicellular eukaryotes are able to divert energy from oxidative phosphorylation and thus compete for a proton electrochemical gradient with ATP synthase. Our recent work indicates that membranous Q is a metabolic sensor that might utilise its redox state to release the PN inhibition of UCP-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling under conditions of phosphorylation and resting respiration. The action of reduced Q (QH2) could allow higher or complete activation of UCP. As this regulatory feature was demonstrated for microorganism UCPs (A. castellanii UCP), plant and mammalian UCP1 analogues, and UCP1 in brown adipose tissue, the process could involve all UCPs. Here, we discuss the functional connection and physiological role of UCP and alternative oxidase, two main energy-dissipating systems in the plant-type mitochondrial respiratory chain of unicellular eukaryotes, including the control of cellular energy balance as well as preventive action against the production of reactive oxygen species.",

We record a halving of CD8 single positive cell numbers in thymus with a significant incremental increase in CD4/CD8 double positives cell numbers in the thymus of UCP 1 knock-out mice compared to wild-type mice. These data are mirrored by an approximate halving of CD8 single positive cell numbers and a doubling of CD4/CD8 double positive cell numbers in the spleen of UCP 1 knock-out mice compared to wild-type mice.

This view was based on data from inhibitor binding studies, small-angle neutron scattering, electron microscopy, differential tagging/affinity chromatography, size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, native gel electrophoresis, cross-linking experiments, tandem-fusions, negative dominance studies and mutagenesis. However, the structural folds of the ADP/ATP carriers were found to be monomeric, lacking obvious dimerisation interfaces. Subsequently, the yeast ADP/ATP carrier was demonstrated to function as a monomer. Here, we revisit the data that have been published in support of a dimeric state of mitochondrial carriers. Our analysis shows that when critical factors are taken into account, the monomer is the only plausible functional form of mitochondrial carriers. We propose a transport model based on the monomer, in which access to a single substrate binding site is controlled by two flanking salt bridge networks, explaining uniport and strict exchange of substrates.",

The mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and reconstituted in liposomes, and their transport activity was measured as 3H-carnitine/carnitine antiport. The mutants K35A, E132A, D179A and R275A were nearly inactive with transport activities between 5 and 10% of the wild-type carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier. R178A, K234A and D231A showed transport function of about 15% of the wild-type carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier. The substitutions of the other residues with alanine had little or no effect on the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier activity. Marked changes in the kinetic parameters with three-fold higher Km and lower Vmax values with respect to the wild-type carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier were found when replacing Lys-35, Glu-132, Asp-179 and Arg-275 with alanine. Double mutants exhibited transport activities and kinetic parameters reflecting those of the single mutants; however, lack of D179A activity was partially rescued by the additional mutation R178A.

P5A ATPases have been identified in the endoplasmic reticulum and seem to have basic functions in protein maturation and secretion. P5B ATPases localize to vacuolar/lysosomal or apical membranes and in animals play a role in hereditary neuronal diseases. Here we have used a bioinformatical approach to identify differences in the primary sequences between the two subgroups. P5A and P5B ATPases appear have a very different membrane topology from other P-type ATPases with two and one, respectively, additional transmembrane segments inserted in the N-terminal end.

The full extent and importance of the role of [Ca2+]m is becoming apparent as evidenced by the increasing interest and work in this area over the last two decades. However, controversies remain, such as the existence of beat-to-beat mitochondrial Ca2+ transients; the role of [Ca2+]m in modulating whole-cell Ca2+ signalling; whether or not an increase in [Ca2+]m is essential to couple ATP supply and demand; and the role of [Ca2+]m in cell death by both necrosis and apoptosis, especially in formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The role of [Ca2+]m in heart failure is an area that has also recently been highlighted. [Ca2+]m can now be measured reasonably specifically in intact cells and hearts thanks to developments in fluorescent indicators and targeted proteins and more sensitive imaging technology. This has revealed interactions of the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters with those of the sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum, and has gone a long way to bringing the mitochondrial Ca2+ transporters to the forefront of cardiac research. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake occurs via the ruthenium red sensitive Ca2+ uniporter (mCU), and efflux via an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX). The purification and cloning of the transporters, and development of more specific inhibitors, would produce a step-change in our understanding of the role of these apparently critical but still elusive proteins. In this article we will summarise the key physiological roles of [Ca2+]m in ATP production and cell Ca2+ signalling in both adult and neonatal hearts, as well as highlighting some of the controversies in these areas.

     "abstract": "While it is generally accepted that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) balance depends on the both rate of single electron reduction of O2 to superoxide (O2\u2212) by the electron transport chain and the rate of scavenging by intracellular antioxidant pathways, considerable controversy exists regarding the conditions leading to oxidative stress in intact cells versus isolated mitochondria. Here, we postulate that mitochondria have been evolutionarily optimized to maximize energy output while keeping ROS overflow to a minimum by operating in an intermediate redox state. We show that at the extremes of reduction or oxidation of the redox couples involved in electron transport (NADH/NAD+) or ROS scavenging (NADPH/NADP+, GSH/GSSG), respectively, ROS balance is lost. This results in a net overflow of ROS that increases as one moves farther away from the optimal redox potential. At more reduced mitochondrial redox potentials, ROS production exceeds scavenging, while under more oxidizing conditions (e.g., at higher workloads) antioxidant defenses can be compromised and eventually overwhelmed. Experimental support for this hypothesis is provided in both cardiomyocytes and in isolated mitochondria from guinea pig hearts. The model reconciles, within a single framework, observations that isolated mitochondria tend to display increased oxidative stress at high reduction potentials (and high mitochondrial membrane potential, \u2206\u03a8m), whereas intact cardiac cells can display oxidative stress either when mitochondria become more uncoupled (i.e., low \u2206\u03a8m) or when mitochondria are maximally reduced (as in ischemia or hypoxia). The continuum described by the model has the potential to account for many disparate experimental observations and also provides a rationale for graded physiological ROS signaling at redox potentials near the minimum.",

     "abstract": "The present state of the art in studies on the mechanisms of antioxidant activities of mitochondria-targeted cationic plastoquinone derivatives (SkQs) is reviewed. Our experiments showed that these compounds can operate as antioxidants in two quite different ways, i.e. (i) by preventing peroxidation of cardiolipin [Antonenko et al., Biochemistry (Moscow) 73 (2008) 1273\u20131287] and (ii) by fatty acid cycling resulting in mild uncoupling that inhibits the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondrial State 4 [Severin et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107 (2009), 663\u2013668]. The quinol and cationic moieties of SkQ are involved in cases (i) and (ii), respectively. In case (i) SkQH2 interrupts propagation of chain reactions involved in peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acid residues in cardiolipin, the formed SkQ\u2212 being reduced back to SkQH2 by heme bH of complex III in an antimycin-sensitive way. Molecular dynamics simulation showed that there are two stable conformations of SkQ1 with the quinol residue localized near peroxyl radicals at C9 or C13 of the linoleate residue in cardiolipin. In mechanism (ii), fatty acid cycling mediated by the cationic SkQ moiety is involved. It consists of (a) transmembrane movement of the fatty acid anion/SkQ cation pair and (b) back flows of free SkQ cation and protonated fatty acid. The cycling results in a protonophorous effect that was demonstrated in planar phospholipid membranes and liposomes. In mitochondria, the cycling gives rise to mild uncoupling, thereby decreasing membrane potential and ROS generation coupled to reverse electron transport in the respiratory chain. In yeast cells, dodecyltriphenylphosphonium (\u042112TPP), the cationic part of SkQ1, induces uncoupling that is mitochondria-targeted since \u042112TPP is specifically accumulated in mitochondria and increases the H+ conductance of their inner membrane. The conductance of the outer cell membrane is not affected by \u042112TPP.",

Defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the ATPase are considered to be accompanied by changes in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This study aimed to elucidate effects of selenium on ROS and antioxidant system of NARP cybrid cells with 98% of T8993G mutation load. We found that selenium decreased ROS generation and increased the level and activity of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR).

     "abstract": "This review highlights the important role of redox signaling between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases. Besides the definition and general importance of redox signaling, the cross-talk between mitochondrial and Nox-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is discussed on the basis of 4 different examples. In the first model, angiotensin-II is discussed as a trigger for NADPH oxidase activation with subsequent ROS-dependent opening of mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium channels leading to depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential followed by mitochondrial ROS formation and respiratory dysfunction. This concept was supported by observations that ethidium bromide-induced mitochondrial damage suppressed angiotensin-II-dependent increase in Nox1 and oxidative stress. In another example hypoxia was used as a stimulator of mitochondrial ROS formation and by using pharmacological and genetic inhibitors, a role of mitochondrial ROS for the induction of NADPH oxidase via PKC\u025b was demonstrated. The third model was based on cell death by serum withdrawal that promotes the production of ROS in human 293T cells by stimulating both the mitochondria and Nox1. By superior molecular biological methods the authors showed that mitochondria were responsible for the fast onset of ROS formation followed by a slower but long-lasting oxidative stress condition based on the activation of an NADPH oxidase (Nox1) in response to the fast mitochondrial ROS formation. Finally, a cross-talk between mitochondria and NADPH oxidases (Nox2) was shown in nitroglycerin-induced tolerance involving the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and ATP-sensitive potassium channels. The use of these redox signaling pathways as pharmacological targets is briefly discussed.",

     "abstract": "The ability of mitochondria to capture Ca2+ ions has important functional implications for cells, because mitochondria shape cellular Ca2+ signals by acting as a Ca2+ buffer and respond to Ca2+ elevations either by increasing the cell energy supply or by triggering the cell death program of apoptosis. A mitochondrial Ca2+ channel known as the uniporter drives the rapid and massive entry of Ca2+ ions into mitochondria. The uniporter operates at high, micromolar cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations that are only reached transiently in cells, near Ca2+ release channels. Mitochondria can also take up Ca2+ at low, nanomolar concentrations, but this high affinity mode of Ca2+ uptake is not well characterized. Recently, leucine-zipper-EF hand-containing transmembrane region (Letm1) was proposed to be an electrogenic 1:1 mitochondrial Ca2+/H+ antiporter that drives the uptake of Ca2+ into mitochondria at nanomolar cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. In this article, we will review the properties of the Ca2+ import systems of mitochondria and discuss how Ca2+ uptake via an electrogenic 1:1 Ca2+/H+ antiport challenges our current thinking of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly undergo fission, fusion, and movement. Increasing evidence indicates that these dynamic changes are intricately related to mitochondrial function, suggesting that mitochondrial form and function are linked. Calcium (Ca2+) is one signal that has been shown to both regulate mitochondrial fission in various cell types and stimulate mitochondrial enzymes involved in ATP generation. However, although Ca2+ plays an important role in adult cardiac muscle cells for excitation\u2013metabolism coupling, little is known about whether Ca2+ can regulate their mitochondrial morphology. Therefore, we tested the role of Ca2+ in regulating cardiac mitochondrial fission. We found that neonatal and adult cardiomyocyte mitochondria undergo rapid and transient fragmentation upon a thapsigargin (TG)- or KCl-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increase. The mitochondrial fission protein, DLP1, participates in this mitochondrial fragmentation, suggesting that cardiac mitochondrial fission machinery may be regulated by intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, the TG-induced fragmentation was also associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, suggesting that activation of mitochondrial fission machinery is an early event for Ca2+-mediated ROS generation in cardiac myocytes. These results suggest that Ca2+, an important regulator of muscle contraction and energy generation, also dynamically regulates mitochondrial morphology and ROS generation in cardiac myocytes.",

The experiments were performed in the presence of ADP, a very effective inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition. Moderate increase in H2O2 release from mitochondria was induced by Ca2+ applied in 50\u00a0\u00b5M, but not in 300\u00a0\u00b5M concentration as measured with Amplex red fluorescent assay starting with a delay of 100-150\u00a0sec after exposure to Ca2+. Parallel measurements of membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) by safranine fluorescence showed a transient depolarization by Ca2+ followed by the recovery of \u0394\u03a8m to a value, which was more negative than that observed before addition of Ca2+ indicating a relative hyperpolarization. NAD(P)H fluorescence was also increased by Ca2+ given in 50\u00a0\u00b5M concentration. In mitochondria having high \u0394\u03a8m in the presence of oligomycin or ATP, the basal rate of release of H2O2 was significantly higher than that observed in a medium containing ADP and Ca2+ no longer increased but rather decreased the rate of H2O2 release. With 300\u00a0\u00b5M Ca2+ only a loss but no tendency of a recovery of \u0394\u03a8m was detected and H2O2 release was unchanged. It is suggested that in the presence of nucleotides the effect of Ca2+ on mitochondrial ROS release is related to changes in \u0394\u03a8m; in depolarized mitochondria, in the presence of ADP, moderate increase in H2O2 release is induced by calcium, but only in \u2264 100\u00a0\u00b5M concentration, when after a transient Ca2+-induced depolarization mitochondria became more polarized. In highly polarized mitochondria, in the presence of ATP or oligomycin, where no hyperpolarization follows the Ca2+-induced depolarization, Ca2+ fails to stimulate mitochondrial ROS generation. These effects of calcium (\u2264 300\u00a0\u00b5M) are unrelated to mitochondrial permeability transition.",

Also in contrast to the oxidation of succinate, where conversion of the pH difference between the mitochondrial matrix and the medium into the transmembrane electric potential by addition of nigericin results in a decrease of ROS generation, the same treatment during oxidation of octanoylcarnitine produces a large increase of ROS. Analysis of respiratory chain complexes by Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed bands that could tentatively point to supercomplex formation between complexes II and I and complexes II and III.

The present study investigated the effects of p13 on mitochondrial inner membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8) in living cells.

As \u0394\u03c8 is known to control mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) uptake, we next analyzed the effect of p13 on Ca2+ homeostasis. Experiments carried out in HeLa cells expressing p13 and organelle-targeted aequorins revealed that the protein specifically reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake.

During the last 20\u00a0years, gerontological studies have revealed different molecular pathways involved in the ageing process and pointed out mitochondria as one of the key regulators of longevity. Increasing age in mammals correlates with increased levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and a deteriorating respiratory chain function. Experimental evidence in the mouse has linked increased levels of somatic mtDNA mutations to a variety of ageing phenotypes, such as osteoporosis, hair loss, graying of the hair, weight reduction and decreased fertility. A mosaic respiratory chain deficiency in a subset of cells in various tissues, such as heart, skeletal muscle, colonic crypts and neurons, is typically found in aged humans.

To examine possible adaptive processes in the skeletal muscle, we isolated mitochondria from the hind limb muscles of cold-acclimated wild-type and UCP1(\u2013/\u2013) mice and examined their bioenergetic chracteristics. We observed a switch in metabolism, from carbohydrate towards lipid catabolism, and an increased total mitochondrial complement, with an increased total ATP production capacity. The UCP1(\u2013/\u2013) muscle mitochondria did not display a changed state-4 respiration rate (no uncoupling) and were less sensitive to the uncoupling effect of fatty acids than the wild-type mitochondria. The content of UCP3 was increased 3-4 fold, but despite this, endogenous superoxide could not invoke a higher proton leak, and the small inhibitory effect of GDP was unaltered, indicating that it was not mediated by UCP3. Double mutant mice (UCP1(\u2013/\u2013) plus superoxide dismutase 2-overexpression) were not more cold sensitive than UCP1(\u2013/\u2013), bringing into question an involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in activation of any alternative thermogenic mechanism. We conclude that there is no evidence for an involvement of UCP3 in basal, fatty-acid- or superoxide-stimulated oxygen consumption or in GDP sensitivity. The adaptations observed did not imply any direct alternative process for nonshivering thermogenesis but the adaptations observed would be congruent with adaptation to chronically enhanced muscle activity caused by incessant shivering in these mice.",

Hence, in nitrate-grown cells, AOX may play a dual role: (1) lowering the ubiquinone pool reduction level and (2) permitting the export of mitochondrial reducing power under the form of malate for nitrate and nitrite reduction. This role of AOX in the mitochondrial plasticity makes logical the localization of Aox1 in a nitrate assimilation gene cluster.",

This identifies subunits a and A6L as two of the last subunits to complete the ATP synthase assembly. Minor amounts of dimeric and even tetrameric forms of the large assembly intermediate were preserved under the conditions of CNE, suggesting that it associated further into higher order structures in the mitochondrial membrane. This result was reminiscent to the reduced amounts of dimeric and tetrameric ATP synthase from yeast null mutants of subunits e and g detected by CNE. The dimer/oligomer-stabilizing effects of subunits e/g and a/A6L seem additive in human and yeast cells. The mature IF1 inhibitor was specifically bound to the dimeric/oligomeric forms of ATP synthase and not to the monomer. Conversely, nonprocessed pre-IF1 still containing the mitochondrial targeting sequence was selectively bound to the monomeric assembly intermediate in \u03c10 cells and not to the dimeric form. This supports previous suggestions that IF1 plays an important role in the dimerization/oligomerization of mammalian ATP synthase and in the regulation of mitochondrial structure and function.",

In this study we investigated whether the effect of 17-beta-estradiol on ischemia-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions and apoptosis is mediated by activation of signaling protein kinases in a Langendorff-perfused rat heart model of stop-flow ischemia. We found that pre-perfusion of non-ischemic hearts with 100\u00a0nM estradiol increased the resistance of subsequently isolated mitochondria to the calcium-induced opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and this was mediated by protein kinase G. Loading of the hearts with estradiol prevented ischemia-induced loss of cytochrome c from mitochondria and respiratory inhibition and these effects were reversed in the presence of the inhibitor of Akt kinase, NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ and protein kinase G inhibitor KT5823. Estradiol prevented ischemia-induced activation of caspases and this was also reversed by KT5823. These findings suggest that estradiol may protect the heart against ischemia-induced injury activating the signaling cascade which involves Akt kinase, NO synthase, guanylyl cyclase and protein kinase G, and results in blockage of mitochondrial permeability transition pore-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, respiratory inhibition and activation of caspases.",

     "abstract": "Despite extensive research, the regulation of mitochondrial function is still not understood completely. Ample evidence shows that cytosolic Ca2+ has a strategic task in co-ordinating the cellular work load and the regeneration of ATP by mitochondria. Currently, the paradigmatic view is that Cacyt2+ taken up by the Ca2+ uniporter activates the matrix enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase, \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase. However, we have recently found that Ca2+ regulates the glutamate-dependent state 3 respiration by the supply of glutamate to mitochondria via aralar, a mitochondrial glutamate/aspartate carrier. Since this activation is not affected by ruthenium red, glutamate transport into mitochondria is controlled exclusively by extramitochondrial Ca2+. Therefore, this discovery shows that besides intramitochondrial also extramitochondrial Ca2+ regulates oxidative phosphorylation. This new mechanism acts as a mitochondrial \u201cgas pedal\u201d, supplying the OXPHOS with substrate on demand. These results are in line with recent findings of Satrustegui and Palmieri showing that aralar as part of the malate\u2013aspartate shuttle is involved in the Ca2+-dependent transport of reducing hydrogen equivalents (from NADH) into mitochondria. This review summarises results and evidence as well as hypothetical interpretations of data supporting the view that at the surface of mitochondria different regulatory Ca2+-binding sites exist and can contribute to cellular energy homeostasis. Moreover, on the basis of our own data, we propose that these surface Ca2+-binding sites may act as targets for neurotoxic proteins such as mutated huntingtin and others. The binding of these proteins to Ca2+-binding sites can impair the regulation by Ca2+, causing energetic depression and neurodegeneration.",

Recent evidence indicates that proteins participating in mitochondrial dynamics also regulate mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, in cultured cells the mitochondrial fusion protein mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) stimulates respiration, substrate oxidation and the expression of subunits involved in respiratory complexes. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients. Reduced mitochondrial mass and defective activity has been proposed to explain this dysfunction. Alterations in mitochondrial metabolism may be crucial to account for some of the pathophysiological traits that characterize type 2 diabetes. Skeletal muscle of type 2 diabetic patients shows reduced expression of PGC-1\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b2, and Mfn2. In addition, a differential response to bilio-pancreatic diversion-induced weight loss in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic patients has been reported. While non-diabetic morbidly obese subjects showed an increased expression of genes encoding Mfn2, PGC-1\u03b1, PGC-1\u03b2, PPAR\u03b4 or SIRT1 in response to bariatric surgery-induced weight loss, no effect was detected in type 2 diabetic patients. These observations suggest the existence of a heritable component responsible for the abnormal control of the expression of genes encoding for modulators of mitochondrial biogenesis/metabolism, and which may participate in the development of the disease.",

Because ROS can damage biomolecules, cells contain elaborate antioxidant defense systems to prevent oxidative stress. In addition to their damaging effect, ROS can also operate as intracellular signaling molecules. Given the fact that mitochondrial ROS appear to be only generated at specific sites and that particular ROS species display a unique chemistry and have specific molecular targets, mitochondria-derived ROS might constitute local regulatory signals. The latter would allow individual mitochondria to auto-regulate their metabolism, shape and motility, enabling them to respond autonomously to the metabolic requirements of the cell. In this review we first summarize how mitochondrial ROS can be generated and removed in the living cell. Then we discuss experimental strategies for (local) detection of ROS by combining chemical or proteinaceous reporter molecules with quantitative live cell microscopy. Finally, approaches involving targeted pro- and antioxidants are presented, which allow the local manipulation of ROS levels.",

An increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ [Ca2+]c as part of this signaling cascade activates Ca2+ responsive phosphatase, calcineurin (Cn). Activation of IGF1R accompanied by increased glycolysis, invasiveness, and resistance to apoptosis is a phenotypic hallmark of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells subjected to this stress. The signaling is associated with activation and increased nuclear translocation of a number of transcription factors including a novel NF\u03baB (cRel:p50) pathway, NFAT, CREB and C/EBP\u03b4. This culminates in the upregulation of a number of nuclear genes including Cathepsin L, RyR1, Glut4 and Akt1. We observed that stress regulated transcription activation of nuclear genes involves a cooperative interplay between NF\u03baB (cRel:p50), C/EBP\u03b4, CREB, and NFAT. Our results show that the functional synergy of these factors requires the stress-activated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, hnRNPA2 as a transcriptional coactivator. We report here that mitochondrial stress leads to induced expression and activation of serine threonine kinase Akt1. Interestingly, we observe that Akt1 phosphorylates hnRNPA2 under mitochondrial stress conditions, which is a crucial step for the recruitment of this coactivator to the stress target promoters and culmination in mitochondrial stress-mediated transcription activation of target genes. We propose that mitochondrial stress plays an important role in tumor progression and emergence of invasive phenotypes.",

PreP contains an inverted Zn-binding motif and belongs to the pitrilysin protease family. The crystal structure of AtPreP refined at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 demonstrated a unique totally enclosed large cavity of 10\u00a0000\u00a0\u00c53 that opens and closes in response to peptide binding, revealing a novel catalytic mechanism for proteolysis.

As a facultative anaerobe with well understood genetics and molecular biology, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the model system of choice for studying nucleo-mitochondrial genetic interactions. Maintenance of the mitochondrial genome is controlled by a set of nuclear-coded factors forming intricately interconnected circuits responsible for replication, recombination, repair and transmission to buds. Expression of the yeast mitochondrial genome is regulated mostly at the post-transcriptional level, and involves many general and gene-specific factors regulating splicing, RNA processing and stability and translation. A very interesting aspect of the yeast mitochondrial system is the relationship between genome maintenance and gene expression. Deletions of genes involved in many different aspects of mitochondrial gene expression, notably translation, result in an irreversible loss of functional mtDNA. The mitochondrial genetic system viewed from the systems biology perspective is therefore very fragile and lacks robustness compared to the remaining systems of the cell. This lack of robustness could be a legacy of the reductive evolution of the mitochondrial genome, but explanations involving selective advantages of increased evolvability have also been postulated.",

     "abstract": "Several human neurological disorders have been associated with various mutations affecting mitochondrial enzymes involved in cellular ATP production. One of these mutations, T9176C in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), changes a highly conserved leucine residue into proline at position 217 of the mitochondrially encoded Atp6p (or a) subunit of the F1FO-ATP synthase. The consequences of this mutation on the mitochondrial ATP synthase are still poorly defined. To gain insight into the primary pathogenic mechanisms induced by T9176C, we have investigated the consequences of this mutation on the ATP synthase of yeast where Atp6p is also encoded by the mtDNA. In vitro, yeast atp6-T9176C mitochondria showed a 30% decrease in the rate of ATP synthesis. When forcing the F1FO complex to work in the reverse mode, i.e. F1-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP coupled to proton transport out of the mitochondrial matrix, the mutant showed a normal proton-pumping activity and this activity was fully sensitive to oligomycin, an inhibitor of the ATP synthase proton channel. However, under conditions of maximal ATP hydrolytic activity, using non-osmotically protected mitochondria, the mutant ATPase activity was less efficiently inhibited by oligomycin (60% inhibition versus 85% for the wild type control). Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis analyses revealed that atp6-T9176C yeast accumulated rather good levels of fully assembled ATP synthase complexes. However, a number of sub-complexes (F1, Atp9p-ring, unassembled \u03b1-F1 subunits) could be detected as well, presumably because of a decreased stability of Atp6p within the ATP synthase. Although the oxidative phosphorylation capacity was reduced in atp6-T9176C yeast, the number of ATP molecules synthesized per electron transferred to oxygen was similar compared with wild type yeast. It can therefore be inferred that the coupling efficiency within the ATP synthase was mostly unaffected and that the T9176C mutation did not increase the proton permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane.",

     "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorders encompass severe developmental disorders characterized by variable degrees of impairment in language, communication and social skills, as well as by repetitive and stereotypic patterns of behaviour. Substantial percentages of autistic patients display peripheral markers of mitochondrial energy metabolism dysfunction, such as (a) elevated lactate, pyruvate, and alanine levels in blood, urine and/or cerebrospinal fluid, (b) serum carnitine deficiency, and/or (c) enhanced oxidative stress. These biochemical abnormalities are accompanied by highly heterogeneous clinical presentations, which generally (but by no means always) encompass neurological and systemic symptoms relatively unusual in idiopathic autistic disorder. In some patients, these abnormalities have been successfully explained by the presence of specific mutations or rearrangements in their mitochondrial or nuclear DNA. However, in the majority of cases, abnormal energy metabolism cannot be immediately linked to specific genetic or genomic defects. Recent evidence from post-mortem studies of autistic brains points toward abnormalities in mitochondrial function as possible downstream consequences of dysreactive immunity and altered calcium (Ca2+) signalling.",

     "abstract": "Although the functional role of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) remains to be fully elucidated, there is strong evidence that Nnt plays a critical part in mitochondrial metabolism by maintaining a high NADPH-dependant GSH/GSSG ratio, and thus the control of cellular oxidative stress. Using real-time PCR, spectrophotometric and western blotting techniques, we sought to determine the presence, abundance and activity level of Nnt in human heart tissues and to discern whether these are altered in chronic severe heart failure. Left ventricular levels of the NNT gene and protein expression did not differ significantly between the non-failing donor (NF) and heart failure (HF) group. Notably, compared to NF, Nnt activity rates in the HF group were 18% lower, which coincided with significantly higher levels of oxidized glutathione, lower glutathione reductase activity, lower NADPH and a lower GSH/GSSG ratio. In the failing human heart a partial loss of Nnt activity adversely impacts NADPH-dependent enzymes and the capacity to maintain membrane potential, thus contributing to a decline in bioenergetic capacity, redox regulation and antioxidant defense, exacerbating oxidative damage to cellular proteins.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the terminal enzyme of the energy-transducing mitochondrial electron transport chain is a hetero-oligomeric, heme\u2013copper oxidase complex composed of both mitochondrially and nuclear-encoded subunits. It is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it couples the transfer of electrons from reduced cytochrome c to molecular oxygen with vectorial proton translocation across the membrane. The biogenesis of CcO is a complicated sequential process that requires numerous specific accessory proteins, so-called assembly factors, which include translational activators, translocases, molecular chaperones, copper metallochaperones and heme a biosynthetic enzymes. Besides these CcO-specific protein factors, the correct biogenesis of CcO requires an even greater number of proteins with much broader substrate specificities. Indeed, growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases might play an important role in CcO biogenesis. Out of the four identified energy-dependent mitochondrial proteases, three were shown to be directly involved in proteolysis of CcO subunits. In addition to their well-established protein-quality control function these oligomeric proteolytic complexes with chaperone-like activities may function as molecular chaperones promoting productive folding and assembly of subunit proteins. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the functional involvement of eukaryotic CcO-specific assembly factors and highlight the possible significance for CcO biogenesis of mitochondrial ATP-dependent proteases.",

This stimulation of oxidative phosphorylation is in the low magnesium model of seizure-like events accompanied by substantial increase in formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, it has remained unclear which ROS-generating sites can be attributed to this phenomenon. Here, we report stimulatory effects of calcium ions and uncouplers, mimicking mitochondrial activation, on ROS generation of isolated rat and mouse brain mitochondria. Since these stimulatory effects were visible with superoxide sensitive dyes, but with hydrogen peroxide sensitive dyes only in the additional presence of SOD, we conclude that the complex redox properties of the \u2018Qo\u2019 center at respiratory chain complex III are very likely responsible for these observations. In accordance with this hypothesis redox titrations of the superoxide production of antimycin-inhibited submitochondrial particles with the succinate/fumarate redox couple confirmed for brain tissue a bell-shaped dependency with a maximal superoxide production rate at +\u00a010\u00a0mV (pH\u00a0=\u00a07.4). This reflects the complex redox properties of a semiquinone species which is the direct electron donor for oxygen reduction in complex III-dependent superoxide production. Therefore, we conclude that under conditions of increased energy load the complex III site can contribute to superoxide production of brain mitochondria, which might be relevant for epilepsy-related seizure activity.",

     "abstract": "It is now clear that mitochondrial defects are associated with a large variety of clinical phenotypes. This is the result of the mitochondria's central role in energy production, reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and cell death. These processes are interdependent and may occur under various stressing conditions, among which low oxygen levels (hypoxia) are certainly prominent. Cells exposed to hypoxia respond acutely with endogenous metabolites and proteins promptly regulating metabolic pathways, but if low oxygen levels are prolonged, cells activate adapting mechanisms, the master switch being the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Activation of this factor is strictly bound to the mitochondrial function, which in turn is related with the oxygen level. Therefore in hypoxia, mitochondria act as [O2] sensors, convey signals to HIF-1directly or indirectly, and contribute to the cell redox potential, ion homeostasis, and energy production. Although over the last two decades cellular responses to low oxygen tension have been studied extensively, mechanisms underlying these functions are still indefinite. Here we review current knowledge of the mitochondrial role in hypoxia, focusing mainly on their role in cellular energy and reactive oxygen species homeostasis in relation with HIF-1 stabilization. In addition, we address the involvement of HIF-1 and the inhibitor protein of F1F0 ATPase in the hypoxia-induced mitochondrial autophagy.",

Mice with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene have improved glucose tolerance compared to wild-type mice, despite lower fasting plasma insulin levels. Increased SCD activity has been found in insulin-resistant humans and animals, whereas SCD1 deficiency attenuates both diet- and genetically-induced impairment of insulin action. Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues on insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1 and IRS2), and on Akt has been shown to be the major step in insulin signaling that is altered due to the lack of SCD1. In this review we discuss perturbations in cell signaling and lipid metabolism cascades in insulin-sensitive tissues due to SCD1 deficiency. In particular, we address the role of cellular signaling molecules including free fatty acids, ceramides, fatty acyl-CoAs, AMP-activated protein kinase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B as well as of membrane fluidity.

     "abstract": "Recent studies have revealed that mitochondria are able to synthesize fatty acids in a malonyl-CoA/acyl carrier protein (ACP)-dependent manner. This pathway resembles bacterial fatty acid synthesis (FAS) type II, which uses discrete, nuclearly encoded proteins. Experimental evidence, obtained mainly through using yeast as a model system, indicates that this pathway is essential for mitochondrial respiratory function. Curiously, the deficiency in mitochondrial FAS cannot be complemented by inclusion of fatty acids in the culture medium or by products of the cytosolic FAS complex. Defects in mitochondrial FAS in yeast result in the inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources, the loss of mitochondrial cytochromes a/a3 and b, mitochondrial RNA processing defects, and loss of cellular lipoic acid. Eukaryotic FAS II generates octanoyl-ACP, a substrate for mitochondrial lipoic acid synthase. Endogenous lipoic acid synthesis challenges the hypothesis that lipoic acid can be provided as an exogenously supplied vitamin. Purified eukaryotic FAS II enzymes are catalytically active in vitro using substrates with an acyl chain length of up to 16 carbon atoms. However, with the exception of 3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP, a component of respiratory complex I in higher eukaryotes, the fate of long-chain fatty acids synthesized by the mitochondrial FAS pathway remains an enigma. The linkage of FAS II genes to published animal models for human disease supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial FAS dysfunction leads to the development of disorders in mammals.",

MPT was determined by the occurrence of cyclosporin A sensitive mitochondrial membrane potential disruption followed by mitochondrial swelling and Ca2+ release. In in vitro experiments, the effect of NOS inhibitors was dose-dependent (1 to 50\u00a0\u00b5M). In addition to cyclosporin A, L-NAME-induced MPT was sensitive to Mg2+ plus ATP, EGTA, and to a lower degree, to catalase and dithiothreitol. In contrast to L-NAME, its isomer D-NAME did not induce MPT. L-NAME-induced MPT was associated with a significant decrease in both the rate of NO generation and the content of mitochondrial S-nitrosothiol. Acute and chronic in vivo treatment with L-NAME also promoted MPT and decreased the content of mitochondrial S-nitrosothiol. SNAP (a NO donor) prevented L-NAME mediated MPT and reversed the decrease in the rate of NO generation and in the content of S-nitrosothiol.

Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) is a critical event in cell death, as it regulates the degree of mitochondrial dysfunction and the release of intermembrane proteins that function in the activation and assembly of caspases. In addition to the crucial role of proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, the lipid composition of the mitochondrial membranes is increasingly recognized to modulate MMP and hence cell death. The unphysiological accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondrial membranes regulates their physical properties, facilitating or impairing MMP during Bax and death ligand-induced cell death depending on the level of mitochondrial GSH (mGSH), which in turn regulates the oxidation status of cardiolipin. Cholesterol-mediated mGSH depletion stimulates TNF-induced reactive oxygen species and subsequent cardiolipin peroxidation, which destabilizes the lipid bilayer and potentiates Bax-induced membrane permeabilization. These data suggest that the balance of mitochondrial cholesterol to peroxidized cardiolipin regulates mitochondrial membrane properties and permeabilization, emerging as a rheostat in cell death.",

First described by Otto Warburg almost nine decades ago [1], this aberrant phenotype becomes more pronounced with increased tumor malignancy [2]. Thus, while maintaining their capacity for respiration, tumors \u201cturn more parasitic\u201d by enhancing their ability to scavenge glucose from their surroundings. With excess glucose at hand, tumors shunt their metabolic flux more toward glycolysis than do their normal cells of origin, a strategy that allows for their survival when oxygen is limiting while providing them a mechanism to poison their extra-cellular environment with acid, thus paving the way for invasion and metastasis. Significantly, tumors harness a crucial enzyme to regulate and support this destructive path\u2014to entrap and channel glucose toward glycolysis. This enzyme is an isoform of hexokinase, referred to as hexokinase type II, and also in abbreviated form as HK-2 or HK II. Due to many-faceted molecular features at genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, and enzymatic levels, including sub-cellular localization to mitochondria, HK-2 facilitates and promotes the high glycolytic tumor phenotype [3]. Thus, HK-2 represents a pivotal model gene or enzyme that tumors \u201cselect for\u201d during tumorigenesis in order to facilitate their destructive path. In this review, we examine the roles played by mitochondrial bound HK-2 within the context of the highly choreographed metabolic roulette of malignant tumors. Recent studies that outline how the aberrant glycolytic flux can be subverted toward a more \u201cnormal\u201d metabolic phenotype, and how the glycolytic flux affects the tumor microenvironment to facilitate tumor dissemination are also described, including how these very features can be harnessed in new metabolic targeting strategies to selectively debilitate tumors.",

Apoptosis is also involved in many pathologies including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, aging, and infarcts. This cell death program is tightly regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins by controlling the formation of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel or MAC. Assembly of MAC corresponds to permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which is the so called commitment step of apoptosis. MAC provides the pathway through the mitochondrial outer membrane for the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space. While overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 eliminates MAC activity, oligomers of the pro-apoptotic members Bax and/or Bak are essential structural component(s) of MAC. Assembly of MAC from Bax or Bak was monitored in real time by directly patch-clamping mitochondria with micropipettes containing the sentinel tBid, a direct activator of Bax and Bak. Herein, a variety of high affinity inhibitors of MAC (iMAC) that may prove to be crucial tools in mechanistic studies have recently been identified. This review focuses on characterization of MAC activity, its regulation by Bcl-2 family proteins, and a discussion of how MAC can be pharmacologically turned on or off depending on the pathology to be treated.",

Ceramide levels measured in mitochondria early in apoptosis are sufficient to form ceramide channels in the outer membrane. The channels are in dynamic equilibrium with non-conducting forms of ceramide in the membrane. This equilibrium can be strongly influenced by other sphingolipids and Bcl-2 family proteins. The properties of ceramide channels formed in a defined system, planar phospholipid membranes, demonstrate that proteins are not required for channel formation. In addition, experiments in the defined system reveal structural information. The results indicated that the channels are barrel-like structures whose staves are ceramide columns that span the membrane. Ceramide channels are good candidates for the protein release pathway that initiates the execution phase of apoptosis.",

Assuming that this neuroprotection might be associated with inhibition of the apoptotic cascade underlying cell death, we examined a possible effect of ropinirole on the permeability transition pore (mtPTP) in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Using isolated rat liver mitochondria, the effect of ropinirole was studied on Ca2+-triggered large amplitude swelling, membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release. In addition, the effect of ropinirole on oxidation of added, membrane-impermeable NADH was investigated. The results revealed doubtlessly, that ropinirole can inhibit permeability transition. In patch-clamp experiments on mitoplasts, we show directly that ropinirole interacts with the mtPTP. Thus, ropinirole reversibly inhibits the opening of mtPTP with an IC50 of 3.4\u00a0\u00b5M and a Hill coefficient of 1.3. In both systems (i.e. energized mitochondria and mitoplasts) the inhibitory effect on permeability transition was attenuated by increasing concentrations of inorganic phosphate. In addition, we showed with antimycin A-treated mitochondria that ropinirole failed to suppress respiratory chain-linked reactive oxygen species release. In conclusion, our data suggest that the neuroprotective activity of ropinirole is due to the blockade of the Ca2+-triggered permeability transition.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria have been shown to play a pivotal role in apoptotic signalling in various cell types. We have recently reported that in lymphocytes the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3, known to reside in the plasma membrane, is active also in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Upon induction of apoptosis, outer-membrane inserted Bax binds to and inhibits Kv1.3 resulting in hyperpolarization, an increase in reactive oxygen species production and cytochrome c release. In cells lacking Kv1.3 these events do not take place. Here, we present new data which further corroborates an important role of this channel in the sequence of events leading to Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Recombinant Kv1.3, when pre-incubated with Bax, prevents the actions of Bax at the level of mitochondria. Furthermore, we report the presence of Kv1.3 protein in mitochondria from PC3 and MCF-7 cancer cells, suggesting that this channel might play a role in the apoptotic signalling not only in lymphocytes but also in other cells.",

In this work we review the information available about them with the addition of new results. We have compared the human VDACs transformed in a yeast strain lacking the endogenous porin. VDAC1 and 2 are able to complement the lack of porin in mitochondrial respiration and modulation of ROS. VDAC3 has a limited ability to support the mitochondrial respiration and has no influence in the control of ROS production. The over-expression of VDAC isoforms in wild type yeast strain led to a dramatic sensitivity to oxidative stress, especially for VDAC3, and a shorter lifespan in respiratory conditions. Real-time PCR comparison of the isoforms indicated that in HeLa cells VDAC1 is 10 times more abundant than VDAC2 and 100 times than VDAC3. The over-expression of any single isoform caused a 10 times increase of the transcripts of VDAC2 and VDAC3, while VDAC1 is not changed by the over-expression of the other isoforms. Models of VDAC2 and VDAC3 isoform structure showed that they could be made of a 19-strand \u03b2-barrel and an N-terminal sequence with variable features. In this work we show for the first time a functional characterization of VDAC3 in a cellular context.",

It is well known that VDAC transports metabolites across the outer mitochondrial membrane. The simple transport function is indispensable for proper mitochondria functions and, consequently for cell activity, and makes VDAC crucial for a range of cellular processes including ATP rationing, Ca2+ homeostasis and apoptosis execution. Here, we review recent data obtained for Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells used as a model system concerning the putative role of VDAC in communication between mitochondria and the nucleus. The S. cerevisiae VDAC isoform known as VDAC1 (termed here YVDAC) mediates the cytosol reduction/oxidation (redox) state that contributes to regulation of expression and activity of cellular proteins including proteins that participate in protein import into mitochondria and antioxidant enzymes. Simultaneously, copper-and-zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) plays an important role in controlling YVDAC activity and expression levels. Thus, it is proposed that VDAC constitutes an important component of a regulatory mechanism based on the cytosol redox state.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria, central to basic life functions due to their generation of cellular energy, also serve as the venue for cellular decisions leading to apoptosis. A key protein in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which also mediates the exchange of metabolites and energy between the cytosol and the mitochondria. In this study, the functions played by the N-terminal region of VDAC1 and by VDAC1 oligomerization in the release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and subsequent apoptosis were addressed. We demonstrate that cells undergoing apoptosis induced by STS or cisplatin and expressing N-terminally truncated VDAC1 do not release cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo or AIF. Ruthenium red (RuR), AzRu, DIDS and hexokinase-I (HK-I), all known to interact with VDAC, inhibited the release of cytochrome c, Smac/Diablo and AIF, while RuR-mediated inhibition was not observed in cells expressing RuR-insensitive E72Q-VDAC1. These findings suggest that VDAC1 is involved in the release of not only cytochrome c but also of Smac/Diablo and AIF. We also demonstrate that apoptosis induction is associated with VDAC oligomerization, as revealed by chemical cross-linking and monitoring in living cells using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer. Apoptosis induction by STS, H2O2 or selenite augmented the formation of VDAC oligomers several fold. The results show VDAC1 to be a component of the apoptosis machinery and offer new insight into the functions of VDAC1 oligomerization in apoptosis and of the VDAC1 N-terminal domain in the release of apoptogenic proteins as well as into regulation of VDAC by anti-apoptotic proteins, such as HK and Bcl2.",

The 16-stranded Sam50 protein forms part of the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) and shows a clear evolutionary relationship to members of the bacterial Omp85 family. By contrast, the evolution of VDAC and Tom40, both adopting the same fold cannot be traced to any bacterial precursor. This finding is in agreement with the specific function of Tom40 in the TOM complex not existent in the enslaved bacterial precursor cell.

Mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane vesicles isolated from rat hearts were incorporated into bilayer lipid membranes, and single chloride channel currents were measured. The observed chloride channels (n\u00a0=\u00a0112) possessed a wide variation in single channel parameters and sensitivities to ATP. ATP (0.5\u20132\u00a0mmol/l) modulated and/or inhibited the chloride channel activities (n\u00a0=\u00a038/112) in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition effect was irreversible (n\u00a0=\u00a05/93) or reversible (n\u00a0=\u00a015/93). The non-hydrolysable ATP analogue AMP-PNP had a similar inhibition effect as ATP, indicating that phosphorylation did not play a role in the ATP inhibition effect. ATP modulated the gating properties of the channels (n\u00a0=\u00a06/93), decreased the channels' open dwell times and increased the gating transition rates. ATP (0.5\u20132\u00a0mmol/l) without the presence of Mg2+ decreased the chloride channel current (n\u00a0=\u00a012/14), whereas Mg2+ significantly reversed the effect (n\u00a0=\u00a04/4).

This is the first investigation using M-PEA, which employs alternations of actinic light (627-nm peak, 5000\u00a0\u03bcmol photons m\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) and dark intervals, where PF-MR and DF kinetics are respectively recorded, with the added advantages: (a) all kinetics are recorded with high time resolution (starting from 0.01\u00a0ms), (b) the dark intervals' duration can be as short as 0.1\u00a0ms, (c) actinic illumination can be interrupted at different times during the PF transient (recorded up to 300\u00a0s), with the earliest interruption at 0.3\u00a0ms. Analysis of the simultaneous measurements at different water-content-states of H. rhodopensis leaves allowed the comparison and correlation of complementary information on the structure/function of the photosynthetic machinery, which is not destroyed but only inactivated (reversibly) at different degrees; the comparison and correlation helped also to test current interpretations of each signal and advance their understanding.

Pathology of diabetic \u03b2-cells might be reflected by the altered morphology of mitochondrial network. Its characterization is however hampered by the complexity and density of the three-dimensional (3D) mitochondrial tubular networks in these cell types. Conventional confocal microscopy does not provide sufficient axial resolution to reveal the required details; electron tomography reconstruction of these dense networks is still difficult and time consuming. However, mitochondrial network morphology in fixed cells can also be studied by 4Pi microscopy, a laser scanning microscopy technique which provides an \u223c\u00a07-fold improved axial resolution (\u223c\u00a0100\u00a0nm) over conventional confocal microscopy.

Recently, these components have been resolved as quantum yields according to the energy partitioning approach that takes into account the rate constants of every process involved in the quenching mechanisms of excited chlorophylls. In this study a fully extended quantum yield approach and the introduction of novel equations to assess the yields of each NPQ component are presented. Furthermore, a complete analysis of the yield of NPQ in Beta vulgaris exposed to different irradiances has been carried out. In agreement with experimental results here it is shown that the previous approach may amplify the yield of qE component and flatten the quantitative results of fluorescence analysis. Moreover, the significance of taking into account the physiological variability of NPQ for a correct assessment of energy partitioning is demonstrated.",

The 132(S) and 132(R) diastereomers of 132-hydroxyChl a were characterized as major oxidation products (ca. 60%) by TLC on sucrose, UV\u2013vis, 1H, and 13C NMR spectra, as well as fast-atom bombardment MS. A minor amount of the 152-methyl, 173-phytyl ester of Mg-unstable chlorin was identified on the basis of its UV\u2013vis spectrum and reactivity with diazomethane, which converted it to the 131,152-dimethyl, 173-phytyl ester of Mg-purpurin 7. The side products (ca. 10%) were suggested to include the 173-phytyl ester of Mg-purpurin 18, which is known to form easily from the Mg-unstable chlorin. The side products also included two red components with UV\u2013vis spectral features resembling those of pure Chl a enolate anion. Hence, the two red components were assigned to the enolate anions of Chl a and pheophytin a or, alternatively, two different complexes of the Chl a enolate ion with Triton X-100. All the above products characterized by us are included in our published free-radical allomerization mechanism of Chl a, i.e. oxidation by ground-state dioxygen. The HRP clearly accelerated the allomerization process, but it did not produce bilins, that is, open-chain tetrapyrroles, the formation of which would require oxygenolysis of the chlorin macrocycle. In this regard, our results are in discrepancy with the claim by several researchers that \u2018bilirubin-like compounds\u2019 are formed in the HRP-catalyzed oxidation of Chl a. Inspection of the likely reactions that occurred on the distal side of the heme in the active centre of HRP provided a reasonable explanation for the observed catalytic effect of the HRP on the allomerization of Chl. In the active centre of HRP, the imidazole nitrogen of His-42 was considered to play a crucial role in the C-132 deprotonation of Chl a, which resulted in the Chl a enolate ion resonance hybrid. The Chl enolate was then oxidized to the Chl 132-radical while the HRP Compound I was reduced to Compound II.

     "abstract": "The ultrafast caroteonid to chlorophyll a energy transfer dynamics of the isolated fucoxanthin\u2013chlorophyll proteins FCPa and FCPb from the diatom Cyclotella meneghiniana was investigated in a comprehensive study using transient absorption in the visible and near infrared spectral region as well as static fluorescence spectroscopy. The altered oligomerization state of both antenna systems results in a more efficient energy transfer for FCPa, which is also reflected in the different chlorophyll a fluorescence quantum yields. We therefore assume an increased quenching in the higher oligomers of FCPb. The influence of the carotenoid composition was investigated using FCPa and FCPb samples grown under different light conditions and excitation wavelengths at the blue (500\u00a0nm) and red (550\u00a0nm) wings of the carotenoid absorption. The different light conditions yield in altered amounts of the xanthophyll cycle pigments diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin. Since no significant dynamic changes are observed for high light and low light samples, the contribution of the xanthophyll cycle pigments to the energy transfer is most likely negligible. On the contrary, the observed dynamics change drastically for the different excitation wavelengths. The analyses of the decay associated spectra of FCPb suggest an altered energy transfer pathway. For FCPa even an additional time constant was found after excitation at 500\u00a0nm. It is assigned to the intrinsic lifetime of either the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids or more probable the blue absorbing fucoxanthins. Based on our studies we propose a detailed model explaining the different excitation energy transfer pathways in FCPa.",

     "abstract": "In this work we have investigated the effect of a pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutation found in human colon cells, at a functional-molecular level. The mutation results in the amino-acid substitution Tyr19His in subunit I of the human CytcO and it is associated with respiratory deficiency. It was introduced into Rhodobacter sphaeroides, which carries a cytochrome c oxidase (cytochrome aa3) that serves as a model of the mitochondrial counterpart. The residue is situated in the middle of a pathway that is used to transfer substrate protons as well as protons that are pumped across the membrane. The Tyr33His (equivalent residue in the bacterial CytcO) structural variant of the enzyme was purified and its function was investigated. The results show that in the structurally altered CytcO the activity decreased due to slowed proton transfer; proton transfer from an internal proton donor, the highly-conserved Glu286, to the catalytic site was slowed by a factor of \u223c\u00a05, while reprotonation of the Glu from solution was slowed by a factor of \u223c\u00a040. In addition, in the structural variant proton pumping was completely impaired. These results are explained in terms of introduction of a barrier for proton transfer through the D pathway and changes in the coordination of water molecules surrounding the Glu286 residue. The study offers an explanation, at the molecular level, to the link between a specific amino-acid substitution and a pathogenic phenotype identified in human colon cells.",

Using iNOS-transfected HEK 293 cells to achieve regulated intracellular NO production, we determined NO and O2 concentrations and mitochondrial O2 consumption by high-resolution respirometry over a range of O2 concentrations down to nanomolar. Inhibition of respiration by NO was reversible, and complete NO removal recovered cell respiration above its routine reference values. Respiration was observed even at high NO concentrations, and the dependence of IC50 on [O2] exhibits a characteristic but puzzling parabolic shape; both these features imply that CcO is protected from complete inactivation by NO and are likely to be physiologically relevant. We present a kinetic model of CcO inhibition by NO that efficiently predicts experimentally determined respiration at physiological O2 and NO concentrations and under hypoxia, and accurately predicts the respiratory responses under hyperoxia. The model invokes competitive and uncompetitive inhibition by binding of NO to the reduced and oxidized forms of CcO, respectively, and suggests that dissociation of NO from reduced CcO may involve its O2-dependent oxidation. It also explains the non-linear dependence of IC50 on O2 concentration, and the hyperbolic increase of c50 as a function of NO concentration.",

PCC 6803. To test whether additional proteases might be involved in D1 degradation during high rates of photodamage, we have studied the synthesis and degradation of the D1 protein in \u0394PsbO and \u0394PsbV mutants, in which the CaMn4 cluster catalyzing oxygen evolution is less stable, and in the D1 processing mutants, D1-S345P and \u0394CtpA, which are unable to assemble a functional cluster. All four mutants exhibited a dramatically increased rate of D1 degradation in high light compared to the wild-type. Additional inactivation of the ftsH2 gene slowed the rate of D1 degradation dramatically and increased the level of PSII complexes. We conclude that FtsH2 plays a major role in the degradation of both precursor and mature forms of D1 following donor-side photoinhibition. However, this conclusion concerned only D1 assembled into larger complexes containing at least D2 and CP47. In the \u0394psbEFLJ deletion mutant blocked at an early stage in PSII assembly, unassembled D1 protein was efficiently degraded in the absence of FtsH2 pointing to the involvement of other protease(s). Significantly, the \u0394PsbO mutant displayed unusually low levels of cellular chlorophyll at extremely low-light intensities. The possibilities that PSII repair may limit the availability of chlorophyll for the biogenesis of other chlorophyll-binding proteins and that PsbO might have a regulatory role in PSII repair are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The effect of illumination and molecular oxygen on the redox and the redox potential changes of cytochrome b559 (cyt b559) has been studied in Tris-treated spinach photosystem II (PSII) membranes. It has been demonstrated that the illumination of Tris-treated PSII membranes induced the conversion of the intermediate-potential (IP) to the reduced high-potential (HPFe2+) form of cyt b559, whereas the removal of molecular oxygen resulted in the conversion of the IP form to the oxidized high-potential (HPFe3+) form of cyt b559. Light-induced conversion of cyt b559 from the IP to the HP form was completely inhibited above pH 8 or by the modification of histidine ligand that prevents its protonation. Interestingly, no effect of high pH or histidine modification was observed during the conversion of the IP to the HP form of cyt b559 after the removal of molecular oxygen. These results indicate that conversion from the IP to the HP form of cyt b559 proceeds via different mechanisms. Under illumination, conversion of the IP to the HP form of cyt b559 depends primarily on the protonation of the histidine residue, whereas under anaerobic conditions, the conversion of the IP to the HP form of cyt b559 is driven by higher hydrophobicity of the environment around the heme iron resulting from the absence of molecular oxygen.",

The structure of iron-stress-induced A protein (IsiA) is similar to that of CP43, albeit with the difference that IsiA is associated with 15 chlorophylls (Chls), one more than previously assumed. The membrane-spanning helices of IsiA contain hydrophilic residues many of which bind Chl. The optimal structure of the IsiA\u2013PSI supercomplex was inferred by systematically rearranging the IsiA monomers and PSI trimer in relation to each other. For each of the 6,969,600 structural configurations considered, we counted the number of optimal Chl\u2013Chl connections (i.e., cases where Chl-bound Mg atoms are \u2264\u00a025\u00a0\u00c5 apart). Fifty of these configurations were found to have optimal energy-transfer potential. The 50 configurations could be divided into three variants; one of these, comprising 36 similar configurations, was found to be superior to the other configurations in terms of its potential to transfer excitation energy to the reaction centres under low-light conditions and its potential to dissipate excess energy under high-light conditions. Compared to the assumed model [Biochemistry 42 (2003) 3180\u20133188], the new Chl increases by 7% the ability of IsiA to harvest sunlight while the rearrangement of the constituent components of the IsiA\u2013PSI supercomplex increases by 228% the energy-transfer potential. In conclusion, our model allows us to explain how the IsiA\u2013PSI supercomplex may act as an efficient light-harvesting structure under low-light conditions and as an efficient dissipater of excess energy under high-light conditions.",

     "abstract": "During fasting, mice (Mus musculus) undergo daily bouts of torpor, considerably reducing body temperature (Tb) and metabolic rate (MR). We examined females of different laboratory strains (Balb/c, C57/6N, and CD1) to determine whether liver mitochondrial metabolism is actively reduced during torpor. In all strains, we found that state 3 (phosphorylating) respiration rate measured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C was reduced up to 35% during torpor for at least one of the substrates (glutamate and succinate) used to fuel respiration. The extent of this suppression varied and was correlated with Tb at sampling. This suggests that, at the biochemical level, the transition to and from a hypometabolic torpid state is gradual. In fasted non-torpid animals, Tb and MR still fluctuated greatly: Tb dropped by as much as 4\u00a0\u00b0C and MR was reduced up to 25% compared to fed controls. Changes in Tb and MR in fasted, non-torpid animals were correlated with changes in mitochondrial state 3 respiration rate measured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. This suggests that fasting mice may conserve energy even when not torpid by occasionally reducing Tb and mitochondrial oxidative capacity to reduce MR. Furthermore, proton conductance was higher in torpid compared to non-torpid animals when measured at 15\u00a0\u00b0C (the lower limit of torpid Tb). This pattern is similar to that reported previously for daily torpor in Phodopus sungorus.",

The oxidizing equivalents are stored at a (Mn)4Ca cluster, the site of water oxidation. EPR spectroscopy has yielded valuable information on the S states. S2 shows a notable heterogeneity with two spectral forms; a g\u00a0=\u00a02 (S\u00a0=\u00a01/2) multiline, and a g\u00a0=\u00a04.1 (S\u00a0=\u00a05/2) signal.

The fate of the g\u00a0=\u00a04.1 conformation during advancement to S3 is accordingly unknown. We searched for light-induced transient changes in the EPR spectra at temperatures below and above the half-inhibition temperature for the S2 to S3 transition (ca 230\u00a0K). We observed that, above about 220\u00a0K the g\u00a0=\u00a04.1 signal converts to a multiline form prior to advancement to S3. We cannot exclude that the conversion results from visible-light excitation of the Mn cluster itself. The fact however, that the conversion coincides with the onset of the S2 to S3 transition, suggests that it is triggered by the charge-separation process, possibly the oxidation of tyr Z and the accompanying proton relocations. It therefore appears that a configuration of (Mn)4Ca with a low-spin ground state advances to S3.",

Experiments were performed on wild-type enzyme and a mutant in which \u03b2His91 was replaced by Lys (\u03b2H91K). This well-conserved His residue, located in the membrane-spanning domain of the protein, has been suggested to function in proton transfer, and to act as a ligand of the inhibitory Zn2+. The XAFS analysis has identified a Zn2+-binding cluster formed by one Cys, two His, and one Asp/Glu residue, arranged in a tetrahedral geometry. The structure of the site is consistent with the notion that Zn2+ inhibits proton translocation by competing with H+ binding to the His residues. The same cluster of residues with very similar bond lengths best fits the spectra of wild-type transhydrogenase and \u03b2H91K. Evidently, \u03b2His91 is not directly involved in Zn2+ binding.

Lhca4 is the antenna complex of Photosystem I which accommodates the red-most chlorophyll forms and it has been proposed that these chlorophylls can play a role in fluorescence quenching. Here we have compared the fluorescence decay of Lhca4 with that of several Lhca4 mutants that are affected in their red form content. The results show that neither the multi-exponentiality of the decay nor the fluorescence quenching is due to the red forms. The data indicate that Lhca4 exists in multiple conformations. The presence of the red forms, which are very sensitive to changes in the environment, allows to spectrally resolve the different conformations: a \u201cblue\u201d conformation with a short lifetime and a \u201cred\u201d one with a long lifetime. This finding strongly supports the idea that the members of the Lhc family are able to adopt different conformations associated with their light-harvesting and photoprotective roles. The ratio between the conformations is modified by the substitution of lutein by violaxanthin. Finally, it is demonstrated that the red forms cannot be present in the quenched conformation.",

Proton translocation was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and sodium ion transport by 23Na-NMR spectroscopy. Specific inhibitors of complex I (rotenone) and of the dioxygen reductase (KCN) inhibited the proton and the sodium ion transport, but the KCN effect was totally reverted by the addition of menaquinone analogues, indicating that both transports were catalyzed by complex I. We concluded that the coupling ion of the system is the proton and that neither the catalytic reaction nor the establishment of the delta-pH are dependent on sodium, but the presence of sodium increases proton transport. Moreover, studies of NADH oxidation at different sodium concentrations and of proton and sodium transport activities allowed us to propose a model for the mechanism of complex I in which the presence of two different energy coupling sites is suggested.",

     "abstract": "Oxygen consumption in Mn-depleted photosystem II (PSII) preparations under continuous and pulsed illumination is investigated. It is shown that removal of manganese from the water-oxidizing complex (WOC) by high pH treatment leads to a 6-fold increase in the rate of O2 photoconsumption. The use of exogenous electron acceptors and donors to PSII shows that in Mn-depleted PSII preparations along with the well-known effect of O2 photoreduction on the acceptor side of PSII, there is light-induced O2 consumption on the donor side of PSII (nearly 30% and 70%, respectively). It is suggested that the light-induced O2 uptake on the donor side of PSII is related to interaction of O2 with radicals produced by photooxidation of organic molecules. The study of flash-induced O2 uptake finds that removal of Mn from the WOC leads to O2 photoconsumption with maximum in the first flash, and its yield is comparable with the yield of O2 evolution on the third flash measured in the PSII samples before Mn removal. The flash-induced O2 uptake is drastically (by a factor of 1.8) activated by catalytic concentration (5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM, corresponding to 2\u20134 Mn per RC) of Mn2+, while at higher concentrations (>\u00a0100\u00a0\u03bcM) Mn2+ inhibits the O2 photoconsumption (like other electron donors: ferrocyanide and diphenylcarbazide). Inhibitory pre-illumination of the Mn-depleted PSII preparations (resulting in the loss of electron donation from Mn2+) leads to both suppression of flash-induced O2 uptake and disappearance of the Mn-induced activation of the O2 photoconsumption. We assume that the light-induced O2 uptake in Mn-depleted PSII preparations may reflect not only the negative processes leading to photoinhibition but also possible participation of O2 or its reactive forms in the formation of the inorganic core of the WOC.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism of the severe quenching of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence under drought stress was studied in a lichen Physciella melanchla, which contains a photobiont green alga, Trebouxia sp., using a streak camera and a reflection-mode fluorescence up-conversion system. We detected a large 0.31\u00a0ps rise of fluorescence at 715 and 740 nm in the dry lichen suggesting the rapid energy influx to the 715\u2013740 nm bands from the shorter-wavelength Chls with a small contribution from the internal conversion from Soret bands. The fluorescence, then, decayed with time constants of 23 and 112\u00a0ps, suggesting the rapid dissipation into heat through the quencher. The result confirms the accelerated 40\u00a0ps decay of fluorescence reported in another lichen (Veerman et al., 2007 [36]) and gives a direct evidence for the rapid energy transfer from bulk Chls to the longer-wavelength quencher. We simulated the entire PS II fluorescence kinetics by a global analysis and estimated the 20.2\u00a0ns\u2212\u00a01 or 55.0\u00a0ns\u2212\u00a01 energy transfer rate to the quencher that is connected either to the LHC II or to the PS II core antenna. The strong quenching with the 3\u201312 times higher rate compared to the reported NPQ rate, suggests the operation of a new type of quenching, such as the extreme case of Chl-aggregation in LHCII or a new type of quenching in PS II core antenna in dry lichens.",

This means that the protein matrix imposes some stress on the active site resulting in distortion of its structure. The redox potentials calculated for the real active site structure are in a substantially better agreement with the experiment than those calculated for the idealized structure. This shows an important role of the active site distortion in tuning its redox potential. The reference absolute electrode potential of the standard hydrogen electrode is used that accounts for the correction caused by the water surface potential. Electrostatic calculations are performed in the framework of the polarizable solute model. Two dielectric permittivities of the protein are employed: the optical permittivity for calculation of the intraprotein electric field, and the static permittivity for calculation of the dielectric response energy.

     "abstract": "Ascochlorin is an isoprenoid antibiotic that is produced by the phytopathogenic fungus Ascochyta viciae. Similar to ascofuranone, which specifically inhibits trypanosome alternative oxidase by acting at the ubiquinol binding domain, ascochlorin is also structurally related to ubiquinol. When added to the mitochondrial preparations isolated from rat liver, or the yeast Pichia (Hansenula) anomala, ascochlorin inhibited the electron transport via CoQ in a fashion comparable to antimycin A and stigmatellin, indicating that this antibiotic acted on the cytochrome bc1 complex. In contrast to ascochlorin, ascofuranone had much less inhibition on the same activities. On the one hand, like the Qi site inhibitors antimycin A and funiculosin, ascochlorin induced in H. anomala the expression of nuclear-encoded alternative oxidase gene much more strongly than the Qo site inhibitors tested. On the other hand, it suppressed the reduction of cytochrome b and the generation of superoxide anion in the presence of antimycin A3 in a fashion similar to the Qo site inhibitor myxothiazol. These results suggested that ascochlorin might act at both the Qi and the Qo sites of the fungal cytochrome bc1 complex. Indeed, the altered electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape of the Rieske iron\u2013sulfur protein, and the light-induced, time-resolved cytochrome b and c reduction kinetics of Rhodobacter capsulatus cytochrome bc1 complex in the presence of ascochlorin demonstrated that this inhibitor can bind to both the Qo and Qi sites of the bacterial enzyme. Additional experiments using purified bovine cytochrome bc1 complex showed that ascochlorin inhibits reduction of cytochrome b by ubiquinone through both Qi and Qo sites. Moreover, crystal structure of chicken cytochrome bc1 complex treated with excess ascochlorin revealed clear electron densities that could be attributed to ascochlorin bound at both the Qi and Qo sites. Overall findings clearly show that ascochlorin is an unusual cytochrome bc1 inhibitor that acts at both of the active sites of this enzyme.",

Using human embryonic kidney cells transfected with a tetracycline-inducible NO synthase we show that the inactivation of NO by cytochrome c oxidase is dependent on both O2 concentration and electron turnover of the enzyme. At a high O2 concentration (70\u00a0\u03bcM), and while the enzyme is in turnover, NO generated by the NO synthase upon addition of a given concentration of l-arginine is partially inactivated by cytochrome c oxidase and does not affect the redox state of the enzyme or consumption of O2. At low O2 (15\u00a0\u03bcM), when the cytochrome c oxidase is more reduced, inactivation of NO is decreased. In addition, the NO that is not inactivated inhibits the cytochrome c oxidase, further reducing the enzyme and lowering O2 consumption. At both high and low O2 concentrations the inactivation of NO is decreased when sodium azide is used to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase and decrease electron turnover.",

The flavin domain of cytochrome P450-BM3 (BMR) was used as a model electron donor partner. Unlike CYP3A4 oligomers, where only 50% of the enzyme was shown to be reducible by BMR, CYP3A4\u2013ND could be reduced almost completely. High reducibility was also observed in proteoliposomes with a high lipid-to-protein ratio (L/P\u00a0=\u00a0910), where the oligomerization equilibrium is displaced towards monomers. In contrast, the reducibililty in proteoliposomes with L/P\u00a0=\u00a076 did not exceed 55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06%. The effect of the surface density of CYP3A4 in proteoliposomes on the oligomerization equilibrium was confirmed with a FRET-based assay employing a cysteine-depleted mutant labeled on Cys-468 with BODIPY iodoacetamide. These results confirm a pivotal role of CYP3A4 oligomerization in its functional heterogeneity. Furthermore, the investigation of the initial phase of the kinetics of CYP3A4 reduction showed that the addition of NADPH causes a rapid low-to-high-spin transition in the CYP3A4\u2013BMR complex, which is followed by a partial slower reversal. This observation reveals a mechanism whereby the CYP3A4 spin equilibrium is modulated by the redox state of the bound flavoprotein.",

A series of experiments indicated that TeA treatment can induce chloroplast-derived ROS generation including not only 1O2 but also O2\u2212, H2O2 and OH in Eupatorium adenophorum mesophyll cells, resulting from electron leakage and charge recombination in PSII as well as thylakoid overenergization due to inhibition of the PSII electron transport beyond QA and the reduction of end acceptors on the PSI acceptor side and chloroplast ATPase activity. The initial production of TeA-induced ROS was restricted to chloroplasts and accompanied with a certain degree of chloroplast damage. Subsequently, abundant ROS were quickly dispersed throughout whole cell and cellular compartments, causing a series of irreversible cellular harm such as chlorophyll breakdown, lipid peroxidation, plasma membrane rupture, chromatin condensation, DNA cleavage, and organelle disintegration, and finally resulting in rapid cell destruction and leaf necrosis. These results show that TeA causing cell necrosis of host-plants is a result of direct oxidative damage from chloroplast-mediated ROS eruption.",

The novelty of this fold lies in the placement of a Fe4S4 cluster within the hydrophobic core of a four-helix bundle, making it unique among previous iron\u2013sulfur (FeS) protein designs, and different from known natural FeS proteins. The apoprotein, recombinantly expressed and purified from E. coli, readily self-assembles with Fe4S4 clusters in vitro. UV\u2013Vis absorption and CD spectroscopy, elemental analysis, gel filtration, and analytical ultracentrifugation confirm that the protein is folded and assembled as designed, namely, \u03b1-helical coiled-coil binding a single Fe4S4 cluster. Dithionite-reduced holoprotein samples have characteristic rhombic EPR spectra, typical of low-potential, [Fe4S4]+ (S\u00a0=\u00a01/2), with g values of gz,y\u00a0=\u00a0(1.970, 1.975), and gx\u00a0=\u00a02.053. The temperature, and power dependence of the signal intensity were also characteristic of [Fe4S4]+ clusters with very efficient spin relaxation, but almost without any interaction between adjacent clusters. The new design is very promising although optimization is required, particularly for preventing aggregation, and adding second shell interactions to stabilize the reduced state. Its main advantage is its extendibility into a multi-FeS cluster protein by simply duplicating and translating the binding site along the coiled-coil axis. This opens new possibilities for designing protein-embedded redox chains that may be used as \u201cwires\u201d for coupling any given set of redox enzymes.",

     "abstract": "In higher plants, the major part of the xanthophyll cycle pigment violaxanthin (Vx) is non-covalently bound to the main light-harvesting complex of PSII (LHCII). Under saturating light conditions Vx has to be released from its binding site into the surrounding lipid phase, where it is converted to zeaxanthin (Zx) by the enzyme Vx de-epoxidase (VDE). In the present study we investigated the influence of thylakoid lipids on the de-epoxidation of Vx, which was still associated with the LHCII. We isolated LHCII with different concentrations of native, endogenous lipids and Vx by sucrose gradient centrifugation or successive cation precipitation. Analysis of the different LHCII preparations showed that the concentration of LHCII-associated Vx was correlated with the concentration of the main thylakoid lipid monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) associated with the complexes. Decreases in the MGDG content of the LHCII led to a diminished Vx concentration, indicating that a part of the total Vx pool was located in an MGDG phase surrounding the LHCII, whereas another part was bound to the LHCII apoproteins. We further studied the convertibility of LHCII-associated Vx in in-vitro enzyme assays by addition of isolated VDE. We observed an efficient and almost complete Vx conversion in the LHCII fractions containing high amounts of endogenous MGDG.

     "abstract": "Cyanobacteria adapt to varying light conditions by controlling the amount of excitation energy to the photosystems. On the minute time scale this leads to redirection of the excitation energy, usually referred to as state transitions, which involves movement of the phycobilisomes. We have studied short-term light adaptation in isolated heterocysts and intact filaments from the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme ATCC 29133. In N.punctiforme vegetative cells differentiate into heterocysts where nitrogen fixation takes place. Photosystem II is inactivated in the heterocysts, and the abundancy of Photosystem I is increased relative to the vegetative cells. To study light-induced changes in energy transfer to Photosystem I, pre-illumination was made to dark adapted isolated heterocysts. Illumination wavelengths were chosen to excite Photosystem I (708\u00a0nm) or phycobilisomes (560\u00a0nm) specifically. In heterocysts that were pre-illuminated at 708\u00a0nm, fluorescence from the phycobilisome terminal emitter was observed in the 77\u00a0K emission spectrum. However, illumination with 560\u00a0nm light caused quenching of the emission from the terminal emitter, with a simultaneous increase in the emission at 750\u00a0nm, indicating that the 560\u00a0nm pre-illumination caused trimerization of Photosystem I. Excitation spectra showed that 560\u00a0nm pre-illumination led to an increase in excitation transfer from the phycobilisomes to trimeric Photosystem I. Illumination at 708\u00a0nm did not lead to increased energy transfer from the phycobilisome to Photosystem I compared to dark adapted samples. The measurements were repeated using intact filaments containing vegetative cells, and found to give very similar results as the heterocysts. This demonstrates that molecular events leading to increased excitation energy transfer to Photosystem I, including trimerization, are independent of Photosystem II activity.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial disorders are a group of clinically heterogeneous diseases, commonly defined by a lack of cellular energy due to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects. Since the identification of the first human pathological mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in 1988, significant efforts have been spent in cataloguing the vast array of causative genetic defects of these disorders. Currently, more than 250 pathogenic mtDNA mutations have been identified. An ever-increasing number of nuclear DNA mutations are also being reported as the majority of proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism and maintenance are nuclear-encoded. Understanding the phenotypic diversity and elucidating the molecular mechanisms at the basis of these diseases has however proved challenging. Progress has been hampered by the peculiar features of mitochondrial genetics, an inability to manipulate the mitochondrial genome, and difficulties in obtaining suitable models of disease. In this review, we will first outline the unique features of mitochondrial genetics before detailing the diseases and their genetic causes, focusing specifically on primary mtDNA genetic defects. The functional consequences of mtDNA mutations that have been characterised to date will also be discussed, along with current and potential future diagnostic and therapeutic advances.",

The most important systems, cytochrome c oxidase in cellular respiration and photosystem II (PSII) in photosynthesis will here be used as examples to illustrate the power of the quantum chemical tools.

Accordingly, free energy profiles can be constructed both for reduction of molecular oxygen in cytochrome c oxidase and water oxidation in PSII, including O\u2013O bond cleavage and formation, and also proton pumping in cytochrome c oxidase. For the construction of the energy diagrams, the computational results sometimes have to be combined with experimental information, such as reduction potentials and rate constants for individual steps in the reactions.",

     "abstract": "The process of skeletal muscle aging is characterized by a progressive loss of muscle mass and functionality. The underlying mechanisms are highly complex and remain unclear. This study was designed to further investigate the consequences of aging on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in rat gastrocnemius muscle, by comparing young (6\u00a0months) and aged (21\u00a0months) rats. Maximal oxidative phosphorylation capacity was clearly reduced in older rats, while mitochondrial efficiency was unaffected. Inner membrane properties were unaffected in aged rats since proton leak kinetics were identical to young rats. Application of top-down control analysis revealed a dysfunction of the phosphorylation module in older rats, responsible for a dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation under low activities close to in vivo ATP turnover. This dysregulation is responsible for an impaired mitochondrial response toward changes in cellular ATP demand, leading to a decreased membrane potential which may in turn affect ROS production and ion homeostasis. Based on our data, we propose that modification of ANT properties with aging could partly explain these mitochondrial dysfunctions.",

     "abstract": "Acyl carrier proteins of mitochondria (ACPMs) are small (\u223c\u00a010\u00a0kDa) acidic proteins that are homologous to the corresponding central components of prokaryotic fatty acid synthase complexes. Genomic deletions of the two genes ACPM1 and ACPM2 in the strictly aerobic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica resulted in strains that were not viable or retained only trace amounts of assembled mitochondrial complex I, respectively. This suggested different functions for the two proteins that despite high similarity could not be complemented by the respective other homolog still expressed in the deletion strains. Remarkably, the same phenotypes were observed if just the conserved serine carrying the phosphopantethein moiety was exchanged with alanine. Although this suggested a functional link to the lipid metabolism of mitochondria, no changes in the lipid composition of the organelles were found. Proteomic analysis revealed that both ACPMs were tightly bound to purified mitochondrial complex I. Western blot analysis revealed that the affinity tagged ACPM1 and ACPM2 proteins were exclusively detectable in mitochondrial membranes but not in the mitochondrial matrix as reported for other organisms. Hence we conclude that the ACPMs can serve all their possible functions in mitochondrial lipid metabolism and complex I assembly and stabilization as subunits bound to complex I.",

In this study, a purified PSII complex which was deprived of major components of FCP was isolated by one step of anion exchange chromatography from the crude PSII treated with Triton X-100. The purified PSII was still associated with the five extrinsic proteins of PsbO, PsbQ', PsbV, Psb31 and PsbU, and showed a high oxygen-evolving activity of 2135\u00a0\u03bcmol O2 (mg Chl a)\u2212\u00a01 h\u2212\u00a01 in the presence of phenyl-p-benzoquinone which was virtually independent of the addition of CaCl2. This activity is more than 2.5-fold higher than the activity of the crude PSII. The activity was completely inhibited by 3-(3,4)-dichlorophenyl-(1,1)-dimethylurea (DCMU). The purified PSII contained 42 molecules of Chl a, 2 molecules of diadinoxanthin and 2 molecules of Chl c on the basis of two molecules of pheophytin a, and showed typical absorption and fluorescence spectra similar to those of purified PSIIs from the other organisms. In this study, we also found that the crude PSII was significantly labile, as a significant inactivation of oxygen evolution, chlorophyll bleaching and degradation of PSII subunits were observed during incubation at 25\u00a0\u00b0C in the dark. In contrast, these inactivation, bleaching and degradation were scarcely detected in the purified PSII. Thus, we succeeded for the first time in preparation of a stable PSII from diatom cells.",

Here, age-related differences in mitochondrial respiration were measured in both whole and permeabilized neurons from 9-month and 24-month adult rat cortex cultured in common conditions. After permeabilization, respiration increased in both ages of neurons with excess substrates. To dissect specific deficiencies in the respiratory chain, inhibitors for each respiratory chain complex were used to isolate their contributions. Relative to neurons from 9-month rats, in neurons isolated from 24-month rats, complexes I, III, and IV were more sensitive to selective inhibition. Flux control point analysis identified complex I in neurons isolated from 24-month rats as the most sensitive to endogenous substrate availability. The greatest age-related deficit in flux capacity occurred at complex IV with a 29% decrease in neurons isolated from 24-month rats relative to those from 9-month rats. The deficits in complexes I and III may contribute to a redox shift in the quinone pool within the electron transport chain, further extending these age-related deficits. Together these changes could lead to an age-related catastrophic decline in energy production and neuronal death.",

These conditions induce the generation of a transient NPQ, which relaxes in the light in parallel with the activation of the Calvin cycle. Wild-type plants were compared with a CMSII mitochondrial mutant, which lacks the respiratory complex I and shows a delayed activation of photosynthesis. In the mutant, a slower onset of photosynthesis was mirrored by a decreased capacity to develop NPQ. This correlates with a reduced efficiency to reroute electrons at the PSI reducing side towards cyclic electron flow around PSI and/or other alternative acceptor pools, and with a smaller ability to generate a proton motive force in the light. Altogether, these data illustrate the tight relationship existing between the capacity to evacuate excess electrons accumulated in the intersystem carriers and the capacity to dissipate excess photons during a dark to light transition. These data also underline the essential role of respiration in modulating the photoprotective response in dark-adapted leaves, by poising the cellular redox state.",

Polyphenols being more than just anti-oxidants, the interaction of these derivatives with the organelles needs to be characterised. We have studied the effects of two quercetin derivatives, 3-(4-O-triphenylphosphoniumbutyl)quercetin iodide (Q3BTPI) and its tetracetylated analogue (QTA3BTPI), on the inner membrane aspecific permeability, transmembrane voltage difference and respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria. While the effects of low concentrations were too small to be reliably defined, when used in the 5\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM range these compounds acted as inducers of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), an effect due to pro-oxidant activity. Furthermore, Q3BTPI behaved as an uncoupler of isolated mitochondria, causing depolarisation and stimulating oxygen consumption. When applied to tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM)-loaded HepG2 or Jurkat cells uptake of the compounds was predictably associated with a loss of TMRM fluorescence, but there was no indication of MPT induction. A production of superoxide could be detected in some cells upon prolonged incubation of MitoSOX\u00ae-loaded cells with QTA3BTPI. The overall effects of these model mitochondriotropic polyphenols may thus differ considerably depending on whether their hydroxyls are protected or not and on the experimental system.

It is shown that all Lhca complexes have a red-shifted fluorescence emission as compared to the antenna complexes of Photosystem II, similar to Lhca from higher plants, but less red-shifted. Three complexes, namely Lhca2, Lhca4 and Lhca9, exhibit emission maxima above 707\u00a0nm and all carry an asparagine as ligand for Chl 603. The comparison of the protein sequences and the biochemical/spectroscopic properties of the refolded Chlamydomonas complexes with those of the well-characterized Arabidopsis thaliana Lhcas shows that all the Chlamydomonas complexes have a chromophore organization similar to that of A. thaliana antennas, particularly to Lhca2, despite low sequence identity.

The genome of G. sulfurreducens encodes a family of five 10-kDa, three-heme cytochromes c7. The sequence identity between the five proteins (designated PpcA, PpcB, PpcC, PpcD, and PpcE) varies between 45% and 77%. Here, we report the high-resolution structures of PpcC, PpcD, and PpcE determined by X-ray diffraction. This new information made it possible to compare the sequences and structures of the entire family. The triheme cores are largely conserved but are not identical. We observed changes, due to different crystal packing, in the relative positions of the hemes between two molecules in the crystal. The overall protein fold of the cytochromes is similar. The structure of PpcD differs most from that of the other homologs, which is not obvious from the sequence comparisons of the family. Interestingly, PpcD is the only cytochrome c7 within the family that has higher abundance when G. sulfurreducens is grown on insoluble Fe(III) oxide compared to ferric citrate. The structures have the highest degree of conservation around \u201cheme IV\u201d; the protein surface around this heme is positively charged in all of the proteins, and therefore all cytochromes c7 could interact with similar molecules involving this region. The structures and surface characteristics of the proteins near the other two hemes, \u201cheme I\u201d and \u201cheme III\u201d, differ within the family. The above observations suggest that each of the five cytochromes c7 could interact with its own redox partner via an interface involving the regions of heme I and/or heme III; this provides a possible rationalization for the existence of five similar proteins in G. sulfurreducens.",

Immunoblotting analysis showed that T2 up-regulated the expression of several subunits (\u03b1, \u03b2, FoI-PVP and OSCP) of the ATP synthase. The observed increase of \u03b2-subunit mRNA accumulation suggested a T2-mediated nuclear effect. Then, the molecular basis underlying T2 effects was investigated. Our results support the notion that the \u03b2-subunit of ATP synthase is indirectly regulated by T2 through, at least in part, the activation of the transcription factor GA-binding protein/nuclear respiratory factor-2. These findings provide new insights into the T2 role on bioenergetic mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Cyanobacteria are capable of using dissipation of phycobilisome-absorbed energy into heat as part of their photoprotective strategy. Non-photochemical quenching in cyanobacteria cells is triggered by absorption of blue-green light by the carotenoid-binding protein, and involves quenching of phycobilisome fluorescence. In this study, we find direct evidence that the quenching is accompanied by a considerable reduction of energy flow to the photosystems. We present light saturation curves of photosystems\u2019 activity in quenched and non-quenched states in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In the quenched state, the quantum efficiency of light absorbed by phycobilisomes drops by about 30\u201340% for both photoreactions\u2014P700 photooxidation in the photosystem II-less strain and photosystem II fluorescence induction in the photosystem I-less strain of Synechocystis. A similar decrease of the excitation pressure on both photosystems leads us to believe that the core\u2013membrane linker allophycocyanin APC-LCM is at or beyond the point of non-photochemical quenching. We analyze 77 K fluorescence spectra and suggest that the quenching center is formed at the level of the short-wavelength allophycocyanin trimers.

     "abstract": "The main function of mitochondria is energy transduction, from substrate oxidation to the free energy of ATP synthesis, through oxidative phosphorylation. For physiological reasons, the degree of coupling between these two processes must be modulated in order to adapt redox potential and ATP turnover to cellular needs. Such a modulation leads to energy wastage. To this day, two energy wastage mechanisms have been described: the membrane passive proton conductance (proton leak) and the decrease in the coupling efficiency between electrons transfer and proton extrusion at the proton pumps level (redox or proton slipping). In this paper, we describe a new energy wastage mechanism of interest. We show that in isolated yeast mitochondria, the membrane proton conductance is strictly dependent on the external dehydrogenases activity. An increase in their activity leads to an increase in the membrane proton conductance. This proton permeability is independent of the respiratory chain and ATP synthase proton pumps. We propose to name this new mechanism \u201cactive proton leak.\u201d Such a mechanism could allow a wide modulation of substrate oxidation in response to cellular redox constraints.",

     "abstract": "Flavodoxin (Fld) replaces Ferredoxin (Fd) as electron carrier from Photosystem I (PSI) to Ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR). A number of Anabaena Fld (AnFld) variants with replacements at the interaction surface with FNR and PSI indicated that neither polar nor hydrophobic residues resulted critical for the interactions, particularly with FNR. This suggests that the solvent exposed benzenoid surface of the Fld FMN cofactor might contribute to it. FMN has been replaced with analogues in which its 7- and/or 8-methyl groups have been replaced by chlorine and/or hydrogen. The oxidised Fld variants accept electrons from reduced FNR more efficiently than Fld, as expected from their less negative midpoint potential. However, processes with PSI (including reduction of Fld semiquinone by PSI, described here for the first time) are impeded at the steps that involve complex re-arrangement and electron transfer (ET). The groups introduced, particularly chlorine, have an electron withdrawal effect on the pyrazine and pyrimidine rings of FMN. These changes are reflected in the magnitude and orientation of the molecular dipole moment of the variants, both factors appearing critical for the re-arrangement of the finely tuned PSI:Fld complex. Processes with FNR are also slightly modulated. Despite the displacements observed, the negative end of the dipole moment points towards the surface that contains the FMN, still allowing formation of complexes competent for efficient ET. This agrees with several alternative binding modes in the FNR:Fld interaction. In conclusion, the FMN in Fld not only contributes to the redox process, but also to attain the competent interaction of Fld with FNR and PSI.",

In order to study the functions of these two subunits from a structural point of view, we constructed deletion mutants lacking either Ycf12 or PsbZ from Thermosynechococcus elongatus, and purified, crystallized and analyzed the structure of PSII dimer from the two mutants. Our results showed that Ycf12 is located in the periphery of PSII, close to PsbK, PsbZ and PsbJ, and corresponded to the unassigned helix X1 reported previously, in agreement with the recent structure at 2.9\u00a0\u00c5 resolution (A. Guskov, J. Kern, A. Gabdulkhakov, M. Broser, A. Zouni, W. Saenger, Cyanobacterial photosystem II at 2.9\u00a0\u00c5 resolution: role of quinones, lipids, channels and chloride, Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 16 (2009) 334\u2013342). On the other hand, crystals of PsbZ-deleted PSII showed a remarkably different unit cell constants from those of wild-type PSII, indicating a role of PsbZ in the interactions between PSII dimers within the crystal. This is the first example for a different arrangement of PSII dimers within the cyanobacterial PSII crystals. PSII dimers had a lower oxygen-evolving activity from both mutants than that from the wild type. In consistent with this, the relative content of PSII in the thylakoid membranes was lower in the two mutants than that in the wild type. These results suggested that deletion of both subunits affected the PSII activity, thereby destabilized PSII, leading to a decrease in the PSII content in vivo. While PsbZ was present in PSII purified from the Ycf12-deletion mutant, Ycf12 was present in crude PSII but absent in the finally purified PSII from the PsbZ-deletion mutant, indicating a preferential, stabilizing role of PsbZ for the binding of Ycf12 to PSII.

     "abstract": "Protein thiolation by glutathione is a reversible and regulated post-translational modification that is increased in response to oxidants and nitric oxide. Because many mitochondrial enzymes contain critical thiol residues, it has been hypothesized that thiolation reactions regulate cell metabolism and survival. However, it has been difficult to differentiate the biological effects due to protein thiolation from other oxidative protein modifications. In this study, we used diamide to titrate protein glutathiolation and examined its impact on glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and cell death in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. Treatment of cells with diamide increased protein glutathiolation in a concentration-dependent manner and had comparably little effect on protein\u2013protein disulfide formation. Diamide increased mitochondrial proton leak and decreased ATP-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption and cellular bioenergetic reserve capacity. Concentrations of diamide above 200 \u03bcM promoted acute bioenergetic failure and caused cell death, whereas lower concentrations of diamide led to a prolonged increase in glycolytic flux and were not associated with loss of cell viability. Depletion of glutathione using buthionine sulfoximine had no effect on basal protein thiolation or cellular bioenergetics but decreased diamide-induced protein glutathiolation and sensitized the cells to bioenergetic dysfunction and death. The effects of diamide on cell metabolism and viability were fully reversible upon addition of dithiothreitol. These data suggest that protein thiolation modulates key metabolic processes in both the mitochondria and cytosol.",

Analysis of post-flash electron distribution in such systems can provide useful information about the contribution of individual reactions to the overall electron flow. In Rba. capsulatus, the non-functional low-potential forms of cytochrome c1 which are devoid of the disulfide bond naturally present in this protein revert spontaneously by introducing a second-site suppression (mutation A181T) that brings the potential of heme c1 back to the functionally high levels, yet maintains it some 100\u00a0mV lower from the native value. Here we report that the disulfide and the mutation A181T can coexist in one protein but the mutation exerts a dominant effect on the redox properties of heme c1 and the potential remains at the same lower value as in the disulfide-free form. This establishes effective means to modify a barrier for electron transfer between the FeS cluster and heme c1 without breaking disulfide. A comparison of the flash-induced electron transfers in native and mutated cytochrome bc1 revealed significant differences in the post-flash equilibrium distribution of electrons only when the connection of the chains with the quinone pool was interrupted at the level of either of the catalytic sites by the use of specific inhibitors, antimycin or myxothiazol. In the non-inhibited system no such differences were observed. We explain the results using a kinetic model in which a shift in the equilibrium of one reaction influences the equilibrium of all remaining reactions in the cofactor chains. It follows a rather simple description in which the direction of electron flow through the coupled chains of cytochrome bc1 exclusively depends on the rates of all reversible partial reactions, including the Q/QH2 exchange rate to/from the catalytic sites.",

In the present work spectroscopic aspects of the CO inhibition for this bacterial organism are reported for the first time and enable a direct comparison with the existing crystallographic data. The binding affinity of each specific redox state for CO is probed by FTIR spectro-electrochemistry. It is shown that only the physiological state Ni\u2013SIa reacts with CO. The CO-inhibited product state is EPR-silent (Ni2+) and exists in two forms, Ni\u2013SCO and Ni\u2013SCOred. At very negative potentials, the exogenous CO is electrochemically detached from the active site and the active Ni\u2013R states are obtained. At temperatures below 100 K, photodissociation of the extrinsic CO from the Ni\u2013SCO state results in Ni\u2013SIa that is identified to be the only light-induced state. In the dark, rebinding of CO takes place; the recombination rate constants are of biexponential character and the activation barrier is determined to be approximately 9 kJ mol\u22121. In addition, formation of a paramagnetic CO-inhibited state (Ni\u2013CO) was observed that results from the interaction of carbon monoxide with the Ni\u2013L state.

Here, we investigated whether UCP1 expressed under the control of the human skeletal actin (HSA) promoter in mouse skeletal muscle can be regulated, and whether it affects mitochondrial superoxide production. We show that the skeletal muscle UCP1 can be fully inhibited by a purine nucleotide (GDP) and reactivated by fatty acids (palmitate). During mitochondrial resting state (State 4), mitochondrial superoxide production is about 76% lower in transgenic mice. We suggest that this reduction is due to uncoupling activity as the administration of GDP restores superoxide production to wildtype levels. Our study confirms native behaviour of UCP1 in skeletal muscle and demonstrates beneficial effects on prevention of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production which may reduce age-related deleterious processes.",

Mitochondria can contribute to neuronal cell death and axonal dysfunction through a plethora of mechanisms, including low ATP levels, increased reactive oxygen species, defective calcium regulation, and impairment of dynamics and transport. Recently, mitochondrial proteases in the inner mitochondrial membrane have emerged as culprits in several human neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial proteases degrade misfolded and non-assembled polypeptides, thus performing quality control surveillance in the organelle. Moreover, they regulate the activity of specific substrates by mediating essential processing steps. Mitochondrial proteases may be directly involved in neurodegenerative diseases, as recently shown for the m-AAA protease, or may regulate crucial mitochondrial molecules, such as OPA1, which in turn is implicated in human disease. The mitochondrial proteases HTRA2 and PARL increase the susceptibility of neurons to apoptotic cell death.

We have compared steady state absorption and photo-induced difference spectra at <\u00a010\u00a0K of PSII containing either D1:1 or D1:3. The following differences were observed. (i) The pheophytin Qx band was red-shifted in D1:3 (547.3\u00a0nm) compared to D1:1 (544.3\u00a0nm). (ii) The electrochromism on the PheoD1 Qx band induced by QA\u2212 (the C550 shift) was more asymmetric in D1:3. (iii) The two variants differed in their responses to excitation with far red (704\u00a0nm) light. When green light was used there was little difference between the two variants. With far red light the stable (t1/2\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0ms) QA\u2212 yield was \u223c\u00a095% in D1:3, and \u223c\u00a060% in D1:1, relative to green light excitation. (iv) For the D1:1 variant, the quantum efficiency of photo-induced oxidation of side-pathway donors was lower. These effects can be correlated with amino acid changes between the two D1 variants. The effects on the pheophytin Qx band can be attributed to the hydrogen bond from Glu130 in D1:3 to the 131-keto of PheoD1, which is absent for Gln130 in D1:1. The reduced yield with red light in the D1:1 variant could be associated with either the Glu130Gln change, and/or the four changes near the binding site of PD1, in particular Ser153Ala. Photo-induced QA\u2212 formation with far red light is assigned to the direct optical excitation of a weakly absorbing charge transfer state of the reaction centre. We suggest that this state is blue-shifted in the D1:1 variant. A reduced efficiency for the oxidation of side-pathway donors in the D1:1 variant could be explained by a variation in the location and/or redox potential of P+.",

     "abstract": "Alternative oxidase (AOX) is a quinol-oxygen oxidoreductase, which is known to possess a dicarboxylate diiron reaction center held in structurally postulated \u03b1-helical bundle. However, little is known about the structural or functional features of its N-terminal region in any organism, with the exception of a regulatory cysteine residue (CysI) in angiosperm plants. Here, we show that transcripts of two AOX1 isozymes (AcoAOX1a and AcoAOX1b) are coexpressed in thermogenic appendices of Arum concinnatum, while their enzymatic activities seem to be distinct. Namely, AcoAOX1a, an abundantly expressed transcript in vivo, shows an apparent cyanide-insensitive and n-propyl gallate-sensitive respiration during ectopic expression of the protein in HeLa cells, whereas AcoAOX1b exhibits a lower transcript expression, and appears to be totally inactive as AOX at the protein level. Our functional analyses further reveal that an E83K substitution in AcoAOX1b, which is located far upstream of CysI in the N-terminal region, is the cause of this loss of function. These results suggest the presence of a naturally occurring inactive AOX homologue in thermogenic plants. Accordingly, our results further imply that the N-terminal region of the AOX protein functionally contributes to the dynamic activities of respiratory control within the mitochondria.",

To better understand the role of mitochondria and their involvement in the pathogenic mechanisms of cancer development, the effects of cancer mitochondria were investigated in a defined nuclear background using a transmitochondrial cybrid system. Our results demonstrated that cancer mitochondria confer a significant reduction in cell growth when cells are metabolically stressed in a galactose medium. Activities of the respiratory chain complexes, cellular oxygen consumption, and ATP synthesis rates were found to be much lower in breast cancer cells, than those in normal breast epithelial cells of MCF-10A (10A). These results suggest that there is reduced mitochondrial function in the studied breast cancer cell lines. Similarly reduced mitochondrial function was observed in cybrids containing cancer mitochondria. Novel tRNA mutations were also identified in two breast cancer cell lines, possibly responsible for the observed mitochondrial dysfunction. We conclude that altered mitochondria in cancer cells may play a crucial role in tumor development.",

As the targeted pathogens have developed resistance to this drug there is an urgent need for new alternatives. To better understand the determinants of inhibitor binding in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the bc1 complex we synthesized a series of hydroxy-naphthoquinones bearing a methyl group on the benzene ring that is predicted to interact with the nuclear encoded Rieske iron\u2013sulfur protein.

We have tested these new 2-hydroxy-naphthoquinones against yeast and bovine cytochrome bc1 complexes to model the interaction with pathogen and human enzymes and determine parameters that affect efficacy of binding of these inhibitors.

The oxygenic photosynthetic chain can function following two different modes: the linear electron flow which produces reducing power and ATP, and the cyclic electron flow which only produces ATP. Some regulation between the linear and cyclic flows is required for adjusting the stoichiometric production of high-energy bonds and reducing power. Here we explore, in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the onset of the cyclic electron flow during a continuous illumination under aerobic conditions. In mutants devoid of Rubisco or ATPase, where the reducing power cannot be used for carbon fixation, we observed a stimulation of the cyclic electron flow. The present data show that the cyclic electron flow can operate under aerobic conditions and support a simple competition model where the excess reducing power is recycled to match the demand for ATP.",

We also examined whether the effects induced by BAXoligo or by BAXmono activated with tcBID depended on induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition. The results obtained in this study revealed that tcBID plus BAXmono produced BAX insertion and Cyt c release without overt changes in mitochondrial morphology. On the contrary, treatment of mitochondria with BAXoligo resulted in BAX insertion and Cyt c release, which were accompanied by gross distortion of mitochondrial morphology. The effects of BAXoligo could be at least partially suppressed by mitochondrial depolarization. The effects of tcBID plus BAXmono were insensitive to depolarization. BAXoligo produced similar BAX insertion, mitochondrial remodeling, and Cyt c release in KCl- and in N-methyl-d-glucamine-based incubation media indicating a non-essential role for K+ influx into mitochondria in these processes. A combination of cyclosporin A and ADP, inhibitors of the mitochondrial permeability transition, attenuated Cyt c release, mitochondrial remodeling, and depolarization induced by BAXoligo, but failed to influence the effects produced by tcBID plus BAXmono. Thus, our results suggest a significant difference in the mechanisms of the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and Cyt c release induced by detergent-oligomerized BAXoligo and by BAX activated with tcBID.",

     "abstract": "Gradual heating of green leaves up to non-physiological temperatures is often used to estimate thermal stability of photosynthetic apparatus. However, a complete sequence of heat-induced disassembly and denaturation of chlorophyll-containing protein complexes (CPCs) has not been reported yet. In this work, we heated (1\u00a0\u00b0C\u00b7min\u2212\u00a01) barley leaves to temperatures selected according to the changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence temperature curve (FTC) and we analyzed CPC stability by two-dimensional native Deriphat/SDS\u2013PAGE. The first distinct change in both structure and function of photosystem II (PSII) appeared at 40\u201350\u00a0\u00b0C. PSII core (CCII) dimers began to dissociate monomers, which was accompanied by a decrease in PSII photochemistry and reflected in FTC as the first fluorescence increase. Further changes in CPCs appeared at 57\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C, when FTC increases to its second maximum. Photosystem I (PSI) cores (CCI) partially dissociated from light-harvesting complexes of PSI (LHCI) and formed aggregates. The rest of CCI\u2013LHCI complexes, as well as the CCI aggregates, degraded to the PSI-A/B heterodimer in leaves heated to 70\u00a0\u00b0C. Heating to these temperatures led to a complete degradation of CCII components and corresponding loss of PSII photochemistry. Trimeric light-harvesting complexes of PSII (LHCII) markedly dissociated to monomers and denatured, as evidenced by a release of large amount of free chlorophylls. Between 70 and 80\u00a0\u00b0C, a complete degradation of LHCII occurred, leaving the PSI-A/B heterodimer as the only detectable CPC in the membrane. This most thermostable CPC disappeared after heating to 90\u00a0\u00b0C, which corresponded to a loss of PSI photochemistry.",

Here we utilize a novel KCa channel activator, NS11021, to examine the role of mitoKCa in regulating mitochondrial function by measuring K+ flux, membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), light scattering, and respiration in guinea pig heart mitochondria. K+ uptake and the influence of anions were assessed in mitochondria loaded with the K+ sensor PBFI by adding either the chloride (KCl), acetate (KAc), or phosphate (KH2PO4) salts of K+ to energized mitochondria in a sucrose-based medium. K+ fluxes saturated at \u223c\u00a010\u00a0mM for each salt, attaining maximal rates of 172\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017, 54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4, and 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0nmol K+/min/mg in KCl, KAc, or KH2PO4, respectively. NS11021 (50\u00a0nM) increased the maximal K+ uptake rate by 2.5-fold in the presence of KH2PO4 or KAc and increased mitochondrial volume, with little effect on \u0394\u03a8m. In KCl, NS11021 increased K+ uptake by only 30% and did not increase volume. The effects of NS11021 on K+ uptake were inhibited by the KCa toxins charybdotoxin (200\u00a0nM) or paxilline (1\u00a0\u03bcM). Fifty nanomolar of NS11021 increased the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR) in KH2PO4, but not in KCl; however, above 1\u00a0\u03bcM, NS11021 decreased RCR and depolarized \u0394\u03a8m. A control compound lacking KCa activator properties did not increase K+ uptake or volume but had similar nonspecific (toxin-insensitive) effects at high concentrations. The results indicate that activating K+ flux through mitoKCa mediates a beneficial effect on energetics that depends on mitochondrial swelling with maintained \u0394\u03a8m.",

While genes coding for UCPs have been identified in plants and animals, evidences for the presence of UCPs in fungi and protozoa are only functional. Here, it is reported that in the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica there is a fatty acid-promoted and GDP-sensitive uncoupling activity indicating the presence of a UCP. The uncoupling activity is higher in the stationary phase than in the mid-log growth phase. The in silico search on the Y. lipolytica genome led to the selection of two genes with the highest homology to the UCP family, XM_503525 and XM_500457. By phylogenetic analysis, XP_503525 was predicted to be an oxaloacetate carrier while XP_500457 would be a dicarboxylate carrier. Each of these two genes was cloned and heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the resulting phenotype was analyzed. The transport activity of the two gene products confirmed the phylogenetic predictions. In addition, only mitochondria isolated from yeasts expressing XP_503525 showed bioenergetic properties characteristic of a UCP: the proton conductance was increased by linoleic acid and inhibited by GDP. It is concluded that the XM_503525 gene from Y. lipolytica encodes for an oxaloacetate carrier although, remarkably, it also displays an uncoupling activity stimulated by fatty acids and inhibited by nucleotides.",

The histidine residues introduced had no apparent effect on photoautotrophic growth of the cells or the activity of PSI and PSII in thylakoid membranes.

Blue-Native PAGE and SDS-PAGE analysis of monomers and trimers indicated the existence of two distinct monomers with different subunit compositions and no contamination of PSI with other complexes, such as PSII and Cyt b6f. Further analysis of proteins and lipids in the purified PSI indicated the presence of novel proteins in the monomers and about six lipid molecules per monomer unit in the trimers.

For these purposes, we performed experiments using Photosystem I core samples isolated from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii wild type, and two mutants in which the methionine axial ligand to primary electron acceptor, A0, has been change to either histidine or serine. The temporal evolution of fluorescence spectra was recorded for each preparation under conditions where the \u201cprimary electron donor,\u201d P700, was either neutral or chemically pre-oxidized to P700+. For all the preparations under study, and under neutral and oxidizing conditions, we observed multiexponential fluorescence decay with the major phases of \u223c\u00a07 ps and \u223c\u00a025 ps. The relative amplitudes and, to a minor extent the lifetimes, of these two phases were modulated by the redox state of P700 and by the mutations near A0: both pre-oxidation of P700 and mutations caused slight deceleration of the excited state decay. These results are consistent with a model in which P700 is not the primary electron donor, but rather a secondary electron donor, with the primary charge separation event occurring between the accessory chlorophyll, A, and A0. We assign the faster phase to the equilibration process between the excited state of the antenna/reaction center ensemble and the primary radical pair, and the slower phase to the secondary electron transfer reaction. The pre-oxidation of P700 shifts the equilibrium between the excited state and the primary radical pair towards the excited state. This shift is proposed to be induced by the presence of the positive charge on P700+. The same charge is proposed to be responsible for the fast A+A0\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a0AA0 charge recombination to the ground state and, in consequence, excitation quenching in closed reaction centers. Mutations of the A0 axial ligand shift the equilibrium in the same direction as pre-oxidation of P700 due to the up-shift of the free energy level of the state A+A0\u2212.",
