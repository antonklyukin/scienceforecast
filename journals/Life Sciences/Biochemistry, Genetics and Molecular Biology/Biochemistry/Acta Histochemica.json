     "abstract": "Because of the wide variety of cells which are arrayed in the tissue of the gastrointestinal tracts of these two fish, basic histological examination is not appropriate to clarify the histological structure. But histochemical techniques can be applied to identify the chemical differences contained in the tissues. The present study aimed to compare the histochemical characteristics of the gastrointestinal tracts of adult fishes which consume different types of food: the Nile tilapia is herbivore and the hybrid catfish is carnivore. The esophagus, stomach and intestine of each fish was stained with 1) Masson\u2019s trichrome, for the muscular and connective tissues, 2) Periodic acid Schiff, for neutral mucin, 3) Alcian blue pH 2.5 and pH 1.0, for acid and sulfated acid mucin. The neutral and acid mucins were observed in the esophagus of the tilapia and catfish but sulfated acid mucin was found only in the catfish. Both neutral and acid mucins presented in the stomach of the tilapia, whereas the stomach of the catfish contained only the neutral mucin although it is contained more collagen in the submucosa. The tilapia intestine revealed that neutral and acid mucins were presented throughout the tissue, and small amounts of sulfated acid mucin were observed in the anterior intestine. However, sulfated acid mucin was very obviously located in posterior intestine of the catfish. Moreover, all parts of the catfish intestine showed both neutral and acid mucins with a thick collagen layer in the submucosa. This research will be useful for understanding the physiology of the relevant digestive systems and making a diagnosis of some gastrointestinal diseases in these two fish.",

     "abstract": "Dp71 is the major form of dystrophins (Dp) in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and in the neural lobe of hypophysis (NL/HP). Dp71-null mice exhibit a hypo-osmolar status attributed to an altered osmosensitivity of the SON and to a perturbed vasopressinergic axis. Because oxytocin (OT) is implicated in osmoregulation via natriuresis, this study explored the oxytocinergic axis in Dp71-null mice after salt-loading (SL).Under normosmolar conditions, OT-mRNA expression was higher in the Dp71-null SON compared to wild-type (wt) and the OT peptide level has not changed. Dp-immunostaining was localized in astrocytes end-feet surrounding vessels in wt SON. This distribution changed in Dp71-null SON, Dp being detected in OT-soma of MCNs. nNOS and NADPH-diaphorase levels increased in the OT area of the Dp71-null SON compared to wt. In the NL/HP, OT level reduced in Dp71-null mice and Dp localization changed from pituicytes end-feet in wt SON to OT terminals in Dp71-null SON.Salt-Loading resulted in an increase of OT-mRNA and peptide levels in wt SON but had no effect in Dp71-null SON. In the NL/HP, OT content was reduced after SL. For Dp71-null mice, OT level, already low in control, was not modified by SL. Dp level was not affected by SL in the SON nor in the NL/HP.Our data confirmed the importance of Dp71 for the SON functionality in osmoregulation. The localization of Dp71 at the glial-vascular interface could be associated with SON osmosensitivity, leading to an adequate OT synthesis in the SON and release from the NL/HP upon plasmatic hyperosmolality.",

Fragments of the tegument were fixed in Bouin solution and preserved in buffered Formol 10%. Subsequently, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed to characterize the macroscopic structure of these regions. Microscopic observations were made from histological sections stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Alcian Blue (pH 2,5), PAS-H, Coomassie Blue, Oil Red, and Bielschowsky Impregnation.. There were three types of protuberance: warts, tubers, and thorns. These structures became evident from post-metamorphic stages. The ventral surface shows elevations similar to flat warts; however, tubers and spines are absent. Histologically, each structure consists of a spongy dermis of lax connective tissue and dense and compact dermis, associated with granular glands and a keratinized epidermis. The latter, in the dorsal region, forms projections called thorns. The granular glands accumulate, and their alveoli increase in size progressively. This work provides a morphological and histological description of the integument and the parotoid glands during the larval and post-metamorphic stage of the genus Rhinella, with aspects described for the first time in the genus.",

It was shown that positive staining of CIC-3 can be present in both hepatocarcinoma and its paired normal controls; and that CIC-3 was significantly over-expressed in hepatcarcioma on the whole relative to paired normal controls. Moreover, up-regulation of CIC-3 markedly correlated with tumor size and overall prognosis, suggesting that CIC-3 expression could predict both tumor size and overall prognosis in hepatocarcinoma.",

The group I rats served as control and they received 0.1\u2009mol/L of citric acid buffer (pH\u2009=\u20094.5) as vehicle. The rats in the group II (DM group) and III (DM\u2009+\u2009Mirtazapine-treated group) were treated intraperitoneally with a single dose of 55\u2009mg/kg streptozotocin dissolved in 0.1\u2009mol/L of citric acid buffer.

Then, the kidneys were excised and prepared for microscopical examination. caspase-1 and NLRP3 proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The TUNEL assay for apoptosis and ELISA assay for IL-1\u03b2 were performed.Histological examination showed that mirtazapine administration has an ameliorative effect on DM-induced kidney damage. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses showed that NLRP3 and caspase-1 expressions were increased in the DM group according to the control group and the mirtazapine administration decreased these expressions. The intraglomerular and tubular TUNEL-positive cells were numerous in the DM group compared to the mirtazapine-treated group. The level of IL-1\u03b2 was highest in the DM group, and decreased significantly in the mirtazapine-treated group.In this study, 20\u2009mg/kg/day mirtazapine administration for 2 weeks reduced NLRP3 and caspase-1 expressions and IL-1\u03b2 level in the diabetic rat kidneys.

     "abstract": "Heat stress damaged spermatogenesis and semen quality, however, the exact molecular mechanism is not clear. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of elevated ambient temperature and local testicular heating on the expressions of heat shock protein 70 and androgen receptor in boar testes. A growing body of evidence demonstrated that germ cell apoptosis can be aggravated by heat stress and androgen deprivation, and at normal temperature, withdrawal of androgen led to germ cell apoptosis. There were no reports that heat stress damaged spermatogenesis has relationship with androgen. In this study, adult boars (Landrace, n\u2009=\u20099) were used and randomly divided into: control group (CON), 20\u201327\u2009\u00b0C; environmental hyperthermia group (EH), 37\u201340\u2009\u00b0C, 3\u2009h/d 42 d; and local testicular heating group (LTH), 42\u2009\u00b0C 1\u2009h. After heat treatments, all boars were castrated and the testes were harvested. qRT-PCR and Western Blot results showed that the mRNA and protein levels of heat shock protein 70 and androgen receptor were significantly increased after heat treatments. Immunohistochemistry results showed that heat stress caused a redistribution of heat shock protein 70 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and androgen receptor was mainly expressed in Sertoli cells. These results indicated that heat stress promoted the inhibition of heat shock protein 70 on the androgen receptor, suggesting that the possible mechanism of heat stress damaged spermatogenesis and semen quality was that heat stress reduced the sensitivity of testicular cells to androgen by up-regulating heat shock proteins.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that obesity contributes to the development of systemic inflammatory responses, which in turn may be involved in the process of interstitial fibrosis and left ventricular (LV) remodelling. Activation of pro-inflammatory factors such as transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) can directly stimulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 and JNK. The aim of the study was to evaluate the level of TGF-\u03b2 and MAPK p38 and JNK in the LV in Sprague Dawley (SPRD) rats maintained on a high fat diet (HFD).The SPRD rats from 4 weeks of age were on a normal fat diet (NFD) or a HFD for 12 weeks (NFD-16-week-old rats, NFD 16-wk; or HFD-16-week-old rats, HFD 16-wk) or 16 weeks (NFD-20-week-old rats, NFD 20-wk; or HFD-20-week-old rats, HFD 20-wk). At the end of the experiment, blood and LV were collected from all rats for further analysis (biochemical, Real Time PCR and immunohistochemical analysis). TGF-\u03b2 mRNA expression did not differ between the study groups of rats. However, p38 MAPK mRNA expression was significantly lower in the HFD 20-wk rats than in both the HFD 16-wk rats and the NFD 20-wk rats. c-jun mRNA expression was significantly higher in the HFD 16-wk rats than in the NFD 16-wk rats. There was significantly lower expression of c-jun mRNA in the HFD 20-wk rats and in the NFD 20-wk rats than in the HFD 16-wk rats and in the NFD 16-wk rats, respectively. TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor (T\u03b2RII) protein demonstrated only cytoplasmic reactivity, while p38 MAPK protein and c-jun protein showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic reactivity. The results suggest that a high fat diet and in two time intervals significantly influence the expression of p38 MAPK and JNK in the LV.

The objective of this study was both to assess the prenatal and postnatal development of sheep ileal Peyer\u2019s patches with respect to histomorphology, distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ cells, and localization of proliferating and apoptotic cells, and to examine the morphology of M cells and expression of CK18 in follicle associated epithelium (FAE). We also hypothesized that CK18 could be a potential marker for M cell. Peyer\u2019s patches completed their histomorphological development in prenatal period and involuted in the postnatal period. The distribution of the CD4+ and CD8+ cells was similar in the last trimester of pregnancy (days 120\u2013150) and the postnatal period, but differed in the early stages of foetal development (days 70\u2013120). In the prenatal period, the follicular area displayed high levels of proliferation and apoptosis. We observed CK18 immunoreaction only in FAE. While M cells were devoid of microfolds in the early stages of the prenatal period, these cells acquired a prismatic shape and bore distinct apical microfolds in the late prenatal period and postnatal period. As a result, it was determined that, in sheep, the development of the ileal Peyer\u2019s patches occurred in the prenatal period, independent of exogenous antigenic stimulation, and in association with high levels of lymphopoiesis and apoptosis in the follicles. We found, for the first time, that CK18 is a novel and reliable marker for FAE in sheep ileal Peyer\u2019s patches. We suggest that CK18 positive cells in FAE are M cells.",

     "abstract": "Cell-based therapies have become a promising approach to promote tissue regeneration and the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders. Bone regeneration maintains bone homeostasis, mechanical stability and physical performance. Mechanical stimulation showed to induce stem cell differentiation into the osteogenic fate. However, the effect of various osteogenic protocols on the osteogenic commitment of equine adipose-derived stem cells is not fully elucidated. Here we examined the influence of fluid-based shear stress (FSS) via mechanical rocking to assess whether mechanical stimulation promotes osteogenic differentiation of equine adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). ASCs were induced into osteogenic fate using osteogenic differentiation medium (ODM) protocol or additional supplementation of 5\u202fmM CaCl2 and 7.5\u202fmM CaCl2 protocol compared to cells cultivated in basal medium (BM) up to 21 day. The ASCs proliferation pattern was evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein assay. Osteogenic differentiation examined via semi-quantification of alizarin red staining (ARS) and alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) as well as, via quantification of osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteopontin (OP), and collagen type-1 (COL1) gene expression using RT-qPCR. We show that mechanical FSS increased the proliferation pattern of ASCs compared to the static conditions. Mechanical FSS together with 5\u202fmM CaCl2 and 7.5\u202fmM CaCl2 promoted osteogenic nodule formation and increased ARS intensity compared to the standard osteogenic protocols. We observed that combined mechanical FSS with ODM protocol increase ALP activity compared to static culture conditions. We report that ALP and OC osteogenic markers expression were upregulated under mechanical FSS culture condition particularly with the ODM protocol. Taken together, it can be assumed that mechanical stress using FSS promotes the efficiency of the osteogenic differentiation protocols of ASCs through independent mechanisms.",

In the case of birds, the expression of these molecules in various organ systems during embryonic development has been reported in Gallus gallus domesticus. In this work, we present the immunohistochemical analysis of the differential expression of E and N-cadherin binding molecules in Columba livia embryos at various stages of gonadal morphogenesis. The expression of E and N-cadherin in embryos corresponding to the stages 41, 43 and in neonates of 2, 5, 7 and 75 post-hatching days were assessed by immunohistochemistry.

In this context, it was aimed to use a cryoprotectant that could be an alternative to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which is commonly used despite the toxic side effects. Therefore, two different cryopreservation solutions were prepared using 10% DMSO and 10% 1,2 propanediol (PrOH). The fresh tissue group that was not performed cryopreservation was used as the control group. Following the cryopreservation step, MSCs were isolated from all groups and compared with each other to assess the efficiency of the cryopreservation solutions. The comparison was performed in terms of followings: morphology, immunophenotypes, growth kinetics, differentiation, and ultrastructural features. Based on the results, there were no significant morphological and immunophenotypic differences between the MSCs isolated from cryopreserved tissue groups and the MSCs isolated from the fresh tissue group. According to the growth kinetic analysis, the cells isolated from the PrOH group had a lower proliferation rate than the cells isolated from the fresh tissue. However, there was no significant difference between the cryopreserved groups in this respect. Osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation was observed in all groups. Upon comparison of the cryopreserved groups, PrOH group was discovered to hold a minor superiority in terms of these modes of differentiation. These results suggest that PrOH, which is considered as a cryoprotectant with low toxicity, could be used as a preferred cryoprotectant instead of DMSO concerning the process of cryopreservation of the umbilical cord.",

In this brief review, we not only report the primary use of TB to detect the anionic substrates and availability of their binding sites, but also unveil the resulting applications of TB staining in biological research. Among these applications, the uses of TB staining to identify the changes in chromatin DNA-protein complexes, nucleolus location, and extracellular matrix proteoglycan complexes associated with different physiological and pathological events are described. The usefulness of TB staining to monitor the effects elicited by environmental insults on chromatin and intercalation of drugs into the DNA is also included.",

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the central site for retinoid storage in the liver and indeed the entire body. Herein, we attempted to elucidate the ultrastructural localization and expression of caveolin-1 (CAV-1) in human HSCs during the progression of liver cirrhosis (LC). Normal and hepatitis C-related cirrhotic liver samples were prepared using a modified perfusion-fixation method to fix organelle structures and molecules in their in vivo positions, and examined using immunoelectron microscopy. In control liver specimens, CAV-1 was minimally associated with low electron density lipid droplets (LDs) segregated around zones 1\u20152, and specifically associated with membranes surrounding LDs. CAV-1 was segregated in high-density LDs, consistent with the formation of membrane-enclosed lipid-rich vesicular structures, as well as caveolae on plasma membranes around zones 2\u20153. In cirrhotic liver specimens, CAV-1 molecules were inserted into the cytoplasmic leaflets of ER membranes for transportation to LDs. Thus, CAV-1 transport to LDs might represent an intracellular pathway from the ER in cirrhotic liver tissue.",

     "abstract": "Mammalian lung development is a complex process that is partially accomplished during the postnatal period. Surface carbohydrates are crucial in many biological and pathological phenomena and are key partners during development. The outer surface of lung epithelial cells, which is rich in carbohydrate components, plays a pivotal role throughout the developmental process. However, systematic studies on the sugar residue content of the cell surface coating during postnatal rat lung development are scarce. The aim of the present study was to identify and determine the localization of N-acetylglucosamine residues on the bronchioloalveolar cell surface during rat lung development using light and pre-embedding transmission electron microscopy methodologies, and to associate these data with the components underlying postnatal lung growth. Strong binding sites for the lectin Triticum vulgare (common name Wheat Germ, WGA) are present on the luminal surface of adult rat bronchioloalveolar cells throughout the entire postnatal period and have been identified as N-acetylglucosamine residues. The consistent positive reaction observed on the surface coating of bronchioloalveolar lining cells before and after neuraminidase treatment suggests that aside from possible terminal sialic acids, the lectin specificity for N-acetylglucosamine residues is still evident.Our results also suggest a stronger positive reaction on the bronchioloalveolar cell surface when compared with endothelial cell surface. N-acetylglucosamine residues for lectin binding can be present in glycoproteins in the membrane and also within heparin sulfate chains of glycosaminoglycans, which are crucial for lung development. The work described here has sought to highlight the presence and possible importance of N-acetylglucosamine residues on the glycocalyx of bronchioloalveolar cells, during postnatal lung development.",

Therefore, we performed a methodological IHC optimization and validation study. First, we compared advantages and disadvantages of cryostat sections versus paraffin sections. Second, we compared and optimized antigen retrieval in paraffin sections using citrate buffer and Tris/EDTA buffer. Third, aminoethyl carbazole (AEC) and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) were tested as horseradish peroxidase (HRP) substrates to obtain a water-insoluble coloured end product to visualize antigens. Fourth, secondary antibodies conjugated with either mono-HRP or poly-HRP were compared. The study was performed using serial sections of human tonsil. IHC was performed with primary antibodies against endothelial cell marker CD31, smooth muscle actin (SMA), chemokine stromal-derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) and its receptor C-X-C receptor type 4 (CXCR4), macrophage marker CD68 and proliferation marker Ki67. DAB rather than AEC, and cryostat sections rather than paraffin sections gave optimum staining at highest primary antibody dilutions, whereas tissue morphology in paraffin sections was superior. Loss of antigenicity in paraffin sections by formaldehyde fixation, heat and/or masking of epitopes was counteracted by antigen retrieval but not for all antigens. Two out of six antigens (CD31 and CD68) could not be retrieved irrespective time and type of retrieval. Tris-EDTA was superior to citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. The use of mono-HRP or poly-HRP depended on the affinity of the primary antibody for its antigen. We conclude that IHC methodology optimization and validation are crucial steps for each antibody and each research question.",

However, the detailed mechanism underlying the effects of nasal obstruction on taste perception has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated this mechanism using the two-bottle taste preference test, immunohistological analysis, and quantification of the mRNA expression of taste-related molecules in the circumvallate papillae. Neonatal male Wistar rats were divided randomly into control and experimental groups. Rats in the experimental group underwent unilateral nasal obstruction by cauterization of the external nostril at the age of 8 days. Arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was recorded in awake rats using collar clip sensors. Taste preference for five basic taste solutions was evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were conducted to evaluate the expressions of taste-related molecules in the taste cells of the circumvallate papillae. Body weights were similar between the two groups throughout the experimental period. The SpO2 in the 7- to 12-week-old rats in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the age-matched rats in the control group. In the two-bottle taste preference test, the sensitivities to sweet taste decreased in the experimental group. The mRNA expression of T1R2, T1R3, \u03b1-gustducin, and PLC\u03b22 was significantly lower in the experimental group than in the control group as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and the immunohistochemical staining for \u03b1-gustducin and PLC\u03b22 was less prominent. These findings suggest that nasal obstruction may affect sweet taste perception via the reduced expression of taste-related molecules in the taste cells in rat circumvallate papillae.",

However, collection of these crabs from natural habitat for local consumption and export has caused rapid population decline. Hence, aquaculture of this species is required and to this measure understanding of endocrine control of their reproduction must be understood. Egg laying hormone (ELH) is a neuropeptide synthesized by the bag cells (neurons) in the abdominal ganglia of Aplysia gastropods. It plays a critical role in controlling egg production and laying in gastropods, and its possible homolog (ELH-like peptide) was reported in the neural and ovarian tissues of prawns and recently in female reproductive tract of the blue swimming crab, Portunus pelagicus. In this study, we have studied the histology of the male reproductive tract in Scylla olivacea which are comprised of anterior testis, posterior testis, early proximal spermatic duct (ePSD), proximal spermatic duct (PSD), middle spermatic duct (MSD) and distal spermatic duct (DSD), by immunohistochemistry, detected an abalone ELH- immunoreactivity (aELH-ir) in epithelium of ducts in posterior testis and epithelium of all parts of spermatic duct. Furthermore, we could detect aELH-ir in neurons of cluster 9, 11, olfactory neuropil (ON) in the brain and in the small neurons located between the third and the fourth thoracic neuropils (T3-T4) and between the fourth and the fifth thoracic neuropils (T4-T5) of thoracic ganglia. Thus, the presence of aELH in male S. olivacea was designated the role of female egg laying behavior in the male mud crab.",

The aim of this study was detailed analysis of the expression of EGFR in the stomach and diverticulum of the O. affinis at the mRNA and protein levels together with the immunohistochemical localization of EGFR in these organs. The intensity of band fluorescence corresponding to the EGFR gene expression level is significantly higher in the stomach than in the diverticulum. Further, quantitative analysis of EGFR protein abundance also revealed its higher synthesis in the stomach than in the diverticulum and the immunohistochemistry method confirmed these results. As regional localization of respiratory function in gut air-breathing fishes seems to be connected with \u201cmorphological remodeling\u201d of the epithelium of their gut, the present research demonstrated the potential efficiency of the O. affinis stomach as a respiratory organ. Having the potential possibility to create an air-blood barrier in the gastrointestinal tract allowing gas diffusion and respiration in hypoxic states seems to be very beneficial for these fish. It seems that facultative gut air breathing fish species are a relevant vertebrate model for high throughput screening, vascular biology and evolution.",

In the present study, we demonstrated the presence of an egg laying hormone (ELH)-like peptide in the male reproductive system. First, an antibody to the abalone (a)ELH was generated, and by Western blot it was shown to specifically bound to a protein from the male M. rosenbergii reproductive tissues with a similar size to molluscan ELH. This aELH-like peptide was localized in spermatogonia in the testes of all three male morphotypes: blue claw, orange claw and small males. Moreover, the aELH-like peptide was detected in the epithelium of the spermatic duct and its associated smooth muscle cell layers and on the outer surface of spermatozoa. As well, the aELH-like peptide was detected in the spermatophore located in the female thelycum at 4\u20136\u2009h post-mating, indicating that it was transferred to the female during copulation. Taken together, we suggest that this aELH-like peptide could be as a male inducing factor that helped to accelerate female spawning. Liquid chromatography of crude extracts and immunoblot analysis suggested that the aELH-like peptide could be further purified for ultimate characterization.",

After extraction of the anterior maculae flavae located at the anterior end of the lamina propria of the human vocal fold mucosa under microscope, the maculae flavae were minced, cultured and proliferated in mesenchymal stem cell growth medium and morphological features were assessed. Cell surface markers were detected using flow cytometry. Cell differentiation into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages was performed. Cell\u2019s differentiation potential was assessed using a human pluripotent stem cell functional identification kit and immunohistochemistry. Subcultured cells formed a colony-forming unit. Subcultured cells expressed CD90, CD105 and CD73 and lacked expression of CD45, CD34, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR. They differentiated into adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Consequently, the cell features in the maculae flavae meet the minimal criteria defining mesenchymal stromal cells. In addition, subcultured cells differentiated into ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm and expressed stage-specific embryonic antigen 3 (SSEA-3).

The latter is related to dopaminergic deficiency that may be triggered by genetic and environmental factors such as Pb intoxication. In this study, we have evaluated, in one hand, the neurotoxic effect of Pb (25\u2009mg / kg B.W i.p) for three consecutive days on dopaminergic system and locomotor performance in Merione shawi. In the other hand, the possible restorative potential of C. sativus (CS) (50\u2009mg / kg BW) by oral gavage.

The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of dexamethasone, on the expression of PGC-1\u03b1, visfatin and antioxidant enzymes activities in mouse testis. The results of the present study showed that dexamethasone treatment significantly decreased the expression of visfatin and PGC-1\u03b1 in mice testis, along with significant decreased in testicular antioxidant enzymes activates. Further, dexamethasone treatment also significantly increased the testicular lipid peroxidation and decreased testosterone synthesis. The dexamethasone induced changes in PGC-1\u03b1 and visfatin in the testis were significantly correlated with changes in serum testosterone concentrations and antioxidant enzymes activities.

The results revealed that the Pb-treated group exhibited a significant increase in MDA concentration concomitantly with a decrease in serum testosterone levels, antioxidative marker levels and caspase-3 gene expression. Several histological and histo-morphometric alterations were observed in this group. Co-administration with spirulina or garlic caused a significant increase in testosterone levels, testicular SOD and CAT activities, and caspase-3 gene expression and a decrease in MDA levels, with improvement in histological and histo-morphometric alterations.

They are localized in the magnocellular neurons (MCNs), astrocytes and vessels.From birth to adulthood, the AVP raise in the SON coincides with the progressive increase of Dp71 level while the level of Dp140 and Dp427 increased only at D20, D10 post-natal development, respectively, and \u03b2-DG expression did not change. Moreover, the location of Dps or/and \u03b2-DG in the cell compartments was modified during development: at D10, Dps appeared in the astrocytes end-feet surrounding MCNs, and at D20, Dps and \u03b2-DG codistributed in the astrocytes end-feet, surrounding MCNs and vessels. Such a distribution marks the first steps of post-natal SON development and may be considered essential in the establishment of structural plasticity mechanisms in SON, where astrocyte end-feet, vessels, magnocellular neurons, are physiologically associated. The disappearance of \u03b2-DG in the MCNs nucleus marks the adulthood SON and suggests that the complex of Dps associating \u03b2-DG is required for the nucleoskeleton function in the post-natal development.",

There were no statistically significant differences in the parameters of head, midpiece, tail and background for human sperm morphology assessment comparable to rapid PAP and Dip quick\u00ae stain (p\u2009>\u20090.05) unless the midpiece compartment when compare to rapid PAP. This finding suggests that the black rice extracted has potential for use as an alternative dye for human spermatozoa morphology evaluation. The usefulness of black rice extracts will decrease the expense for purchasing synthetic dyes and reduce their adverse effects on human and environment.",

The distribution of GnRH immunoreactive (ir) cell bodies and fibers in the nerve ganglion of the clam worm Perinereis aibuhitensis (Polychaeta) was examined by immunohistochemistry using a newly produced rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the marine worm GnRH (mwGnRH). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by dot blot assay. The antibody cross-reacted with mwGnRH, but not with other forms of GnRH such as octopus GnRH, tunicate GnRH-I, II, owl limpet GnRH, and lamprey GnRH-II. In P. aibuhitensis, mwGnRH-ir cell bodies were detected in the nuclei 15\u201322, the caudal part of the cerebral ganglion. Furthermore, mwGnRH-ir fibers were mainly observed in the optic neuropil, but mwGnRH-ir fibers were also detected in the central neuropil region, the subpharyngeal ganglion, and the ventral nerve cord. These results indicate that mwGnRH is synthesized in the cerebral ganglion, is transported through the subpharyngeal ganglion and the ventral nerve cord, and functions either as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.",

In this context, we point out and propose the use of darkfield microscopy (DM) combined with different fixation protocols (to be used anyway) to enhance the different cell structures and districts as a timesaving and inexpensive support to the techniques that need staining or immuno-staining protocols and products. In a first step, we have analysed the effect of different fixation protocols on DM images for various human cellular lines. The presented imaging study shows that cell morphology actually changes with the fixation protocols that enhance, through contrast and luminosity variations, different shapes and patterns and thus structures of the cells. The different chemical action of various fixations, in fact, modifies the local scattering coefficient, thus affecting in a different way the morphology shown by DM images. As a second step we have compared the observed DM morphologies to those of selective fluorescent staining being therefore able to associate them to specific cell districts (e.g. nucleus, membrane or cytoskeleton).The obtained results indicate that this common microscopy technique can give images with particular cellular structures or districts enhanced more than others depending on the choice of fixation protocol. Therefore Darkfield Microscopy can be considered as a simpler, cheaper and faster method to provide morphological indications, respect to staining techniques, even at low and medium magnifications",

The natural plant polyphenol compound curcumin can improve obesity-associated inflammation and diabetes in obese mice. The role of curcumin in adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is still unclear. We used hMSCs to investigate the details of the mechanism underlying the adipogenic effects of curcumin. At different time points (i.e., 5 days and 10 days) of hMSC adipocyte differentiation, an accumulation of large lipid droplets was analyzed in Oil Red O-stained cultured cells in two curcumin (5\u2009\u03bcM and 10\u2009\u03bcM) groups and the control group. The cells were also harvested for the detection of mRNA and protein expressions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The results showed that curcumin can suppresses adipocyte differentiation in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the expression of PPAR\u03b3, C/EBP\u03b1, and FABP4. Importantly, curcumin can also suppress the expression of Kruppel-like factor 15, which may bind to the PPAR\u03b3 promoter, resulting in downregulation of PPAR\u03b3 expression to inhibit the adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs.",

     "abstract": "Nervous control of light emission from deep-sea mesopelagic fishes has been documented for several species. Studies on the nervous control of photophores from deep-sea luminescent fish, are mainly restricted to a pharmacological approach. For example, the light organs, called photophores, isolated from Argyropelecus hemygimnus and Maurolicus muelleri show a much higher sensitivity to adrenaline than to noradrenaline. According to these results and other information in different species, catecholamines are considered as main neurotransmitters triggering bioluminescence in deep-sea fishes. The present work is a study of the nervous control of the isolated photophores from two Stomiid fishes, Chauliodus sloani (the viperfish) and Stomias boa (the dragonfish) with the aim to determine the nature of the nervous control by pharmacological, biochemical and morphological approaches.Results show that, although the photophores of both species are sensitive to catecholamines, adrenaline is present in larger amount than noradrenaline in the light organs of C. sloani. Both catecholamines have different immunoreactive (IR) sites, noradrenaline showing a very diffuse localization as compared to adrenaline in C. sloani. On the contrary, only adrenaline is detected in the photocytes chamber and nerves innervating the photophore in S. boa. Knowing that the majority of dragonfishes exhibit a luminescent chin barbel, we also investigated the presence of catecholamines in this specific tissue in S. boa. Immunohistology reveals the presence of adrenaline within the tissue forming the chin barbel; adrenaline\u2013IR is found in the connective tissue surroundings two group of muscle fibers and blood vessels in the stem but also around the multiple blood vessels located within the barbel bulb.Our results strongly support the adrenergic control of light emission in bioluminescent stomiid fishes.",

It is associated with histological and ultrastructural alterations, changes in the quantitative parameters and the expression of different enzymes. While the structural and functional consequences of systemic hypertension on the left ventricle have been well evaluated, the right ventricle has received less attention. The aim of the present study was to analyse and compare the changes in the left and right ventricle during the development of cardiac hypertrophy initiated by systemic hypertension in different age groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Therefore, we studied the histology and ultrastructure of the cells of the myocardium, evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase and conducted a quantitative analysis of several morphometric parameters. We used three groups of spontaneously hypertensive rats. For the quantitative analysis we also used three age groups of age- and weight-matched control animals (normotensive Wistar rats). In both ventricles, we described cardiomyocytic hypertrophy, focal myocytolysis and increased collagen deposition in the interstitial space. Our observations on the ultrastructural level were associated with changes in the cardiomyocytic nuclei, the arrangement, maturity and organisation of the myofibrils, the localisation and ultrastructure of the mitochondria, the development and maturity of the intercalated discs, as well as changes in the components of the interstitium. The immunohistochemical expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the left ventricle was stronger than that in the right ventricle across all age groups. The comparative quantitative analysis revealed that changes in the studied morphometric parameters in the two ventricles occurred disproportionately. In conclusion, the present study characterised the development of cardiac hypertrophy in response to systemic hypertension in both ventricles and demonstrated the involvement of the right ventricle.",

Changes in the pituitary gland volume; the volume density and volume of somatotrophs following acute and repeated immobilization (IMO, R-IMO); acute and repeated restraint (R, R-R) were evaluated using a stereological system (newCAST), while growth hormone level within pituitary was determined by Western blot.

Sperm cryopreservation is the only method which can provide a baby for couples. Cryopreservation freezes tissues and cells, allowing them to be stored for future use by stopping all biological activities. Cryopreservation can cause some harmful changes in the structure and function of the sperm. Leptin molecule plays many roles in most biological processes including the satiety and cell renewal, proliferation, angiogenesis, modulation of energy expenditure and regulation of the neuroendocrine system. Leptin was also reported to be associated with spermatogenesis in several studies. Methods This study aims to use leptin molecule as a parameter for sperm motility and DNA fragmentation before and after the cryopreservation. In this study, semen samples were taken from 30 normospermic male volunteers. Each semen sample was examined for the same parameters before and after the cryopreservation. Samples were analyzed before and after cryopreservation in terms of sperm motility by morphological sperm analysis with spermac stain dye, DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay, ultrastructural analysis with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), seminal leptin levels by ELISA method and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by colorimetric method. Results Decreased sperm motility, distribution of sperm morphology and increased DNA fragmentation were determined after cryopreservation. Similarly, seminal ROS and leptin levels were also increased significantly. There was a negative correlation between seminal leptin and sperm motility. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between seminal leptin and DNA fragmentation. Conclusion According to these results, leptin molecule can be used as a marker for sperm motility and DNA fragmentation before and after cryopreservation. We think that the results of this study can contribute to further studies in the clinical aspect.",

Our results showed that astaxanthin attenuated SAH-induced cerebral vasospasm and reduced neuronal apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Telocytes (TCs) are CD34 and Vimentin positive (+) immunoreactive stromal cells with a small-sized body and several extremely long telopodes. TCs have been described to provide a mechanical support throughout the tissue by making cellular connections (homo- or hetero) to form a 3D network. Such network can transmit the intercellular signaling. Recently, TCs have been described in the esophageal wall. However, information concerning the role of these cells in esophageal organization and development is rare. Thus, we aimed to record the temporo-spatial localization pattern of TCs during esophageal morphogenesis in rabbit. Embryos and fetuses of New Zealand White rabbits (10th\u201330th gestational days) were collected. Using CD34 immunostaining, TCs have not been demonstrated in the wall of the developing esophagus till the end of the second third of pregnancy. On 24th gestational day, CD34+ TCs were organized in the adventitia of the esophageal wall specifically in close association with the endothelial cells lining the micro vessels. Later on 26th gestational day, CD34+TCs were additionally expressed in the sub-mucosa and in lamina propria (sub-epithelial). On 28th gestational day, additional CD34+TCs were detected among the smooth muscle bundles of the muscular layer. Reaching the last gestational day, CD34+TCs formed several sheaths in the esophageal wall namely sub epithelial sheath, sub-mucosal, muscular (circular and longitudinal) and inter-muscular sheaths and an outer adventitial one. On the other hand, vimentin immunohistochemistry revealed wider spread TCs positivity in all developmental ages. Presumptively, arrangement of CD34 and vimentin positive TCs in all layers of the developing esophageal wall hypothesizes that TC may play a potential role as a progenitor cell initially in differentiation of the epithelial and muscular precursors and finally in shaping of the various layers of the rabbit esophageal wall during its morphogenesis. TCs are also proposed to be involved in the angiogenesis of the esophageal blood capillaries.",

Also, testicular tissues were obtained for histopathological investigations and immunohistochemical staining with anti-PCNA (proliferating cell marker), anti-ssDNA (apoptotic cell marker), anti-SOX9 (Sertoli cell marker), anti-Stella (spermatogonia marker), anti-STRA8 (preleptotene and early-leptotene spermatocytes marker), anti-DMC1 (leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes marker), anti-Dnmt3a (a marker for cells under DNA methylation) and anti-\u03b1-SMA (peritubular myoid cell marker). The biochemical analysis revealed that diabetes resulted in a significant elevation in blood glucose level and a reduction in serum testosterone level. Moreover, histopathological investigations revealed disorganized seminiferous epithelium and sever hyalinization with vacuolization of the testicular interstitium containing Leydig cells. The immunohistochemical findings support spermatogenesis impairment in the diabetic group. However, ZnO NPs treatment restores architecture of seminiferous epithelium and Leydig cells. Furthermore, more PCNA, SOX9, Stella, STRA8, DMC1 and Dnmt3a immunopositive cells with an improvement of peritubular \u03b1-SMA immunopositive expression, as well as few ssDNA-immunopositive cells were detected in the seminiferous epithelium. This study suggested the possible protective role of orally administered ZnO NPs on testicular alterations in the STZ-induced diabetic group via steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis enhancement. In addition, further researches are acquired for evaluation mechanism of ZnO NPs treatment via oral or parenteral routes in a dose-dependent manner to identify the more effective route and dose in the treatment of testicular diabetic complications.",

     "abstract": "The vomeronasal system (VNS) is an accessory olfactory structure present in most mammals adhibited to the detection of specific chemosignals implied in social and reproductive behavior. The VNS comprises the vomeronasal organ (VNO), vomeronasal nerve and accessory olfactory bulb. VNO is characterized by a neuroepithelium constituted by bipolar neurons and supporting and stem/progenitor cells. In humans, VNO is present during fetal life and is supposed to possess chemoreceptor activity and participate in gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal precursor migration toward the hypothalamus. Instead, the existence and functions of VNO in postnatal life is debated. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) have been demonstrated to play fundamental roles in various neurogenic events. However, there are no data regarding the localization and possible function of VEGF/VEGFRs in human fetal VNO. Therefore, this study was conceived to investigate the expression of VEGF/VEGFRs in human VNO in an early developmental period (9\u201312 weeks of gestation), when this organ appears well structured. Coronal sections of maxillofacial specimens were subjected to peroxidase-based immunohistochemistry for VEGF, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Double immunofluorescence for VEGF, VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 and the neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5) was also performed. VEGF expression was evident in the entire VNO epithelium, with particularly strong reactivity in the middle layer. Strongly VEGF-immunostained cells with aspect similar to bipolar neurons and/or their presumable precursors were detected in the middle and basal layers. Cells detaching from the basal epithelial layer and detached cell groups in the surrounding lamina propria showed moderate/strong VEGF expression. The strongest VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 expression was detected in the apical epithelial layer. Cells with aspect similar to bipolar neurons and/or their presumable precursors located in the middle and basal layers and the detaching/detached cells displayed a VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 reactivity similar to that of VEGF. The basal epithelial layer exhibited stronger staining for VEGFRs than for VEGF. Cells with morphology and VEGF/VEGFR expression similar to those of the detaching/detached cells were also detected in the middle and basal VNO epithelial layers. Double immunofluorescence using anti-PGP 9.5 antibodies demonstrated that most of the VEGF/VEGFR-immunoreactive cells were neuronal cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that during early fetal development the VEGF/VEGFR system might be involved in the presumptive VNO chemoreceptor activity and neuronal precursor migration.",

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a bone degenerative disease characterized by a decrease in bone strength and an alteration in the osseous micro-architecture causing an increase in the risk of fractures. These diseases usually happen in post-menopausal women and elderly men. The most common treatment involves anti-resorptive agent drugs. However, the inhibition of bone resorption alone is not adequate for recovery in patients at the severe stage of osteoporosis who already have a fracture. Therefore, the combination of utilizing osteoblast micro mimetic scaffold in cultivation with the stimulation of osteoblastic differentiations to regain bone formation is a treatment strategy of considerable interest. The aims of this current study are to investigate the osteoblastic differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human amniotic fluid and to compare the monolayer culture and scaffold culture conditions. The results showed the morphology of cells in human amniotic fluid as f-type, which is a typical cell shape of mesenchymal stem cells. In addition, the proliferation rate of cells in human amniotic fluid reached the highest peak after 14 days of culturing. After which time, the growth rate slowly decreased. Moreover, the positive expression of specific mesenchymal cell surface markers including CD44, CD73, CD90, and also HLA-ABC (MHC class I) were recorded. On the other hand, the negative expressions of the endothelial stem cells markers (CD31), the hematopoietic stem cells markers (CD34, 45), the amniotic stem cells markers (CD117), and also the HLA-DR (MHC class II) were also recorded. The expressions of osteoblastogenic related genes including OCN, COL1A1, and ALP were higher in the osteogenic-induced group when compared to the control group. Interestingly, the osteoblastogenic related gene expressions that occurred under scaffold culture conditions were superior to the monolayer culture conditions. Additionally, higher ALP activity and greater calcium deposition were recorded in the extracellular matrix in the osteogenic-induced group than in the culture in the scaffold group. In summary, the mesenchymal stem cells derived from human amniotic fluid can be induced to be differentiated into osteoblastic-like cells and can promote osteoblastic differentiation using the applied scaffold.",

     "abstract": "The nuclear receptor 4A (NR4A) members play important roles in cellular proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The current study first evaluate the expression of ovarian NR4A1 during different luteal stages in rats. Immature rats aged 28 days were treated with sequential Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) (D -2) / human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (D 0) to induce pseudopregnancy. Serum progesterone (P4) and ovarian expression of NR4A1 were detected by RIA and WB, respectively, at follicle stage (D 0), early (D 2), middle (D 7) and late (D 14 and D 20) luteal stages. To confirm the role of NR4A1 during the luteal regression, rats were treated with prostaglandin F2\u03b1 analog (PGF) for 0\u20138\u202fh on D 7 to detect the expressions of NR4A1 and NR4A2. RIA result showed that serum P4 reached highest level on D 7 and then declined. WB results showed that there were two types of NR4A1 (NR4A1-L and NR4A1-S) expressed in the ovary. The ovarian NR4A1-L decreased at the late luteal stage (D 20). However, the NR4A1-S increased at the late luteal stage (D 14). After PGF treatment on D 7, the expression of NR4A1-S increased which peaked at 0.5\u20131\u202fh and then declined; while NR4A1-L expression did not change within 8 h. Real-time PCR results showed that the ovarian NR4A1 mRNA increased within 0.5\u202fh, maintained high at 1 h and then declined. The NR4A2 mRNA expression exhibited a similar pattern to that of NR4A1 mRNA, though its abundance was not as high as NR4A1. IHC results revealed that NR4A1-L was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of luteal steroidogenic cells, faintly expressed in the follicle theca cells, oocytes and the pericytes; while NR4A2 was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of luteal steroidogenic cells. In conclusion, all these results demonstrate that NR4A2 as well as NR4A1 might be involved in the luteal development and luteolysis in rats.",

ENS comprises the myenteric plexus (MP) and the submucous plexus (SP). In this study, we examined the expression profile of neurofilament heavy chain (NF-H), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), calcyclin (S100A6), vimentin and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal enteric neurons and enteric glia cells (EGCs) during prenatal development using an immunohistochemical method. The material of the study consisted of 15 different fetal ileum tissues obtained between days 60 and 150 of pregnancy. NF-H was observed in the majority of ganglion cells in SP and MP throughout the fetal period. It was determined that there was no NF-H reaction in some ganglion cells in Peyer\u2019s patches of internal submucosal plexus (ISPF). In the early stage of pregnancy (60\u201390 days), there was no expression of NSE and S1006 in ileum. After this period, NSE and S1006 were expressed in the ganglion cells of the plexus, indicating an increase in the amount of expression towards the end of pregnancy. In the early period, vimentin expression was only detected in intramuscular interstitial cells (ICs) (60\u201390 days), but later (90\u2013150 days) it was also seen in the cells around the ganglion cells in the plexus. On days 60\u201390 of gestation, GFAP expression only occurred in MP, but in later stages, staining was also detected in SP. In the plexus, an immunoreactivity was present in EGCs forming a network around the ganglion cell. During the last period of gestation (120\u2013150 days), the number of GFAP-positive plexus increased, with the majority of these stained cells being observed in MP. Interestingly, weak staining or reaction did not occur in ISPF, unlike other plexuses. In conclusion, this is the first study that demonstrated the expression of NF-H, vimentin, S100A6, NSE and glial fibril acidic protein (GFAP) in ovine ileal ENS in the prenatal period. In the last period of gestation (120\u2013150 days), the expression profile of ENS was similar to that of adult animals. The expression of the used markers increased toward the end of pregnancy. Our results suggest that neurons and EGCs show heterogeneity, and GFAP and NF-H cannot be used as panenteric glial or panneuronal markers, respectively. We also demonstrated, for the first time, the prenatal expression of S100A6 in enteric neurons and the possibility of using this protein for the identification of enteric neurons.",

It was used EDL muscle to evaluate oxidative stress. The deep fibular nerve and EDL muscle were used for morphologic and morphometric assessment. 25(OH)D plasma levels were higher in the supplemented group and no alterations were observed in other parameters including the oxidative stress evaluation. The G ratio remained constant which indicates nervous conduction normality. Cholecalciferol supplementation promoted an increase in the number and area of type II fibers and a decrease in the area of type I fibers. In the studied model, there was neither alcoholic myopathy nor neuropathy. The EDL muscle glycolytic patterns in the high-drinker UChB rats may be associated with the differential effects of cholecalciferol on metabolism and protein synthesis in skeletal muscle.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are crucial for cells, supplying up to 90% of the energy requirements for neurons. Their correct localisation is crucial and ensured by a transport system. Mitochondrial trafficking in neurons is particularly critical, because mitochondria must leave the soma and travel along the axon and dendritic network to facilitate neuronal function. Abnormal mitochondrial trafficking has been reported in several neurological disorders, therefore the ability to quantify and analyse mitochondrial trafficking is vital to improving our understanding of their pathogenesis. Commercial software currently lacks an automated approach for performing such quantitation. Here we demonstrate the development of the Mitochondrial Trafficking and Distribution (MiTrakD) analysis toolset, which consists of simple and free-to-use instructions for mitochondrial trafficking analysis using time-lapse microscopy. MiTrakD utilises existing Fiji (ImageJ) tools for semi-automated, fast and efficient analysis of mitochondrial trafficking and distribution, including velocity, abundance, localisation and distance travelled in neurons. We document MiTrakD\u2019s efficiency and accuracy by analysing mitochondrial trafficking using two-dimensional fluorescence images of cortical neurons of wild type mice after 6 days (DIV6), 10 days (DIV10) and 14 days (DIV14) of in vitro incubation. Using MiTrakD we have demonstrated that neurons at all developmental stages exhibited the same percentage of mobile mitochondria, all of which travel in equidistance. Interestingly, the mitochondria in neurons at DIV10 were in greater abundance and were faster than those at DIV6 and DIV14. We can also conclude that MiTrakD is more efficient than manual analysis and is an accurate and reliable tool for performing mitochondrial trafficking analysis in neuronal cells.",

In the present study, we immunohistochemically examined the developmental process of olfactory organs in soft-shelled turtle and the Reeve\u2019s turtle to clarify the developmental origins of the lower chamber epithelium in these turtles.

This study aimed to determine the localization and expression of galectin-1 (Gal-1) and galectin-3 (Gal-3) in the testis and epididymis of rats at postnatal [(prepubertal (day 5), pubertal (day 20), postpubertal (day 50) and mature (day 70)] periods by using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Gal-1 and Gal-3 were differentially expressed in different types of cells in the testis and epididymis during postnatal development. While we detected Gal-1 expression in some spermatogenic cells and Leydig cells in the testis, not in the epididymal epithelium, Gal-3 was expressed in Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells, Leydig cells, smooth muscles and interstitial CD68-positive macrophages. Epithelial cells of the corpus and cauda epididymis showed an intense Gal-3 expression. Gal-1 expression was higher in the testis than in the epididymis on days 50 and 70. The expression of Gal-3 in the testis increased from the prepubertal to mature period. While the expression difference of Gal-3 was not statistically significant in the testis and epididymis until puberty, Gal-3 expression in the postpubertal and mature periods was higher in the epididymis. The expression of Gal-3 in the corpus and cauda epididymis was higher than that in the caput epididymis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that puberty has potential regulatory effect on the expression of galectins in testis and epididymis of rats. Gal-1 and 3 may play a role in the development of the reproductive system and the preservation of the immune-privileged environment in the testis, due to their pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic functions. The presence of intense expression of Gal-3 in the corpus and cauda epididymis may contribute to the maturation and storage of spermatozoa.",

In addition, the diabetic rats showed severe \u03b2-cell necrosis with reduced insulin levels, cerebral neuronopathy, myelinopathy, axonopathy, microglial and astroglial activation, and vascular damage. While Mel treatment did not prevent the development of STZ-induced diabetes mellitus and had no significant effect on the BGLs of the diabetic rats, it significantly ameliorated the diabetes-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration.

Lichen planopilaris (LPP) and frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) are inflammatory scalp conditions resulting in permanent alopecia, which are thought to be related to stem cell damage. Here we investigate the expression of mTOR signaling pathway proteins in human hair follicles of LPP and FFA patients. The expression of mTOR pathway proteins in biopsy specimens from lesional and non-lesional scalp areas of eight LPP and five FFA patients were compared to control scalp biopsies from patients undergoing surgical excisions of sebaceous cysts. We performed immunohistochemical evaluation using a panel of antibodies including mTOR, phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-p70S6K (Thr389), phospho-4EBP1 (Thr37146), and phospho-tuberin (T1462), as well as Western blot analysis for phospho-p70S6K (Thr389) expression. All evaluated mTOR pathway proteins were similarly expressed in the control and patient non-lesional scalps. While mTOR expression did not show significant alterations between the groups, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, p-4EBP1, and p-tuberin expressions decreased in the interfollicular epidermis in the lesional scalps of patients. p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1 expression decreased in the outer root sheath (ORS) and inner root sheath (IRS) of the bulge of hair follicles in the lesional scalps of patients. p-mTOR and p-p70S6K expression increased in the lower follicle ORS and bulb of the hair follicles, and p-4EBP1 expression decreased in the bulb of the hair follicles in the lesional scalps of patients. Phospho-tuberin expression increased in the IRS of the bulge and lower follicle ORS of the hair follicles in the lesional scalps of patients, whereas its expression decreased in the bulb. Our results indicate that the mTOR signaling pathway proteins are localized throughout normal hair follicles and that expression of mTOR signaling pathway proteins is altered in the hair follicles of LPP and FFA patients. Further research is required to understand the mechanism by which mTOR operates in the pathogenesis of these diseases.",

To investigate these diseases mouse models are increasingly being used. However, the literature on the vascular system of the mouse dura mater is sparse and explicit studies concerned exclusively with its vasculature are lacking. Here we present a detailed light and scanning electron microscopic investigation of the supratentorial dura mater of the mouse species, with a focus on the largest part of it, the parietal dura mater. By utilizing different immunohistochemical and classical staining methods, a \u201ccartography\u201d of the vascular system was achieved. Additionally, the different blood vessel types with their mural cells were characterized. In contrast to humans, no arteries were found in the mouse parietal dura mater. Its supply is assured through frontolateral and occipital localized arteriolar branches. These arteriolar vessels exhibit in some specimens arteriolar anastomoses with one another. The venous blood is drained to the superior sagittal and transverse sinus through satellite venules accompanying the arterioles or through solitary venules. In all samples, large ruptured venules were identified in the frontolateral dural area. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that these vessels were ruptured on the dorsal side (skull bones-oriented side) of the dura. Our results contribute to the anatomical data on the mouse species and may set up a basis for fundamental investigation of disorders, for which the role of dural blood vessels is not yet clarified.",

The origin and organ location, the presence of a glottal region, the inner architecture, the characteristics of the exchange barrier and the presence of pulmonary arteries have been reviewed in the two types of air-breathing organs. With the exception of the dorsal (bladders) or ventral (lungs) origin from the posterior pharynx, none of the morphological traits analyzed can be considered specific for either lungs or gas bladders. This is exemplified by analysis of the morphology of the lung of the Dipnoii and Polypteriformes and of the bladder of the Lepisosteiformes. All of them are obligate air-breathers and show a lung-like (pulmonoid) air-breathing organ. However, while the lungfish lung and the bladder of the Lepisosteiformes occupy a dorsal position and are highly trabeculated, the polypterid lung occupies a ventral position and shows a smooth inner surface. Structural and ultrastructural differences are also highlighted. Noticeably, a large part of the inner surface area of the lung of the Australian lungfish is covered by a ciliated epithelium. A restricted respiratory surface area may help to explain the incapability of this species to aestivate. The respiratory bladder of basal teleosts displays a more complex morphology than that observed in more primitive species. The bladder of basal teleosts may appear divided into respiratory and non-respiratory portions, exhibit intricate shapes, invade adjacent structures and gain additional functions. The increase in morphological and functional complexity appears to prelude the loss of the respiratory functions.",

     "abstract": "The evolution of air-breathing and transition from water to land were pivotal events that greatly determined the ecological diversification, the advances and the successes of animal life. During their relocation onto land, the so-called bimodal breathers were literally caught at the water-air interface. Among such animals are the diverse air-breathing bony fish. Such taxa, however, strictly do not constitute the so-called \u2018bridging animals\u2019, i.e., the inaugural animals that crossed from water to land, nor are they their direct progenitors. The pioneer transitional animals were the Devonian rhipidistian amphibians that possessed a primitive lung which acquired O2 directly from air and discharged CO2 back into the same. By having particular morphological and physiological adaptations for terrestrialness, the modern amphibious- and aquatic air-breathers are heuristic analogues of how and why animals relocated from water to land. It has generally been espoused that lack or dearth of O2 in water, especially in the warm tropical one, was an elemental driver for adoption of air-breathing. There is, however, no direct causal relationship between the evolution of air-breathing and the shift onto land: the move onto land was a direct solution to the existing inimical respiratory conditions in water. This is evinced in the facts that: a) even after attaining capacity of air-breathing, an important preadaptation for life on land, some animals continued living in water while periodically accessing air, b) in the fish species that live in the well-oxygenated waters, e.g., torrential rivers, only few air-breathe and c) air-breathing has still evolved in freshwaters and seawaters, where levels of dissolved O2 are sufficiently high. Here, the structure and function of the respiratory organs of the air-breathing fish are succinctly outlined. Two African catfishes, Clarias mossambicus and C. gariepinus are highlighted.",

These chemoreceptors are sensitive to changes in O2, CO2 and/or H+. In fish and mammals, respiratory chemoreceptors may be additionally sensitive to ammonia, hypoglycemia, and numerous other stimuli. Thus, chemoreceptors that affect respiration respond to different types of stimuli (or modalities) and are considered to be \"polymodal\". This review discusses the polymodal nature of respiratory chemoreceptors in vertebrates with a particular emphasis on chemoreceptors of the carotid body and pulmonary epithelium in mammals, and on neuroepithelial cells in water- and air-breathing fish. A major goal will be to examine the evidence for putative polymodal chemoreceptors in fish within the context of studies on mammalian models, for which polymodal chemoreceptors are well described, in order to improve our understanding of the evolution of polymodal chemoreceptors in vertebrates, and to aid in future studies that aim to identify putative receptors in air- and water-breathing fish.",

     "abstract": "In fishes, exploitation of aerial gas exchange has evolved independently many times, involving a variety of air-breathing organs. Indeed, air-breathing occurs in at least 49 known families of fish (Graham, 1997). Many amphibious vertebrates, at some stage of their development are actually trimodal breathers that use various combinations of respiratory surfaces to breath both water (skin and/or gill) and air (skin and/or lung). The present review examines the evolutionary implications of air-breathing organs in fishes and the morphology of the peripheral receptors and the neurotransmitter content of the cells involved in the control of air-breathing. Control of breathing, whether gill ventilation or air-breathing, is influenced by feedback from peripheral and/or central nervous system receptors that respond to changes in PO2, PCO2 and/or pH. Although the specific chemoreceptors mediating the respiratory reflexes have not been conclusively identified, studies in water-breathing teleosts have implicated the neuroepithelial cells (NECs) existing in gill tissues as the O2 sensitive chemoreceptors that initiate the cardiorespiratory reflexes in aquatic vertebrates. Some of the air-breathing fishes, such as Protopterus, Polypterus and Amia have been shown to have NECs in the gills and/or lungs, although the role of these receptors and their innervation in the control of breathing is not known. NECs have been also reported in the specialized respiratory epithelia of accessory respiratory organs (ARO\u2019s) of some catfish species and in the gill and skin of the mudskipper Periophthalmodon schlosseri. Unlike teleosts matching an O2-oriented ventilation to ambient O2 levels, lungfishes have central and peripheral H+/CO2 receptors that control the acid-base status of the blood.",

     "abstract": "This review considers the environmental and systemic factors that can stimulate air-breathing responses in fishes with bimodal respiration, and how these may be controlled by peripheral and central chemoreceptors. The systemic factors that stimulate air-breathing in fishes are usually related to conditions that increase the O2 demand of these animals (e.g. physical exercise, digestion and increased temperature), while the environmental factors are usually related to conditions that impair their capacity to meet this demand (e.g. aquatic/aerial hypoxia, aquatic/aerial hypercarbia, reduced aquatic hidrogenionic potential and environmental pollution). It is now well-established that peripheral chemoreceptors, innervated by cranial nerves, drive increased air-breathing in response to environmental hypoxia and/or hypercarbia. These receptors are, in general, sensitive to O2 and/or CO2/H+ levels in the blood and/or the environment. Increased air-breathing in response to elevated O2 demand may also be driven by the peripheral chemoreceptors that monitor O2 levels in the blood. Very little is known about central chemoreception in air-breathing fishes, the data suggest that central chemosensitivity to CO2/H+ is more prominent in sarcopterygians than in actinopterygians. A great deal remains to be understood about control of air-breathing in fishes, in particular to what extent control systems may show commonalities (or not) among species or groups that have evolved air-breathing independently, and how information from the multiple peripheral (and possibly central) chemoreceptors is integrated to control the balance of aerial and aquatic respiration in these animals.",

     "abstract": "Aquatic areas frequently face hypoxic conditions. In order to get sufficient oxygen to support aerobic metabolism, a number of freshwater fish resort to aerial respiration to supplement gill respiration especially in situations with reduced oxygen availability in the water. In many species a concomitant reduction in gill surface area or in gill perfusion reduces possible loss of aerially acquired oxygen to the water at the gills, but it also compromises the ion regulatory capacity of gill tissue. In consequence, the reduced gill contact area with water requires appropriate compensation to maintain ion and acid-base homeostasis, often with important ramifications for other organs. Associated modifications in the structure and function of the gills themselves, the skin, the gut, the kidney, and the physiology of water exchange and ion-linked acid-base regulation are discussed. In air-breathing fish, the gut may gain particular importance for the uptake of ions. In addition, tissues frequently exposed to environmental air encounter much higher oxygen partial pressures than typically observed in fish tissues. Physostomous fish using the swimbladder for aerial respiration, for example, will encounter aerial oxygen partial pressure at the swimbladder epithelium when frequently gulping air in hypoxic water. Hyperoxic conditions or rapid changes in oxygen partial pressures result in an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accordingly, in air-breathing fish, strategies of ionoregulation may be greatly modified, and the ROS defense capacity of air-exposed tissues is improved.",

     "abstract": "During water-land transition, ancient fishes acquired the ability to breathe air, but air-breathing engendered problems in nitrogenous waste excretion. Nitrogen is a fundamental component of amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids, and the degradation of these nitrogen-containing compounds releases ammonia. Ammonia is toxic and must be removed. Fishes in water excrete ammonia as the major nitrogenous waste through gills, but gills of air-breathing fishes are modified for air-breathing or largely replaced by air-breathing organs. Notably, fishes emerged from water can no longer excrete ammonia effectively because of a lack of water to flush the gills. Hence, ancient fishes that participated in water-land transition must have developed means to deal with ammonia toxicity. Extant air-breathing fishes, particularly amphibious ones, can serve as models to examine adaptations which might have facilitated the emergence of ancient fishes from water. Some of these fishes can actively emerge from water and display complex behaviors on land, while a few can burrow into mud and survive for years during drought. Many of them are equipped with mechanisms to ameliorate ammonia toxicity during emersion. In this review, the mechanisms adopted by air-breathing fishes to deal with ammonia toxicity during emersion were organized into seven disparate strategies. In addition, eight extant air-breathing fishes with distinctive terrestrial behaviors and peculiar natural habitats were selected to describe in detail how these seven strategies could be adopted in disparate combinations to ameliorate ammonia toxicity during emersion.",

While a few species do utilize their gills for gas exchange in air, this is a rare occurrence and most air-breathing fish utilize other surfaces including air-breathing organs and lungs. At present almost nothing is known about the central sites that initiate and regulate air breathing although hypotheses can be put forward based on our rudimentary understanding of the sites involved in water breathing in lampreys and teleost fishes, and those involved in air breathing in pre-metamorphic anuran ampibians. The pumps involved in producing both water and air breathing in fishes are highly conserved, a buccal pump, assisted by pharyngeal and/or parabranchial/opercular pumps, produce both forms of ventilation. What varies between species are the manner in which air breaths are produced (in two versus four phases), and the \u2018valving\u2019 involved in producing water flow over the gills versus air flow in and out of air-breathing organs. The latter suggests that a major step in the evolution of air breathing was the evolution of the mechanisms that control the flow of the respiratory medium.

At birth, three offspring/females were euthanized so that the chondrocytes could be extracted. At 7, 14 and 21 days of culture, the chondrocytes were subjected to the MTT cell viability assay and an evaluation of their alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis. Chondrocytes were also stained by Hematoxylin-eosin, PAS, Safranin-O and Alcian Blue. The Sox-9, Runx-2, aggrecan, collagen-II and alkaline phosphatase gene transcript levels were also evaluated. Mean comparisons were performed by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test.Chondrocyte cultures from the 25\u202fmg/kg group had the lowest results, as chondrocytes from this group had reduced viability, percentage of cells, alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen and chondrogenic matrix synthesis. A reduced expression of Sox-9, alkaline phosphatase and collagen-II was also detected in the 25\u202fmg/kg group. Chondrocyte cultures of the group treated with 50\u202fmg/kg caffeine showed reduced collagen synthesis and Sox-9 expression. The caffeine dose of 100\u202fmg/kg also reduced collagen and Sox-9 and alkaline phosphatase expression.Caffeine administered to pregnant rats negatively alters the articular cartilage chondrocytes of their offspring, reducing the synthesis of collagen and Sox-9 expression regardless of the dose. This study also concluded that the effects of caffeine are not linear or dose-dependent.",

     "abstract": "CYP2C and CYP2\u202fJ enzymes, commonly named as cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases, convert arachidonic acid to four regioisomeric epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), biologically active eicosanoids with many functions in organism. EETs are rapidly hydrolysed to less active dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). We investigated spatio-temporal expression pattern of CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2\u202fJ2 and sEH in normal human placenta by immunohistochemical method. In the villous trophoblast, CYP2C8 was the most abundant protein. Its expression is higher than the CYP2C9 and CYP2\u202fJ2 in the cytotrophoblast in the embryonic stage of development and remains higher in syncytiotrophoblast of term placenta. Unlike to CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2\u202fJ2 expression decrease in term placenta. sEH expression increases with gestation age and is strictly limited to cytotrophoblast in embryonic and foetal stages of the development. Moreover, CYP2C8 shows more intensive staining than the other protein monitored in Hofbauer cells in villous stroma. Specific information regarding the exact role of EETs and DHETs functions in a normal placenta is still unknown. Based on CYP epoxygenases and sEH localization and well known information about the functions of placental structures during development, we suggest that these enzymes could play different roles in various cell populations in the placenta. As the placenta is absolutely crucial for prenatal development, arachidonic acid is essential part of human nutrient and CYP epoxygenases expression can be affected by xenobiotics, further investigation of the exact role of CYP epoxygenases, sEH, and their metabolites in normal pregnancy and under pathological conditions is needed.",

We investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on EMT in the lungs of gerbils with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes.

The percentage of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine-positive cells and transforming growth factor-\u03b2-positive cells was significantly higher, the expression of E-cadherin was significantly lower, and the expression of N-cadherin was significantly higher in diabetic gerbils than in nondiabetic gerbils. These EMT characteristics were associated with a significant increase in \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression and collagen deposition in the lungs of diabetic gerbils. The increased \u03b1-SMA expression was co-localized with surfactant protein-C in alveolar type II cells in hyperglycemic animals.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression, location and function of c-kit in the intestinal epithelium. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RT-PCR were performed to detect the expression and location of c-kit in the intestinal mucosa of WT mice. We investigated intestinal epithelial proliferation and migration in vivo by performing 5-Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and Ki-67 staining in WT and Wads m/m mice. An Ussing chamber with fluorescein-isothiocyanate dextran 4000 was used to detect the transepithelial electric resistance (TER), short circuit current (ISC) and permeability across ex vivo colon segments under control and endotoxaemia conditions. We demonstrated that c-kit was located and expressed in the gut crypt compartment in WT mice, which was demonstrated in the c-kit mutant mice (Wads m/m). In addition, both the number of proliferating cells and the percentage of the distance migrated were lower in the Wads m/m mice than those in the WT mice. Moreover, the intestinal permeability, TER and tight junction were unaltered in the Wads m/m mice under endotoxic conditions compared with those in both the control condition and the WT mice. Altogether, these observations imply that the expression of c-kit in the colonic epithelium is involved in the proliferation and permeability of the colonic epithelium.",

Co-treatment with curcumin-I inverted these damages and exhibited a significant neuroprotective potential, thus, both TH expression and locomotor performance was reinstated in intoxicated rats. These results prove a profound dopaminergic and astroglial damages following subchronic Cu exposition and new beneficial curative potential of curcumin against subchronic Cu-induced astroglial and dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Consequently, we suggest that Cu neurotoxicity may be strengthened in vivo firstly by attacking and weaking the astroglial system, and curcumin could be prized as a powerful and preventive target for the neurodegenerative diseases related metal element, especially Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

For this, adult mouse pancreatic sections were double labeled with specific antibodies against Cx30.2 and CD31, an endothelial cell marker, or with anti-\u03b1-actin smooth muscle, a smooth muscle cell (SMC) marker or anti-mucin-1, a marker of epithelial ductal cells, using immunofluorescence (IF) studies. Cx30.2-IF hot spots were found at junctional membranes of exocrine ECs and SMCs of blood vessels. Furthermore, Cx30.2 was localized in mucin-1 positive cells or epithelial ductal cells. Using immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, it was found that in vessels and ducts of different diameters, Cx30.2 was also expressed in these cell types. In addition, it was found that Cx30.2 is already expressed in these cell types in pancreatic sections of 3, 14 and 21 days postpartum. Moreover, this cell specific pattern of expression was also found in the adult rat, hamster and guinea pig pancreas. Expression of Cx30.2 mRNA and protein in the pancreas of all these species was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot studies.

Sensory epithelial surfaces of the olfactory mucosa and VNO are covered by mucosal fluid that contains secretory products derived from associated glands, and glycoconjugates in the mucosal fluid are involved in odorant reception. The VNO of brown bears contains two types of glands; submucosal vomeronasal glands (VNG) and multicellular intraepithelial glands (MIG). The present study determined the labelling profiles of 21 lectins in the olfactory glands (OG), VNG and MIG of young male brown bears. The OG reacted with 12 lectins, and the VNG and MIG were positive for seven and eight lectins, respectively. Six lectins bound only to the OG, while four reacted with both or either of the VNG and MIG, but not the OG. The differences of lectin labelling pattern between the OG and glands in the VNO suggest that glycans in covering mucosal fluids differ between the olfactory mucosa and VNO. In addition, Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin-I, Sophora japonica agglutinin and Jacalin reacted with the MIG but not the VNG, whereas Datura stramonium lectin and concanavalin A bound to the VNG, but not the MIG. These findings indicate that the properties of secretory substances differ between the two types of glands in the bear VNO, and that the various secretions from these two types of glands may function in the lumen of VNO together.",

A small heterochromatic body (chromocenter) formed by the Y chromosome is evident in the somatic cells of P. megistus, differing in size and chromosome type contribution from the well-studied chromocenters present in T. infestans. While the overall distribution of histone epigenetic marks differ when comparing the heterochromatin and euchromatin territories in T. infestans, no similar data have been established for other hemipteran reduviids, including P. megistus. In the present work, histone acetylation and methylation marks were investigated in cells of Malpighian tubules of P. megistus 5th instar nymphs using immunocytochemical assays and compared to previously published data for T. infestans. Although similarities between these species were found regarding absence of acetylated H3K9, H4K8 and H4K16, and H3K9me and H3K9me2 in the chromocenter, presence of these marks in euchromatin, and presence of H3K9me3 in the chromocenter, no intimate association of acetylated H4K8 and 18S rDNA was revealed in the chromocenter of P. megistus. The elevated abundance of H3K9me2 marks at the nuclear periphery in P. megistus cells, differing from data for T. infestans, is suggested to reflect differences in the interaction of lamina-associated chromatin domains with the nuclear lamina, methyl-transferase modulation and/or association with the last DNA endoreplication step in 5th instar nymphs, which is a matter for further investigation.",

Additionally, the high dose of Allura Red led to a reduction in the volume of mPFC (35%) and its subdivisions, number of neurons (59%) and glial cells (46%), length of dendrites, and number of spines (mushroom and thin) per dendritic length in comparison to the distilled water group (p\u2009<\u20090.05). The low dose group only showed a reduction in the number of glial cells. However, simultaneous treatment of rats with taurine plus Allura Red prevented the above-mentioned changes. The acceptable daily dose of Allura Red could bring about impairment in spatial learning and memory as well as in the number of glial cells.

     "abstract": "A new peculiar stromal cell type called telocyte (TC)/CD34-positive stromal cell (i.e. cell with distinctive prolongations named telopodes) has recently been described in various tissues and organs, including the adult skeletal muscle interstitium of mammals. By forming a resident stromal three-dimensional network, TCs have been suggested to participate in different physiological processes within the skeletal muscle tissue, including homeostasis maintenance, intercellular signaling, tissue regeneration/repair and angiogenesis. Since a continuous interplay between the stromal compartment and skeletal muscle fibers seems to take place from organogenesis to aging, the present study was undertaken to investigate for the first time the presence of TCs in the human skeletal muscle during early myogenesis. In particular, we describe the morphological distribution of TCs in human fetal lower limb skeletal muscle during early stages of myogenesis (9\u201312 weeks of gestation). TCs were studied on tissue sections subjected to immunoperoxidase-based immunohistochemistry for CD34. Double immunofluorescence was further performed to unequivocally differentiate TCs (CD34-positive/CD31-negative) from vascular endothelial cells (CD34-positive/CD31-positive). Our findings provide evidence that stromal cells with typical morphological features and immunophenotype of TCs are present in the human skeletal muscle during early myogenesis, revealing differences in either CD34 immunopositivity or TC numbers among different gestation ages. Specifically, few TCs weakly positive for CD34 were found between 9 and 9.5 weeks. From 10 to 11.5 weeks, TCs were more numerous and strongly reactive and their telopodes formed a reticular network in close relationship with blood vessels and primary and secondary myotubes undergoing separation. On the contrary, a strong reduction in the number and immunopositivity of TCs was observed in fetal muscle sections from 12 weeks of gestation, where mature myotubes were evident. The muscle stroma showed parallel changes in amount, density and organization from 9 to 12 weeks. Moreover, blood vessels appeared particularly numerous between 10 and 11.5 weeks. Taken together, our findings suggest that TCs might play a fundamental role in the early myogenetic period, possibly guiding tissue organization and compartmentalization, as well as angiogenesis and maturation of myotubes.",

     "abstract": "A general problem in immunocytochemistry is the development of a reliable multiple immunolabeling method with primary antibodies originating from the same host species. When primary antibodies are raised in the same host species, the secondary species-specific antibodies can cross-react with each of the primary antibodies. This obstacle can however be avoided with the use of striping buffers eluting the primary/secondary antibody complex. After elution of the previous primary/secondary antibody complex, the next primary antibody from the same host species can be applied. Recently, a group from VENTANA (Tucson, AZ, USA) presented a fully automated multiplex protocol for fluorescent immunohistochemistry on the platform of VENTANA\u2019s BenchMark ULTRA slide stainer using the same species antibodies in combination with tyramide signal amplification. We adapted the automated protocol of VENTANA for the use in a routine histochemical laboratory and present here a standard procedure with a manual mode of operation for simultaneously detecting two or more antigens from the same host species.",

The blood glucose level was reduced in the treated group over time till reaching its acceptable level whereas it was increased in the diabetic group. The oxidative stress was decreased in the treated group compared to the diabetic one. The treated group showed increased expression of the insulin gene compared to the diabetic group. The immune-histochemical analysis of insulin showed an increased number and size of pancreatic islets in the treated group compared to the diabetic one.

FSH binds to a specific G protein-coupled receptor (FSHR) belonging to the glycoprotein hormone receptor family that plays an essential role in reproduction. Although the primary location of FSHR is in the gonads (mainly in ovarian follicles), FSHR protein and/or mRNA have also been detected in extragonadal female reproductive tissues including embryo, placenta, endometrium, cervix, ovarian cancer tissues, and/or endometriotic lesions in several species. To determine the pattern of FSHR expression in the uterus and placenta, uterine tissues were collected at the early, mid- and/or late luteal phases of the estrous cycle from non-treated or FSH-treated ewes, and utero-placental tissues were collected during early pregnancy followed by immunohistochemistry and image generation. FSHR was immunolocalized to several uterine and utero-placental compartments including luminal epithelium, endometrial glands and surrounding stroma, myometrium, and endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cells in endometrium, myometrium and mesometrium. Intensity of staining and distribution of FSHR in selected compartments differed and seems to depend on the stage of the estrous cycle or pregnancy, and FSH-treatment. These novel data demonstrate differential expression of FSHR protein indicating that FSH plays a specific role in regulation of uterine and utero-placenta functions in sheep.",

The study included 32 peripubertal Wistar rats, divided into 4 groups: control (T-N-), nandrolone (T-N+), physical activity (T+N-) and physical activity plus nandrolone (T+N+) groups. The T+N- and T+N+ group swam for 4 weeks, 1\u202fh/day, 5 days/week. The T-N+ and T+N+ groups received nandolone decanoate (20\u202fmg/kg b.w.) once per week, subcutaneously. Subsequently, the rats were sacrificed and muscle specimens were prepared for the processing. Tissue sections were histochemically and immunohistochemically stained, while the image analysis was used for quantification. Longitudinal diameter of quadriceps muscle cells was increased for 21% in T-N+, for 57% in T+N- and for 64% in T+N+ group while cross section muscle cell area was increased in T-N+ for 19%, in T+N- for 47% and in T+N+ group for 59%, compared to the control.

Furthermore, early pregnancy is an uncharacterized process in these species, especially in regard to the ultrastructural, biochemical and genetic changes that the uterine epithelial surface undergoes to allow embryo implantation. The present study describes the uterine horn luminal surface and the characteristics of the mucinous glycocalyx in non-pregnant and early pregnant (15 days) female alpacas. In addition, the relative abundance of Mucin 1 and 16 genes (MUC1 and MUC16) was determined, as well as the relative mRNA abundance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that could be involved in MUC shedding during early pregnancy. Noticeable changes were detected in the uterine luminal epithelium and glycocalyx of pregnant alpacas in comparison to non-pregnant ones, as well as presence of MUCs and MMPs in the endometrial environment. The decrease in glycocalyx staining and in the relative abundance of MUC 1 and MUC 16 transcripts in pregnant females would allow embryo attachment to the luminal epithelium and its subsequent implantation, as has been described in other mammals. These results suggest a crucial role of MUC1 and MUC16 and a possible role of MMPs in successful embryo implantation and survival in alpacas.",

We analyzed 150 embryos, 25 neonates and 5 juveniles by means of observations under a stereoscopic magnifying glass and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin-eosin staining techniques and the PAS reaction. For the immunohistochemical analysis, the expression of GnRHR and PCNA in embryos corresponding to stages 41, 43 and in neonates of 2, 5, 7 and 75 days post-hatch was revealed in testicular histological preparations. That gonadal outline is evident in stage 18. In stage 29, the testes are constituted of a medulla in which the PGCs are surrounded by the Sertoli cells, constituting the seminiferous tubules. From stage 37 a greater organization of the tubules is visualized and at the time of hatching the testicle is constituted of the closed seminiferous tubules, formed of the PGCs and Sertoli cells. The Leydig cells are evident outside the tubules. In the juvenile stages, the differentiation of germline cells and the organization of small vessels that irrigate the developing testicle begin to be visible. In the analyzed stages, the immunodetection of the GnRHR receptor and PCNA revealed specific marking in the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear zone for GnRHR and in the nucleus of the germline cells in juvenile testicles for PCNA. These results can be used as a basis for further study of endocrine regulation events during testicular ontogeny in avian species.",

This study was conducted to report a series of eight ameloblastomas with adenoid features, highlighting their clinicopathological and immunohistochemical aspects.Out of 71 cases of ameloblastomas, this study classified 8 cases as ameloblastomas with adenoid features. Clinicopathological data and immunohistochemistry for CK7, CK14, CK19, IMP3, p53 and Ki-67 were evaluated.From those cases of ameloblastoma exhibiting adenoid features, there were 4 women and 4 men, with mean age of 39 years. Most cases affected the mandible and all presented radiographically as a radiolucency. The predominant histopathological features were pseudoducts, squamous metaplasia, nuclear hyperchromatism, clear cells, whorled aspect of epithelial structures, cribriform growth pattern, proliferation of spindle cells and extracellular eosinophilic material. Immunohistochemical analysis showed high expression for CK14 (n\u202f=\u202f6) and CK19 (n\u202f=\u202f3) and all cases (n\u202f=\u202f8) were negative for p53, IMP3 and CK7.

We examined the cytotoxicity of different extracts (distilled water, 20\u201380% EtOH) of S. quelpaertensis on HepG2 cells and their hepatoprotective effect on HepG2 cells stimulated by ethanol (800\u202fmM, 24\u202fh). Furthermore, we measured reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ethanol toxicity induced cell death, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. In in vivo experiments, liver damage was induced by oral administration of 5\u202fg/kg ethanol with or without potent ethanol extract of S. quelpaertensis (10 or 100\u202fmg/kg) 12\u202fh interval for a total of 3 doses.

SQEE80 treatment (250, 500\u202f\u03bcg/mL) in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells showed significant attenuation of ROS production and ethanol toxicity induced cell death. Furthermore, SQEE80 markedly increased the activity of antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 in ethanol exposed HepG2 cells compared to ethanol stimulated cells. In in vivo experiments, SQEE80 treatment evidently suppressed the alcohol-induced histopathological changes in liver, serum ethanol content, and expression of cytochrome P450 2E1. Furthermore, SQEE80 significantly reversed the reduction of glutathione level in the ethanol challenged liver. Taken together, we suggest the possibility of developing SQEE80 as a natural hepatoprotective substance in attenuating alcohol-induced oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease in which the body fails to produce enough insulin or increased tissue resistance to insulin. The diabetes may have profound effects on placental development and function. This study was designed to detect the placental changes in pregnancy associated with DM comparing these changes with normal placenta. The study was carried out on sixty full-term placentae; divided into three equal groups; control group (group I): placentae of normal pregnancy, uncontrolled diabetes (group II): placentae from pregnant women whose blood glucose is poorly controlled during pregnancy. Controlled diabetes (group III): includes placentae from diabetic women whose blood glucose is controlled during pregnancy. The placentae from group II tend to be heavier and exhibited immaturity of villi, villous edema, fibrosis, excessive syncytial knots formation and infarctions. In addition to, fibrinoid necrosis, increased thickness of vasculosyncytial membrane, syncytial basement membrane, microvillous abnormalities and vascular endothelial changes were demonstrated. The syncytial multivesicular knots were present in placentae of group II. The nuclei within these syncytial knots display condensed chromatin, either dispersed throughout the nucleus or in the form of dense peripheral clumps with and numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles. The syncytial basement membrane showed focal areas of increase in its thickness and irregularity. Villous cytotrophoblasts showed increased number and activity in the form of numerous secretory granules, abundant dilated RER, larger distorted mitochondria. Villous vessels showed various degrees of abnormalities in the form of endothelial cell enlargement, folding, thickening and protrusion of their luminal surfaces into vascular lumen making it narrower in caliber. In placentae of group III, most of these abnormalities decreased. In most of placentae of group III, the VSM appeared nearly normal in thickness and showed nearly normal composition of one layer of syncytiotrophoblastic cells, one layer of smooth, regular capillary endothelium and the space between them. Mild microvillous abnormalities were noted in few placentae as they appeared short and blunted with mild decrease in their number per micron. The electron picture of syncytial knots appeared nearly normal containing aggregations of small, condensed hyperchromatic nuclei, minimal vacuoles could be seen in the cytoplasm of syncytial knots. Syncytial basement membrane appeared regular and nearly normal in its thickness and composition coming in direct contact with fetal blood capillaries but mild abnormalities were noted in the basement membrane in few placentae as increased its thickness and deposition of fibers or fibrinoid. Regarding cytotrophoblasts in the terminal villi of placentae with controlled diabetes, these cells appeared nearly normal. They were scattered beneath the syncytium and were active containing mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes and a large nucleus with fine dispersed chromatin. The vascular ultrastructural pattern in terminal villi of placentae of this group showed no significant abnormalities and was normally distributed in the villous tree. The luminal surface of the vascular endothelium appeared regular smooth in the majority of placentae of this group. The endothelial cells appeared connected to each other with tight junctions. It could be concluded that whether if long-term diabetes is controlled or not, placentae of diabetic mother showed a variety of significant histological structural changes seen more frequently than in the placentae of pregnant women without diabetes.",

Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were randomly distributed into 3 groups. Control group; given 1\u202fml distilled water daily for 6 weeks.

Retinal specimens were prepared for histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical study using anti-PDE5 and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies. Morphometric and statistical studies were performed. Tadalafil group displayed a significant reduction in retinal thickness, diminished cell population of outer and inner nuclear layers, dilated blood capillaries and a significant decline in the number of ganglion cells. Significant reductions of both PDE5 and Bcl-2 immunoexpression were observed. At the ultrastructural level, the photoreceptors showed spacing of outer segments and disorganized membranous discs. Retinal neurons showed ultrastructural degenerative changes in the form of shrunken irregular nuclei, dilated rER, and disrupted mitochondria. Withdrawal group revealed preservation of histological structure and partial restoration of retinal thickness, retinal cells ultrastructure, and PDE5 and Bcl-2 immunoexpressions. In conclusion, chronic use of tadalafil could induce reversible apoptotic and degenerative changes in retinal neurons due to its inhibitory effect on PDE5 expression which affects the metabolism and viability of retinal cells.",

The current study aimed to inspect the expression of OBAP in the kidney of twelve 10-week-old male C3H/HeNJc1 mice using immunohistochemistry, and immunoelectron microscopic localization. The immunohistochemical investigation revealed an OBAP positive reaction mainly in the medulla, which was stronger than the cortex of the kidney and was concentrated in the distal convoluted tubules (DCT), connecting tubules (CT), and the thick limbs of the loop of Henle (HL). Moreover, we clarified that the OBAP was co-distributed with ghrelin and calbindin (markers of the DCT). Interestingly, immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that OBAP was concentrated in the mitochondrial inner membrane of the DCT and CT. Based on these results, it was concluded that the mitochondria of the DCT, CT, and HL of the mice kidney generate OBAP. Furthermore, our results suggest that OBAP might have a role in the regulation of calcium reabsorption by the renal tubule; however, further investigations are required to clarify this potential role.",

     "abstract": "Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) regulate a number of important physiological functions. Alteration of mAChR expression or function has been associated in the etiology of several pathologies including functional bladder disorders (e.g bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis \u2013 BPS/IC). In a previous study we found specific mAChR expression patterns associated with BPS/IC, while correlation between protein and gene expression was lacking. Posttranslational regulatory mechanisms, e.g. altered intracellular receptor trafficking, could explain those differences. In addition, alternative G protein (GP) coupling could add to the pathophysiology via modulation of muscarinic signaling. In our proof-of-principle study, we addressed these questions in situ. We established PLA in combination with confocal laserscanning microscopy (CLSM) and 3D object reconstruction for highly specific detection and analysis of muscarinic 3 receptors (M3), G protein (GP) coupling and intracellular trafficking in human detrusor samples.Paraffin sections of formalin-fixed bladder tissue (FFPE) of BPS/IC patients receiving transurethral biopsy were examined by Cy3-PLA for M3 expression, coupling of M3 to GPs (G\u03b1q/11, G\u03b1s, G\u03b1i) and interaction of M3 with endocytic regulator proteins.

Calculated receptor densities correlated significantly with existing confocal expression data, while significantly improved specificity of M3 detection by PLA was verified using bladder tissue samples from transgenic mice. 50\u201360% of the M3 receptor complexes were plasma membrane associated in human bladder detrusor. Application of PLA for M3 and GPs allowed visualization of M3-GP interactions and revealed individual GP-subtype coupling patterns. Detection of M3 interactions with endocytic trafficking proteins by PLA resulted in object sizes correlating with well-documented vesicle sizes of the endocytosis pathway.PLA enabled highly specific detection of M3 receptor expression, demonstration of M3/GP differential coupling and intracellular M3 trafficking in human detrusor smooth muscle cells. This new approach minimized background fluorescence and antibody cross-reactions resulting from single antibody application, and enhanced specificity due to the use of two primary antibodies. Use of subcellular markers allowed visualization of subcellular receptor location. PLA/CLSM allows analyses of muscarinic \u201creceptor \u2013 G protein \u2013 promiscuity\u201d and intracellular trafficking even in bladder paraffin sections and may give new insights into the etiology and pathology of BPS/IC.",

Kidneys were stained with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) to measure the area, perimeter, diameter and radius of renal corpuscles, glomeruli and proximal convoluted tubules (PCTs). Blood tests were conducted to determine hepatotoxicity.No significant changes in histopathology were seen. Melatonin stimulated pancreatic islet abundance, as the number of islets per mm2 was significantly higher in the C/M+ than in the C/ART-/M- and ART+/M+. Parameters of the renal corpuscle, glomeruli, renal space and PCTs were significantly lower in the C/ART+ compared to the other groups, thus cART may have caused tubular dysfunction or cellular damage. A significant increase in serum haemoglobin was observed in the C/ART+ compared to the C/ART-, which showed cART increases serum haemoglobin in the absence of immune deficiency. Serum lipids were significantly decreased in the C/M+ compared to the C/ART-, possibly due to the effect of melatonin on the decrease of lipolysis, decreasing effect on cholesterol absorption and stimulation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that melatonin stimulated \u03b1-cell production, increased the number of pancreatic islets and caused a decrease in total lipids, whereas cART increased serum haemoglobin and decreased various parameters of the nephron in an HIV-free rat model, suggestive of tubular dysfunction.",

Despite this, transplantation of 84\u202fh harvested pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) tissues have been shown to have the same functional ability to foetal pancreata, but there was only 40% success in reverting hyperglycaemia. We tested the potential of early islets with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) to promote isogeneic grafts survival and to restore normoglycemia in diabetic rats, in comparison with late islets. Islets were isolated from injured adult pancreata of donor rats at 24\u202fh post ligation either with MSCs (24\u202fh islet/MSC+) or without MSCs (24\u202fh islet/MSC-), and at 84\u202fh without MSCs (84\u202fh islet/MSC-). These cells were transplanted under the renal capsule of syngeneic STZ-diabetic recipient rats. The islet grafts were monitored using the BGLs of recipients and the immunohistomorphology of the grafts were analysed using anti-insulin and anti-Ki67 antibodies. The mean BGL in 24\u202fh islet/MSC+ recipients was reduced over time toward the control value. The curves of the mean BGLs in the control islet/MSC- and the 24\u202fh islet/MSC- recipients dropped significantly below the control normal glucose group\u2019s levels to reach their nadirs on weeks 4 and 6, respectively. Both curves had a peak overshoot on week 9, with no statistical significant difference between them. Engrafted islets were evident in these recipients, lasted for 5 and 6 weeks and correspondingly survived failure. However, insulin+ cells were present in the isografts of all recipients; but, only isografts in the 24\u202fh islet/MSC+ presented with a homogenous subcapsular beta cell mass. In addition, the tendency of 24\u202fh islet/MSC- to restore normoglycaemia with its survival capacity was statistically highly significant compared to the 84 islet/MSC- recipients (80%; 20%; p\u202f=\u202f0.001). Transplantation of early islets with MSCs from injured adult pancreata prolongs islet graft survival and improves isograft function in diabetic rats. This novel observation requires much further exploration for its clinical application, but this model already provides hope for new sources of donor islets for transplantation.",

     "abstract": "The adrenal medulla is crucial for the survival of species facing significant environmental changes. The parenchyma is composed mainly of chromaffin cells, ganglion cells and sustentacular cells (SC). The male viscacha exhibits seasonal variations of gonadal activity and other metabolic functions. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the reproductive conditions on the morphology of SC of this rodent. In addition, the effects of testosterone and melatonin on these cells were studied. Immunoexpression of S100 protein, GFAP and vimentin were analyzed. Furthermore, the distribution of adrenergic and noradrenergic chromaffin cells subpopulations was studied for the first time in this species. SC present long cytoplasmic processes in contact with chromaffin cells, probably generating an intraglandular communication network. Significant differences (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the %IA (percentage of immunopositive area) for the S100 protein were observed according to winter (4.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.34) and summer (3.51\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.15) values. In castrated animals, the %IA (6.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.35) was significantly higher in relation to intact animals (3.95\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.40). In melatonin-treated animals the %IA (3.62\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.23) was significantly higher compared to control animals (2.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.26). GFAP immunoexpression was negative and no noradrenergic chromaffin cells were detected suggesting an adrenergic phenotype predominance. Vimentin was observed in SC, endothelial cells and connective tissue. Results indicate that SC exhibit variations along the annual reproductive cycle, along with castration and the melatonin administration. Our results suggest that in this rodent SC are not only support elements, but also participate in the modulation of the activity of the adrenal medulla; probably through paracrine effects.",

In hepatopancreas and foregut, another intense positive band was detected at molecular weight of 30\u202fkDa, which could be an isotype of LEP-R. By immunohistochemistry, LEP-R-ir was detected in the neurons, and neuropils in the brain, thoracic ganglia, and abdominal ganglia. In the gastrointestinal tract, there was intense LEP-R-ir in the apical part of the epithelial cells of the foregut, midgut, and hindgut. In addition, LEP-R-ir was found in the Restzellen(R)cells and Fibrillenzellen(F) cells in the hepatopancreas. In the ovary, LEP-R-ir was detected in early stage of oocytes and mature oocytes. Intense LEP-R-ir was observed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes of the small and orange claw male prawns. In addition, LEP-R was seen in the high epithelium of spermatic ducts from all male morphotypes. In summary, the detection of the LEP-R-ir suggests the existence of a LEP-R in several organs of M. rosenbergii. Through binding with leptin peptide, LEP-R may be an important signaling molecule that has critical functions in modulating and controlling food intake, energy expenditure, and reproduction in this prawn.",

Since various body organs of the camel are under high ecological and physiological stress during food and water deprivation, desiccation, and the long exposure to solar radiation in these desert nomads, we aimed to examine the immunohistochemical expression of apoptosis-related biomarkers in some of its normal body organs to illustrate a basic track for further pathological investigation. Regarding apoptosis, the present study has revealed that the higher expression of cleaved caspase-9 (CC9) [initiator of the intrinsic pathway] and CC3 (effector caspase), and the scanty expression of CC8 (initiator of the extrinsic pathway), highlight the role of the caspase-dependent, intrinsic apoptotic pathway particularly in the intestines and lymphoid organs. The apoptosis- inducing factor (AIF)-immunoexpression was completely missing in the cell nuclei of the examined tissues, indicating the absence of the caspase-independent pathway. The nuclear overexpression of the phospho-histone H2AX (\u03b3 H2AX) and the occasional expression of single-stranded DNA, particularly among the CNS neurons, suggest an efficient, protective DNA-repair mechanism in such cells. Thus, despite efficient anti-apoptotic mechanisms intrinsic apoptotic pathways exists in brain, intestine and lymph organs of adult desert camels.",

In these cases, the nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (NAD(P)H) coenzyme and dehydrogenases from metabolically active cells reduce tetrazolium salts to strongly colored and lipophilic formazan products, which are then quantified by absorbance (MTT) or fluorescence (CTC). More recently, certain sulfonated tetrazolium, which give rise to water-soluble formazans, have also proved useful for cytotoxicity assays. We describe several aspects of the application of tetrazolium salts and formazans in biomedical cell biology research, mainly regarding formazan-based colorimetric assays, cellular reduction of MTT, and localization and fluorescence of the MTT formazan in lipidic cell structures.

Here we address these aspects in the adult rat lumbar DRG. Cx36 mRNA was detected using qRT-PCR, and Cx36 protein was identified in DRG sections using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). Double staining revealed that Cx36 co-localizes with both anti-\u03b2-III tubulin, a neuronal marker, and anti-glutamine synthetase, a satellite glial cell (SGC) marker. In neurons, Cx36 staining was mostly uniform in somata and fibers of all sizes and its intensity increased at the cell membranes. This labeling pattern was in contrast with Cx36 IF dots mainly found at junctional membranes in islet beta cells used as a control tissue. Co-staining with anti-Cx43 and anti-Cx36 showed that whereas mostly uniform staining of Cx36 was found throughout neurons and SGCs, Cx43 IF puncta were localized to SGCs. Cx36 mRNA was expressed in normal lumbar DRG, and it was significantly down-regulated in L4 DRG of rats that underwent sciatic nerve injury resulting in persistent hypersensitivity. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that neurons and SGCs express Cx36 protein in normal DRG, and suggested that perturbation of Cx36 levels may contribute to chronic neuropathic pain resulting from a peripheral nerve injury.",

     "abstract": "The MTT assay was the first widely accepted method to assess cytotoxicity and cell viability. However, there is controversy on whether this indicator is a useful tool. In this work we intend to expand the interpretability of the MTT study by its combination with widely used cellular biology techniques. We propose complementary approaches to the colorimetric assay, based on the use of measurements in three different settings: confocal microscopy, multi-well plate assay and flow cytometry. Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that MTT uptake and reduction by cells is a time-dependent process, and that formazan accumulates in round-shaped organelles. Quantitative measurements with a multi-well fluorimeter combined with nuclear staining result in a useful method, yielding a ratio between formazan production and cell number that informs about the average cell metabolic state. We also found that flow cytometry is a suitable technique to measure MTT reduction in large cell populations. When assaying the effect of an oxidizing agent such as paraquat (PQ), this approach allows for the distinction of subpopulations of cells with different reducing power. Finally, we prove that it is feasible to monitor MTT reduction in an in vivo model, the Drosophila larvae, without affecting its survival rate. Formazan accumulates exclusively in the larval fat body, confirming its lipid solubility. The methods explored in this work expand the MTT potential as a useful tool to provide information of the physiological state of cells and organisms.",

To clarify their involvement in the central control of osmotic homeostasis, we investigated the effect of 14\u202fdays of salt loading (with drinking water containing 2% NaCl) and then reversibly to 30\u202fdays of normal hydration (with drinking water without salt), first on the expression by western-blotting and the distribution by immunochemistry of Dp71 and \u03b11Syn in the SON of the rat and, second, on the level of some physiological parameters, as the plasma osmolality, natremia and hematocrit.Dp71 is the most abundant form of dystrophin revealed in the supraoptic nucleu (SON) of control rat. Dp71 was localized in magnocellular neurons (MCNs) and astrocytes, when \u03b11Syn was observed essentially in astrocytes end feet. After 14\u202fdays of salt-loading, Dp71 and \u03b11Syn signals decreased and a dual signal for these two proteins was revealed in the astrocytes processes SON surrounding blood capillaries. In addition, salt loading leads to an increase in plasma osmolality, natremia and hematocrit. Reversibly, after 30\u202fdays of normal hydration, the intensity of the signal for the two proteins, Dp71 and \u03b11Syn, increased and approached that of control.

Their localization in astrocyte end feet emphasizes their importance in neuronal\u2013vascular\u2013astrocyte interactions for the central detection of osmolality.

For this reason, specific studies related to the organ of hypertension are performed in experimental animals. The heart and kidney tissue, which are the most important organs that hypertension has damaged, have formed specific organs of our work.In our experimental study, a total of 35 (hypertensive group: 20, control group: 15) Rattus Norvegicus Wistar albino rats were used.

Increasing expression of all analyzed factors (except FGF8) characterized both the multilayered human apical ectodermal ridge (AER), sub-ridge mesenchyme (progress zone) and chondrocytes in developing human limbs.

Nuclear expression of Ki-67 proliferating cells, and partly of MSX-1 and MSX-2 was detected in the whole limb primordium. Strong expression of factors p19 and RIP5, both in the AER and mesenchyme of human developing limbs indicates their possible involvement in control of cell senescence and cell death.

Expression of FGF2 and downstream RIP5 gene, and transcription factors Msx-1 and MSX-2 did not show human-specific changes in expression pattern.

PcG proteins form two large repressive complexes, namely, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 and 2.

Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the expression patterns of five human PcG proteins, including Bmi-1, Ring1b, Mel-18, Ezh2, and Suz12, in various cellular components of odontogenic keratocysts (OKCs), ameloblastomas and, pericoronal follicles (PFs). In OKCs, expression of PcG proteins were found in the majority of cases while the expression pattern was relatively different for each PcG proteins. All PcG proteins were strongly expressed in the basal cells while some proteins showed variable expression in the parabasal and luminal cell layer of OKCs. In ameloblastomas, almost all PcG proteins showed a similar expression pattern of moderate to strong staining in the peripheral ameloblast-like cells and metaplastic squamous cells.

The present study provides the initial evidence regarding epigenetic involvement by PcG proteins in these odontogenic lesions. Although these proteins are known to be in the same repressive group proteins, differential expression patterns of these proteins in OKCs and ameloblastomas indicates that these proteins may play different roles in pathogenesis of these odontogenic lesions.",

     "abstract": "To study the expression patterns of claudin-5 and its related signals during luteal regression in rats, a sequential PMSG/hCG treatment paradigm was used to obtain a single, well-defined generation of corpus luteum (CL). A total of 35 rats were treated with one PGF or two PGF at an interval of 24\u202fh from day 7 of pseudopregnancy to induce CL regression. Serum and ovaries were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8 or 24\u202fh after one PGF injection (1 PGF), 2 or 24\u202fh after two PGF injections (2 PGF). The serum progesterone level was detected by RIA; the ovarian expression of claudin-5, the phosphorylations of STAT3 (p-STAT3), Akt (p-Akt), ERK1/2 (p-ERK) and p38 MAPK (p-p38) were detected by western blot, real-time PCR and IHC. Results showed that serum progesterone (P4) decreased after PGF treatment. Claudin-5 mRNA decreased at 4\u202fh and 8\u202fh after 1 PGF and 2\u202fh after 2 PGF, and claudin-5 protein decreased at 4\u202fh after 1 PGF. p-STAT3 increased at 4\u202fh after 1 PGF and 2\u202fh after 2 PGF. p-ERK increased at 2\u202fh after 2 PGF. The level of p-Akt decreased at 4\u202fh after 1 PGF. PGF treatment did not alter the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK at any time points in this study. IHC results revealed that claudin-5 was expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of steroidogenic cells and in the vessels, while PGF induced-p-STAT3 was expressed uniformly in the cytoplasm of luteal steroidogenic cells. In conclusion, PGF treatment decreased the expression of claudin-5 and the additional PGF treatment enhanced the decrease in claudin-5 mRNA expression and the increases in ERK1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation in the corpus luteum of pseudopregnant rats, which will contribute new information to the further study of molecular mechanism of luteal regression.",

Adult male Wistar rats were orally treated with 25 or 50\u202fmg/kg bw of AA for 3 weeks. Qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemical evaluation of glucagon and insulin expression and stereological analyses of pancreatic alpha and beta cells were performed.

In insulin-immunolabeled pancreatic sections in AA-treated animals was observed decrease of intensity of insulin immunopositive signal, beta cell surface, numerical and volume densities and volume density of beta cell cytoplasm. Serum insulin and glucose concentrations remained unchanged after both AA treatments. The number of islets of Langerhans was not affected by AA treatment.

Epileptic neuronal activation was evaluated through the immunohistochemical detection of c-fos protein in the cerebellar cortex. Generalized seizures were precipitated by the intraperitoneal injection of 4-aminopyridine. The animals were pretreated with the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 (2\u202fmg/kg), amantadine (50\u202fmg/kg), and the AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 hydrochloride (50\u202fmg/kg). Two hours after 4-aminopyridine injection, the number of c-fos immunostained cell nuclei was counted in serial immunohistochemical sections of the cerebellar vermis. The number of c-fos immunostained cell nuclei in the granular layer decreased significantly in animals pretreated with the glutamate receptor antagonists compared to the untreated animals having convulsion. We can conclude that mossy fiber stimulation exerts its seizure-generating action mainly through the ionotropic glutamate receptors of the mossy fiber synapses. Both NMDA and AMPA receptor antagonists are effective in reducing glutamate-mediated postsynaptic effects in the cerebellar cortex.",

Toll-like receptor2 (TLR2) and Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) Inflammasome are implicated in hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis; the histological landmark stages of NASH. TXNIP, a member of \u03b1-arrestin family activates NLRP3 in response to various danger stimuli. The aim of current work was to investigate the effect of TXNIP genetic deletion on histological manifestations of high fat diet-induced steatohepatitis and activation of TLR2-NLRP3-inflammasome axis. Wild-type mice (WT) and TXNIP knock out (TKO) littermates were randomized to normal diet (WT-ND and TKO-ND) or high fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) (WT-HFD and TKO-HFD). After 8-weeks, liver samples from all groups were evaluated by histological, immunohistochemical and western blot analysis. HFD resulted in significant induction of micro and macrovesicular hepatic steatosis, that was associated with increased inflammatory immune cell infiltration in WT-HFD compared with WT-ND and TKO-ND controls, but not in TKO-HFD group. In parallel, WT-HFD group showed significant fibrosis and \u03b1-SMA expression; a marker of pro-fibrotic stellate-cell activation, in areas surrounding the central vein and portal circulation, versus all other groups. Western blot revealed increased activation of TLR2-NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and downstream IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in WT-HFD group, but not in TKO-HFD group. IL-1\u03b2 expression coincided within the same areas of steatosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, collagen deposition and \u03b1-SMA expression in WT-HFD mice, that was significantly reduced in TKO-HFD mice. In conclusion, TXNIP deletion ameliorates the HFD-induced steatosis, inflammatory and fibrotic response via modulation of TLR2-NLRP3 inflammasome axis. Targeting TXNIP-TLR2-NLRP3 pathway may provide potential therapeutic modalities for NASH treatment.",

Our objectives are to explore the existence of zones in IPEH with sinusoidal hemangioma characteristics, the mechanism of papillary and septa formation in sinusoidal hemangioma and the comparison of this mechanism with that in IPEH. For these purposes, specimens of 4 cases of each entity were selected and studied by serial histologic sections and by immunochemistry and immunofluorescence procedures. The results showed a) zones with characteristics of sinusoidal hemangioma in IPEH cases, b) presence in both entities of papillae with a cover formed by a monolayer of CD34+ and CD31+ endothelial cells (ECs) and a core formed by either type I collagen and \u03b1SMA+ cells (presenting a pericyte/smooth muscle cell aspect) or thrombotic components, and c) a similar piecemeal angiogenic mechanism in papillary formation, including sprouting of intimal ECs toward the vessel wall itself or intravascular thrombi, formation of vascular loops that encircle and separate vessel wall or thrombus components, and parietal or thrombotic papillae development. The major differences between both entities were the number, arrangement and substrate of papillae: myriad, densely grouped, parietal and thrombotic papillae in IPEH, and a linear arrangement of predominant parietal papillae in sinusoidal hemangioma, originating septa (segmentation). In conclusion, sinusoidal hemangioma and IPEH are interrelated processes, which share morphologic findings and a piecemeal angiogenic mechanism, combining sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis, and leading to papillary formation and vessel segmentation.",

Our previous study has shown the selective expression/localization of EFA6D in steroidogenic adrenocortical cells in situ of adult mice. In view of the previous finding, the present study was undertaken to examine its localization in mouse Leydig cells representing another steroidogenic cell species in order to further support the possible involvement of the EFA6/Arf6 cascade via membrane trafficking in the regulation of steroidogenesis and/or secretion. A distinct band for EFA6D with the same size as that of the brain was detected in the testis of adult mice. In immuno-light microscopy, immunoreactivity for EFA6D was seen throughout the cytoplasm in most Leydig cells without any distinct accumulation along the plasmalemma. Lack of immunoreactivity for EFA6D was seen in the seminiferous tubular epithelium. In immuno-electron microscopy, the immune-labeling was seen in sporadic/focal patterns on plasma membranes and some vesicles and vacuoles subjacent to the plasma membranes. More constant and rather predominant is the labeling on numerous mitochondria. No immuno-labeling was seen in lipid droplets. The present study suggests that EFA6D is somehow involved in regulation of the synthesis and/or secretion of testosterone through the membrane-traffic by activation of Arf6. In addition, EFA6D is suggested to play in mitochondria some yet unidentified roles rather independent of Arf6-activation, which remains to be elucidated.",

Histological and ultrastructural studies were performed on parotid and submandibular glands. Measurement of salivary flow, PCR analysis and immunohistochemical assessment of CXCL10 expression have been carried-out.Muscarinic receptor antagonists led to various histological, morphometric and ultrastructural changes together with diminished salivary secretion and up-regulation of CXCL10 expression with the mildest alterations observed with solifenacin.Solifenacin has shown the least adverse effects to salivary glands.

Three implantation methods were performed; 1) Suture method is where a tissue-scaffold was implanted by suturing its border to the external oblique muscle, 2) Control method is where a tissue-scaffold was implanted without any suturing or support, 3) Frame method is where a tissue-scaffold was attached to a circular frame composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) biomaterial and placed subcutaneously. After 1 and 4 weeks, tissue-scaffolds were explanted and evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson\u2019s trichrome,Picrosirius Red, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), immunohistochemistry, and mechanical testing.Macroscopically, tissue-scaffold degradation with the suture method and tissue-scaffold folding with the control method were observed after 4 weeks. In comparison, the frame method demonstrated intact tissue scaffolds after 4 weeks. H&E staining showed progressive cell repopulation over the course of the experiment in all groups with acute and chronic inflammation observed in suture and control methods throughout the duration of the study. Immunohistochemistry quantification of CD3, CD 31, CD 34, CD 163, and \u03b1SMA showed a statistically significant differences between the suture, control and frame methods (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) at both time points.

     "abstract": "The peptides orexin A (OXA) and orexin B (OXB) derived from the proteolytic cleavage of a common precursor molecule, prepro-orexin, were originally described in the rat hypothalamus. Successively, they have been found in many other brain regions as well as in peripheral organs of mammals and other less evolved animals. The widespread localization of orexins accounts for the multiple activities that they exert in the body, including the regulation of energy homeostasis, feeding, metabolism, sleep and arousal, stress, addiction, and cardiovascular and endocrine functions. Both OXA and OXB peptides bind to two G-coupled receptors, orexin-1 (OX1R) and orexin-2 (OX2R) receptor, though with different binding affinity. Altered expression/activity of orexins and their receptors has been associated with a large number of human diseases. Though at present evidence highlighted a role for orexins and cognate receptors in mammalian reproduction, their central and/or local effects on gonadal functions remain poorly known. Here, we investigated the localization of OXB and OX2R in the rat epididymis. Immunohistochemical staining of sections from caput, corpus and cauda segments of the organ showed intense signals for both OXB and OX2R in the principal cells of the lining epithelium, while no staining was detected in the other cell types. Negative results were obtained from immunohistochemical analysis of hypothalamic and testicular tissues from OX2R knock-out mice (OX2R\u2212/\u2212) and OX1R/OX2R double knock-out (OX1R\u2212/\u2212; OX2R\u2212/\u2212) mice, thus demonstrating the specificity of the rabbit polyclonal anti-OX2R antibody used in our study. On contrary, the same antibody clearly showed the presence of OX2R in sections from hypothalamus and testis of normal mice and rats which are well known to express the receptor. Thus, our results provide the first definite evidence for the immunohistochemical localization of OXB and OX2R in the principal cells of rat epididymis.",

Earlier we have also shown that metabotropic GABAB receptors have overlapping localization in the same compartment. Moreover, activation of GABAB receptors affects the intensity of acetylcholine release. These data taken together, allows us to suggest that in the mammalian cholinergic neuromuscular junction, GABA is synthesized and performs certain synaptic signaling function.",

In this study, image analysis cytometry was used to investigate the effect of diabetes and aging on Feulgen-DNA quantities, ploidy degrees, nuclear shapes and chromatin texture in mouse cardiomyocytes compared to previously reported data for mouse hepatocytes. Adult, non-obese diabetic (NOD) hyperglycemic and normoglycemic females and 56-week-old normoglycemic BALB/c females were used. A small percentage (\u223c7%) of the cardiomyocyte nuclei in severely hyperglycemic NOD adult mice possessed higher ploidy values than those in the 8-week-old normoglycemic mice. Surprisingly, the Feulgen-DNA values and the frequency of nuclei belonging to the 4C and 8C ploidy classes were even higher (\u223c6%) in normoglycemic NOD specimens than in age-matched hyperglycemic NOD specimens. Additionally, a pronounced elongated nuclear shape was observed especially in adult normoglycemic NOD mice. In conclusion, NOD mice, irrespective of their glycemic level, exhibit a moderate increase in ploidy degrees within cardiomyocyte nuclei during the adult lifetime. As expected, aging did not affect the Feulgen-DNA values and the ploidy degrees of cardiomyocytes in BALB/c mice. The differences in ploidy degrees and chromatin textures such as absorbance variability and entropy, between adult NOD and aged BALB/c mice are consistent with other reports, indicating dissimilarities in chromatin functions between diabetes and aging.",

MicroRNA-199a downregulation is a common feature of HCC where its reduced expression contributes to mTOR and c-Met pathways activation. Notch1 activation is also a common event in HCC, influencing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, tumor invasion and recurrence at least in part through E-cadherin regulation. Here we identified a negative correlation between miR-199a-3p and Notch1 or E-cadherin protein levels in HCC patients and demonstrated that miR-199a-3p regulates E-cadherin expression through Notch1 direct targeting in in vitro models. Moreover, we showed that a strong correlation exists between miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-3p in HCC specimens and that miR-199a-5p contributes to E-cadherin regulation as well, underlying the complex network of interaction carried out by miR-199a and its influence on tumor aggressiveness. In conclusion, our findings suggest the restoration of miR-199a-3p physiologic levels as a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.",

     "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is reported to be involved in male reproductive impairment, and its impact is evident in the increased prevalence of infertility. Various studies have reported that a single parenteral injection of <40\u202fmg/kg Streptozotocin (STZ) is ineffective in ablating pancreatic \u03b2-cells and creating a rat model to investigate the effect of DM on the male reproductive system. This study therefore aims to validate these claims.Adult male Wistar rats received either a single intraperitoneal injection of STZ (30\u202fmg/kg or 60\u202fmg/kg) or saline (0.9%, Control). Diabetes was confirmed after 72\u202fh if plasma glucose levels were \u226514\u202fmmol/L. Body weight, glucose level, fluid and food intake were measured weekly. Animals were sacrificed after 8 weeks of treatment by an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (160\u202fmg/kg body weight). The testis and epididymis were harvested and weighed prior to preparation for histological evaluation. Epididymal sperm morphology was analysed using computer aided sperm analysis (CASA). STZ60 animals presented with significantly lower body weights compared to both control and STZ30 groups. Animals in both STZ30 and STZ60 groups showed decreased normal sperm morphology compared to control. Histological evaluation of the testes showed a decrease in the number of spermatozoa in the seminiferous tubules of animals in the STZ30 and STZ60 groups compared to control. A complete absence of spermiogenesis was observed in the seminiferous tubules of STZ60 animals. These findings prove that an STZ concentration of 30\u202fmg/kg, which is much lower than the reported 40\u202fmg/kg, has adverse effects on the male reproductive system via its diabetogenic effect and can therefore be used to study the impact of DM on male fertility.",

GAP-43-IRF were more abundant and diffuse than PGP 9.5-IRF at early stages, but showed similar distribution with growth, ramifying out from thick bundles in connective tissues until encircling the secretory units observed around postnatal day 21 (PN21). CGRP-IRF were detected in the mesenchyme at embryonic day 20 (E20) and PN0. CGRP-IRF became numerous around PN7 and PN10. They then decreased to the adult level at PN21, mainly located around ducts and infrequently blood vessels. NPY-IRF were sparsely detected in the mesenchyme at E20, then detected in close proximity to acini in addition to blood vessels at PN3. NPY-IRF increased till reaching the adult stage, and were mainly associated with blood vessels and around mucous cells and some serous demilunes.The findings indicated a developmental modification of the sensory and autonomic innervation which may play a role in the functional maturation of the palatine salivary glands.",

This study is aimed at investigating the neuroprotective effects of quercetin 3,4\u2019-O-\u03b2-d-diglucoside (Q3,4\u2019dG), isolated from the bulbs of the white cultivar (Allium cepa L.), using an in vitro model of human striatal precursor cells (HSPs), a primary culture isolated from the striatal primordium and previously characterized. To study the effect of Q3,4\u2019dG on cell survival, HSPs were exposed to nutrient deprivation created by replacing culture medium with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Our findings showed that Q3,4\u2019dG treatment significantly promoted cell survival and strongly decreased apoptosis induced by nutrient deprivation, as evaluated by cell proliferation/death analyses. In addition, since the adhesive capacities of cells are essential for cell survival, the expression of some adhesion molecules, such as pancadherin and focal adhesion kinase, was evaluated. Interestingly, PBS exposure significantly decreased the expression of both molecules, while in the presence of Q3,4\u2019dG this effect was prevented.This study provides evidence of a neuroprotective role exerted by Q3,4\u2019dG and suggests its possible implication in sustaining neuronal survival for prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Data regarding the effect of daidzein on the morphofunctional and histological parameters of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) system is still lacking. Therefore, using the newCAST stereological software, we investigated the effects of chronic (21 days) daidzein treatment on corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons within the hypothalamus and corticotropes (ACTH cells) in the pituitary, while image analysis was employed to-examine the intensity of fluorescence of CRH in the median eminence (ME) and adrenocorticotropin hormone in the pituitary in adult orchidectomized (Ovx) rats. Circulating ACTH and corticosterone levels were also analyzed. This study showed that daidzein treatment decreased the volume density of CRH neurons within the paraventricular nucleus as well as CRH immunofluorescence in the ME. The total number of ACTH cells was decreased, while ACTH cell volume and the intensity of ACTH fluorescence were increased following daidzein treatment. Both ACTH and corticosterone blood levels were increased after daidzein administration. The results of performed experiments clearly demonstrate that volume density of CRH neurons; total number and volume of ACTH cells, as well as stress hormones levels are vulnerable to the effects of daidzein.",

Due to the lack of information about the exact location and activity of gelatinases in mature human dentin, the present study was designed to examine gelatinolytic levels in sound dentin. In situ zymography using confocal microscopy was performed on both mineralized and demineralized dentin samples. Sites presenting gelatinase activity were identified throughout the entire biological tissue pursuing different gelatinolytic levels for distinct areas: predentin and dentinal tubule regions presented higher gelatinolytic activity compared to intertubular dentin. Dentin regions with higher gelatinolytic activity immunohistochemically were partially correlated with MMP-2 expression. The maintenance of gelatinolytic activity in mature dentin may have biological implications related to biomineralization of predentin and tubular/peritubular dentinal regions, as well as regulation of defensive mechanisms of the dentin-pulp complex.",

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a central regulator of cell growth, metabolism, proliferation, and survival, is considered an important target for anticancer drug development. The mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is another highly implicated cellular pathway in cancer and is thought to have compensatory effects in response to the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. We investigated the mechanism of anti-proliferative effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and MAPK/ERK (MEK) inhibitor PD 0325901, and the combined effect of rapamycin and PD 0325901 on human chondrosarcoma cell line (OUMS-27). Combination therapy with rapamycin and PD 0325901 showed a stronger anti-proliferative effect on OUMS-27 cells than rapamycin monotherapy. We confirmed that the dual inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways had synergistic anti-proliferative effects in OUMS-27. Our results suggest that combination therapy of mTOR and MEK inhibitor could be an effective therapeutic approach against chondrosarcoma.",

In detail, results of Western Blot analysis on digestive and respiratory part of bronze corydoras intestine homogenates confirmed the immunoreactivity of anti-cytoplasmic domain (C-terminal) human EGFR antibodies with protein band of approximately 180\u00a0kDa (EGFR molecular weight). This indicates a high homology of EGFR domain between these species and the possibility of such antibody use in bronze corydoras.

Although several molecules, such as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, are involved in the regulation of the respiratory system, their detailed mechanisms have not been established yet. This study identifies that the presence of manserin, a neuropeptide, in the carotid body may play a crucial role in regulating respiration.The carotid bodies of adult Wistar rats were perfused with paraformaldehyde, and the frozen sections were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses. The carotid body comprises two distinct types of cells, neuron-like glomus cells and glial-like sustentacular cells. We used specific antibodies to distinguish the specific location of manserin in the carotid body, which included a tyrosine hydroxylase-positive antibody for glomus cells and an S100 protein antibody for sustentacular cells. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that while tiny, round signals were exclusively observed in the cytoplasm of glomus cells, no signals were observed in sustentacular cells.Because manserin is believed to be secreted from precursor proteins by the endoproteolytic processing of a large precursor protein called secretogranin II, manserin secretion systems may exist in the carotid body, and thus, behave as potential regulators of respiration in the carotid body.",

To understand the functional role of CDK5 in hair color determination, we constructed CDK5-knockdown mice and identified the effect on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the mouse skin. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, co-immunoprecipitation, and western blotting were performed to analyze the effects of CDK5-knockdown on the MAPK pathway in mice. The results showed that MAP3K6 was inhibited by phosphorylated CDK5 through its activator CDK7. The decrease in MAP3K6 levels caused down-regulation of MEK1 and ERK expression, leading to the up-regulation of miR-143-3p, which targets MAP3K6 via Dicer. Taken together, our findings indicate that CDK5 functions in regulating the MAPK pathway. Given that MAP3K6 was inhibited in two directions, this mechanism can provide insight into the contributions of the MAPK/ERK pathway to the inhibition of melanin production.",

The obtained results were considered against the clinical parameters of age, sex, body weight, body surface area (BSA) and body mass index (BMI). We observed that as age increases, the number of BMA/mm2, the diameter of adipocytes and AF increase while BF and HF decrease. However, this relationship was not statistically significant. A significant correlation of BMA parameters was also not found in relation to weight, BMI and BSA, and the number and diameter of BMAs were comparable in both sexes.

In view of their phylogenetic position, lancelets may indeed provide a critical point of reference for studies on osmoregulation evolution in Chordates.The results of present work demonstrated that, except to Na+/K+ ATPase that is strongly expressed in nephridia only, all the other studied molecules are abundantly present in skin, coelomic epithelium, renal papillae and nephridia and hepatic coecum. Thus, it is possible to hypothesize that also in lancelet, as in fish, these organs are involved in pH control and ionic regulation.In the digestive tract of B. floridae, the intestine epithelium was weakly immune-reactive to all tested antibodies, while the hepatic coecum showed an intense immunoreactivity to all molecules. Since in amphioxus the hepatic coecum functions simultaneously as stomach, liver and pancreas, these immunohistochemical results proved the secretion of H+ and HCO3\u2212 ions, typical of digestive process.Colocalization studies indicated a co-expression of the studied proteins in all considered organs, excluding NHE and pendrin for renal papillae, since some renal papillae are NHE immunopositive only.",

Numerous studies determined that different subsets of telocytes populate almost all tissues and attempted to relate these subsets to various functions, from cell signaling to tissue repair and regeneration. Extremely few studies addressed the urinary tract though few data on the molecular pattern of the urinary TCs actually exist. We therefore hypothesized that subsets of urinary TCs co-localize within the human ureter and we aimed at performing an immunohistochemical study to evaluate the tissue-specific molecular pattern of TCs. On sample tissues of proximal ureter drawn from ten human adult patients during surgery were applied primary antibodies against CD34, CD105, von Willebrand Factor, the heavy chain of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) and c-erbB-2. The molecular pattern indicated three different subsets of ureteral TCs which are neither endothelial nor epithelial in nature: (a) type I: the CD34-/CD105+ TCs of the superficial layer of lamina propria; (b) type II: the CD34+/CD105\u00b1 myoid TCs of the deep layer of lamina propria and (c) type III: the CD34+/CD105+ perivascular TCs. Although apparently different, all these subsets of TCs could belong to the stem/progenitor niche of the ureter.",

     "abstract": "Cell migration inducing hyaluronan binding protein (CEMIP) is a hyaluronic acid binding protein, the abnormal elevation of which is suggested as a contributor in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Cancer cells lose their adhesive properties and acquire an enhanced mobility by undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This study is performed to investigate whether and how CEMIP orchestrates the EMT process of CRC cells. To avoid the unexpected off-target effects possibly caused by one single shRNA, two shRNAs targeting different mRNA regions of CEMIP gene were used to knock down the mRNA and protein expression of CEMIP. Our data showed that the proliferation, migration and invasion of two CRC cell lines, HCT116 and SW480 cells, were inhibited by CEMIP shRNA. We here defined EMT as the complete or partial loss of E-cadherin and zona occludens protein 1 (ZO-1) (epithelial markers) and the gain of Vimentin and N-cadherin (mesenchymal markers), and found that the EMT process was attenuated in CEMIP-silenced SW480 cells. Snail, a direct target of \u03b2-catenin/T cell factor complex, is known to activate the EMT program during cancer metastasis. CEMIP shRNA was further found to suppress the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/Snail signaling transduction in CRC cells as manifested by the decreased nuclear \u03b2-catenin and Snail. Collectively, our work demonstrates that CEMIP contributes to metastatic phenotype of CRC cells in vitro.",

The ovary consists of two elongated filaments covered by a connective tissue that divides the organ into lobules, where somatic and germ cells are found. It was possible to classify five types of germ cells: Oogonia (Oog), previtellogenic oocyte (Oc1), early vitellogenic oocyte (Oc2), late vitellogenic oocyte (Oc3) and mature oocyte (Oc4) based on their vitellogenic stage, cytoplasmic, nuclear and morphometric characteristics. The histochemical analysis demonstrated an intense reaction for proteins and polysaccharides in peripheral cytoplasm of Oc3 comparing to others cell types. According to size, volume, color intensity and distribution of oocyte types the gonads were classified into: immature, developing, developed and spent, being in females at this last stage, observed empty follicles and oocytes in reabsorption process. During oogenesis was observed a gradual increase in cytoplasmic acidophilia due to accumulation of yolk granules and the intense histochemical reaction in periphery of Oc3, which indicate the beginning of an extravitellogenic source of nutrients. Based on the microscopic analysis of the vitellogenesis, shrimp C. major showed the initial short phase of oocyte growth following with a fast vitellogenic cycle.",

Glycan epitopes identified by lectin histochemistry were grouped as follows: N\u2010acetylglucosamine (s-WGA, WGA, BSL-II, DSL, LEL, STL), mannose (Con A, LCA, PSA), galactose (RCA120, BSL-I, Jacalin, PNA, ECL), N-acetylgalactosamine (VVA, DBA, SBA, and SJA), fucose (UEA-I) and complex type N-glycan (PHA-E and PHA-L) groups. The free border of the VSE was positive for all 21 lectins, and 18 of the lectins (excluding DBA, SJA, and PHA-L) showed weak and/or moderate staining in the receptor cells. The supporting cells were weakly positive for 19 lectins (excluding PNA and SJA). Moreover, 17 lectins (excluding BSL-II, Jacalin, PNA, and SJA) were expressed in the basal cells. In the VNSE of roe deer, the free border showed staining for all 21 lectins examined. The ciliated cells were positive for 16 lectins (excluding BSL-II, DSL, PNA, VVA, and SJA). Furthermore, 15 lectins (excluding DSL, LEL, ECL, UEA-I, PHA-E, and PHA-L) were expressed in goblet cells. Twenty lectins (excluding SJA) were expressed in the acini of the vomeronasal glands. Collectively, both VSE and VNSE were rich in N-acetylglucosamine, mannose, galactose, N\u2010acetylgalactosamine, fucose, and complex-type N-glycans, although the different cell types of the VSE and VNSE expressed different glycoconjugates of varying intensities, suggesting that these carbohydrate residues may be involved in odor perception as well as cell-to-cell communication in the VNO.",

We show that the native substrate supports myogenic differentiation judged by the expression of members of the Myogenic Determination Factor (MRF) family. However SC even on their native substrate can be induced into adopting adipogenic or osteogenic fate. Furthermore conditions that support adipose or bone formation inhibit the proliferation of SC progeny as well as their migration. We show that Connexin43 (Cx43), a gap junction complex protein, is only expressed by activated and not quiescent SC. Furthermore, it is not expressed by SC that are in the process of changing their fate. Lastly we show that intact adult mouse muscle contains numerous cells expressing Cx43 and that the density of these cells seems to be related to capillary density. We suggest the Cx43 expression is localized to angioblasts and is more prominent in oxidative slow muscle compared to glycolytic fast muscle.",

To elucidate whether desmin is involved in this process, we examined the spatiotemporal expression profiles of desmin and their relationship with two astroglial intermediate filaments, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and nestin, in the striatum of rats treated with the mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). Weak, constitutive immunoreactivity for desmin was observed in astrocytes generally, and in reactive astrocytes in the peri-lesional area, its expression increased in parallel with that of GFAP over 3 d post-lesion and was maintained until at least day 28. Desmin, GFAP, and nestin showed characteristic time-dependent expression patterns in reactive astrocytes forming the astroglial scar; delayed and long-lasting induction of desmin and GFAP, and rapid but transient induction of nestin. In the lesion core, desmin was expressed in two categories of perivascular cells: nestin-negative and nestin-positive. These findings show that desmin, together with GFAP and nestin, is a dynamic component of intermediate filaments in activated astroglia, which may account for the dynamic structural changes seen in these cells in response to brain injuries.",

However, there are limited data regarding the role(s) of the MTergic system in males. Thus, the objective of this study was to elucidate the localization of the MT neuronal groups in the brain of male native Thai chickens. The distributions of MT-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons and fibers in the brain were studied utilizing immunohistochemistry technique. The results revealed that MT-ir neurons and fibers were distributed throughout the brain and extensively in the diencephalon. MT-ir neurons and fibers were predominantly located within the nucleus supraopticus, pars ventralis (SOv), nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), nucleus ventrolateralis thalami (VLT), nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN), and regio lateralis hypothalami (LHy), suggesting that MT neurons in these nuclei might be involved in the reproductive activities and/or parental behavior in the male chickens. In addition, the numbers of MT-ir neurons within the SOv and POM were significantly higher than those of the VLT, PVN, and LHy. More importantly, the number of MT-ir neurons in the SOv was high in the male brain when compared with the female brain, indicating that the MTergic system in the SOv might play a significant role in male reproductive activities in this equatorial species.",

     "abstract": "Neuropathic pain manifested by a number of sensory symptoms is often accompanied by disorders of higher nervous activity, such as memory impairment, depression, anxiety, anhedonia, etc. This emphasizes the involvement of supraspinal structures including the hippocampus in neuropathic pain pathogenesis. In the present study, we focused on the impact of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and microglial state. In addition, we test the effect of alkyl glycerol ethers on hippocampal neuronal and microglial plasticity as well as behavioral parameters. Neuropathic pain was induced using the model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury. We found an impairment of working memory and locomotor activity in animals with neuropathic pain, which was prevented by alkyl glycerol ethers treatment. Sciatic nerve ligation in mice contributed to the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis intensity. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration significantly reduced this effect. Neuropathic pain-associated neurogenesis reduction was accompanied by an increased percentage of Iba1-labeled area in the CA1 hippocampal region on the 14th and 28th days after surgery. In addition, we observed a decrease in hippocampal pro-inflammatory microglia marker CD86 immunostaining on day 28 after surgery in alkyl glycerol ethers-treated mice with sciatic nerve ligation. These results are consistent with data on pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines expression in the hippocampus. Alkyl glycerol ethers administration increased IL-10 and decreased IL-1\u03b2 hippocampal expression in animals with neuropathic pain. Taken together, these data suggest that neuropathic pain-behavior in rodents is accompanied by changes in microglia polarization, thereby contributing to neurogenesis impairment and cognitive disturbances. Alkyl glycerol ethers prevented M1 microglial activation, contributing to the maintenance of normal neurogenesis levels within the hippocampus and normalizing working memory.",

To address this, we first cultivated EMSCs from neonatal mice aged 1 week and adult mice aged 3 months or 6 months, and then compared their morphology, proliferative capacity, and pluripotency through various induced differentiation assays. The results showed that neonatal EMSCs were fibroblast-like, more regular compared to adult EMSCs; the proliferative capacity of neonatal EMSCs was higher than that of adult EMSCs. More importantly, after neural, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation, neonatal EMSCs differentiated into respective cell types significantly better than adult EMSCs. Notably, EMSCs from mice aged 3 months differentiated into mesodermal lineages better than those from 6 months old mice after induction.

Additionally, 526 DEGs were identified from the IL-1\u03b1-KO vs. IL-1\u03b2-KO groups. These DEGs were significantly enriched in functions and pathways associated with ion transport, neuron apoptotic processes and inflammatory responses. The common genes were enriched in the pathways for cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction. DEGs of IL-1\u03b1-KO vs. IL-1\u03b2-KO were significantly enriched in the immune system, hematopoietic cell lineage and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway-associated biological processes and pathways. The PPI network consisted of 76 nodes, such as Saa2, Kcna1, Scn8a, Ccl5, Ccl28 and Pink1. A total of 94 miRNAs, including mir-17-5P and mir-30a-5p were predicted that could target the DEGs.IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 may play important roles in SCI by regulating ion transport, inflammation and neuron apoptotic processes and their associated genes or miRNAs. Compared with IL-1\u03b2-KO, IL-1\u03b1-KO may improve the outcome of SCI via the alteration of hematopoietic cell lineage and PI3K-Akt signalling pathways.",

     "abstract": "In vertebrates such as the mouse and the human, primordial germ cells (PGCs) arise at the base of the allantois and are carried to the epithelium of the posterior intestine, to later migrate to the primordial gonads. In the case of bats, almost nothing is known about this process. To clarify the dynamics of PGCs during gonadal morphogenesis in the phyllostomid bat Sturnira lilium, the proteins for the Ddx4, Sox9 and Mis genes were detected in the gonads of embryos at different stages of development. We identified 15 stages (St) of embryonic development in Sturnira lilium. We found that the formation of the genital ridge and the establishment of the undifferentiated gonad take place between stages 11 and 14. The onset of morphological differentiation in the gonad is first detected in the male gonads at St17. The first PGCs in meiosis are detected in the ovary at St19, whereas in the testicles, the PGCs were in mitotic arrest. Structural changes leading to testicular and ovarian development in Sturnira lilium are observed to be similar to those described for the mouse; however, differences will be established concerning the time taken for these processes to occur.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that Suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS) was involved in the nervous system development. The universality and diversity of SOCS also suggested their important roles in neurogenesis and nerve regeneration. In this study, we employed a lentiviral vector to investigate the impacts of overexpression SOCS1 on the proliferation and differentiation of rat-derived NSCs. Cells infected with LV-EGFP-SOCS1 showed a prominent increased cell number, diameter, and metabolic activity compared with other groups. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the proportion of cells positive for microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP2) or myelin basic protein (MBP) was significantly increased in LV-EGFP-SOCS1 group while the proportion of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in LV-EGFP-SOCS1 group was significantly decreased compare to LV-EGFP and PBS group. Moreover, Western blot results were consistent with immunofluorescence results which indicated that overexpression of SOCS1 could promote neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiations of NSCs but inhibit astrocyte differentiation of NSCs. In conclusion, our findings provided evidence that SOCS1 could promote the proliferation of NSCs and affect the differentiation of NSCs, providing a potential target for NSCs transplantation strategies.",

     "abstract": "The islet, the endocrine portion of the pancreas \u2212 develops from an invagination of the pancreatic duct epithelial cells (PDECs) into the surrounding tissue. The contact of the PDECs with mesenchymal cells (MSCs) may be an essential drive for endocrine cell fate. During pancreatic development, cells that express Neurogenin-3 (Ngn3) biomarker are precursors of insulin- producing beta cells. These precursors have been reported in the neogenesis of islets from adult tissues following the surgical ligation of the main pancreatic duct (PDL). But the capacity of these precursors to induce the appropriate signals to complete the entire neogenesis program has been questioned. We studied the fate of co-culture of PDECs and MSCs from the ligated adult pancreas and established the exact location of adult stem- or progenitor-like cells that give rise to beta cells. PDECs were cultured in direct contact with or without MSCs in serum-containing culture media. The cytomorphology of the cells in co-cultures was determined and the immunocytochemical study of the cells was carried out using anti-Ngn3, anti-insulin and anti-cytokeratin-7 (CK7) antibodies. Both the PDEC/MSC- and PDEC/MSC+ cultures showed out- pocketing from duct epithelium by the end of the second week, which are distinct as cell clusters only in PDEC/MSC+ cells later in week four, exhibiting numerous branching ducts. Co-expression of Ngn3 with insulin was observed in both cultures from the second week. However, characterizations of these Ngn3+ cells in the PDEC/MSC+ culture revealed that these cells also co-expressed a CK7 biomarker. This study provides new evidence of the ductal epithelial nature of beta cells in injured adult pancreata; and that the mesenchymal stromal cells are required to sustain Ngn3 expression for beta cell maturation and function.",

In the present study, we immunohistochemically determined the localization of arginase 1 and 2 in the olfactory bulb (OB) of the roe dear (Capreolus pygargus). Reverse transcription PCR revealed that the mRNAs encoding both arginase 1 and 2 were expressed in the OB. Arginase 1 was localized to olfactory nerve axons, calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive mitral/tufted cells (excitatory neurons), and glutamate acid decarboxylase 65/67-immunopositive periglomerular cells of the main olfactory bulb. The arginase 2 immunoreactivities in the OB tissues were similar to those of arginase 1. Furthermore, both arginases were detected in the accessory olfactory bulb.

This study firstly demonstrated the neurosecretory cells as well as the existence and distribution of the egg-laying hormone (ELH)-like peptide in the central nervous system (CNS) and ovary of the B. areolata. The neurosecretory cell was characterized by the cytoplasmic purple dot-like structure as stained by the Gomori\u2019s paraldehyde fuchsin. Using the anti-abalone (a) ELH, we detected the aELH-like-peptide in neurons (Nr) and neurosecretory cells (Ns) of all ganglia including the cerebral, pleural, parietal, pedal and buccal ganglia. The aELH-like peptide was also present in the neuropil of each. It was noted that not all Ns presented the aELH-like peptide. In the ovary, the aELH-like peptide was slightly detected in early developing oocytes and strongly detected in late developing oocytes and follicular cells. This study firstly reported the evidence of ELH-like peptide in the CNS and ovary of the B. areolata. The molecular cloning as well as to investigate the function of ELH in this species is needed as it will be beneficial for future applications in aquaculture.",

However, the role of MT during incubation behavior has never been studied. The objective of this study was to determine the physiological function(s) of the MTergic system in incubation behavior in native Thai chickens. The brains were collected from incubating (INC) and nest-deprived (ND) hens at different time points (days 3, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 21; n\u00a0=\u00a06). Immunohistochemistry technique was used to compare the numbers of MT-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons between the INC and ND hens within the Nucleus supraopticus, pars ventralis (SOv), Nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), and Nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN). The results revealed that the numbers of MT-ir neurons within the SOv, POM, and PVN remained high during the incubating stage. The number of MT-ir neurons in the SOv was lower than that of the POM and PVN. Disruption of incubation behavior by nest deprivation caused the numbers of MT-ir neurons within the SOv, POM, and PVN to decrease throughout the observation periods. For the first time, this study demonstrates that the MTergic system within the SOv, POM, and PVN may be involved with incubation behavior. In addition, these results further suggest that the MTergic neurons in these nuclei are not only regulated by rearing behavior but also might have a role in the initiation and maintenance of incubation behavior in this tropical species.",

Ten female Sprague Dawley rats at nine weeks of age were randomly divided in two groups and fed either standard laboratory chow or high-fat diet during six weeks, and then mated with the same male subject. After birth and lactation male offspring from both groups were further divided into four subgroups depending on their subsequent diet. At 22 weeks of age, the animals were weighted, sacrificed and major organs were collected and weighted. Immunohistochemistry for TNF-alpha was performed on liver, and liver samples were analyzed for pathohistological changes. The group in which mothers were fed standard chow and offspring high-fat diet had the most pronounced changes: heaviest liver, poorest histopathological findings and strongest TNF-alpha immunohistochemical staining of liver parenchyma. High-fat diet during pregnancy and lactation and switching to high-fat diet postnatally affects liver weight, histological structure and TNF-alpha expression in male offspring.",

To that end, we characterized the testicular immunolocalization of LHR and FSHR, their expression on both mRNA and protein levels, as well as serum concentrations of LH and FSH in male wild ground squirrels throughout the annual reproductive cycle. Histologically, all types of spermatogenic cells including mature spermatozoa were identified in the breeding season (April), while spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes were observed in the non-breeding season (June), and spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes and secondary spermatocytes were found in pre-hibernation (September). LHR was present in Leydig cells during the whole periods with more intense staining in the breeding season; Stronger immunostaining of FSHR was observed in Sertoli cells during the breeding season compared to the non-breeding season and pre-hibernation. Consistently, the mRNA and protein levels of LHR and FSHR were higher in testes of the breeding season, and then decreased to a relatively lower level in the non-breeding season and pre-hibernation. Meanwhile, serum LH and FSH concentrations were significantly higher in the breeding season than those in the non-breeding season and pre-hibernation.

After ovariectomy, hepatocyte mitochondria became hypertrophic and misformed, which were reversed with E or ICR treatment. ICR-treated rats also showed endoplasmic reticulum disorganization. After ovariectomy, ER\u03b1 and LXR levels significantly decreased while SREBP expression increased. E treatment increased ER\u03b1 and LXR levels while ICR treatment only increased LXR expression. E treatment decreased SREBP-1c levels, whereas SREBP-1c levels increased with ICR treatment. Treatment with E significantly reversed the ovariectomy-induced dysregulation of hepatocyte lipid metabolism, which was, however, exacerbated with ICR treatment. The effects of E and ICR on hepatocyte lipid metabolism may involve the regulation of LXR and SREBP-1c.",

     "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB), which saves the brain from toxic substances, is formed by endothelial cells. It is mainly composed of tight junction (TJ) proteins existing between endothelial cells. Estrogen is an important regulatory hormone of BBB permeability. It protects the BBB before menopause, but may increase BBB permeability with aging. In addition, nitric oxide modulates BBB permeability. Alcohol impairs the integrity of the BBB with oxidants and inflammatory mediators such as iNOS. We investigated the effects of estrogen on BBB integrity in an in vitro BBB model created with ER\u03b1-free HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial-like cells) to mimics the menopausal period.In vitro BBB model is created with HUVEC/C6 (rat glioma cells) co-culture. The effect of 17\u03b2-estradiol on ethanol-induced BBB disruption and change/or increase of iNOS activity, which modulate BBB integrity, were evaluated. Inducibility and functionality of BBB were investigated using transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the expression of proteins TJ proteins (occludin and claudin-1) and iNOS activity by immunostaining.Our results revealed that 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment before and after ethanol decrease expression of occludin and claudin-1 and value of TEER which are BBB disrupt indicators. In addition, ethanol and 17\u03b2-estradiol separately and pre- and post-ethanol 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment increased iNOS expression. Thus our study suggests caution in the use of 17\u03b2-estradiol after menopause because 17\u03b2-estradiol at this time may both increase the inflammatory process as well as damage the BBB. We think that beneficial effects of 17\u03b2-estradiol may be through ER\u03b1 but it needs further studies.",

Expression levels of CS-A in epithelial component and stroma of ameloblastoma were significantly higher than those in odontogenic keratocyst and dentigerous cyst. Moreover, CS-A in ameloblastoma was more strongly expressed in stellate reticulum-like cells than in amelobast-like cells with statistical significance. On the other hand, expression levels of HS and KS in epithelial component and stroma of ameloblastoma were lower compared with CS-A. These results overall reveal that among these odontogenic lesions, CS-A is preferentially expessed in ameloblastoma, suggesting potential pathogenetic role probably in cytodifferention of tumor cells to stellate reticulum-like cells.",

Herein, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of sesamin on cell cytotoxicity and the potent supporting effects on chondrogenic differentiation of human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAF-MSCs). The results indicated that sesamin was not toxic to hAF-MSCs after sesamin treatment. When treating the cells with a combination of sesamin and inducing factors, sesamin was able to up-regulate the expression level of specific genes which play an essential role during the cartilage development process, including SOX9, AGC, COL2A1, COL11A1, and COMP and also simultaneously promote the cartilage extracellular protein synthesis, aggrecan and type II collagen. Additionally, histological analysis revealed a high amount of accumulated sGAG staining inside the porous scaffold in the sesamin co-treating group.

BGC-1 represent immature granulosa cells, whereas CPGB represent different degrees of luteinization.Our aim was to evaluate the intracellular pathways involved in the GnRH regulation of apoptosis in BGC-1. Treatment with LA 100\u00a0nM but not with antide led to an increase in BAX over BCL-2 expression, showing antagonism of antide. All treatments inhibited phospholipase-D (PLD) activity compared to control, implying agonist behavior of antide. Progesterone in vitro production and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) expression revealed different degrees of luteinization: BGC-1 were immature, whereas CPGB+ were less differentiated than CPGB\u2212. We concluded that LA-induced apoptosis in BGC-1 occurs by activation of the mitochondrial pathway and by inhibition of PLD activity and that antide might work both as an antagonist of the intrinsic pathway and as an agonist of the extrinsic protection pathway by inhibiting PLD activity.",

Appearance of aggregates of particles of nuclear origin within the nuclei and cytoplasm of the induced cells was the first and the most prominent morphological sign of apoptosis. These aggregates were not coated by a membrane, had variable shape, density and size. Two types of particles dominated in the aggregates: perichromatin fibers (PFs) and proteasomes (PRs). PFs represent a morphological expression of transcriptional and co-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNA (Biggiogera et al., 2008), PRs are involved in hydrolysis of proteins and nucleoproteins, and participate in regulation of apoptosis (Ciechanover, 1998; Liu et al., 2007). We examined the ultrastructure and localization of PFs and PRs, and confirmed the proteasome nature of the latter by immunoelectron microscopy. We traced the formation and migration of the aggregates along the nucleus and their exit into the cytoplasm across the nuclear pores. Finally, we demonstrated degradation of the aggregates and relocating their content into exosomes at the terminal stages of apoptosis with aid of exosomes. We suggest that proteasomes function as morphologically definite and independent intracellular organelles. Alongside with proteasomes, autophagic vacuoles were revealed in apoptotic cells. Occurrence of autophagic vacuoles in apoptotic cells may suggest that both proteolytic pathways, autophagy and proteasome degradation, are coordinated with each other along the programmed cell death pathway.",

Direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DS RGCs) strongly respond to preferred directional stimuli, but rarely respond to the opposite or null directional stimuli.

Using immunocytochemistry, we studied with the distributions of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits on the dendrites of DS RGCs in the developing and adult mouse retina. DS RGCs were injected with Lucifer yellow for identification of dendritic morphology. The triple-labeled images of dendrites, kinesin II, and NMDA receptor subunits were visualized using confocal microscopy and were reconstructed from high-resolution confocal images. Although our results revealed that the synaptic pattern of NMDA receptor subunits on dendrites of DS RGCs was not asymmetric in developing and adult mouse retina, they showed the anatomical connectivity of NMDA glutamatergic synapses onto DS RGCs and the developmental formation of the direction selectivity in the mouse retina. Through the comprehensive interpretation of the direction-selective neural circuit, this study, therefore, implies that the direction selectivity may be generated by the asymmetry of the excitatory glutamatergic inputs and the inhibitory inputs onto DS RGCs.",

Three months old male C57BL/6 mice (wild-type, WT) and deficient leptin (ob/ob) mice had their testes dissected and prepared for analyses. Compared to the WT group, the ob/ob group showed a greater body mass with smaller testes, and alterations in the germinative epithelium: fewer spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids. The Sertoli cells and the germ cells showed condensed nuclei and nuclear fragmentation indicating cell death, in agreement with a low expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and a high expression of Caspase3. In the ob/ob group, the sperm was absent in the seminiferous tubules, and the steroidogenic pathway was compromised (low 3Beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein). Further, all hormone receptors involved in the testicular function were down expressed (androgen, estrogen, follicle-stimulating, luteinizing, aromatase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). In conclusion, the findings indicate significant morphological, hormonal and enzymatic changes in the testis of the ob/ob mice. The shifts in the enzymatic steroidogenic pathway and the enzymes related to spermatic activity support the insights about the failures in the fertility of these animals.

Among reptiles, molecular mechanisms for sex differentiation have been analyzed in turtles, crocodiles, and some lizards, while in adult stages such studies are scarce.

FOXL2 is expressed in follicular cells of adult ovaries. DDX4 and IFITM3 are located in germ line cells as well as in follicular cells of adult ovaries.

CB1 and CB2 receptor levels decreased in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues compared to the control group (p\u202f=\u202f0,001 and p\u202f=\u202f0,001). FAAH, NAPE-PLD, MAGL and DAGL enzyme levels decreased in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues compared to control (p\u202f=\u202f0,001, p\u202f=\u202f0,001, p\u202f=\u202f0,001 and p\u202f=\u202f0,002 respectively). Apoptotic cell indexes both in endometriotic and adenomyotic tissues also decreased significantly, compared to the control group (p\u202f=\u202f0,001 and p\u202f=\u202f0,001). CB1 and CB2 receptor agonist mediated dose dependent fast anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were detected in Ishikawa and ovarian endometriosis cyst wall stromal cell lines (CRL-7566). Endocannabinoids are suggested to increase apoptosis mechanisms in endometriosis and adenomyosis. CB1 and CB2 antagonists can be considered as potential medical therapeutic agents for endometriosis and adenomyosis.",

     "abstract": "Aortic valve (AV) stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease with an incidence of 3% for people\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years in the industrialized world with indication for a surgical or transcatheter valve replacement. Researchers suppose osteogenic processes as key mechanisms in calcific aortic valve stenosis. Recently, Torre et al. published impressive histological analyses and detected osseous and/or chondromatous metaplasia in 15.6% of 6685 native calcified aortic valves. Therefore one HE section per valve originated from the area with the greatest extent of calcification was analyzed. Aim of our experimental setup was to identify regions of neo-osteogenesis and to determine the rate of specimens with active mineralization in human aortic valve tissue by Movat Pentachrom staining of sections of lager tissue segments.Operational replaced aortic valves of 35 patients, 15 female and 20 male with an average age of 66.2 years were formalin fixed and decalcified using Osteosoft\u00ae-solution. Tissue samples were cut and 2\u00a0\u03bcm specimens were stained with Movat Pentachrom to visualize osteogenic regions. Instead of screening a large number of sections, tissue samples were cut up to five times with at least 100\u00a0\u03bcm space each if no region of osseous and/or chondromatous metaplasia was visible.Using this setup, a region of osseous metaplasia was detected in 25 (71.4%) of 35 samples analyzed. In some cases, these regions were small sized and only visible due to the bright color of Movat Pentachrom stain. This leads to the suggestion that a higher rate of calcified aortic valve samples would be classified as cusps with areas of neo-osteogenesis after staining with Movat Pentachrom stain and by the systematic analysis of larger parts of the tissue blocks.",

This study was carried out to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of p38\u03b1MAPK and p-p38\u03b1MAPK. Ovarian tissue samples were collected from 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 16-, 20- and 30-day-old female rats. Western blotting was used to examine the relative expression of p38\u03b1MAPK and p-p38\u03b1MAPK in ovarian tissue, and subcellular localization was examined using immunohistochemistry of the rat ovaries at different ages of postpartum. The immunohistochemical results showed that p38\u03b1MAPK and p-p38\u03b1MAPK were widely expressed in the rat ovaries, mainly localized in the follicle cells and granulosa cells. The expression of p38\u03b1MAPK was relatively stable for the different stages of oocytes, whereas the expression of p-p38\u03b1MAPK gradually increased. At different stages of granulosa cells, the expression of p38\u03b1MAPK was also relatively stable, and the p-p38\u03b1MAPK expression showed an upward trend during follicular development. Western blotting revealed that the expression of p38\u03b1MAPK in the ovaries was relatively stable, where as p-p38\u03b1MAPK expression initially exhibited an increasing trend and subsequently decreased, with a maximum at day 20. The expression patterns of p38\u03b1MAPK and p-p38\u03b1MAPK in the rat ovaries indicate their possible involvement in folliculogenesis. Taken together, the stage- and cell-specific expression of p-p38\u03b1MAPK in rat ovaries indicated that p-p38\u03b1MAPK might play a vital role during rat follicular development.",

Immunohistochemical, electron microscopic, biochemical and statistical studies were performed. TR-group displayed disarranged hepatic architecture, hepatic congestion, hemorrhage and necrosis. Apoptotic hepatocytes, mononuclear cellular infiltration and a significant increase in the number of anti-CD68 positive cells were observed. Ultrastructurally, hepatocytes showed shrunken nuclei, swollen mitochondria, many lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles. Activated Ito and Von Kupffer cells were also demonstrated. Elevated serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP and bilirubin were noticed. NSO administration resulted in preservation of hepatic histoarchitecture and ultrastructure and significant reductions in the number of anti-CD68 positive cells and serum levels of liver seromarkers. In conclusion, NSO administration could mitigate the alterations induced by tramadol in rat liver.",

Obesity and antiretroviral therapy (ART) may cause pathophysiological conditions in the aortic wall and surrounding PVAT. The aim of the study was to determine the histological effects on the aortic wall, aortic PVAT adipocyte morphology and leptin staining intensity in obese rats treated with ART. Wistar rats (N\u00a0=\u00a036) were divided into four groups; a lean control (C/ART-), ART control (C/ART+), high-calorie diet (HCD) untreated (HCD/ART-) and HCD and ART experimental (HCD/ART+). The aorta and surrounding PVAT were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anti-leptin antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC). The C/ART+ group had a thinner tunica media compared to the HCD/ART- group. The tunica adventitia was thicker in the ART groups (C/ART+ and HCD/ART+) compared to the lean control group. White adipocytes in the HCD/ART- group was larger in size compared to the other three groups. The high-calorie diet groups (HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+) had increased adipocyte sizes, for both brown and differentiating adipocytes, compared to the control groups (C/ART- and C/ART+). The unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the C/ART+ group showed intense leptin staining. Unilocular and differentiating adipocytes in the HCD/ART- and HCD/ART+ groups showed weak to no leptin staining intensity. The present study indicated that ART and a HCD, separately and combined, altered both the tunica media and adventitia of the aortic wall, whereas the HCD alone caused adipocytes to increase in size. The leptin staining intensity suggested that ART alone may lead to increased leptin expression, whereas ART combined with a HCD may cause leptin deficiency. Changes seen with ART in a rat model suggest that aortic wall thickness and PVAT adipocyte morphology alterations should be considered by clinicians in obese individuals receiving ART.",

     "abstract": "Accessory respiratory organs in fish exhibit great diversity but share the presence of numerous capillaries covered by a simple squamous epithelium. The adoption of the intestine for respiratory function needs certain special modifications. In this study, we explored immunohistochemical and metabolic fingerprint features that could underlay this adaptation in bronze corydoras Corydoras aeneus. Immunohistochemical localization of the cytoplasmic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the respiratory part of intestine demonstrated a strong positive immunoreaction in epithelial cells and connective tissue. Fourier Transfer Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics discriminated between anterior and posterior region of intestine in terms of secondary structure of proteins and the abundance of p-cresol and other phenolics. The latter were reduced in the posterior part of intestine, indicating the cessation of digestive function in this region. It has been suggested that aquatic hypoxia via endocrine cells (hypoxia-sensitive) activate EGFR, which induce proliferation of squamous epithelial cells, thereby enabling gas diffusion in the posterior part of intestine. It seems that hypoxia and normoxia are opposed conditions adjusting the production of squamous epithelial cells in this intestine. The physiological role of EGFR in the respiratory intestine of bronze corydoras is of interest not only from an evolutionary aspect but also in terms of a potential model for observations process proliferation squamous epithelial cells. Future investigations on the molecular responses to different water oxygen levels in air-breathing bronze corydoras fish are required to clarify the mechanism responsible for squamous cell proliferation.",

     "abstract": "Leptin, a highly conserved adipocyte-derived hormone, plays important roles in a variety of physiological processes, including the control of fat storage and metabolic status which are linked to food intake, energy homeostasis, and reproduction in all vertebrates. In the present study, we hypothesize that leptin is also present in various organs of the fresh water prawns, Macrobrachium rosenbergii. The existence and distribution of a leptin-like peptide in prawn tissues were verified by using Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemical detection (ID) using primary antibody against human leptin. With WB, a leptin-like peptide, having a molecular weight of 15\u00a0kDa, was detected in the brain, thoracic ganglia, abdominal ganglia, parts of the gastro-intestinal tract, hepatopancreas, adipocytes and gonads. By ID, leptin immunoreactivity (leptin-ir) was detected in the brain, thoracic ganglia and intersegmental commissural nerve fibers of abdominal ganglia. In the gastrointestinal tract, there was intense leptin-ir in the apical part of the epithelial cells of the cardiac and pyloric parts of the stomach. In the midgut and hindgut, the leptin-ir was detected in epithelial cells and basal cells located near the basal lamina of the epithelium. In addition, there was leptin-ir in the Restzellen cells in the hepatopancreas which produce digestive enzymes. In the ovary, the strong intensity of a leptin-ir was detected in the cytoplasm of middle to late stage oocytes, whereas no positive staining was detected in follicular cells. An intense leptin-ir was detected in spermatocytes and sustentacular cells in the seminiferous tubules in the testes of small and orange claw males. Taken together, the detection of the leptin-ir in several organs implicates the existence of a leptin-like peptide in various organs of the freshwater prawn; and like in vertebrates this peptide may be an important hormonal factor in controlling feeding and reproductive process.",

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle mass loss has a broad impact on body performance and physical activity. Muscle wasting occurs due to genetic mutation as in muscular dystrophy, age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) as well as in chronic wasting disorders as in cancer cachexia. Food restriction reduces muscle mass underpinned by increased muscle protein break down. However the influence of dietary restriction on the morphometry and phenotype of forelimb muscles in a genetically modified myostatin null mice are not fully characterized. The effect of a five week dietary limitation on five anatomically and structurally different forelimb muscles was examined. C57/BL6 wild type (Mstn+/+) and myostatin null (Mstn\u2212/\u2212) mice were either given a standard rodent normal daily diet ad libitum (ND) or 60% food restriction (FR) for a 5 week period. M. triceps brachii Caput laterale (T.lateral), M. triceps brachii Caput longum (T.long), M. triceps brachii Caput mediale (T.medial), M. extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU) and M. flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) were dissected, weighted and processed for immunohistochemistry. Muscle mass, fibers cross sectional areas (CSA) and myosin heavy chain types IIB, IIX, IIA and type I were analyzed. We provide evidence that caloric restriction results in muscle specific weight reduction with the fast myofibers being more prone to atrophy. We show that slow fibers are less liable to dietary restriction induced muscle atrophy. The effect of dietary restriction was more pronounced in Mstn\u2212/\u2212 muscles to implicate the oxidative fibers compared to Mstn+/+. Furthermore, peripherally located myofibers are more susceptible to dietary induced reduction compared to deep fibers. We additionally report that dietary restriction alters the glycolytic phenotype of the Mstn\u2212/\u2212 into the oxidative form in a muscle dependent manner. In summary our study shows that calorie restriction alters muscle fiber profile of forelimb muscles of Myostatin null mice.",

     "abstract": "Copper (Cu) is an important trace element for the organism survival, which ensures the normal functioning of different biosystems. However, excessive levels of this heavy metal are responsible for profound physiological alterations including the central nervous system. Numerous findings sustain the involvement of heavy metals, as an environmental risk factor such as copper (Cu), in the neuropathology of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) which is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that principally affects the motor system. The classic and evident symptoms of PD namely rigidity, tardiness of movement, and difficulty with walking, result from progressive dopaminergic neurons death within substantia nigra. Whereas, few pharmacological trials have shown a beneficial role against Cu neurotoxicity, Aloe arborescens is one of the powerful medicinal plants with an array of therapeutic effects. Thus, we aimed through the present study, to evaluate the impact of acute Cu intoxication (10\u00a0\u03bcg/g B.W. i.p) for 3\u00a0days on the dopaminergic system and locomotor performance, together with the possible restorative effect of oral administration of aqueous extract of Aloe arborescens gel (AEAAG) (200\u00a0mg/kg B.W.). By means of immunohistochemistry, we noted, in the Cu intoxicated rats, a significant loss of TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) expression within substantia nigra compacta (SNc), ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the subsequent striatal outputs, those alterations were correlated to behavioral abnormalities such as a severe drop of locomotor performance. While AEAAG administration to Cu intoxicated rats showed a noticeable beneficial effect; this potential was featured by a complete recovery of the TH expression and locomotor behavior deficiencies in the intoxicated rats. The present investigation have brought, on the one hand, an experimental evidence of an altered dopaminergic innervations following Cu intoxication and on the other hand, a new pharmacological property of Aloe arborescens that may be used as a neuroprotective plant for neurodegenerative disorders, such as PD, touching the dopaminergic system trigged by heavy metals.",

The oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in lung tissue homogenate and apoptotic proteins (BcL-2 and Caspase-3) expression were quantified in lung tissues. The results of TCS or NaF treated groups revealed a prominent depletion of super oxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione (GSH) in lung tissue homogenate. On contrary, a marked increase in the tissue levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzymatic assay levels. The co-exposed group evoked less severity in the oxidative stress biomarkers concentration than individually exposed groups. The apoptotic genes protein expression was significantly higher in TCS or NaF treated rats when compared to the control with intense to moderate immunolabeling of the bronchiolar lining epithelium and surrounding mononuclear inflammatory cells. On the contrary, no significant differences were detected in the expression of the investigated apoptotic biomarkers between the control and the combined exposed group.

     "abstract": "Several studies have shown that chronic low food consumption alters the composition and metabolism of the extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDLm) fiber types. EDLm is constituted by four independent fascicles (F2\u2013F5) of different sizes; their constitution and metabolism, however, as well as how chronic undernourishment affects these is virtually unknown. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the relative fiber type composition and metabolism of each independent fascicle in the EDLm, using control and chronically undernourished young male rats by using the alkaline ATPase and NADH-TR histochemical techniques. Our results indicate that all control fascicles showed a higher percentage of intermediate fibers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), except for F5, which had a higher percentage of fast fibers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After chronic undernutrition, the proportion of intermediate fibers decreased in F4 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and increased in F5 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas fast fibers decreased in F3 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and F5 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). When we investigated fiber metabolism we found that F3 and F4 had a similar composition (mainly glycolytic), whereas F2 and F5 predominantly contained oxidative fibers. All fascicles of chronic undernourished rats showed a general decrease in oxidative fibers (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), except for F3, in which oxidative fibers increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). After determining the possible predominant metabolism expressed in intermediate fibers, we propose that chronic undernutrition induces the transformation of fast-glycolytic to intermediate-oxidative/glycolytic fibers, mainly in F3 and F5. Our observations confirm that chronic undernourishment differentially affects the fiber types of each fascicle in the EDLm, which could alter their individual physiological contractile properties.",

For this purpose, 24 mature male Wistar rats were divided into control and test groups. The animals in test groups received 7.5\u00a0mg/kg, 15\u00a0mg/kg and 30\u00a0mg/kg of NMC (NO\u00a0=\u00a06 rats in each group). Following 48\u00a0days, the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3, P53 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were evaluated by using reverse transcription-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Histological changes, tubular differentiation index (TDI), tissue cellularity and serum level of testosterone were analyzed. Finally, the DNA laddering test was used to assess the DNA fragmentation as hallmark for apoptosis. The NMCM significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) diminished the Bcl-2, p53 and PCNA and enhanced the Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels. The NMCM significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) elevated the percentage of Bax and caspase-3-positive tubules and remarkably reduced the percentage of tubules with positive reaction for Bcl-2, p53 and PCNA. The NCMN-received animals exhibited remarkable (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduction in cell population, TDI ratio and serum level of testosterone. Severe DNA fragmentation was observed in 30\u00a0mg/kg NMCM-received group. In conclusion, the NMCM by reducing the testicular endocrine status, down-regulating Bcl-2 expression and by enhancing the Bax and caspase-3 expression initiates the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.

     "abstract": "An increasing number of studies revealed the importance of estrogen in male reproduction. However, most research was conducted in laboratory rodents subjected to standardized environmental conditions. Therefore, seasonal regulations of estrogen pathways remain poorly understood under natural conditions. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression of several molecules involved in the functioning of testis (i.e. 17-\u03b2 estradiol [E2], P450 aromatase, estrogen receptors ESR1, ESR2, and GPER1 [also known as GPR30]) were investigated in free-ranging fat sand rats, Psammomys obesus, during the breeding and resting seasons. Leydig cells showed a strong immunoreactivity for aromatase in the testis sampled during the breeding season only; however, E2, ESR1, ESR2 and GPER1 were present during both seasons. Sertoli cells showed a positive signal for E2 and ESR2 during the breeding season; though, all molecules, except GPER1, were present during the resting season. Spermatogonia were reactive for E2, ESR2 and GPER1 during the breeding season and for ESR1 and GPER1 during the resting season. During both seasons, spermatocytes-I presented a moderate reactivity for E2, ESR1, ESR2 and a strong reactivity for GPER1; aromatase was detected during the resting season only. Spermatids and spermatozoa were present exclusively during breeding season and were reactive for all molecules; except round spermatids that were negative for aromatase. The functioning of the testis depends on finely tuned stimulation and inhibition systems. Our results suggest that differential expression of aromatase, ESR1, ESR2, and GPER1 across cells types is involved in the seasonal activation/inactivation cycle of spermatogenesis in a free-ranging species.",

In this study, the 5/6 nephrectomized rat was used as a CKD model and the TGF-\u03b21-exposed mouse mesangial cells were used as an in vitro model. Pathological examination showed that resveratrol treatment attenuated glomerular injury in the remnant kidney of 5/6 nephrectomized rat. Additionally, resveratrol improved mitochondrial function in vivo and in vitro, as evidenced by increasing mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing ATP, decreasing reactive oxygen species production and enhancing activities of complex I and III. Furthermore, the dysregulated expressions of electron transport chain proteins and fission/fusion proteins in the kidney of 5/6 nephrectomize rats and TGF-\u03b21-exposed mesangial cells were restored by resveratrol. Finally, upregulated sirt1 and PGC-1\u03b1 deacetylation were found after treatment with resveratrol in vivo and in vitro, which may contribute to the mitochondrial protective effects of resveratrol. The results demonstrate that resveratrol protects the mitochondria of kidney in 5/6 nephrectomized rats and TGF-\u03b21 induced mesangial cells.

Angiogenesis in ischemic heart can promote the supply of oxygen and nutrients to both ischemic myocardium and transplanted stem cells. Focus is then given to the evolving strategies amied at angiogenesis. ILK has been reported to be an important factor regulating apoptosis and angiogenesis. This study examined the role and mechanism of ILK in MSCs survival and angiogenesis. In hypoxic condition, upregulation of ILK expression increased the phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR, resulting in markedly enchanced MSCs survival and VEGF expression; while significantly inhibited MSCs survival and VEGF expression was detected in MSCs with ILK kinase inactivation, which was associated with a reduction of phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. In addition, it also caused an inhibitory effects of ILK on MSCs survival and VEGF expression, which was abolished by Akt or mTOR inhibitor. Furthermore, it was observed that ILK-overexpressed MSCs increased MSCs survival at 4\u00a0days and angiogenesis at 3 weeks after transplantation into infracted myocardium as compared with GFP-MSCs group and ILK-SiRNA-MSCs group. This enhanced response was associated with attenuated left ventricular (LV) chamber dilation, reduced LV fibrosis, decreased infarct size and improved LV function. These findings reveal ILK play a pivotal role in regulating MSCs survival and VEGF expression partially through Akt and mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, transplantation of ILK-overexpressed MSCs into infracted myocardium resulted in reduced fibrosis, improved cardiac function and remodeling, which mainly medicated through increased MSCs survival and angiogenesis.",

In human, an imbalance of the endocannabinoid system is linked with both ectopic pregnancy and infertility. In bovine species anandamide levels regulate aspects of sperm-oviduct interaction. Here we report the immunohistochemical distribution of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in cat ovary and oviduct, using paraffin-embedded tissue samples and commercially available antibodies. We found a differential expression of both CB1R and FAAH during different stages of ovarian function and in the oviduct. CB1R was detected only in tertiary follicle granulosa cells while more immature follicles were negative. FAAH was instead found in ovarian pre-antral follicles, the oocyte cytoplasm, and in granulosa cells of primary, secondary and tertiary follicles. Secondary and tertiary follicles were also FAAH immunoreactive. Luteal cells were immunopositive for both CB1R and FAAH. Because CBR1 in oviduct was found only in ciliated cells, it might represent a specific marker at least in cats. In contrast, FAAH immunoreactivity was observed in both ciliated and non-ciliated cells. The present study may thus serve as the starting point for further investigations on the role of the endocannabinoid system in cat reproduction. Additional work will be needed to assess whether the morphological distribution of CB1R and FAAH changes in different conditions such as pre-pubertal age, follicular phase of the sexual cycle and pregnancy.",

However, damage to the host caused by NO has been reported by various authors, and the role of NO in protection or cytotoxicity continues to be extensively studied. In this study, nitrergic neurons were investigated in the myenteric plexus of the jejunum and the distal colon of rats infected with 500 oocysts of the M7741 strain of T. gondii. Ten rats were randomly assigned into a control group (CG) and infected group (IG; received 500 sporulated oocysts of T. gondii orally). After 24\u00a0h, the rats were euthanized, and samples of the jejunum and distal colon were obtained and processed for NADPH-diaphorase histochemical analysis. Quantitative and morphometric analysis of the nitrergic neurons in whole mounts containing the myenteric plexus was performed. There was a numeric reduction of nitrergic neurons per mm2 in both jejunum and distal colon. The remaining nitrergic neurons suffered atrophy in the areas of the cell body and nucleus, which resulted in a decrease in cytoplasm. Thus, we conclude that an avirulent strain of T. gondii in a short time causes neuroplastic changes in the small and large intestine of rats.",

The presence and localization of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive (ChAT-IR) cells in the microbat retina were investigated using immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy, and quantitative analysis. These ChAT-IR cells were present in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner part of the inner nuclear layer (INL), as previously reported in various animals. However, the bat retina also contained some ChAT-IR cells in the outer part of the INL. The dendrites of these cells extended into the outer plexiform layer, and those of the cells in the inner INL extended within the outer part of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The dendrites of the ChAT-IR cells in the GCL extended into the middle of the IPL and some fibers ramified up to the outer IPL. The average densities of ChAT-IR cells in the GCL, inner INL, and outer INL were 259\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0cells/mm2, 469\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0cells/mm2, and 59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0cells/mm2, respectively.

We also found that the cholinergic amacrine cells in the bat retina contained calbindin, one of the calcium-binding proteins, but not calretinin or parvalbumin. As the cholinergic amacrine cells play key roles in the direction selectivity and optokinetic eye reflex in the other mammalian retinas, the present study might provide better information of the cytoarchitecture of bat retina and the basic sources for further physiological studies.",

This review summarizes the research about the regulation of RhoGDI\u03b1 during cell migration, which can be in a Rho GTPases association independent manner.

At the basis of this relationship is the close interconnection between the ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation. Cell proliferation-stimulating factors also stimulate ribosome production, while the ribosome biogenesis rate controls the cell cycle progression. The major tumour suppressor, the p53 protein, plays an important balancing role between the ribosome biogenesis rate and the cell progression through the cell cycle phases. The perturbation of ribosome biogenesis stabilizes and activates p53, with a consequent cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death, whereas an up-regulated ribosome production down-regulates p53 expression and activity, thus facilitating neoplastic transformation.In the present review we describe the interconnection between ribosome biogenesis and cell proliferation, while highlighting the mechanisms by which quantitative changes in ribosome biogenesis may induce cancer.",

Six boars were used. Three boars were subjected to an elevated ambient temperature (37\u201340\u00a0\u00b0C, 7\u00a0days, 3\u00a0h per day) as a heat stress (HS) group. The other 3 boars were kept in a room temperature house (20\u201327\u00a0\u00b0C) as a control group. All boars were castrated and the testes were harvested. TUNEL assay was used for the detection of apoptotic cells. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze protein and mRNA levels of Bcl-2 and Bax in response to heat treatment. The results showed that apoptotic signals increased under heat stress conditions compared with the control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and the cell types most affected by heat treatment were spermatocytes and spermatids. In both the control and experimental groups, Bcl-2 was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of spermatogonia, spermatocytes and differentiating spermatids and Bcl-2 preferentially localized close to the seminiferous tubule's luminal surface in late spermatocytes and spermatids. Compared with the control group, the expression levels of Bcl-2 protein and mRNA significantly increased in heat treatment group, while the expression levels of Bax protein and mRNA did not show significant changes between the control and experimental group. Low to moderate Bax immunoreactivity staining was observed in all kinds of germ cells in the control group. Strong staining was observed in spermatogonia, and low to moderate Bax staining was observed in spermatocytes and spermatids. A redistribution of Bax from a cytoplasmic to perinuclear or nuclear localization could be observed in the spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids obtained in the heat treated group. These results showed that elevated ambient temperatures induced germ cell apoptosis. In response to heat stress, the expression of Bcl-2 increased and a redistribution of Bax from a cytoplasmic to a perinuclear or nuclear localization.

Cell-to-cell contact between single-stained TLR2+ cells and FoxP3+ cells was noted. Double IF studies validated demonstration of co-expression of FoxP3+/TLR2+ immune cells in OSCC.The presence of FoxP3+TLR2+ cells within the OSCC microenvironment may represent a dendritic cell-dependent pathway capable of inhibiting Treg suppressive activity, potentially enhancing the anti-tumour response.

Western blot indicates some immunoreactive bands in the expected range at 46 and 33\u00a0kDa in the regenerating tail. Immunolocalization indicates that Wnt1 is prevalently detected in the apical wound epidermis, blastema, and ependyma ampulla of the regenerating tail while it lowers in other tissues of more proximal regions close to the original tail stump. Although a gradient for Wnt1 was not detected, the higher immunofluorescence present in the apical region of the blastema and around the regenerating spinal cord indicates that the protein could be secreted from the apical wound epidermis and the ependyma and might influence cell proliferation in the blastema, the distal-most growing center of the new tail.

From the 30th to the 38th week, calretinin was expressed by most of Purkinje cells and by migrating cerebellar interneurons. Furthermore, granule cells in the internal granular layer were also immunoreactive for calretinin. Our data show that calretinin, other than for developing Purkinje cells, is a useful marker also for migrating cerebellar interneurons and for some neuronal elements related to the granular layer.

We established two models of CPFE in mice using tracheal instillation with bleomycin (BLM) or murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68). Experimental mice were divided randomly into four groups: A (normal control, n\u00a0=\u00a06), B (emphysema, n\u00a0=\u00a06),\u2009C (emphysema\u00a0+\u00a0MHV-68, n\u00a0=\u00a024), D (emphysema\u00a0+\u00a0BLM, n\u00a0=\u00a06). Group C was subdivided into four groups: C1 (sacrificed on day 367, 7\u2009days after tracheal instillation of MHV-68); C2 (day 374; 14\u00a0days); C3 (day 381; 21\u00a0days); C4 (day 388; 28\u00a0days). Conspicuous emphysema and interstitial fibrosis were observed in BLM and MHV-68 CPFE mouse models. However, BLM induced diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis with severely diffuse pulmonary inflammation; MHV-68 induced relatively modest inflammation and fibrosis, and the inflammation and fibrosis were not diffuse, but instead around bronchioles. Inflammation and fibrosis were detectable in the day-7 subgroup and reached a peak in the day-28 subgroup in the emphysema\u2009+\u2009MHV-68 group. Levels of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1, interleukin-13, and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were increased significantly in both models. Percentage of apoptotic type-2 lung epithelial cells was significantly higher; however, all four types of cytokine and number of macrophages were significantly lower in the emphysema\u00a0+\u00a0MHV-68 group compared with the emphysema\u2009\u00a0+\u00a0BLM group. The different changes in pathology between BLM and MHV-68 mice models demonstrated different pathology subtypes of CPFE: macrophage infiltration and apoptosis of type-II lung epithelial cells increased with increasing pathology score for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Previously, we reported that the expression of superoxides and of the NO-generating enzyme (NO synthase, NOS) was up-regulated in the human pancreatitis, especially within the exocrine compartment indicating an exceptional susceptibility of the exocrine parenchyma to oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to compare the regulation of NO signalling pathways in the human pancreatitis and in an animal model of an acute pancreatitis induced by pancreatic duct ligation (PDL) in rats. In the PDL-induced rat pancreatitis, we revealed a similar pattern of oxidative stress and NOS up-regulation in acinar and in ductal compartments, like in the human pancreatitis. This demonstrates that the PDL-induced rat pancreatitis is a proper model for further studies of acute pancreatitis development in humans.",

     "abstract": "Surgical hemostasis is critical in reducing the likelihood of excessive bleeding and blood transfusion. In treating some cases, commonly used hemostatic agent showed limited efficacy and prolonged degradation and clearance, causing an inhibition of bone healing. Starch absorbable polysaccharide (SAPH) is a novel hemostatic agent made from a plant starch, which can be completely absorbed and achieve better hemostatic effects than many commonly used hemostatic agents. However, whether SAPH can induce a promotion of bone healing remains unknown. In this study, we used a model of rabbit parietal bone defect and a mouse osteoblast cell line MC3T3-E1 to evaluate the effects of SAPH on bone healing. We found that SAPH significantly decreased bone healing scores, reduced defective area of parietal bone, and increased the areas of bone trabeculae and cavitas medullaris. In addition, SAPH enhanced MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts proliferation, up-regulated the expressions of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin and increased the level of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts. These SAPH-induced benefits in MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts were significantly abolished by the application of BMP-2-siRNA. These findings suggested that SAPH enhances bone healing, promotes the proliferation, differentiation and maturation of osteoblast by up-regulating BMP-2 expression in osteoblastic cells.",

The aim of this work was to describe the morphological characteristics of the female Mongolian gerbil\u2019s (Meriones unguiculatus) normal mammary gland, the average expression of hormone receptors, and the average proliferation rates in the epithelial cells during the periods of lactation, pregnancy and involution. Dams were euthanized on the 14th and 21st gestational days, 7 and 14\u00a0days after parturition, and 3 and 5\u00a0days after weaning. The dams\u2019 mammary tissues were processed and were submitted to haematoxylin and eosin staining, Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining, and Gomori\u2019s Reticulin staining. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was performed for the characterization of myoepithelial cells with \u03b1-actin, the proliferation rates with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the estrogen hormonal receptors (ESR1 and ESR2), and progesterone receptor (PR) quantifications. It was observed that the abundant adipose tissues were replaced by glandular epithelia and there was an increase in the epithelial cell\u2019s height (from 5.97 to 32.4\u00a0\u03bcm in 14th and 21st gestational days and from 20.64 to 25.4\u00a0\u03bcm in 7th and 14th lactational days, respectively) and the acini diameters (from 24.88 to 69.92\u00a0\u03bcm in 14th and 21st gestational days and from 139.69 to 118.59\u00a0\u03bcm in 7th and 14th lactational days, respectively) with the progression of gestation and lactation. The PAS staining intensity varied throughout the glands and between the stages that were evaluated. The extracellular matrix showed different phenotypes too, with more of a presence of the Type I collagen during the early gestation and involution and with more reticular fibers (Type III collagen) during the late gestation period and lactation. The myoepithelial layers showed alterations in their distribution with thick patterns as verified by the \u03b1-actin labeling. The PCNA showed higher rates of the marked cells in 14th and 21st gestational days (40.25 and 60.28%) and in 7th and 14th lactational days (64.08 and 65.08%). The hormone receptor quantifications showed a high variation in the rates: the average PR staining decreased from 14th to 21st gestational days (from 42.3 to 8.54%), from 7th to 14th lactational days (from 59.83 to 23.18%) and from 3rd to 5th days after weaning (from 39.98 to 12.72). There were higher averages of ESR1 staining in gestational days 14 and 21(from 58.06 to 30.02%). ESR2 staining decreased during gestation (25.7 and 12.94% in 14th and 21st gestational days)and involution (from 50.97 to 30.18% in 3rd and 5th days after weaning). The Mongolian gerbils showed similar morphological characteristics when they were compared to mice and rats. However, the higher proliferation rates with a smaller involution period compared to other murine characterized this species as being adequate for mammary pathologies studies.",

Also, stress modifies oxidative status and causes apoptosis in testes, as well as a decrease in the epithelial area of seminiferous tubules. However, there are no studies that analyze the alterations caused by stress in testicular cells. Thus, in this study, alterations in the morphology of testicular germ cells caused by different days of chronic stress were assessed. Adult male rats were exposed to stress by immersion in cold water (ICW) daily for 3, 8, 20 or 50 consecutive days. Plasma testosterone and corticosterone were also assessed. Results showed that chronic stress causes loss of germ cells, and alteration of spermatogenesis. Seminiferous tubules from stressed males showed several degenerative signs, such as vacuoles in the basal epithelium, with picnotic indicia; moderate to severe exfoliation of degenerative germinal cells in the tubule lumen was also observed. These alterations were observed in all days of stress in a gradual way, from day 3\u201350. Testosterone levels were decreased at all those times, and corticosterone concentrations were increased on the same days. These results show that chronic stress causes severe damage to germ cells, which can account for infertility problems in males. These alterations are related to a decrease in testosterone as well as an increase in corticosterone caused by stress.",

However, they may also affect thyroid hormone economy. Keeping in mind impaired thyroid function at older age, in this study we tested wheather NAR or HES administration potentiate this decline. NAR or HES were administrated orally (15\u00a0mg/kg) to male 24-month-old Wistar rats during 4 weeks. Control groups received vehicle, sunflower oil. Qualitative and quantitative immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent expression of specific proteins and stereological analyses of thyroid tissue were performed. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and total thyroxine (T4) concentrations were measured in serum. Thyroid parenchyma of both flavanone-treated groups was characterized by lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) absolute and relative volume of luminal colloid, accompanied by elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) relative volume of stroma in comparison with the controls. No hypertrophy or absolute thyroid volume change was detected. Intensity of immunopositive signal for thyroglobulin (Tg) and T4 bound to Tg (T4-Tg) increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the colloid of thyroid follicles after both flavanone treatments. Serum TSH increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after NAR, while T4 remained unchanged after both treatments. In conclusion, NAR elevated serum TSH in old-aged males, thus being more potent than HES in altering pituitary-thyroid axis. However, changes in thyroid structure, namely moderate colloid depletion and higher Tg and T4-Tg protein expressions after both treatments, indicate preserved capacity of the gland to compensate flavanone interfering, and maintain T4 production in old-aged males.",

The CD31 immunolabeling showed that neovascularization was observed in the IPC group but not in the I/R group.

An immunohistochemical study was performed on whole sections of paraffin embedded tissue, using antibodies for the following markers: estrogen receptor alpha and beta, progesterone receptor, androgen receptor, HER2, EGFR, Ki-67, E-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, p53, chromogranin, synaptophysin, GCDFP15, mammaglobin, and CDX2.The pure mucinous type was more prevalent in older patients and more frequently expressed GCDFP15. Capella type B presented more frequently with a high Ki-67 index and neuroendocrine differentiation. Although there was a lower frequency of vascular invasion and lymph node metastases in the pure type, the difference was not statistically significant. No case expressed CDX2 (a marker for gastrointestinal tumors), while 85% of the cases expressed at least one of the two typical breast markers (GCDFP15 and mammaglobin), suggesting that these markers may be reliably used for differential diagnosis. Expression of estrogen receptor beta was related to the presence of mucin cell producing lymph node metastasis, with potential prognostic and predictive value.our findings support the immunohistochemical homogeneity of mucinous breast carcinomas because only minor differences were found when subgrouping them into Capella types A and B or into types pure and mixed.",

It is known that substance P (SP), after binding to the neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor, elicits GC proliferation; that GC cells and samples express NK-1 receptors; that NK-1 receptor antagonists, in a concentration dependent manner, inhibit the proliferation of GC cells and that these cells die by apoptosis. However, the presence of SP in GC and normal gastric cells is unknown. In order to know more on the involvement of the SP/NK-1 receptor system in GC, we studied in thirty human GC and normal gastric samples the immunolocalization of SP after using an immunohistochemical technique. SP was observed in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of GC and normal gastric cells. The nuclear expression of SP was higher in GC cells than in normal cells. No significant difference was observed when the cytoplasmatic expression of SP in normal and GC cells was compared.

However, as epithelial removal may cause postoperative pain and an increased risk of corneal infection, new therapeutic approaches have been proposed. Iontophoresis is a recently developed non-invasive technique which provides the use of electrical current during CXL to enhance transepithelial penetration of riboflavin into the corneal stroma. Here, we describe for the first time the morphological changes of the corneal stromal compartment in a patient with keratoconus who underwent in vivo iontophoresis-assisted CXL (ionto-CXL) before full-thickness corneal transplantation. Immunohistochemistry for type I collagen and CD34 was performed to investigate the stromal distribution of collagen fibers and keratocytes, respectively. The histology of ionto-CXL-treated keratoconic cornea, collected 6 months after the intervention, was compared with that of healthy corneas and either untreated or standard CXL-treated keratoconic corneas. An attempt to restore a normal stromal architecture was observed in the ionto-CXL-treated cornea compared with untreated keratoconic corneas. In particular, the ionto-CXL-treated cornea showed a parallel distribution of type I collagen fibers, although fiber interweaving appeared less organized than in healthy corneas and standard CXL-treated keratoconic corneas. Moreover, the distribution of CD34-positive keratocytes was improved in keratoconic corneas following ionto-CXL treatment, though a scattered CD34 immunoreactivity was still noticeable in the subepithelial stroma. This study provides histological evidence that ionto-CXL may represent a non-invasive alternative in the management of progressive keratoconus in adults.",

The methyl-thiazol-diphenyl-tetrazolium assay, annexin V/propidium iodide test, electron microscopic examination, cell cycle analysis based on DNA content, real-time PCR assays, in vitro scratch wound-healing assay, fluorescence staining of F-actin, \u03b2-tubulin and vimentin were performed to assess the effects of quercetin on A549 cells. Our results showed that quercetin triggered BCL2/BAX-mediated apoptosis, as well as necrosis and mitotic catastrophe, and inhibited the migratory potential of A549 cells. The disassembling effect of quercetin on microfilaments, microtubules and vimentin filaments along with its inhibitory impact on vimentin and N-cadherin expression might account for the decreased migration of A549 cells in response to quercetin treatment. We also suggest that the possible mechanism underlying quercetin-induced mitotic catastrophe involves the perturbation of mitotic microtubules leading to monopolar spindle formation, and, consequently, to the failure of cytokinesis. We further propose that cytokinesis failure could also be a result of the depletion of actin filaments by quercetin. These findings are important to our further understanding of the detailed mechanism of the antitumor activity of quercetin and render this flavonoid a potentially useful candidate for combination therapy with conventional antimicrotubule drugs, nucleic acid-directed agents or novel cytoskeletal-directed agents.",

Human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs) were obtained from amniocentesis at the second trimester of gestation. The cells were characterized as mesenchymal stem cells by flow cytometry. The results showed that the cells were positive for mesenchymal stem cell markers CD44, CD73, CD90 and HLA-ABC, and negative for CD31, Amniotic fluid stem cells marker: CD117, anti-human fibroblasts, HLA-DR and hematopoietic differentiation markers CD34 and CD45. The hAF-MSCs were differentiated into endothelial cells under the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and analyzed for the expression of the endothelial-specific markers and function. The expression of the endothelial-specific markers was determined by reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), while immunofluorescent analysis demonstrated that the induced hAF-MSCs expressed von Willebrand factor (vWF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), CD31 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The network formation assay showed that the induced hAF-MSCs formed partial networks. All results indicated that hAF-MSCs have the potential to be differentiated into endothelial-like cells, while human amniotic fluid might be a suitable source of MSCs for vascularized tissue engineering.",

     "abstract": "Mucins, secreted by intestinal goblet cells, form an integral part of the intestinal biofilm, which is important for the functioning of a healthy gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This mucous layer is sensitive to factors such as diet, drugs and inflammation. Histochemically, mucins can be classified as neutral or acidic, where acidic mucins can contain sulphate groups (sulphomucins) or sialic acid (sialomucins). The aim of the present study was to determine the composition of various mucin secreting cells using histochemical stains in rats fed on a high calorie diet (HCD) treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Wistar rats (N\u00a0=\u00a024) were divided into a lean control group (C/ART\u2212), high calorie diet group (C/HCD+), ART group (C/ART+) and HCD and ART group (HCD+/ART+). The body of the stomach as well as the colon were stained with Alcian Blue Periodic Schiff (ABPAS) to distinguish between neutral and acidic mucins and Alcian Blue Aldehyde Fuschin (ABAF) to distinguish between sialo-and sulphomucins. An increase of the total gastric mucous cells was observed in the HCD+/ART+ group compared to the C/ART\u2212 group using both ABPAS and ABAF. A decrease of neutral cells in the distal part of the colonic crypts in the C/HCD+ and C/ART+ groups compared to the C/ART\u2212 group were observed. Mixed goblet cells in the colonic crypts of the C/ART\u2212 and HCD+/ART+ groups were decreased in comparison to the C/ART+ group. The study showed that the total mean percentage of mucous cells in the stomach as well as the total amount of neutral goblet cells in the colon were most affected by ART and a HCD. These changes in a rat model suggest that the quality of the biofilm may be altered and should be considered when ART is prescribed to obese patients.",

Most of the data on odontogenesis derives from rodents, which does not have all dental groups. Didelphis albiventris is an opossum with the closest dentition to humans, and the main odontogenesis stages occur when the newborns are in the pouch. In this study, D. albiventris postnatals were used to characterize the main stages of their molars development; and also to establish FGF2, FGF3 and FGF4 expression pattern. D. albiventris postnatals were processed for histological and indirect immunoperoxidase analysis of the tooth germs. Our results revealed similar dental structures between D. albiventris and mice. However, FGF2, FGF3 and FGF4 expression patterns were observed in a larger number of dental structures, suggesting broader functions for these molecules in this opossum species. The knowledge of the signaling that determinates odontogenesis in an animal model with complete dentition may contribute to the development of therapies for the replacement of lost teeth in humans. This study may also contribute to the implementation of D. albiventris as model for Developmental Biology studies.",

     "abstract": "Experimental evidence suggests human M\u00fcller glia exhibit neural progenitor properties in vitro. CD117 and CD44 are known to be expressed by stem cells, the survival of which appears to depend critically on interactions with hyaluronan-rich extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we characterise M\u00fcller glia expression of CD117 and CD44 in normal adult human retina and describe how it correlates with hyaluronan distribution in ocular ECM. By using chromogen-based immunohistochemistry, CD117 expression was found in entire M\u00fcller glia cytoplasm spanning from inner to outer limiting membrane in both peripheral retina (PR) and macular retina (MR), mirroring expression of the established M\u00fcller glia marker vimentin. Unlike vimentin, CD117 was also strongly expressed by M\u00fcller glia nuclei. Relative to total inner nuclear layer (INL) nuclei, more CD117+ M\u00fcller glia nuclei were seen in PR than MR. By contrast, CD44 expression was found predominantly in M\u00fcller glia apical processes of PR; no expression was found in MR. Astral blue staining demonstrated the presence of hyaluronan in cortical vitreous and the interphotoreceptor matrix (IPM) in both MR and PR. Our findings demonstrate that: (i) both CD117 and CD44 are expressed by human adult M\u00fcller glia; (ii) CD117 is a robust nuclear and cytoplasmic immunohistochemical marker of M\u00fcller glia; and (iii) that while CD117 is expressed by the entire M\u00fcller glia in both PR and MR, CD44 is only expressed by M\u00fcller glia apices in PR. Since the apices of M\u00fcller glia are in direct contact with the hyaluronan-rich IPM, the M\u00fcller glia-IPM interface in PR is likely a favourable region for supporting progenitor or stem cell-like signalling. These observations provide novel insights into potential stem-cell favouring microenvironments in mature human retina.",

We present a reproducible non-enzymatic protocol to isolate cell progenitor populations of three distinct areas of the mature bovine IVD. Bovine specific RNA probes were validated in situ and employed to assess fate changes, heterogeneity, stem cell characteristics and differentiation potential of the cultures.

Lung tissue samples were processed for light, electron microscopic and immunohistochemical study using anti inducible NO synthase (iNOS). The lung of HCL group demonstrated thickened interalveolar septa, inflammatory cell infiltration and significant increase in the area percent of collagenous fibers and immune expression of iNOS. Ultra structurally, disrupted alveolocapillay membrane, degenerated type II pneumocytes and plentiful alveolar macrophages were evident. PO administration partially attenuated these histological and ultra structural alterations and reduced iNOS immune-expression in lung tissue. In conclusion, PO has a protective effect against HCL aspiration lung injury most probably through its antioxidant activity.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of tartrazine and vitamin E on the performance of rats in memory and learning tests as well as the structure of medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). The rats were first divided into seven groups which received the followings for a period of seven weeks: distilled water, corn oil, vitamin E (100\u00a0mg/kg/day), a low dose (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) and a high dose (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) of tartrazine with and without vitamin E. Behavioral tests were conducted and the brain was extracted for stereological methods The high dose of tartrazine decreased the exploration time of novel objects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The low and high doses of tartrazine led into an increase in working and reference memory errors in acquisition and retention phases (eight-arm radial maze) compared to distilled water group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Additionally, the high dose of tartrazine induced a reduction in the volume of mPFC (\u223c13%) and its subdivision. Not only that, but the number of neurons and glial cells (\u223c14%) as well as the mushroom and thin spines per dendrite length declined. The length of dendrites per neuron also reduced in comparison to the distilled water group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Nonetheless, concomitant treatment of the rats with vitamin E plus tartrazine prevented the above-mentioned changes. An acceptable daily dose of tartrazine could induce impairment in spatial memory and dendrite structure. Moreover, a high dose of tartrazine may defect the visual memory, mPFC structure, the spatial memory and also cause dendrite changes. Vitamin E could prevent the behavioral and structural changes.",

The aim of this work was to study the repercussions of high fat diet (HFD) induced diabetes on the retina of Meriones shawi (M.sh). Two groups of six M.sh each was studied. Group I was a normal control, fed with standard laboratory granules. In Group II, rodents received a HFD of enriched laboratory granules, for a period of 3 months. Body weight and plasma glucose were determined in the two groups. Retinal sections of the two groups were stained with the Hematoxylin-Eosin. Photoreceptors were identified by immunolabeling for rhodopsin (rods) and PNA (cones). Gliosis and microglial activation were identified by immunolabeling for GFAP and Iba-1. Labeling of calretinin and parvalbumin were also carried out to study the AII amacrine cells. Retinal layers thicknesses, gliosis, and specific neural cell populations were quantified by microscopy. The body weight (+77%) and plasma glucose (+108%) were significantly greater in the HFD rodents. Three months of HFD induced a significant loss of 38.77% of cone photoreceptors, as well as gliosis and an increase of 70.67% of microglial cells. Calcium homeostatic enzymes were depleted. This work shows that HFD in Meriones shawi induces a type II diabetes-like condition that causes loss of retinal neurons and photoreceptors, as well as gliosis. Meriones shawi could be a useful experimental animal model for this physiopathology particularly in the study of retinal neuro-glial alterations in Type II diabetes.",

Our data report that Cu enhanced 5HT innervation in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) together with a loss of TH expression within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), Substantia nigra compacta (SNc) and their subsequent outputs including the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) and striatum. In the elevated plus maze Cu significantly increased the time and the number of entries into the open arms, and raised the time spent in the Dark Box indicating a clear reduced anxiety state induced by Cu. The present data show for the first time a powerful neuro-modulatory potential of Cu in rat which involves primarily a dysfunction of 5HT and DA neurotransmissions.",

     "abstract": "The nucleus of mammalian embryos differs by transcriptional activity at different stages of early development. Here, we studied nuclear distribution of the chromatin-remodeling protein ATRX in pre-implantation mouse embryos. Immunofluorescent staining revealed the changes of ATRX nuclear distribution at the initial stages of early mouse development. At the stage of early zygote, a diffuse ATRX distribution pattern was prevalent. During the course of zygotic genome activation (ZGA), zones of increased ATRX concentration are observed, and they are most expressed in the nuclei of late 2-cell embryos. In the morula stage, the ATRX distribution becomes diffuse again. In zygotes, the patterns of ATRX distribution differ between male and female pronuclei. At all the stages, ATRX concentrates in the DAPI-positive areas of condensed chromatin. The level of colocalization between ATRX and heterochromatin was found the highest at the late 2-cell stage. When transcription was artificially suppressed, the pattern of intranuclear ATRX distribution was mostly determined by the mechanism of inhibitor action rather than the decreased level of transcriptional activity. Thus, the obvious changes of ATRX distribution occur and partially correlate with the main stages of ZGA during mouse early development, but these changes seem to be determined by other processes of structural and functional rearrangements of blastomere nuclei.",

Similarly, ELISA and western blot analysis also showed the up-regulation of pro-caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 expression in the visfatin group compared to the control group. In contrast to LPS, visfatin down-regulated the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 in the visfatin+LPS co-stimulated group, resulting in a significant decrease in apoptosis in intestinal mucosal cells. We observed more pro-caspase-3 positive cells in the visfatin+LPS co-stimulated group.

At the thickening stage, the epidermis at the pressed site became transiently thicker, and at the whitening stage, rapidly thinner. At these stages, the epidermis in the skin surrounding the pressed site became gradually thicker. At the yellow scar stage, the skin was covered only by necrotic tissues and horny layer. These layers were scratched during walking and turning, and the yellow scar stage became the open wound stage. Inflammatory reaction began at the thickening stage, and at the yellow scar and open wound stages, necrosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells and dilation of small blood vessels were observed.

Tryptophan staining was seen in acini of the deep gland and demilunes, whereas acid mucosubstances were exclusively localised in the superficial gland. Dehydrogenase activities were widespread. Strong esterase activity occurred throughout the parenchyma of the deep gland and in demilunes; it was variably inhibited by E600, apart from acinar apical regions in the deep gland. Lipase was confined to acini of the deep gland and demilunes. Acid phosphatase staining was similarly localised; it was also seen in periluminal ductal rims of the deep gland, in which ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase was localised basolaterally. Staining for alkaline phosphatase decorated occasional myoepithelial-like arrangements and interstitial capillaries. Acetylcholinesterase was associated with nerve fibres embracing glandular parenchyma. Adrenergic fibres were not seen. The results suggest that the acini of the posterior deep lingual gland secrete neutral glycoproteins, whereas the ducts transport ions and absorb luminal material. The posterior superficial lingual gland mainly secretes acid glycoproteins. Both glands produce lingual lipase, receive cholinergic-type innervation and have inconspicuous myoepithelium.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the temporal and spacial distribution of the mucins produced by goblet cells and intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) expression during the development of the small intestine of the rat. Intestines were removed from rats on the 15th, 17th and 18th days of intratuterine life (i.u.) and on the 3rd, 10th, 17th and 25th days after birth (a.b.). Intestines were processed for routine histological procedures and sections were submitted to histochemistry using PAS to stain neutral glycoproteins and Alcian blue for acidic glycoproteins, as well as immunohistochemistry to detect IAP. In rats, glycoprotein production was seen to begin in the intestinal epithelium cell at around the 17th day of i.u. life; however, this production was not accompanied by morphological indications of the presence of goblet cells. By the 18th i.u. day, the villus epithelium was undergoing differentiation and the first goblet cells could be identified from this time. At around the 10th day a.b., both compartments of the small intestine were detected; i.e. the villi and the crypts. At this timepoint, goblet cells were present in the villi, and also in the upper regions of the crypts. On the 3rd, 10th 17th and 25th days a.b., the presence of the goblet cells increased and presented regional differences in the sections evaluated. IAP was not detected during i.u. life, but was weakly detected in the cells of the villi from the 3rd day a.b., along the entire extension of the villi. On the 10th day, IAP was detected at the tip of the villi, while on the 25th day, it was detected along the extension of the villi, but with a weaker intensity. In conclusion, a temporal and spacial distribution of goblet cells and IAP activity occurs during the development of the small intestine, suggesting a possible regulatory control in accordance with the suckling and weaning phases of food intake in the rat\u2019s life.",

Urethral endocrine cells immunoreactive for 5-HT were densely distributed in the epithelial layers of the prostatic part, but were sparsely distributed in the membranous and spongy parts of urethra. Distribution of urethral endocrine cells with 5-HT immunoreactivity in the prostatic part was restricted from the internal urethral orifice to the region of seminal colliculus. 5-HT-immunoreactive endocrine cells were also observed in the ductal epithelial layers of coagulating glands, prostatic glands, and seminal vesicles. 5-HT-immunoreactive endocrine cells were triangular or flask in shape and possessed an apical projection extending toward the urethral lumen, and basal or lateral protrusions intruding between other epithelial cells were also detected in some cells. Double immunolabeling for 5-HT and CGRP revealed that CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers attached to urethral endocrine cells with 5-HT immunoreactivity in the prostatic part. These results suggest that urethral endocrine cells may release 5-HT in response to luminal stimuli, and that these cells and CGRP-immunoreactive nerves may regulate each other by an axon reflex mechanism.",

Insects, throughout the larval period, were fed eggs of Diatraea saccharalis treated with neem oil at a concentration of 0.5%, 1% or 2%. In the adult stage, the midgut was collected from female insects at two stages of adulthood (newly emerged and at the start of oviposition) and processed for ultrastructural analyses. In the newly emerged insects obtained from neem oil treatments, muscle fibers showed a reduction of myofilaments as well as swollen mitochondria and an accumulation of membranous structures. Muscular fibers responded to those cellular injuries with the initiation of detoxification mechanisms, in which acid phosphatase activity was observed in large vesicles located at the periphery of the muscle fiber. At the start of oviposition in the neem oil treated insects, muscle fibers exhibited signs of degeneration, containing vacant areas in which contractile myofilaments were reduced or completely absent, and an accumulation of myelin structures, a dilatation of cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial swelling and cristolysis were observed. Enzymatic activity for acid phosphatase was present in large vesicles, indicating that mechanisms of lytic activity during the cell injury were utilized but insufficient for recovery from all the cellular damage. The results indicate that the visceral muscle layer is also the target of action of neem oil, and the cytotoxic effects observed may compromise the function of that organ.",

However, the subsequent signalling modulations for epithelial maturation, initiated by Fgf signalling, remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we employed an in vitro tongue organ cultivation system along with the applications of various pharmacological inhibitors against the intracellular signalling molecules of Fgf signalling pathways, including H89, LY294002, PD98059, and U0126. Following treatments with LY294002 and H89, inhibitors for PI3K and PKA, respectively, the decreased thickness of the tongue epithelium was observed along with the alteration in cell proliferative and apoptotic patterns. Meanwhile, cultivated tongues treated with MEK inhibitor U0126 or PD98059 showed significantly decreased cell proliferation in the tongue epithelium and the mesenchyme. Based on these results, we suggest that the tongue epithelium is differentiated into multiple epithelial cell layers via the PI3K and PKA pathways in tissue-specific manner during the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions.",

They can also secrete multiple bioactive molecules that exert specific physiological functions. Thus, UCMSCs represent excellent candidates for cell therapy in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Abundant preclinical research on different disease models has shown that UCMSCs can accelerate wound or nerve damage recovery and suppress tumor progression. In fact, UCMSCs are thought to possess a higher therapeutic potential than MSCs derived from other tissues. Increasing evidence suggests that the mechanism underlying UCSMCs efficacy depends mostly on cell secretions, in contrast to the early paradigm of cell replacement and differentiation. In this review, we discuss UCMSCs biological characteristics, their secretome-based therapeutic mechanism, and potential applications.",

     "abstract": "The carotid body (CB) is a major peripheral arterial chemoreceptor organ that evokes compensatory reflex responses so as to maintain gas homeostasis. It is dually innervated by sensory fibers from petrosal ganglion (PG) neurons, and autonomic fibers from postganglionic sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) and parasympathetic vasomotor fibers of intrinsic ganglion cells in the CB. The presence of nitric oxide (NO), a putative gaseous neurotransmitter substance in a number of neuronal and non-neuronal structures, was examined in the CB, PG and SCG of the rat using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing. One week after injecting the retrograde tracer Fast Blue (FB) in the CB, we found that a subset of perikarya in the caudal portions of the PG and SCG were FB-labeled. Histochemistry and immunohistochemistry revealed that the majority of large- and medium-sized PG and SCG cells were NADPH-d positive and displayed a strong NOS immunostaining. We also observed that many varicose nerve fibers penetrating the CB and enveloping the glomus cells and blood vessels were NADPH-d reactive and expressed the constitutive isoforms of NOS, nNOS and eNOS. In addition, some autonomic microganglion cells embedded within, or located at the periphery of the CB, and not glomus or sustentacular cells were nNOS-immunopositive while CB microvasculature expressed eNOS. The present results suggest that NO is a transmitter in the autonomic nerve endings supplying the CB and is involved in efferent chemoreceptor inhibition by a dual mechanism.",

Gene expression analysis showed maximum expression of AR and SDH in the coagulating glands. Western blot analysis showed a coordinated presence of the two enzymes in the coagulating glands, seminal vesicle and epididymis. Immunohistochemistry showed a concordant expression of the two enzymes in the coagulating gland, which goes well with its function of fructose production in rats. A less concordant expression of the two enzymes in the seminal vesicle was also seen. Discrete expression of AR was seen in the Sertoli cells without SDH. Germ cells including sperm in the seminiferous tubules lacked AR, but SDH was present in all stages of developing germ cells including sperm present in the seminiferous tubules. The epithelial layer of epididymis showed the presence of AR, but it was negligible in vas deferens and prostate. SDH was not seen in the epithelial layer of epididymis, vas deferens or prostate. Though sperm in the seminiferous tubules lacked AR, sperm extracted from cauda showed the presence of both AR and SDH. Immunofluorescence localization of AR and SDH on sperm showed the presence of both the enzymes all over sperm. Discrete expression of AR in the Sertoli cells may be linked to detoxification of a number of metabolism by-products. Similarly, the presence of polyol enzymes on sperm in epididymis and beyond may be to tackle toxic metabolites they may encounter during their journey along the male or female reproductive tract.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of MXT on the organization of cytoskeletal proteins. Analyses were performed using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, spectrophotometric techniques, flow cytometry and Western blotting.It was shown that H1299 cells are significantly more sensitive to mitoxantrone than the A549 cell line, and that the growth-inhibitory effect of the drug is dose-dependent only after longer incubation. The observed presence of ring-like microtubule structures and mitochondria surrounding the nuclei of H1299 cells could be a manifestation of increased tubulin polymerization requiring large amounts of energy, whereas the loss of actin stress fibers was presumably not the cause but rather the consequence of cell death induction. Treatment with mitoxantrone also led to the appearance of structures resembling agresomes in H1299 cells and to nucleolar segregation in both cell lines. It was demonstrated that cells arrested in the S phase were most susceptible to cell death induction, and that triggered intracellular changes led mainly to apoptosis. High concentrations induced necrosis and some H1299 cells exhibited morphological features of mitotic catastrophe.",

In several types of cancers, NHERF1 and EZRIN are displaced from the apical compartment to the cytoplasm and nuclei of cancer cells.

In this study, NHERF1 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in cyst adenofibromas, serous borderline tumors, and serous ovarian carcinomas. We observed a strong staining of NHERF1 and EZRIN at the membrane level of borderline tumors and areas of papillary structures in ovarian carcinomas. In tumors without papillary structures and compact structure, NHERF1 was exclusively expressed in the apical pole of the cells at the edges of the clefts of luminal spaces. In contrast, positive expression of EZRIN was found in the membrane of tumor cells within the solid tumor where NHERF1 was not expressed.

However, the morphological changes in serotonergic neurons induced by hypoxia have not yet been examined and respiratory controls of serotonergic neurons have not been clarified. We herein investigated the distribution of immunoreactivity for serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in the medulla oblongata of control rats and rats exposed to 1\u20136\u00a0h of hypoxia (10% O2). We also examined the medulla oblongata by multiple immunofluorescence labeling for 5-HT, neurokinin 1 receptors (NK1R), a marker for some respiratory neurons in the pre-B\u00f6tzinger complex (PBC), and dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), a marker for catecholaminergic neurons. The number of 5-HT-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies in the raphe nuclei was higher in rats exposed to hypoxia than in control rats. The number of 5-HT-immunoreactive nerve fibers significantly increased in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of rats exposed to 1\u20136\u00a0h of hypoxia, caudal ventrolateral medulla of rats exposed to 2\u20136\u00a0h of hypoxia, and lateral part of the nucleus of the solitary tract and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve of rats exposed to 1\u20132\u00a0h of hypoxia. Multiple immunofluorescence labeling showed that 5-HT-immunoreactive nerve fibers were close to NK1R-immunoreactive neurons in ventrolateral medulla and to DBH-immunoreactive neurons in the medulla.

In carrageenan-injected cats maximum in the mean number of intensely stained NADPH-diaphorase reactive (NADPH-dr) neurons was found in lamina VII (+100%) and VIII (+33%) of the contralateral ventral horn of the L6/L7 segments as compared with control animals. The maximumal level of Fos-immunoreactivity was registered in the same laminae with ipsilateral predominance (39.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6 and 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 cells), in comparison with the contralateral side (13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 and 5.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 cells, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We also visualized low-intensely stained and double labelled (Fos immunoreactive\u00a0+\u00a0low-intensely stained NADPH-dr) multipolar and fusiform Renshaw-like cells (RLCs) within the ventral horn on both sides of the L6/L7 segments in carrageenan-injected cats. We visualized the double labelled (Fos-ir\u00a0+\u00a0NADPH-dr) multipolar and fusiform Renshaw-like cells (RLCs) within the ventral horn on both sides of the L6/L7 segments in carrageenan-injected cats. A significant difference in the mean number of RLCs was recorded between the ipsi- and contralateral sides in the lamina VII (13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 vs. 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 cells, respectively). We suppose that activation of inhibitory RLCs in ipsilateral lamina VII could be directed on attenuation of activation of motoneurons during muscle pain development. Our study showed that a significant contralateral increase in the number of NADPH-dr cells is accompanied by an ipsilateral increase in c-Fos expression in lamina VII. These data may suggest that NADPH-dr neurons of the contralateral ventral horn through commissural connections also involved in the maintenance of the neuronal activity associated with acute muscle inflammation. It is also hypothesized, that during acute myositis, plastic changes in the ventral horn activate the processes of disinhibition due to an increase in the number of NADPH-d-reactive neurons in the spinal gray matter.",

     "abstract": "The development of submucosal glands of rat nasopharynx was studied with respect to their morphological maturation and glycoprotein alterations during the postnatal period. This study examined the histological morphology with hematoxylin\u2013eosin and the binding pattern of lectins, soybean agglutinin (SBA), Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Vicia villosa agglutinin (VVA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and succinylated WGA (sucWGA) on frozen sections from newborn into adulthood. At birth, nasopharyngeal glands consisted of rudimentary secretory units which by postnatal day 3 (PN3) showed the characteristic features of salivary glands comprised of mixed mucous and serous cells. With maturation, serous cells increased in number and were arranged in clusters. Lectin reactivity at birth was detected at the acinar cell basal membranes for DBA, SBA, VVA, UEA-1 and PNA. At PN3, lectins labeled the apical cytoplasm and basolateral membranes of mucous cells and progressively with maturation, extended from the apical to basal portions of the cytoplasm with variable reactivity of VVA, PNA and sucWGA. Serous cells were labeled by UEA-1 starting from PN10 and also by PNA in adults. Ducts showed variable lectin reaction on the luminal membrane with strong reactivity of DBA and UEA-1 at PN21. Taken together, lectin histochemistry indicated the transitional occurrence of glycoproteins depending on the stage of maturation of the glands. Moreover, these results emphasize the difference in the morphology and lectin histochemistry between the nasopharyngeal and palatine glands.",

     "abstract": "The hormone leptin is produced by mature adipocytes and plays an important role in regulating food intake and energy metabolism through its interaction with the leptin receptor. In addition to roles in obesity and obesity-related diseases, leptin has been reported to affect the components and secretion of bile in leptin-deficient mice. Furthermore, gallbladder diseases such as cholelithiasis are known to be associated with serum leptin concentrations in humans. We hypothesized that the canine gallbladder is a source of leptin and that the leptin receptor may be localized in the gallbladder, where it plays a role in regulating the function of this organ. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence and expression patterns of leptin and its receptors in normal canine gallbladders using reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Clinically normal gallbladder tissue samples were obtained from four healthy beagle dogs with similar body condition scores. RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplified PCR products revealed the presence of leptin mRNA and its receptors in the gallbladder. Immunohistochemical investigations demonstrated the expression of leptin and its receptors in the luminal single columnar and tubuloalveolar glandular epithelial cells. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated the presence of leptin and its receptors in the gallbladders of dogs. Leptin and its receptor were both localized throughout the cytoplasm of luminal and glandular epithelial cells. These results suggested that the gallbladder is not only a source of leptin, but also a target of leptin though autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. The results of this study could increase the understanding of both the normal physiological functions of the gallbladder and the pathophysiological mechanisms of gallbladder diseases characterized by leptin system dysfunction.",

We investigated the temporal expression of several IEGs, including c-fos, early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1), and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc), in trimethyltin (TMT)-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration. Mice (7 weeks old, C57BL/6) administered TMT (2.6\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally) presented severe neurodegenerative lesions in the dentate gyrus (DG) and showed behavioral seizure activity on days 1\u20134 post-treatment, after which the lesions and behavior recovered spontaneously over time. c-fos, Egr-1, and Arc mRNA and protein levels significantly increased in the mouse hippocampus after TMT treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that nuclear c-fos expression increased mainly in the DG, whereas nuclear Egr-1 expression was increased extensively in cornu ammonis (CA) 1, CA3, and the DG after TMT treatment. Increased Arc levels were detected in the cellular somata/dendrites of the hippocampal subregions after TMT treatment. Therefore, we suggest that increased IEGs are associated with TMT-induced pathological events in mouse hippocampus.",

     "abstract": "Maintaining stemness and permitting differentiation mediated by combinations of transcription factors (TFs) are key aspects of mammalian spermatogenesis. It has been established that yin yang 1 (YY1), a target factor of mammalian polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and a regulator of stemness, is involved in the stable maintenance of prophase stage spermatocytes. Recently, we have demonstrated that the TF CP2c partners with YY1 in some cells to antagonistically regulate the other protein\u2019s function. To date, the functional roles of YY1 and CP2c in spermatogonial stem cells and their derived germ cells remain unclear. Here, we investigated the expression of YY1 and CP2c in mouse gonocytes and germ cells using tissue immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses. At E14.5, both YY1 and CP2c were stained in gonocytes and Sertoli cells in testicular cords, showing different proportion and density of immunoreactivity. However, in adult testes, YY1 was localized in the nuclei of spermatogonial stem cells and spermatocytes, but not in spermatozoa. It was also detected in spermatogonia and spermatids in a stage\u2013specific manner during spermatogenic cycle. CP2c could be detected mostly in the cytoplasm of spermatocytes but not at all in spermatogonial stem cells, indicating mutually exclusive expression of CP2c and YY1. Interestingly, however, CP2c was stained in the cytoplasm and nucleus of spermatogonia at elongation and release stages, and co-localized with YY1 in the nucleus at grouping, maturation, and releasing stages. Neither YY1 nor CP2c was expressed in spermatozoa. Our data indicate that YY1 strongly localizes in the spermatogonial stem cells and co-localizes heterogeneously with CP2c to permit spermatogenesis, and also suggest that YY1 is essential for stemness of spermatogonial stem cells (SCs) whereas CP2c is critical for the commitment of spermatogonia and during the progression of spermatogonia to spermatids. This evaluation expands our understanding of the molecular mechanism of spermatogonia formation as well as spermatogenesis in general.",

In this study we immunohistochemically analyzed different pathways of cell death in 11 human conceptuses 5th-10th-weeks old, 10 low and high grade colorectal carcinomas (CRC), and 10 normal colon samples by using markers for apoptosis (caspase-3, AIF, TUNEL), proliferation (Ki-67) and stemness (Oct-4).Between the 5th and 10th week of development, caspase-3 and AIF showed moderate-to-strong expression in the developing gut wall. During development, number of caspase-3-reactive cells decreased, while AIF increased. While healthy colorectal control and low grade CRC showed moderate expression of caspase-3 and AIF, in high grade CRC their expression was strong. Tumor tissues displayed significantly higher number of positive cells than controls. Occasionally, co-expressing of both markers characterized dying cells. In developing colon, Oct-4 and Ki-67 showed moderate-to-strong expression, while some cells co-expressed both markers. Their number decreased in the epithelium and increased in the connective tissue in later development. Healthy colorectal control displayed moderate Ki-67 and mild Oct-4 reactivity. While in low-grade CRC expression Oct-4 and Ki-67 was moderate, in high-grade CRC their expression was strong. Although Oct-4 and TUNEL occasionally co-expressed in all samples, both grades of CRC contained cells that were Oct-4 positive only.Our study revealed two different parallel pathways of cell death, with characteristic increase of AIF-mediated apoptosis when compared to caspase-3, and presence of stemness cells both during colon development and carcinogenesis. These finding might be considered as important diagnostic, survival and CRC therapy predictors.",

CTLA-2\u03b1 exhibits selective inhibitory activities against papain and cathepsin L. We previously demonstrated the distribution pattern of the CTLA-2\u03b1 protein in mouse brain by immunohistochemistry, describing that it is preferentially localized within nerve fibre bundles than neuronal cell bodies. In the present study we report colocalization of cathepsin L and CTLA-2\u03b1 by double labeling immunofluorescence analysis in the mouse brain. In the telencephalon, immunoreactivity was identified in cerebral cortex and subcortical structures, hippocampus and amygdala. Within the diencephalon intense colocalization was detected in stria medullaris of thalamus, mammillothalamic tract, medial habenular nucleus and choroid plexus. Colocalization signals in the mesencephalon were strong in the hypothalamus within supramammillary nucleus and lateroanterior hypothalamic nucleus while in the cerebellum was in the deep white matter, granule cell layer and Purkinje neurons but moderately in stellate, and basket cells of cerebellar cortex. The distribution pattern indicates that the fine equilibrium between synthesis and secretion of cathespin L and CTLA-2\u03b1 is part of the brain processes to maintain normal growth and development. The functional implication of cathespin L coexistence with CTLA-2\u03b1 in relation to learning, memory and disease mechanisms is discussed.",

Skeletal organ of interest was the fifth lumbar vertebra, which is not exposed to biomechanical loading in rats. Further aims were to determine TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 serum concentrations, and the intensity of the TNF-\u03b1 immunohistochemical staining in the bone marrow. Ten female Sprague Dawley rats, nine weeks old, were randomly divided in two groups and fed either standard laboratory chow or food rich in saturated fatty acids during five weeks, and then mated with genetically similar male subjects. After birth and lactation male offsprings from both groups were divided in four subgroups depending on the diet they were fed until twenty-two weeks of age. The highest cholesterol and triglyceride concentration were found in both groups of offsprings fed with high-fat diet. The lowest trabecular bone volume, lowest trabecular number and highest trabecular separation were found in offsprings fed with high-fat diet of mothers on standard laboratory chow. The same group of offsprings was also characterized by the highest intensity of TNF-\u03b1 immunostaining in the bone marrow and the highest TNF-\u03b1 serum concentration, which suggest that this proinflammatory cytokine has interfered with bone metabolism, possibly by stimulation of bone resorption, which led to inadequate trabecular bone development and bone modeling of the fifth lumbar vertebra.",

Acid phosphatase was detected in the lining epithelium throughout the digestive tract, whereas alkaline phosphatase was only observed in the intestine. In the esophagus, an acid phosphatase reaction occurred in the apical cytoplasm of the epithelial cells and was related to epithelial protection and freeing of superficial cells for sloughing. Similar results were also observed in epithelial cells of gastric epithelium. In the gastric glands, acid phosphatase occurred in lysosomes of the oxynticopeptic cells acting in the macromolecule degradation for use as an energy source, whereas in the vesiculotubular system, its presence could be related to secretion processes. Furthermore, acid phosphatase in the intestine occurred in microvilli and lysosomes of the enterocytes and was correlated to absorption and intracellular digestion. However, no difference was reported among the regions of the intestine. However, alkaline phosphatase reaction revealed a large number of reaction dots in the anterior intestine, with the number decreasing toward the posterior intestine. This enzyme has been related to several functions, highlighting its role in the nutrient absorption primarily in the anterior intestine but also being essential in pH regulation because this is a carnivorous species with many gastric glands with secretions that could damage the intestine.",

Results revealed a remarkable spatiotemporal correlation between MT1-MMP expression and intestinal villi morphogenesis in both vertebrates. However, the villi morphogenesis process was found to be different in chickens to that of rats.

     "abstract": "We previously reported that Vitex agnus-castus L. essential oil (VACEO), when administered to middle-aged males, exerts a bone-protective effect, induces silencing of locomotor activities and decreases pituitary prolactin immunopositivity. To further assess the putative endocrine effects of VACEO, we examined the pituitary-thyroid and -adrenocortical axes in our model. Sixteen-month-old Wistar rats were subcutaneously administered 60\u00a0mg/kg of VACEO dissolved in sterile olive oil, while the control group received the same amount of vehicle alone for three weeks. Pituitaries, thyroids and adrenals were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative histological approaches. Concentration of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), total thyroxine and triiodothyronine (TH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), corticosterone in serum and in adrenal tissue were measured. In VACEO-treated rats, the relative volume density of pituitary thyrotrophs increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while intensity of cytoplasmic TSH\u03b2 immunostaining decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), consistent with elevated TSH in serum (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The thyroid tissue was characterized by a micro-follicular structure, increased relative volume of follicular epithelium (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), decreased volume of luminal colloid (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and increased basolateral expression of sodium-iodide symporter-immunopositivity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Serum TH also increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The relative volume density of pituitary corticotrophs decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), compatible with decline in circulating ACTH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Neither tissue nor serum corticosterone levels were affected by VACEO treatment. In conclusion, the observed changes in TSH and ACTH strongly indicate central endocrine effects of prolonged VACEO treatment. In this respect, production of ACTH decreased without impact on corticosterone production. Increase in serum concentration of both TH and TSH are not compatible with a negative feedback loop and suggest a major change in set-point regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis.",

It has been reported that amphibians undergo anatomical and histological remodeling during metamorphosis and this transformation is crucial for adaptation to terrestrial conditions.

Ewes were randomly assigned to one of three nutritional groups: control (C; 100% NRC requirements, n\u00a0=\u00a09), overfed (O; 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0C, n\u00a0=\u00a012), or underfed (U; 0.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0C, n\u00a0=\u00a010). Superovulation was induced by follicle stimulating hormone injections. At the early and mid-luteal phases of the estrous cycle, CL were dissected from ovaries, and luteal cells isolated enzymatically. Luteal cells were incubated overnight in medium containing serum in chamber slides. Media were then changed to serum-free and after 24\u00a0h incubation, media were collected for P4 analysis, and cells were fixed in formalin and stained with BODIPY followed by DAPI staining. Z-stacks of optical sections of large and small luteal cells (LLC and SLC, respectively) were obtained using a laser-scanning microscope. Rendered 3D images of individual LLC and SLC were analyzed for cell volume, and total and individual LD volume, number and percentage of cellular volume occupied by LD by using Imaris software. Concentrations of P4 in serum and media were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at the mid than early-luteal phase, and were not affected by nutritional plane. LD total volume and number were greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in LLC than SLC; however, mean volume of individual LD was greater (P\u00a0<\u00a00.02) in SLC than LLC.

In this study, we hypothesized that the possible favorable outcome of HCQ may be partly achieved by its molecular effect on the endothelial stress markers as well as on the imparied balance of the adipokines that usually accompanies IR.A total of 54 rats were divided equally into; control, high fat diet (HFD) and HFD\u00a0+\u00a0HCQ groups (received standard chow, HFD and HFD\u00a0+\u00a0HCQ respectively). After 12 weeks, samples from pancreas as well as visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were histologically studied for the consequent changes.In the HFD group, there were mild degenerative changes and expansion of the IOL accompanied with a significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) \u03b2-cell area%, mass, proliferation and neogenesis as well as a significantly decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) \u03b1-cell area% compared with the other groups. On combining HCQ with HFD, reversal of these changes along with correction of the impaired adipokines levels (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, visfatin and lipocalin-2) and significant decrease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of the vascular endothelial stress markers (sE-selectin, sICAM and sVICAM) were manifested compared with the HFD group.Therefore, HCQ favorable effects in IR may be attributed to relieving of the endothelial stress as well as normalization of the skewed balance of adipokines.",

The current study analyzed the effects of pre-and neonatal undernutrition on the circumvallate papillae of rats at 12, 20, and 30\u00a0days of age. Early undernourishment occurred from gestational days G6 to G19 when dams received low percentages of food followed by a balanced diet from G20-21. After birth pups were underfed by rotating two lactating dams every 12\u00a0h; in one of them, the nipples were tied. The pups were weaned at 25\u00a0days of age, and then given an ad libitum diet. Under anesthesia the tongues were removed and stained with the hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) procedure. The results indicated that young underfed rats had significantly body weight reductions. The tongue measurements in underfed rats showed reduced total area and length of the anterior portion, but there were negligible effects on the posterior portion. The circumvallate papillae in underfed rats was significantly reduced in major length, major diameter, and total and upper areas, but unaffected in the lateral wall trench region. The taste bud areas and minor diameter were unaffected by undernutrition, but there were significant reductions in the total number of visible taste buds and the major diameter, delayed opening of taste bud pores, and an increased number of closed pores were also observed.

Recent evidence has suggested a role of honey in reducing colitis-induced inflammatory and oxidative stress markers. In this study, we examined whether the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties of honey have a beneficial effect on the enteric innervation and cellular proliferation of UC in rat. The colitis was induced in rats by dextran sodium sulphate (DSS). The effect of natural honey on induced colitis was assessed by the following parameters in colonic samples: tissue injury, inflammatory infiltration, interleukin-1\u03b2 and -6, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione. In addition, the expression of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, inducible NO synthase, caspase-3, CD34, Ki67, S100, c-kit, and neuron-specific enolase were examined by immunohistochemistry. Compared to the DSS-induced colitis group, the honey-treated group had significantly improved macroscopic and microscopic scores and exhibited the down-regulation of oxidative, inflammatory, and apoptotic markers. In addition, up-regulation of intrinsic muscular innervation and epithelial cellular proliferation markers was detected. These results provide new insight into the beneficial role of natural honey in the treatment of DSS-induced colitis via the inhibition of colonic motor dysfunction and the inflammatory-oxidative-apoptotic cascade. In addition, the role of honey in epithelial regeneration was clarified.",

This study aimed to investigate the mice spleen histology and immunotoxicity using skin acid secretion (SAS) of the sea slug Berthellina citrina after oral administration. The spleen showed atrophy in the white pulp, decrease in the splenocytes density, megakaryocytes cytoplasmic degeneration as well as inflammatory cells infiltrations. The white and red pulp splenocytes number decreased time-dependently in the treated spleens. Additionally, the size of the megakaryocytes increased as compared with the control. The administration with SAS increased the number of the IgA+ cells aggregation in the splenic red pulp. Furthermore, after 7\u00a0days of the administration, large number of dispersed IgA+ cells were distributed in splenic parenchyma. The IgA+ cells numbers increased time-dependently as compared with those in the control. The aggregation sizes and number of the F4/80+ cell in the splenic red pulp were increased. Furthermore the F4/80+ cells numbers increased time-dependently as compared with those in the control. The UEAI+ cells were found as free cells but not in aggregations in the control splenic red pulp. Contradictory to the number of IgA+ cells and F4/80+ cells the number of the UEAI+ cells decreased time-dependently after administration with SAS. Hematologically, abnormal numbers of WBCs different cells were observed after administration with SAS. This study provides new insight about the toxicity of a marine extract may be used in natural products industry or medical applications.",

However, the effect of indirubin on ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been addressed. Here, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of indirubin on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice and explored its underlying mechanisms. UC model was induced in BALB/c mice by administrating with 3% DSS in drinking water for 7\u00a0days. Subsequently, indirubin treatment (10\u00a0mg/kg) for 7\u00a0days obviously inhibited the loss of body weight, reversed the elevation of disease activity index (DAI), alleviated crypt distortion and mucosal injury, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in the colon mucosa, thereby ameliorating DSS-induced UC. Mechanically, the levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-2 as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in colon tissues were decreased significantly, while the levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were increased remarkably by indirubin treatment. Moreover, indirubin administration effectively suppressed CD4+ T cell infiltration in the colon of DSS-induced UC mice and promoted the generation of Foxp3-expressing regulatory T cells. Additionally, further studies showed that indirubin obviously inhibited DSS-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling. These results reveal that the significant anti-UC effect of indirubin may be attributable to its inhibition of inflammatory responses and promotion of Foxp3+ T cells. Our studies provide the first evidence for the anti-UC effect of indirubin as well as the related molecular mechanisms and suggest a promising candidate drug for UC therapy.",

Although the airway is involved in the physiopathology of asthma, there is also evidence of the importance of vascular and lung parenchyma inflammation and remodeling, which can contribute to the functional pulmonary alterations observed in asthmatic patients. Our aim was to evaluate treatment using sakuranetin, a flavone isolated from the twigs of Baccharis retusa (Asteraceae), on vascular and lung parenchyma alterations in an experimental murine model of asthma.Male BALB/c mice were subjected to a sensitization protocol with ovalbumin for 30\u00a0days and were treated with or without sakuranetin (20\u00a0mg/kg/mice) or dexamethasone (5\u00a0mg/kg/mice); then, the lungs were collected for histopathological analysis. We evaluated extracellular matrix remodeling (collagen and elastic fibers), inflammation (eosinophils and NF-kB) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane) in the pulmonary vessels and lung parenchyma. The thickness of the vascular wall was quantified, as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.We demonstrated that sakuranetin reduced the number of eosinophils and elastic fibers in both the pulmonary vessels and the lung parenchyma, probably due to a reduction of oxidative stress and of the transcription factor NF-kB and VEGF levels in the lung. In addition, it reduced the thickness of the pulmonary vascular wall. The treatment had no effect on the collagen fibers. In most of the parameters, the effect of sakuranetin was similar to the dexamethasone effect.Sakuranetin had anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, preventing vascular and distal parenchyma changes in this experimental model of asthma.",

Quantitative and morphometric analysis have been performed.Diabetic rats presented a decrease in the number of neurons when compared to normoglycemic animals. However, diabetes was not associated with a change in glial density. l-Glutathione prevented the neuronal death in diabetic rats. l-Glutathione increased a glial proliferation in diabetic rats. The neuronal area in diabetic rats increased in relation to the normoglycemics. The diabetic rats supplemented with l-glutamine and l-glutathione showed a smaller neuronal area in comparison to diabetic group. The glial cell area was a decreased in the diabetics. The diabetic rats supplemented with l-glutamine and l-glutathione did not have significant difference in the glial cell body area when compared to diabetic rats.It is concluded that the usage of l-glutamine and l-glutathione as supplements presents both desired and side effects that are different for the same substance in considering normoglycemic or diabetic animals.",

In postnatal mice, FAST2 was expressed in oocytes and thecal cells from postnatal day (PD) 1 to PD 21. In gonadotropin-induced immature mice, FAST2 was expressed in oocytes, thecal cells and newly formed corpora lutea (CLs), but was expressed at a lower level in degenerated CLs. Similar results were observed upon western blot analyses. In meloxicam-treated immature mice, ovulation was inhibited and FAST2 was expressed in thecal cells, luteinized granulosa cells and entrapped oocytes. Immunofluorescence results showed that FAST2 was expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus but not the nucleolus from the zygote to 8-cell embryo stage, after which it was localized to the cytoplasm of the morulae and inner cell mass of the blastocysts. Taken together, these observations suggest that FAST2 is expressed in a cell-specific manner during ovarian follicle development, ovulation, luteinization and early embryonic development, and that FAST2 might play important roles in these physiological processes.",

Despite this important function, their composition, anatomy and function vary widely between species. Thus, the RAGs of three species of phyllostomid bats were morphologically and ultrastructurally characterized and compared in this study. The RAGs of the three analyzed species are composed of a prostate and a pair of bulbourethral glands (BG). In all species, the prostate is composed of three well-defined regions (ventral, dorsolateral and dorsal regions). The ventral region showed an atypical epithelium (undefined) with no obvious cellular limits and a holocrine PAS-positive secretion. The dorsolateral region of Carollia perspicillata and Phyllostomus discolor showed a pseudostratified cubic morphology, and that from Glossophaga soricina had a columnar morphology endowed with cytoplasmic projections and stereocilia. The dorsal region of the three analyzed species is composed of a pseudostratified columnar epithelium endowed with stereocilia; however, G. soricina also presented cytoplasmic projections in the apical portions of the secretory cells similar to those in the dorsolateral region. The BG of the three analyzed species are composed of a pseudostratified columnar epithelium including basal and PAS-positive secretory cells. In conclusion, this study morphologically and ultrastructurally characterized the RAGs of three species of phyllostomid bats, demonstrating the presence of a novel third prostatic region in species of this family. The results also showed the absence of seminal vesicles and ampullary glands, and better characterized the holocrine pattern of the prostatic ventral region, which is unique to bats.",

Indeed, protein expression changes of this system could contribute to craniofacial defects commonly associated with a variety of congenital syndromes. Similarly to other craniofacial bones, mandible arises from neural crest cells of the neuroectodermal germ layer, and undergoes membranous ossification. Here, we report a case of left mandibular hypoplasia in a 42-year-old man treated with autologous bone graft from mandibular symphysis. After 3 months from surgical reconstruction, the protein expression of VEGF and receptors (VEGFR-1, -2 and -3) in regenerated bone tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. At variance with the mandibular symphysis bone harvested for graft surgery, we observed de novo expression of VEGF and VEGFRs in osteoblasts and osteocytes from post-graft regenerating mandible bone tissue. In particular, while VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-3 immunopositivity was widespread in osteoblasts, that of VEGFR-2 was scattered. Among the three receptors, VEGFR-3 was the more intensively expressed both in osteoblasts and osteocytes. These findings suggest that VEGFR-2 might be produced during the early period of regeneration, while VEGFR-1 might participate in bone cell maintenance during the middle or late consolidation period. VEGFR-3 might, instead, represent a specific signal for ectomesenchymal lineage differentiation during bone regeneration. Modulation of VEGF/VEGFR signaling could contribute to graft integration and new bone formation during mandibular regeneration.",

Furan contamination is found to be relatively high in processed baby foods, cereal products, fruits juices, and canned vegetables. Several studies have demonstrated that furan is a potent hepatotoxin and hepatocarcinogen in rodents. However, few studies have investigated the toxic effects of furan in the testis. In addition, the exact mechanism(s) by which furan exerts toxicity in the testis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the potential of furan exposure from weaning through adulthood to induce oxidative stress in adult rat testis, as well as the potential of garlic oil (GO) to ameliorate the induced toxicity. Our results reveal that furan administration significantly reduced serum testosterone levels and increased the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA); furthermore, furan administration decreased significantly the enzymatic activity of testicular antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) and induced histopathological alterations in the testis. GO co-administration ameliorated the reduction in testosterone levels and dramatically attenuated the furan-induced oxidative and histopathological changes. In addition, Go significantly down-regulated the increased caspase-3 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) expression in the furan-treated testis. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the furan-induced oxidative changes in the adult rat testis and the protective role of GO to ameliorate these changes through its antioxidant effects and its ability to inhibit CYP2E1 production.",

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of ES on inflammatory-induced decrement of oxidative metabolism in mice tibialis anterior muscles. ICR mice were randomly divided into three groups: control, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection for 4\u00a0days, and LPS injection plus ES (LPS\u00a0+\u00a0ES). Cachexia was induced in the animals in the LPS groups via LPS injection (10\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day, i.p.) during the intervention period. The animals in the LPS\u00a0+\u00a0ES group were stimulated electrically (carrier frequency, 2500\u00a0Hz; modulation frequency, 100\u00a0Hz; duration, 240\u00a0s/day; type of contraction, isometric) during the intervention period. LPS injection resulted in decreased body and muscle wet weight and increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 in plasma and skeletal muscle. In addition, LPS injection decreased indicators of mitochondrial function such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and citrate synthase (CS) activity as well as the expression of PGC-1\u0251, and increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. On the other hand, the intervention of ES attenuated the changes in muscle wet weight, SDH activity, CS activity, p38 MAPK, and PGC-1\u0251.

This study was done using avidin-biotin immunohistochemistry method. In addition, blood levels of calcium (Ca), vitamin D3 (Vit D), estrogen (E2) and progesterone (P4) were measured. The immunohistochemical findings restricted the expressions of CaBP-9k and VDR to the luminal and glandular epithelia of the endometrium implicating the importance of CaBP-9K and VDR in the function of endometrial epithelium, especially the glandular one, in order to prepare a receptive uterus. On the other hand, the myometrium did not express CaBP-9k or VDR that denies the potential role of CaBP-9k and VDR in the uterine contractility during the estrous cycle of Egyptian buffalo. All of Ca, Vit D, and P4 blood levels significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased during luteal phase however, blood level of E2 significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased during follicular phase. The expressions of CaBP-9k and VDR in the uterus of Egyptian buffalo were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher during luteal (P4 dominant) phase than during the follicular (E2 dominant) phase indicating that P4 up-regulates the expressions of CaBP-9k and VDR. In view of these observations, this study represents the first characterization of CaBP-9K and VDR expression in the uterus of Egyptian buffalo and suggests the pivotal role of CaBP-9k and VDR in the uterine receptivity.

DM1 model was induced with intraperitoneally injected streptozotocin (STZ) (55\u00a0mg/kg). Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed 6 and 12 months after the DM1 induction. The immunohistochemical analyses of CYP24 and transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 (TGF-\u03b21) expression in the liver were performed. We found that ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in a significantly increased expression of CYP24 in hepatocytes, as well as in non-hepatocyte liver cells (Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells). Ageing and long-term DM1 resulted in an increased expression of TGF-\u03b21 as well. Expression of CYP24 coexisted with the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in all types of hepatic cells. We concluded that liver has the capacity for an active vitamin D catabolism in different populations of liver cells, especially in sinusoidal endothelial cells, through an expression of CYP24. That capacity is substantially increased during ageing and long-term diabetes mellitus. Increased liver calcitriol catabolism could be one of the mechanisms of the bone metabolism impairment related to ageing and diabetes.",

TPPI activity was biochemically assayed and localized by enzyme histochemistry. Although less vulnerable to oxidative stress, the studied brain areas showed different histopathological changes, such as neuronal loss and tissue vacuolization, dilatation of the smallest capillaries and impairment of neuronal processes. TPPI activity was strictly regulated following the hypoxic stress. It was found to increase 12\u201324\u00a0h post-treatment, then decreased followed by a slow process of recovery.

The younger animals had significantly more CD90+/CD44+/CD29+/PDGFR\u03b1\u00a0+\u00a0primary cells, than the aged rats, suggesting an age dependent shift in the relative cell type distribution within the population. Taken together with recent studies of much more pronounced age differences, our data strongly suggest that donor age is a very critical parameter that should be taken into account in future stem cell studies, especially when using primary cells.",

Many studies have focused on reproductive toxicity on glyphosate-based herbicide, but few evidence exists to imply the male reproductive toxicity of glyphosate alone in vivo. In this study SD rats were Lavaged with glyphosate at doses of 5, 50, 500\u00a0mg/kg to detect the toxicity of glyphosate on rat testis. Glyphosate significantly decreased the average daily feed intake at dose of 50\u00a0mg/kg, and the weight of seminal vesicle gland, coagulating gland as well as the total sperm count at dose of 500\u00a0mg/kg. Immunohistochemistry of androgen receptor (AR) has no difference among all groups. As to testosterone, estradiol, progesterone and oxidative stress parameters, the level of them has no differences amidst all doses. Taken together, we conclude that glyphosate alone has low toxicity on male rats reproductive system.",

The data were analyzed by Mann\u2013Whitney test, Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Dunn\u2019s post hoc test. Initially, developing human limbs consisted of mesenchymal core and surface ectoderm with apical ectodermal ridge (AER). During progression of development, strong proliferation activity gradually decreased in the mesenchyme (from 78% to 68%) and in the epithelium (from 62% to 42%), while in the differentiating finger cartilages proliferation was constantly low (26\u20137%). Apoptotic caspase-3 and AIF\u2014positive cells characterized mesenchyme and AER at earliest stages, while during digit separation they appeared in interdigital mesenchyme as well. Strong Bcl-2 expression was observed in AER, subridge mesenchyme and phalanges, while BAX expression charaterized limb areas undergoing apoptosis. Ultrastructurally, proliferating cells showed mitotic figures, while apoptotic cells were characterized by nuclear fragmentation. Macrophages were observed around the apoptotic cells. We suggest that intense proliferation enables growth and elongation of human limb primordia, and differential growth of digits. Both caspase-3 and AIF\u2013dependant pathways of cell death control the extent of AER and numer of cells in the subridge mesenchyme at earliest developmental stages, as well as process of digit separation at later stages of limb development. Spatio-temporal co-expresson of Bcl-2 and BAX indicates their role in suppression of apoptosis and selective stimulation of growth during human limb morphogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The proliferative activity of tumour cells represents an important prognostic marker in the diagnosis of cancer. One of the methods for assessing the proliferative activity of cells is the immunohistochemical detection of cell cycle-specific antigens. For example, Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins are standard markers of proliferation that are commonly used to assess the growth fraction of a cell population. The function of Ki67, the widely used marker of proliferation, still remains unclear. In contrast, PCNA and MCM proteins have been identified as important participants of DNA replication. All three proteins only manifest their expression during the cell division of normal and neoplastic cells. Since the expression of these proliferative markers was confirmed in several malignant tumours, their prognostic and predictive values have been evaluated to determine their significance in the diagnosis of cancer. This review offers insight into the discovery of the abovementioned proteins, as well as their current molecular and biological importance. In addition, the functions and properties of all three proteins and their use as markers of proliferation in the diagnosis of breast cancer are described. This work also reveals new findings about the role of Ki67 during the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. Finally, information is provided about the advantages and disadvantages of using all three antigens in the diagnosis of cancer.",

In this study, we investigated the expression of miR-193b in 50 GC cases and found that miR-193b was significantly reduced in GC tissues compared with the adjacent normal gastric tissues. Moreover, lower-level of miR-193b was also associated with a more aggressive GC phenotype. We further demonstrated that miR-193b can inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of HGC-27 and MGC-803 GC cells. Further mechanism study indicated that CCND1 was a direct target of miR-193b in GC. Overexpression of miR-193b inhibited the expression of CCND1, and knock-down of CCND1 inhibited the proliferation of GC cells, suggesting that miR-193b exerted its anti-tumorigenic role in GC cells through targeting CCND1 gene.",

The results indicated that body weight and dry matter intake increased significantly in treated groups. Significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) pH was recorded in all the treated groups after 8\u00a0h of feeding. Similarly, the brightness (L*), redness (a*) and yellowness ((b*) of rumen was significantly higher (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in treated groups. The papillary length, width and surface area of rumen were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) high in alfalfa supplemented groups. Iron (Fe) concentration in rumen tissue decreased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in treated groups.

Here, we have investigated in an animal model of mild HE: the bile duct ligated rat (BDL) at the cirrhotic stage (4 weeks after surgery), the expression of the key marker of mature astrocytes; the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in different brain areas such as: Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), Ventral tegmental area (VTA), hippocampus, dorsal striatum and brain cortex by means of immunohistochemistry.

Thus, biochemical profile changes in oil-treated larvae and its influence on reproduction were assessed. Corn leaves dipped in a 50\u00a0mg/mL concentration were offered to third instar larvae for 24\u00a0h and assessed in sixth instar to estimate protein, lipid, sugar, and glycogen levels. Adult testes and ovarioles were collected for histological and histochemical analysis 24\u00a0h after emergence. Number of eggs and hatching rate were also measured. Oil-treated larvae showed an increase in glycogen and a decrease in protein, lipid, and totals sugar content. Control testes exhibited connective tissue lining and cysts with abundant spermatozoids. However, intense peripheral vacuolation and neutral carbohydrates reduction occurred in oil-treated individuals. Control ovarioles showed normal morphologic characteristics. On the other hand, oil-treatment ovarioles showed follicular cell stratification and removal, reduced nurse cell development, reduced yolk quantity, a thinner conjunctiva sheath, and a reduction in proteins and neutral carbohydrates. Eggs derived from oil-treated pairs were unviable. Therefore, sub-lethal doses of citronella oil alters the biochemical profile of S. frugiperda larvae, causing damage to their reproductive histophysiology and results in diminished reproduction or reproductive failure.",

For the last 24\u00a0h of culture, they were exposed to T (10\u22127\u00a0M), DHT (10\u22127\u00a0M), Vnz (1.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0M), T and Vnz (T\u00a0+\u00a0Vnz), or DHT and Vnz (DHT\u00a0+\u00a0Vnz) at the same concentrations. To better imitate in vivo conditions, whole follicles (4\u20136\u00a0mm in diameter) were incubated (24\u00a0h) in an organ culture system with the same factors. Expression of AR mRNA and protein was determined by real-time PCR and western blot analyses. To demonstrate AR localization in cultured GCs and whole follicles, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry were performed, respectively. To elucidate the possible non-genomic action of Vnz in GCs, protein expression and the activity of ERK1/2 and Akt kinases were determined by western blot and ELISA analyses. The immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry results showed that exposure of GCs and follicles to Vnz resulted in cytoplasmic and perinuclear AR localization. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that AR mRNA and protein expression increased (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) in GC cultures after combined treatment with an androgen and Vnz. In whole follicles, such treatment also increased AR mRNA with a decrease in the respective protein expression (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Moreover, addition of T or DHT with Vnz increased the activity of ERK1/2 and Akt kinases in cultured GCs (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). The results suggest a novel mechanism for Vnz action in porcine ovarian follicles on both AR mRNA and protein levels. Thus, this environmental antiandrogen activates non-genomic signaling pathways, as indicated by the increased activity of both investigated kinases observed within minutes of Vnz addition. Given the widespread presence of Vnz in the environment, elucidation of its non-genomic action should be the subject of studies on female fertility.",

In present study, we found that miR-128 was remarkably decreased during the differentiation of hHFMSCs into SMCs induced by transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21).

Further, we identified that miR-128 targeted the 3\u2032-UTR of SMAD2 transcript for translational inhibition of SMAD2 protein, and knockdown of SMAD2 abrogated the promotional effect of antagomir-128 (miR-128 neutralizer) on SMC differentiation.

     "abstract": "Triatoma infestans, a vector of Chagas\u2019 disease, shows several particular cell biology characteristics, including the presence of conspicuous heterochromatic bodies (chromocenters) where DNA methylation has not been previously detected. Whether histone modifications contribute to the condensed state of these bodies has not yet been studied. Here, we investigated epigenetic modifications of histones H3 and H4 and presence of the non-histone heterochromatin protein (HP1-\u03b1) in the chromocenters and euchromatin of T. infestans cell nuclei, using immunocytochemistry. The effect of different concentrations of the histone deacetylase inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (NaBt) on chromocenter condensation was visually examined; in VPA-treated specimens, this effect was also analyzed by image analysis. Trimethylated H3K9 signals, which were revealed in chromocenter and non-chromocenter areas, were strongest in chromocenters, whereas selected acetylated histone marks and mono- and dimethylated H3K9 and H4K20 signals were detected only in euchromatin. Weak trimethylated H4K20 signals and variable distribution of HP1-\u03b1 were detected in chromocenters of part of the cellular population analyzed. Although specific VPA and NaBt treatment conditions affected the heterochromatin condensation pattern, they did not induce a decrease in survival and molting rates of the T. infestans nymphs. The VPA-induced chromatin remodeling was not accompanied by induction of H3K9 acetylation in chromocenters. Present findings regarding histone modifications and effects following VPA or NaBt treatments did not yet solve the question of which factors are responsible for maintenance of the condensed state of chromocenters in T. infestans. A possibility requiring further investigation remains on histone methylation marks and/or non-histone proteins.",

     "abstract": "Regression of atherosclerosis is a key aspect of preventing further coronary artery disease and understanding which cell type forms smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic fibrous caps will aid in reducing CAD. Atherogenesis is a complex interplay of cells migrating and proliferating into the vascular wall. CD34 positive hemapoetic stem cells are believed to not transform into vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC). The current study hypothesised that there would be no evidence for CD34+/\u03b1 SMC actin+ cells in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. Aims: To identify CD34+/\u03b1 actin positive cells in the fibrous cap and wall of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary artery. Methods: Male New Zealand White rabbits were fed a diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 1% methionine for 4 weeks, then 9 weeks of normal diet to induce regression. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CD34+ haematopoietic progenitor cells and \u03b1 SMC actin. Results: In the fibrous cap, the majority of cells were CD34\u2212/\u03b1 SMC actin+ spindle shaped cells. However very rare populations of CD34+/\u03b1 SMC actin+ and CD34+/\u03b1 SMC actin\u2212 cells were also present but these cells were not spindle shaped. Conclusion: Our study found that CD34+/\u03b1 SMC actin\u2212 spindle shaped cells were absent from the fibrous cap. Moreover, the predominant cell population were the vascular smooth muscle cells (CD34\u2212/\u03b1 SMC actin+) but (CD34+/\u03b1 SMC actin+) cells were also present. This model could be used to understand the role of each SMC population subtype to hasten atherosclerotic regression in the coronary artery.",

     "abstract": "Among the stem cells contained in human amniotic fluid (hAF), the human amniotic fluid derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hAF-MSCs) are derived from fetal membranes and tissues that are produced during fetal development. The aim of this study was to characterize the \u2018stem-ness\u2019 properties of hAF-MSCs and their potency with regard to the chondrogenic differentiations using the scaffold cultivation method. This study revealed that the easily accessed and isolated MSCs were highly cell prolific and there were fewer ethical concerns regarding their usage. The MSCs were studied through the use of the alamar blue technique. In addition, after cell isolation, hAF-MSCs displayed typical MSCs morphologies including MSCs biomarker characteristics and immune privilege properties (CD44, CD73, CD90, CD105 and HLA-ABC) through immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Interestingly, this result indicated a negative expression when using the C-Kit (CD117, tyrosine kinase receptor type III ligand for cytokine stem cell factor). This expression can be found at the cell\u2019s surface of the amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSCs). This study found evidence that hAF-MSCs had the ability to differentiate the cells into the chondrogenic lineage by exhibiting chondrogenic related genes and proteins (SOX9, AGC, COL2A1 and COMP) through RT-qPCR, immunoenzymatic assays and immunofluorescence analysis. Furthermore, MSCs presented sGAGs accumulation, which was confirmed by histological analysis and SEM. Therefore, this study showed that the MSCs characteristics are contained in AF and are of significant value for further research. It appears that MSCs possess the potential for use in treatments that would necessitate the use of regenerative cell therapy.",

     "abstract": "Clusterin has anti-apoptotic, regeneration and migration stimulating effects on tumor cells. This study investigates the relation between clusterin expression and the clinicopathological parameters in endometrial carcinomas. Seventy one cases of previously diagnosed endometrial carcinoma (including 59 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 9 serous adenocarcinoma, 1 clear cell adenocarcinoma, and 2 malignant mixed Mullerian tumor) and 30 tissue samples of non-cancerous endometrium (including 16 proliferative endometrium, 10 secretory endometrium and 4 endometrial polyps) were employed for clusterin detection using tissue microarrays and immunostaining. A total number of 23 (32.4%) cases were positive for clusterin immunostaining. Brown granular cytoplasmic expression of clusterin was detected in 33.9% of endometrioid adenocarcinomas, 22.2% papillary serous endometrial carcinomas. Three (10%) control cases showed granular cytoplasmic expression. Positive clusterin immunostaining was found more frequent in well differentiated and stage I endometrial carcinomas, showing significant statistical association (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.036 and p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.002 respectively). Significant difference in clusterin expression was observed between tumor cases and control group (P-Value\u00a0=\u00a00.019), i.e., endometrial carcinoma cases are more than four times likely to show positive clusterin immunostaining (odds ratio 4.313 with 95% confidence interval 1.184\u201315.701). This study did not find relation between clusterin expression and disease recurrence, survival or any of the other clinicopathological parameters in endometrial tumors. The results of our study confirms the diagnostic values of clusterin in supporting the diagnosis of endometrioid carcinoma. When clusterin is expressed in endometrial tumors, it is associated with lower stage. The correlation of clusterin with tumor stage suggests involvement of this molecule in endometrial tumor progression.",

To examine this, we investigated the effect of chronic liquid nutrition intake (Fresubin) on stomach and duodenum morphology in Wistar rats fed liquid nutrition during different developmental periods. We used four groups of rats: a) control group (CON) fed pelleted chow for 130\u00a0days; b) liquid nutrition group (LN) fed liquid nutrition for 130\u00a0days; c) liquid nutrition juvenile group (LNJ) fed liquid nutrition for 70\u00a0days and then pelleted food for 60\u00a0days; d) liquid nutrition adult group (LNA) fed pelleted chow for 70\u00a0days and then liquid nutrition for 60\u00a0days. We found that LN and LNA rats showed a significant reduction of empty stomach mass compared to CON animals, while stomach and duodenal longitudinal muscle layer thickness did not differ between groups. Villus height was increased only in LNA animals, while villus width was increased in both LN and LNA rats. Crypt depth was reduced in LNJ. However, liquid nutrition intake did not affect villus height/crypt depth ratio, nor number of goblet cells. We found that chronic intake of liquid nutrition affects some morphological parameters of the stomach and duodenum but these changes were not homogenous between experimental groups. Interestingly, transition from liquid nutrition to solid food reversed the alterations of stomach weight as well as villus width induced by intake of liquid nutrition in LNA rats. Our data indicate that morphological and functional changes in the gastrointestinal system induced by qualitative and quantitative changes in food intake are at least partially reversible. Therefore, specific diets may be used potentially as adjuvant treatment for modulating the progression of gastrointestinal diseases by affecting stomach and small intestine morphology.",

     "abstract": "During the life cycle of fish the larval stages are the most interesting and variable. Teleost larvae undergo a daily increase in adaptability and many organs differentiate and become active. These processes are concerted and require an early neuro-immune-endocrine integration. In larvae communication among the nervous, endocrine and immune systems utilizes several known signal molecule families which could be different from those of the adult fish.The immune-neuroendocrine system was studied in several fish species, among which in particular the sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), that is a species of great commercial interest, very important in aquaculture and thus highly studied. Indeed the immune system of this species is the best known among marine teleosts.In this review the data on main signal molecules of stress carried out on larvae of fish are considered and discussed.For sea bass active roles in the early immunological responses of some well-known molecules involved in the stress, such as ACTH, nitric oxide, CRF, HSP-70 and cortisol have been proposed. These molecules and/or their receptors are biologically active mainly in the gut before complete differentiation of gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), probably acting in an autocrine/paracrine way. An intriguing idea emerges from all results of these researches; the molecules involved in stress responses, expressed in the adult cells of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, during the larval life of fish are present in several other localizations, where they perform probably the same role. It may be hypothesized that the functions performed by hypothalamic-pituitary system are particularly important for the survival of the larva and therefore they comprises several other localizations of body. Indeed the larval stages of fish are very crucial phases that include many physiological changes and several possible stress both internal and environmental.",

Amylin-immunoreactive signals were located on the haloes of presumable secretory granules in association with \u03b1MSH-immunoreactive signals in the amylin-positive cells. However, in the pars distalis, the \u03b1MSH-positive cells did not contain amylin-immunoreactive secretory granules. Western blot analysis of axolotl pituitary extracts revealed the labeling of a protein band at approximately 10.5-kDa by the anti-rat amylin serum, which was not labeled by the anti-\u03b1MSH antibody. These findings indicate that amylin secreted from MSH-producing cells in the pars intermedia may modulate MSH secretion in an autocrine fashion and may participate in MSH functions such as fatty homeostasis together with MSH.",

Quantitative real time PCR analysis of sGC showed that the expression of sGC mRNA is higher (\u223c5 fold) in white sheep skin relative to black sheep skin with significant difference (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Using a rabbit polyclonal anti-sGC antibody, an immune reactive band corresponding to sheep sGC protein was detected in the skin samples by Western blotting analysis, and the expression of sGC protein was significantly higher in white sheep skin compared to black sheep skin (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that sGC protein was localized in cytoplasm and intercellular substance of upper hair papilla in hair follicles of white sheep skin, but the protein was localized in cytoplasm and intercellular substance of lower hair bulb and outer root sheath cells in hair follicles of black sheep skin. The immunocytochemical analysis revealed that sGC was expressed in melanocytes in vitro of sheep skin. Over expression of sGC in melanocytes resulted in decreased expression of key melanogenic genes including microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase related protein 1(TYRTP1), and tyrosinase related protein 2(TYRP2) both at mRNA and protein level.

We demonstrated here that cigaret smoke extract induces cell shrinking and detachment as a consequence of F-actin cytoskeleton degradation in H1299 cells not overexpressing tropomyosin-1. Furthermore, the treatment of these cells with cigaret smoke extract resulted in the loss of peripheral localization of ZO-1 and initiated apoptosis. In contrast, structural stabilization of F-actin, by overexpression of tropomyosin-1, preserved cell to cell interactions through the attenuation of cortical actin organization into thin fibers and thus protected these cells against oxidative stress-induced degradation of actin cytoskeleton and cell death. In conclusion, we suggest that structural stabilization of thin cortical F-actin fibers increases link between tight junctions proteins and actin cytoskeleton and thus protects H1299 cells against cigaret smoke extract.",

These changes became more pronounced in the LTZ12 where micropapillae, hyperchromasia, frequent deep invaginations, cysts of OSE as well as papillae and multilayering of TEC were noticed. The tubal level of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and serum MCP-1 progressively increased in LTZ6 and LTZ12 groups compared with the control group. The significant positive correlation observed between these cytokines in the LTZ6 group became stronger in the LTZ12 one.

We analysed the microscopic frame of vessels sections, starting from the primum movens leading to abnormal dilatation. AAA samples were collected and processed through various staining methods (Verhoeff-Van Gieson, Masson Goldner, Sirius Red). Subsequently, the vessel morphology and collagenic web of the tunica media and adventitia were determined and the amount of type I and type III collagen was measured. We also applied immune-histochemistry markers for CD34 and PGP 9.5 in order to identify vascular and nerve structures in the aorta. Immune-positivity quantification was used to calculate the percentage of the stained area. We found increasing deposition of type I collagen and reduced type III collagen in both tunica media and adventitia of AAA. The total amount of vasa vasorum, marked with CD34, and nerva vasorum, marked with PGP 9.5, was also higher in AAA samples. Cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, cigarette smoking) and radiological data (maximum aneurism diameter, intra-luminal thrombus, aortic wall calcification) increased these changes. These results suggest that the tunica adventitia may have a central role in the pathogenesis of AAA as clearly there are major changes characterized by rooted inflammatory infiltration. The presence of immune components could explain these modifications within the framework of the aorta.",

In the immunohistochemical examinations, caspase-3 immunopositive cells displayed higher in the Cis group according to C and Cis\u00a0+\u00a0Se groups. Bcl-2 and NF-\u03baB staining revealed a moderate number in the C group and significantly fewer in the Cis group compared to the Cis\u00a0+\u00a0Se groups. Additionally, MDA levels were also significantly increased in the Cis group in comparison to Control group, but pretreatment with selenium prevented elevation of MDA levels significantly in Cis\u00a0+\u00a0Se group rats. This study indicates that Cis-treatment induced testicular apoptosis and lipid peroxidation, and combined treatment with selenium prevented severity of the toxicity in rats.",

     "abstract": "Amiodarone is a potent agent used to treat tachyarrhythmias, which are especially refractory to other medications, in both adults and children. Although widely used as an antiarrhythmic drug, amiodarone causes many serious adverse effects that limit its use. This study investigated the possible morphological and apoptotic effects of amiodarone on rat testes. Amiodarone was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 20 or 200\u00a0mg/kg/day for 14 days. A histopathological examination of testicular tissue revealed the presence of inflammatory cells in the seminiferous tubule lumen together with swelling and vacuolization in the cytoplasm of some spermatogonia; these effects occured in a dose-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical staining showed evidence of apoptosis, including caspase-3, caspase-9, Bax and increased DNA fragmentation was detected via a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay. In conclusion, the results show that chronic amiodarone treatment causes dose-dependent degenerative and apoptotic effects on rat testes.",

Although Mel has been reported to exhibit strong antioxidant properties in healthy tissues, studies carried out on tumor cultures gave a different picture of its action, often describing Mel as effective to trigger the cell death of tumor cells by enhancing oxidative stress.Based on this premise, here Mel effect was investigated using a tumor cell line representative of the human alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma affecting childhood. For this purpose, Mel was given either dissolved in ethanol (EtOH) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at different concentrations and time exposures. Cell viability assays and ultrastructural observations demonstrated that Mel was able to induce a dose- and time-dependent cell death independently on the dissolution solvent. Microscopy analyses highlighted the presence of various apoptotic and necrotic patterns correlating with the increasing Mel dose and time of exposure. These findings suggest that Mel, triggering apoptosis in ARMS cells, could be considered as a promising drug for future multitargeted therapies.",

Twenty-five paraffin blocks of displaced temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disk specimens from earlier investigations were retrieved from the archives of the University of Catania. Of these 16 had been removed from females and 9 from males; 11 with anterior disk displacement with reduction (ADDwR) and 14 with anterior disk displacement without reduction (ADDwoR). The sections were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and cut. Then they were incubated in 0.3% H2O2/methanol and half of sections from each sample were incubated in diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-ADAM10 antibody. Then biotinylated anti-mouse/anti-rabbit IgG was applied to the sections, followed by avidin\u2013biotin\u2013perioxidase complex. The results were analyzed and the results were that ADAM10 was overexpressed in the posterior band of sections from patients with ADDwR compared to the other bands of both ADDwR and ADDwoR sections. Overexpression correlated with severe histopathological degeneration. We believe these results have the potential to provide insights into the pathogenesis of TMJ disk degeneration and to help design new therapeutic approaches targeting the proteolytic events that lead to tissue degeneration.

The chronobiotic properties of AG are of significant interest due to the disorganization of internal rhythms, which might play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. The present study was designed to assess the effects of the antidepressant-like activity of AG, a new antidepressant drug, on adult neurogenesis and apoptosis using stress-exposed rat brains. Over the period of 1 week, the rats were exposed to light stress twice a day for 1\u00a0h. After a period of 1 week, the rats were given AG treatment at a dose of either 10\u00a0mg/kg or 40\u00a0mg/kg for 15 days. The animals were then scarified, and the obtained tissue sections were stained with immuno-histochemical anti-BrdU, Caspase-3, and Bcl-2 antibodies. Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations were measured biochemically using a BDNF Elisa kit. Biochemical BDNF analysis revealed a high concentration of BDNF in the serum of the stress-exposed group, but the concentrations of BDNF were much lower those of the AG-treated groups. Immuno-histochemical analysis revealed that AG treatment decreased the BrdU-positive and Bcl-2-positive cell densities and increased the Caspase-3-positive cell density in the hippocampus of stress-induced rats as compared to those of the stress group. The results of the study demonstrated that AG treatment ameliorated the hippocampal apoptotic cells and increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These results also strengthen the possible relationship between depression and adult neurogenesis, which must be studied further.",

In a previous study, we demonstrated that rat eccrine sweat glands contained abundant bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-label-retaining cells (LRCs). However, morphological observations showed that eccrine sweat glands usually show little or no signs of homeostatic change. In this study, we account for why the homeostatic change is rare in eccrine sweat glands based on cytokinetic changes in BrdU-LRC turnover, and also determine the BrdU-labeled cell type. Thirty-six newborn SD rats, were injected intraperitoneally with 50\u00a0mg/kg BrdU twice daily at a 2\u00a0h interval for 4 consecutive days. After a chase period of 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 and 32 weeks, rats were euthanized, and the hind footpads were removed and processed for BrdU immunostaining, and BrdU/\u03b1-SMA and BrdU/K14 double-immunostaining. BrdU-LRCs were observed in the ducts, secretory coils and mesenchymal cells at all survival time points. The percentage of BrdU+ cells in rat eccrine sweat glands averaged 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2% after 4 weeks of chase, increased slightly by the 6th week, averaging 4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9%, and peaked at 8 weeks, averaging 5.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0%. Subsequently, the average percentage of BrdU+ cells declined to 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% by the 32nd week. There was no difference in the percentage of BrdU-LRCs among the different survival time points except that a significant difference in the percentage of BrdU-LRCs detected at 24 weeks versus 8 weeks, and 32 weeks versus 8 weeks, was observed.

Although it is well known that activation of a variety of pro-adaptive genes represents a key event in the development of brain hypoxic/ischemic tolerance, the role of epigenetic mechanisms, in particular histone acetylation, in this process is still unexplored. The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in acetylation of histones in vulnerable brain neurons using original well-standardized model of hypobaric hypoxia and preconditioning-induced tolerance of the brain. Using quantitative immunohistochemistry and Western blot, effects of severe injurious hypobaric hypoxia (SH, 180\u00a0mm Hg, 3\u00a0h) and neuroprotective preconditioning mode (three episodes of 360\u00a0mm Hg for 2\u00a0h spaced at 24\u00a0h) on the levels of the acetylated proteins and acetylated H3 Lys24 (H3K24ac) in the neocortex and hippocampus of rats were studied. SH caused global repression of the acetylation processes in the neocortex (layers II\u2013III, V) and hippocampus (CA1, CA3) by 3\u201324\u00a0h, and this effect was prevented by the preconditioning. Moreover, hypoxic preconditioning remarkably increased the acetylation of H3K24 in response to SH in the brain areas examined. The preconditioning hypoxia without subsequent SH also stimulated acetylation processes in the neocortex and hippocampus. The moderately enhanced expression of the acetylated proteins in the preconditioned rats was maintained for 24\u00a0h, whereas acetylation of H3K24 was intense but transient, peaked at 3\u00a0h. The novel data obtained in the present study indicate that large activation of the acetylation processes, in particular acetylation of histones might be essential for the development of brain hypoxic tolerance.",

Moreover, OBAP-immunopositive cells were observed mainly in the upper and lower parts of the gastric gland. Significantly high optical density of immunopositive cells was observed in the upper and lower gastric gland regions. The dot blot assay confirmed that OBAP is secreted by parietal cells and that it is present in the gastric gland lumen. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that OBAP was confined to the mitochondrial inner membrane within parietal cells and that the number of mitochondria in the upper and lower parts of the gastric epithelium was significantly larger than the number in the middle part of the gastric epithelium.

Previous studies have demonstrated a deepening of the tight junction (zonula occludens) and a reduction in the number of desmosomes (macula adherens) in UECs at the time of implantation. However, the adherens junction (zonula adherens), which is primarily responsible for cell\u2013cell adhesion, has been little studied during early pregnancy.This study investigated the adherens junction in rat UECs during the early stages of normal pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulated (OH) pregnancy using transmission electron microscopy. The adherens junction is present in UECs at the time of fertilisation, but is lost at the time of blastocyst implantation during normal pregnancy. Interestingly, at the time of implantation after OH, adherens junctions are retained and may impede blastocyst penetration of the epithelium.The adherens junction anchors the actin-based terminal web, which is known to be disrupted in UECs during early pregnancy. However, artificial disruption of the terminal web, using cytochalasin D, did not cause removal of the adherens junction in UECs.This study revealed that adherens junction disassembly occurs during early pregnancy, but that this process does not occur during OH pregnancy. Such disassembly does not appear to depend on the disruption of the terminal web.",

In this study, we investigated the localization and expression level of interleukin-1 (IL-1\u03b2) and its functional membrane receptor type I (IL1R1) proteins in the oviduct of R. dybowskii during pre-hibernation and the breeding period. There were significant differences in both oviductal weight and pipe diameter, with values markedly higher in pre-hibernation than in the breeding period. Histologically, epithelium cells, glandular cells and tubule lumen were identified in the oviduct during pre-hibernation and the breeding period, while sizes of both cell types are larger in the pre-hibernation than those of the breeding period. IL-1\u03b2 was immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of epithelial and glandular cells in both periods, whereas IL-1R1 was observed in the membrane of epithelial and glandular cells in the breeding period, whereas only in epithelial cells during pre-hibernation. Consistently, the protein levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-1R1 were higher in pre-hibernation as compared to the breeding period.

     "abstract": "In the last decade, different molecular subtypes of breast cancer have been proposed. Although displaying appreciable association with disease prognosis and the prognostic value of cytotoxic and endocrine therapeutic modalities, the subtypes seem to fail at completely explaining disease behavior and response to treatment. Molecules such as those of the cyclocooxigenase (COX) family, currently composed of three entities (COX 1, 2 and 3) have been shown to be associated with breast carcinogenesis, and the analysis of p53 expression in breast tumors may also offer some additional prognostic clues. Our study is aimed at assessing COX2 and p53 expression in these clinico-pathological surrogate subtypes, and to evaluate whether the expression of these molecules can help further explain the variability in prognosis still found within the clinico-pathological subtypes groups of breast cancer.A total of 183 breast cancer samples were obtained from women treated at the Wome\u0144s Hospital of Campinas State University, Campinas, Brazil, between June 2008 and January 2011. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of ER, PR, ki67, COX2, and p53 and the HER2 status of the 183 specimens was assessed using FISH. Two COX2 staining thresholds were used to define COX2 positivity: low threshold (LT): moderate and intense staining were considered positive; high-threshold (HT): only intense staining was considered positive.There was no trend in COX2 overexpression from Luminal A-like to Triple-negative subtypes. By contrast, p53 was expressed in roughly 67% of the Luminal A-like tumors, 50% of the Luminal B-like HER2 positive tumors, 60.9% of the Luminal B-like HER2 negative, approximately 82% of the HER2 positive (non-luminal) and 87% of the Triple-negative tumors (p for trends\u00a0=\u00a00.06). There was a significantly higher proportion of COX2 positive (LT) tumors (66.9%) when p53 was also positive compared to when the tumor was negative for p53 (in which case only18.0% of the tumors were positive for COX2; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Neither marker was found to be associated with patients\u2018 survival. Conclusions: There seems to be a positive association between the expressions of COX2 and p53. Otherwise, neither the expression of COX nor that of p53 was associated with clinico-pathological subtypes, tumor features and prognosis. It seems to be too early to elect the detection of COX2 using IHC as prognostic or predictive tool, but incipient evidence points toward a possible role for the marker.",

Consumption of an antioxidant-fortified (AO) diet from an early age prevents or delays later development of DN in the Zucker rat female with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize this is due to effects on mesangial matrix and renal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) distribution and to sex-specific differences in NOS responses in the diabetic kidney. Total glomerular tuft area (GTA) and PAS-positive tuft area (PTA), endothelial (e), neuronal (n) and inducible (i) NOS were quantified in males and females on AO or regular (REG) diet at 6 and 20 weeks of age. eNOS was observed in glomeruli and tubules. nNOS predominantly localized to tubular epithelium in both cortex and medulla. iNOS was expressed in proximal and distal tubules and collecting ducts. Sex, diabetes duration and AO diet affected the distribution of the three isoforms. GTA and PTA increased with duration of hyperglycemia and showed a negative correlation with renal levels of all NOS isoforms. AO diet in both genders was associated with less PAS-positive staining and less mesangial expansion than the REG diet, an early increase in cortical iNOS in males, and sex-specific changes in cortical eNOS at 20 weeks. These effects of AO diet may contribute to sex-specific preservation of renal function in females.",

These molecules play an important role in digestion, host defense and lubrication. The secretion of pancreatic proteins ensures the availability of the correct mix of proteins when needed. This review describes model systems available for the study of the econobiology of secretory granule content. The secretory pancreatic molecules are stored in large dense-core secretory granules that may undergo either constitutive or evoked secretion, and constitute the granule inventory of the cell. It is proposed that the Golgi complex functions as a distribution center for secretory proteins in pancreatic acinar cells, packing the newly formed secretory molecules into maturing secretory granules, also known functionally as condensing vacuoles. Mathematical modelling brings forward a process underlying granule inventory maintenance at various physiological states of condensation and aggregation by homotypic fusion. These models suggest unique but simple mechanisms accountable for inventory buildup and size, as well as for the distribution of secretory molecules into different secretory pathways in pancreatic acinar cells.",

Previous studies conducted by us in a PTSD animal model found that single prolonged stress (SPS) induced abnormal morphological changes in hippocampal cells. The effects of SPS on cellular organelles of the hippocampal neurons remain unknown; however, these changes have been involved in SPS-induced abnormal hippocampal function. The aim of the present study is to examine ultrastructural changes in cellular organelles, including the lysosomes, mitochondria (Mit), Golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), following SPS exposure using transmission electron microscopy, enzyme histochemistry, and enzyme cytochemistry. First, morphological changes of the hippocampal cells and ultrastructural changes in cellular organelles, including lysosomes, ER, and Mit-induced by SPS were observed. Results from histo- and cytochemistry demonstrated that the Mit marker enzyme, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase, (ACP), increased following exposure to SPS. SPS induced COX release from Mit and led to a wider distribution of ACP in round lysosomes, NLY, and the Golgi. In addition, we found that SPS increased the presence of autophagosomes and induced changes in the autophagy-related protein, Beclin. These results indicated the differential effects of SPS on cellular organelles, that is, a positive effect on lysosomes as well as a negative effect on the Mit and ER. Increased lysosomal function may serve as protection against SPS-induced cell damage. Structural changes in the Mit and ER may be involved in SPS-induced disorders of energy metabolism and protein synthesis and export.",

Results show that SPIB protein expression levels were significantly higher in colon, liver, and stomach tumors than in non-tumor tissues (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). SPIB overexpression in patients with HCC was also significantly higher than that of the normal samples (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

This study investigated the comparative biosynthesis and cellular biodistribution of fucose residues in some tissues of tetrapoda representatives using lectin histochemistry. In this study, the mouse was used as a representative for mammalian, pigeon for avian, lizard for reptilian, and toad for amphibians. The localization of the fucose residues was seen in several cell types of mice ileum, such as villi microfold (M) cells, goblet cells, some of intestinal crypts cells, and lamina propria cells. In other tetrapoda representatives, fucose was only seen in M cells of lizard ileum and some cells of villi lamina propria of pigeon, lizard, and toad. It was also observed in the pancreatic acinar cells of the mouse and some cell aggregations of pancreatic parenchyma of the lizard. Contrarily, it was not seen either in pigeon or in toad pancreases parenchyma. Spleen of all animals showed the fucose residues in some splenic cells in the red pulp only, barring the white pulp. The liver parenchyma of all tetrapoda representatives hadn\u2019t fucose residues. The fucose cellular biodistribution in some cells of tetrapoda representatives differed based on the cell type.

     "abstract": "The effects of daily repeated bouts of concentric, isometric, or eccentric contractions induced by high frequency (kilohertz) transcutaneous electrical stimulation in ameliorating atrophy of the soleus muscle in hindlimb unloaded rats were determined. Five groups of male rats were studied: control, hindlimb unloaded for 2 weeks (HU), or HU plus two daily bouts of concentric, isometric, or eccentric high-frequency electrical stimulation-induced contractions of the calf musculature. Soleus mass and fiber size were smaller, the levels of phosphorylated Akt1 and FoxO3a lower, and atrogin-1 and ubiquitinated proteins higher in the HU, and the HU plus concentric or isometric contraction groups than in the control group. In contrast, daily bouts of eccentric contractions maintained these values at near control levels and all measures were significantly different from all other HU groups. These results indicate that daily bouts of eccentric contractions induced by high-frequency stimulation inhibited the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome catabolic pathway and enhanced the Akt1/FoxO3a anabolic pathway that resulted in a prevention of the atrophic response of the soleus muscle to chronic unloading.",

MMP20 expression was higher in ameloblastoma when compared to adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), DC and GOC. The expression of MMP20 was lower in CCOT when compared to all tumors and cysts.The expression of WNT5A in a group of odontogenic lesions suggests the participation of a non-canonical WNT signaling pathway in the progression and maintenance of these lesions.

They are thus an interesting target in wide fields of pulmonary research. Stereological methods allow their quantification based on measurements on histological sections. A proper AE2 cell quantification, however, requires a method of tissue processing that results in little tissue shrinkage during processing. It was recently shown that a primary fixation with a mixture of glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, postfixation with osmium tetroxide and uranyl acetate and embedding in glycol methacrylate fulfills this requirement. However, a proper quantification, furthermore, requires a secure identification of the cells under the microscope. Classical approaches using routine stainings, high magnifications and systematic uniform random sampling can result in a tedious counting procedure. In this article we show that Sudan Black B and Sudan III staining in combination with the previously described \u201clow shrinkage method\u201d of tissue processing result in good staining of lamellar bodies of AE2 cells (their storing organelles of surfactant) and thus provide a good signal of AE2 cells, which allows their easy and secure identification even at rather low magnifications.

Results indicate evident histological changes in the oviduct magnum during development mainly in the magnum's mucosa. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the oviduct magnum from 8-day-old chicken embryos to one-day-old chickens did not present any PR isoform, but the oviduct magnum of one-week and one-month-old chickens expressed PR in the nuclei of all cell types. In epithelial cells, PR-B was the only isoform expressed; in muscle and serosa cells, PR-A isoform was the only isoform expressed; and stromal cells expressed both isoforms. The results also demonstrate positive ER-\u03b1 immunostaining in the nuclei of different cells from embryonic life to later developmental stages of the oviduct magnum. Data indicate that the variations of ER-\u03b1 or PR expression or dominance of either PR expression is differentially regulated depending on the cell type, the development of the oviduct, and in an age-specific manner. These variations in sex steroids hormone receptors are related with histological changes of the oviduct magnum through development.",

     "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum-A (XPA) is a C4-type zinc-finger scaffolding protein that regulates the removal of bulky-helix distorting DNA damage products from the genome. Phosphorylation of serine residues within the XPA protein is associated with improved protection of genomic DNA and cell death resistance. Therefore, kinase signaling is one important mechanism for regulating the protective function of XPA. Previous experiments have shown that spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) may mobilize XPA as a general stress response to chemical and physical ototoxicants. Therapeutic optimization of XPA via kinase signaling could serve as a means to improve DNA repair capacity within neurons following injury. The kinase signaling activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been shown in tumor cell lines to increase the repair of DNA damage products that are primarily repaired by XPA. Such observations suggest that EGFR may regulate the protective function of XPA. However, it is not known whether SGNs in particular or neurons in general could co-express XPA and EGFR. In the current study gene and protein expression of XPA and EGFR were determined from cochlear homogenates. Immunofluorescence assays were then employed to localize neurons expressing both EGFR and XPA within the ganglion. This work was then confirmed with double-immunohistochemistry. Rosenthal's canal served as the reference space in these experiments and design-based stereology was employed in first-order stereology quantification of immunoreactive neurons. The results confirmed that a population of SGNs that constitutively express XPA may also express the EGFR. These results provide the basis for future experiments designed to therapeutically manipulate the EGFR in order to regulate XPA activity and restore gene function in neurons following DNA damage.",

     "abstract": "Craniopharyngiomas (CPs) are cystic, encapsulated, slow-growing epithelial tumors. CPs can be aggressive forms invading and resorting surrounding structures of adjacent brain tissue, where Rosenthal fibers (RFs) are expressed. The aim of this study was to investigate the ultrastructure of these fibers in human biopsies and compare it with an experimental toxic model produced by the cortical infusion of the oil cyst fluid (\u201cOil machinery\u201d fluid or OMF) from CPs to rats. For this purpose, the CPs from ten patients were examined by light and electron microscopy. OMF was administered to rats intracortically. Immunohistochemical detection of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin was assessed. In both freshly obtained CPs and rat brain tissue, the presence of abundant cellular debris, lipid-laden macrophages, reactive gliosis, inflammation and extracellular matrix destruction were seen. Ultrastructural results suggest focal pathological disturbances and an altered microenvironment surrounding the tumor\u2013brain junction, with an enhanced presence of RFs in human tumors. In contrast, in the rat brain different degrees of cellular disorganization with aberrant filament\u2013filament interactions and protein aggregation were seen, although RFs were absent. Our immunohistochemical findings in CPs also revealed an enhanced expression of GFAP and vimentin in RFs at the peripheral, but not at the central (body) level. Through these findings we hypothesize that the continuous OMF release at the CPs boundary may cause tissue alterations, including damaging of the extracellular matrix, and possibly contributing to RFs formation, a condition that was not possible to reproduce in the experimental model. The presence of RFs at the CPs boundary might be considered as a major criterion for the degree of CPs invasiveness to normal tissue. The lack of RFs reactivity in the experimental model reveals that the invasive component of CPs is not present in the OMF, although the fluid per se can exert tissue damage.",

     "abstract": "Heat shock proteins are ubiquitous molecular chaperones involved in post-translational folding, stability, activation and maturation of many proteins that are essential mediators of signal transduction and cell cycle progression. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) has recently emerged as an attractive therapeutic target in cancer treatment since it may act as a key regulator of various oncogene products and cell-signaling molecules. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1; also known as Hsp32) is an inducible enzyme participating in heme degradation and involved in oxidative stress resistance. Recent studies indicate that HO-1 activation may play a role in tumor development and progression. In the present study we investigated the chemotherapic effects of combining an Hsp90 inhibitor (NMS E973) and an HO-1 inhibitor (SnMP) on A375 melanoma cells. NMS E973 treatment was able to reduce cell viability and induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (i.e. Ire1\u03b1, ERO1, PDI, BIP and CHOP). Interestingly, no significant effect was observed in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Finally, NMS E973 treatment resulted in a significant HO-1 overexpression, which in turn serves as a possible chemoresistance molecular mechanism. Interestingly, the combination of NMS E973 and SnMP produced an increase of ROS and reduced cell viability compared to NMS E973 treatment alone. The inhibitors combination exhibited higher ER stress, apoptosis as evidenced by bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BFAR) mRNA expression and lower phosphorylation of Akt when compared to NMS E973 alone. In conclusion, these data suggest that HO-1 inhibition potentiates NMS E973 toxicity and may be exploited as a strategy for melanoma treatment.",

FGF7 immunoreactivity is mainly detected in the regenerating epidermis and in sparse fibroblasts of the underlying dermis of the regenerating scales while it is weaker in the other tissues such as the apical ependymal cells and early regenerating muscles. Immunolabeled mesenchymal fibroblasts are frequently present under the epidermis of the forming outer scale surface, a localization that might be connected to beta-cell differentiation in this region of the scale. FGF7 immunolabeling is also seen in differentiating beta-keratinocytes of the beta-layer in the regenerating scales.

It is known that microRNA-mediated genes regulation is essential for gonadal development and function. Thus, the aim of the present study was to examine whether prenatal flutamide exposure influences expression of Dicer1, an enzyme involved in microRNA maturation, in gonads of porcine fetuses during mid- and late gestation.Pregnant gilts were injected with flutamide (50\u00a0mg/day/kg b.w.) or corn oil (controls) between days 43\u201349, 83\u201389 or 101\u2013107 of gestation. The fetal gonads were obtained on gestational day 50 (GD50), 90 (GD90) or 108 (GD108). To assess Dicer1 mRNA expression real-time PCR were performed. Furthermore, immunohistochemical Dicer1 localization was conducted. In testes from flutamide treated fetuses, increased Dicer1 mRNA expression was observed in the GD50 and GD108 groups, but decreased in the GD90 group. Dicer1 was immunolocalized in the fetal Leydig cells in both control and flutamide-treated groups. In fetal ovaries, antiandrogen treatment increased Dicer1 mRNA level in the GD50 and GD90 groups. In control and flutamide-exposed groups, Dicer1 was localized in the germ cells within oogonia/oocyte nests as well as in the granulosa cells and oocytes of forming follicles. Concluding, diminished androgen action during gestation induces changes in Dicer1 mRNA expression, which may affect post-transcriptional gene regulation via miRNAs in porcine fetal gonads. However, it seems that androgens exert diverse biological effects depending on the gestational period.",

The intratubular germ cell neoplasia unclassified (ITGCNU) is a histological pattern preceding the development of seminomas and non-seminomas. It was suggested that in patients with cryptorchidism, the gonocytes remained undifferentiated with pluripotent abilities expressing proteins like POU domain class 5 transcription factor 1 (POU5F1), tyrosine kinase receptor c-Kit, placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP), the transcription factor AP2\u03b3 and sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) that confer to the gonocytes this ability and therefore make them susceptible to develop ITGCNU. The aim of the present study was to determine if the gonocytes of patients with cryptorchidism express POU5F1, c-Kit, PLAP, AP2\u03b3 and SALL4 proteins after their differentiation period. Based on this, we evaluated samples of testicular tissue from newborns to 16-year old subjects with or without cryptorchidism in search of POU5F1, c-Kit, PLAP, AP2\u03b3 and SALL4 using immunocytochemical method, the results of which were validated by RT-PCR. The results showed that control subjects witnessed a down-regulation in the expression of these five proteins in the first year of life, which eventually disappeared. On the other hand, it was determined that 21.6% (8/37) of the patients with cryptorchidism continued to express, at least, one of the proteins analyzed in this study after the second year of life. And only 5.4% (2/37) of the patients were positive to the five markers. These data sustain the proposed hypothesis that in cryptorchid patients, ITGCNU arises from gonocytes that fail in their differentiation process to spermatogonia with conservation of the proteins (POU5F1, c-Kit, PLAP, AP2\u03b3 and SALL4) that maintain pluripotency and undifferentiated characteristics and which are responsible for making the gonocytes susceptible to malignancy.

Then, specimens were prepared for histological study by hematoxlyin and eosin (H&E), Masson's trichrome, caspase-3 as well as for ultrastructural examination and oxidative stress parameters evaluation. Data were morphometrically and statistically analyzed. In AFB1-treated group, focal tubulo-interstitial affection in the form of tubular cytoplasmic vacuolation, mitochondrial disruption, numerous lysosomes, marked increase in collagen deposition and in caspase-3 expression were observed. Glomerular impairment in the form of fusion of podocytes enlarged foot processes and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) with loss of its trilaminar appearance were detected. In the group treated by AFB1\u00a0+\u00a0Vit E, there were minimal affection of the histological structure of the renal cortex as well as significant increase in the anti-oxidative parameters which were significantly decreased in the AFB1-treated group. Therefore, Vit E could be considered in wide experimental studies to be a first choice antioxidant of high cost-effectiveness in prevention of fungal toxins pro-oxidant-induced renal impairment.",

Hubbard strain one-day old chickens (n\u00a0=\u00a0120) were kept in pens and were fed one of the three corn-soybean meal-based diets until 49 days of age. The dietary treatments consisted of 2.5% added oil or fat from three sources as follows: SFO diet containing sunflower oil; LRD diet containing lard, and EVOO diet containing extra-virgin olive oil. Dietary oil or fat type improved significantly body weight and gain as well as feed efficiency in birds fed EVOO compared to those fed the other treatments. Based on our findings, after the whole experimental feeding period it was possible to observe relevant injuries to the liver of the chicks fed with lard, whereas the hepatic histopathological changes appeared less marked or absent in the chicks fed vegetable oils from sunflower or olive. Thus, we can conclude that dietary lipid source affected chicks performance and hepatic histopathology especially when chicks fed diet containing animal fats; whereas feeding extra-virgin olive oil supported positively growth traits and did not result in hepatic histopathological effects.",

D2R immunoreactivity was mainly localized in glomus cells immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase or dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), but not in S100B-immunoreactive sustentacular cells. Furthermore, D2R immunoreactivity was observed in petrosal ganglion cells and nerve bundles in the carotid body, but not in the nerve endings with P2X2 immunoreactivity. In the carotid ganglion, a few punctate D2R-immunoreactive products were detected in DBH-immunoreactive nerve cell bodies.

The clamps were then removed to allow reperfusion for 3\u00a0h (Group 3, 6, 7). Sham-operated rats (Group 1) underwent laparotomy without the induction of ischemia/reperfusion injury. Real-Time-PCR was performed to determine IL-1-beta, IL-6 and iNOS expression levels. Histopathological (H&E) and immunohistochemical staining (NF-k\u03b2 p65) processes were then performed. Finally, SOD, GSH, and MDA levels were determined.Intense hemorrhagic areas were observed in both the ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion groups, whereas minimal hemorrhage was observed in the treatment groups. The ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion groups exhibited extreme immunoreactivity, detected by NF-k\u03b2 p65 staining; this reactivity decreased after the application of beta-carotene. The expression of IL-1-beta, IL-6, and iNOS in the injury groups increased significantly, whereas a dose-dependent improvement was observed in the treatment groups. Finally, MDA levels increased significantly and SOD and GSH levels decreased drastically in the injury groups. However, these values obtained from I/R groups were normalized after beta-carotene treatment.In this study, we demonstrated via molecular and biochemical parameters the protective effect of beta-carotene, which is a potent antioxidant, on the experimental ischemia-reperfusion model.",

In addition, 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/ml lysozyme had a promoting effect on shaft production. It was also associated with significant proliferation of matrix keratinocytes by immunofluorescence observation. Furthermore, lysozyme promoted hair growth by increasing the levels of alkaline phosphatase and lymphoid enhancer factor 1 in DP, as determined by Western blotting.

This study investigates the protective effect of Ang1-7 against H/R-induced oxidative stress in rat H9C2 cells. Our results showed that Ang1-7 (80\u00a0nM) treatment significantly protected cells from H/R-induced oxidative injury via improving cell viability and reducing cell apoptosis. The protective effect of Ang1-7 was associated with the inhibition of ROS-associated mitochondrial dysfunction as well as the induction of Akt phosphorylation.

The liver was dissected: the left lobe was used for histology and the right lobe was frozen for biochemical assays. Body weight, rectal temperature and T4 concentration were lower in hypothyroid groups. When measurements of oxidative stress markers, redox environment, \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase and glutathione-S-transferase were determined, we observed that hypothyroid animals with TAA compensated better with oxidative damage than euthyroid animals treated with TAA. Furthermore, we measured reduced expressions of GADD34, caspase-12 and GRP78 and subsequently less hypothyroidism-induced cellular damage in hypothyroid animals. We conclude that hypothyroidism protects against hepatic damage caused by TAA because it reduces endoplasmic reticulum stress and changes to the redox environment.",

In the present study, we performed a microarray analysis in order to evaluate the expression of cyclin D1 in neuroblastoma as compared to ganglioneuroma and ganglioneuroblastoma. We first confirmed that comparable levels of cyclin D1 are present in neuroblastoma and fetal neuroblasts. In addition, we observed that neuroblastoma is associated to significantly higher levels of cyclin D1 as compared to both ganglioneuroma and ganglioneuroblastoma. No differences are instead observable between ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma.

Fragments of the stomach and gut fixed for 8\u00a0h in Bouin liquid were subjected to histological processing and immunohistochemical routine. For the histological analyses, the technique of staining with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) was used, whereas for the histochemical analyses Gomori's trichrome, periodic acid\u00a0+\u00a0Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue pH 2.5 (AB) were used to further immunohistochemical processing. The stomach has a mucosa lined with a simple columnar epithelium with mucus-secreting cells; the glandular region (proximal and distal portions) has folds and pits, whereas the non-glandular region has pits only. The intestinal epithelium is simple with plain cylindrical grooved and goblet cells. The anterior region has thin folds with few goblet cells, and the posterior region with thick folds and many goblet cells. The regional distribution and frequency of endocrine cells varied across regions of the GIT with the stomach showing the highest amount of immunoreactive (IR) cells. Only the 5-HT was found in the stomach (epithelia and glands) and gut regions, with comparatively higher frequency in the stomach. SST-IR cells were found in the stomach (epithelia and gastric glands) with higher frequency in the glandular region, whereas GAS-IR were found in the gastric glands only.

Seven-week-old female Wistar rats were divided into the OVX and sham-treated (Sham) groups.

Furthermore, OVX led to increased concentrations of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) protein and a decreased VEGF-A/TSP-1 ratio, an indicator of angio-adaptations, in soleus muscle compared with the Sham group.

Intense GAT-1 expression was observed in the GL; GAT-1 expression was discernible in the ePL, ML, and GrL. However, intense GAT-3 expression was extensively observed in all layers of the MOB. These results suggest that substantial GABAergic synapses are present in the GL, ePL, ML, and GrL. Furthermore, the released GABA may be removed by GAT-1 and GAT-3 in the GL, and the majority of GABA, which is present in the ePL to GrL, may undergo reuptake by GAT-3. This is the first morphological and descriptive study of GABAergic transmission in the MOB of Korean roe deer.",

For this purpose, thirty-six male rat pups were allocated into six groups. The 1st group received distilled water (control group), the 2nd group was given 300\u00a0mg RJ/kg bw (RJ group), the 3rd group was given 0.4\u00a0ml CLO/kg bw (CLO group), the 4th was given 500\u00a0mg T/kg bw (T group). The 5th group was given T concurrently with RJ (TRJ group) and the 6th group was given T concurrently with CLO (TCLO group), at the same doses as the former groups. All treatments were given orally for 30 consecutive days. The concentrations of different brain neurotransmitters, gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) as well as the antioxidant and oxidative stress biomarkers were measured in the brain homogenates. An immunohistochemical staining of the cerebral cortex was applied with the anti-ssDNA antibody (an apoptotic cell marker) to reveal the changes in brain structure. The T group revealed a significant decrease in the concentration of the brain neurotransmitters, a sharp shortage in the level of antioxidant biomarkers (super oxide dismutase, catalase and the reduced glutathione), a marked increase in malondialdehyde levels, and numerous apoptotic cells in the brain cortex compared with the other groups. Interestingly, all the previously mentioned parameters were almost retrieved in both the TRJ and TCLO groups compared to the T group. These results conclusively demonstrate that RJ and CLO administration provides sufficient protection against the ruinous effects of T on rat pups brain tissue function and structure.",

DHA reduced the intensity and duration of neurogenic pain. The application of DHA led to an earlier stabilization of weight bearing in the incapacitance test and prevented the development of cold allodynia and degenerative changes in tissues of the denervated limb. DHA treatment significantly reduced satellite glia reaction and expression of the pro-apoptotic p53 protein in the DRG. Thus, DHA's anti-pain effect may be a result of the modulation of microglia/macrophages activity and the development of neuroprotective effects at the level of the dorsal root ganglia.",

The tissue morphology, immunohistochemical profile, ultrastructural and molecular characteristics of four cases of small cell variant renal oncocytoma were analyzed and the literature was reviewed. The patients were three women and one man with ages ranging from 51 to 76 years. The size of the tumors ranged from 3 to 8.5\u00a0cm in diameter. The follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 58 months. All patients lived uneventfully without tumor recurrence or metastasis. The tumors were grayish yellow to brown, well demarcated, with a central scar or cystic change. Microscopically, the tumor was arranged in lobular structure containing dense small acini or tubular structures, with small cells featuring weak eosinophilic and scant cytoplasm, small round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. No mitotic figures or necrosis were discerned. The immunohistochemical profile of small cell variant of renal oncocytoma is partially consistent with classic oncocytoma, expressing EMA, CK18, CD117 and E-cad. However, MITO and S-100A1 were intensively expressed in classic RO, but neither of them was expressed in small cell variant RO. Ultrastructurally, a small number of organelles was revealed in the tumor cell, including a few mitochondria, lysosomes and microvilli, less than those in the classic oncocytoma. No genetic aberrations were found in all cases regardless of clinicopathological characteristics and tissue types. Small cell variant renal oncocytoma of the kidney is frequently difficult to be differentiated from other benign and malignant small cell tumors with eosinophilic cytoplasm. The immunohistochemical profile, ultrastructural and genetic features of the tumor are integrally presented here for the first time. Acquaintance with the special characteristics of the tumor could facilitate the correct diagnosis of the tumor.",

We observed the growth pattern, histopathological characteristics and immunohistochemical localization of cytokeratin 5 (CK 5), cytokeratin 8 (CK 8) and androgen receptor (AR) in the transplanted tissues. Almost all of the transplanted UGS organs gradually increased in weight over time in the non-castrated recipient animals, and the histopathological observations and immunohistochemical analysis of CK 5 and CK 8 revealed that the morphological changes in the tissues were in accordance with the features of normal prostate development. The histological characteristics included glandular epithelial dominant and stromal dominant area, with an increase in the glandular epithelial dominant areas over time and resemblance among a portion of the transplanted tissues within a certain period during the developmental course to the histopathology of human benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The effects of androgens and resemblance in the immunohistochemical localization pattern changes in AR to that observed in the normal differentiating rat prostate were also noted.

The elevated levels of KLF4 in the spinal cords of rats with EAE remained significant, even during the recovery stage of EAE. The cellular phenotype of KLF4 in EAE lesions consisted of some T cells, macrophages, and reactive astrocytes, whereas it was expressed constitutively in resting astrocytes and neurons, but not in ramified microglial cells in normal spinal cords. Collectively, we postulate that autoimmune T cells and macrophages activate KLF4 and subsequently do not proliferate or exhibit phenotypic switching from M1 to M2 macrophages, respectively.

In parallel, free testosterone deficiency provides the baseline hormonal milieu for the ageing male. The aim of this study was to illustrate (using diverse microscopic and biochemical methodologies) the effects of testosterone application on the capacity for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone secretion in a rat model of the andropause. Middle-aged Wistar rats were divided into sham-operated (SO; n\u00a0=\u00a08), orchidectomized (Orx; n\u00a0=\u00a08) and testosterone treated orchidectomized (Orx\u00a0+\u00a0T; n\u00a0=\u00a08) groups. Testosterone propionate (5\u00a0mg/kg b.w./day) was administered for three weeks, while SO and Orx groups received the vehicle alone. ACTH cells and the adrenal cortex were stained using immuno-histochemical, immuno-fluorescent and histochemical procedures. Circulating concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, ACTH and corticosterone, as well as the adrenal tissue corticosterone levels were measured by immunoassays. Testosterone application led to increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) serum concentrations of sex steroids. Consequently, in Orx\u00a0+\u00a0T rats the ACTH cell nuclei volume increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by 34%, while the volume density of ACTH cells and their relative intensity of fluorescence decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) by 46% and 21%, respectively, in comparison with the corresponding parameters in the Orx group. Testosterone also induced vasodilatation in the adrenocortical zona fasciculata, and decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) the ACTH concentrations and adrenal tissue corticosterone levels by 38% and 31%, respectively, compared to the Orx group. In conclusion, testosterone administration caused a decrease in the capacity for ACTH and corticosterone secretion in a rat model of the andropause.",

Nowadays, it has been clearly demonstrated that Apo D expression is induced and its subcellular location undergoes modifications in stressful and pathological conditions that characterize aging processes and neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present work was to study in detail the effect of H2O2 on the subcellular location of Apo D, in the hippocampal cell line HT22, by structural, ultrastructural, immunocytochemical, and molecular techniques in order to characterize the Apo D distribution pattern in neurons during oxidative stress. Our results indicate that Apo D is located in the cytoplasm under physiological conditions but treatment with H2O2 induces apoptosis and causes a displacement of Apo D location to the nucleus, coinciding with DNA fragmentation. In addition, we demonstrated that Apo D tends to accumulate around the nuclear envelope in neurons and glial cells of different brain areas in some neurodegenerative diseases and during human aging, but never inside the nucleus. These data suggest that the presence of Apo D in the nucleus, which some authors related with a specific transport, is a consequence of structural and functional alterations during oxidative stress and not the result of a specific role in the regulation of nuclear processes.",

The study material was collected from 20 animals. The distribution of CART in the bovine pancreas was investigated, by an immunohistochemical evaluation.CART peptide in the normal pancreas has been identified in intrapancreatic ganglia, nerve fibres and in endocrine cells of Langerhans islets and exocrine pancreas. CART immunoreactive nerve fibres innervate the exocrine and endocrine regions and the intrapancreatic ganglia, where they form a moderate number of networks, encircling the cell bodies. The few CART-immunoreactive endocrine cells, that appear in the bovine pancreas, are not limited to the islet cells, where they form a subpopulation of CART-containing cells, but are also individually distributed in the exocrine region. Furthermore, CART has been visualized in nerve fibres, innervating pancreatic outlet ducts and blood vessels.CART plays a physiological role in the integrated mechanisms that regulate both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic secretion.These results are consistent with the hypothesis that CART expression in nerve fibres and intrapancreatic ganglia is a common feature of the mammalian pancreas, whereas its expression in endocrine cells appears to be restricted to single cells of the bovine pancreas.",

LRG1 overexpression and silenced cell lines demonstrated modulation of glioma cellular proliferation, migration and invasion through MTT, cell scratching and Transwell assays. Furthermore, overexpression of LRG1 led to augmented activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway as well as downregulation of E-cadherin and resultant enhanced invasiveness, which was reversed by TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitor SB431542.

     "abstract": "Melatonin plays an essential role in development and immunoregulation of the avian spleen through its receptors; however, the variations in the expression of the melatonin receptor subtypes in the developing avian spleen are still unclear. The objective of the present study was not only to investigate the distribution patterns and development changes of the expression of the melatonin receptor subtypes (Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c) in the chicken spleen but also to identify the correlation between the plasma melatonin concentration and the expression of the melatonin receptor subtypes. The immunohistochemical results indicated that Mel1a was mainly distributed in the red pulp and capillaries, Mel1b was predominantly distributed in the periarterial lymphatic sheath (PALS) and splenic nodule, and Mel1c was widely located in the red pulp, PALS and splenic nodule. From P0 to P21, the mRNA and protein expressions of Mel1a, Mel1b and Mel1c in the spleen were increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, a slight increase in the expression of the three melatonin receptor subtypes was observed after P21 (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Furthermore, the mRNA levels of Mel1b and Mel1c between P0 and P14 raised more quickly than Mel1a. The plasma melatonin concentration increased in an age-dependent manner in the chicken from P0 to P42 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and this increasing change was linear after P14 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The melatonin level in the plasma is strongly correlated with the protein expressions of Mel1a (r\u00a0=\u00a00.938, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), Mel1b (r\u00a0=\u00a00.912, P\u00a0=\u00a00.011), and Mel1c (r\u00a0=\u00a00.906, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) in the chicken spleen.

Data were analyzed using paired t-test and unpaired t-test, with a 5% significance level. HMWHA reduced histologic changes and thickness of the articular disc, led to a greater arrangement of collagenous fibers, lower concentration of sulfated glycosaminoglycans and lower activity in all isoforms of MMP-2 and -9 in TMJs with induced arthritis.

This analysis was conducted on both cryosections and whole mount preparations including the myenteric and the submucous plexuses of the bovine jejunum. The results obtained showed the presence of a large subpopulation of GFAP-expressing EGCs in the main plexuses and within the muscle layers, whereas only few GFAP-positive glial processes were found within the deeper layer of the mucosa, and they never reached the mucosal epithelium. Three different EGC subtypes, namely I, III and IV types were recognized in the examined tract of the bovine intestine.

     "abstract": "We examined immunohistochemically the expression pattern of a potential tumor biomarker survivin in a panel of 116 tubular adenomatous polyps to determine its association with clinicomorphological parameters such as age of patients, size of polyps, degree of dysplasia and polyp localization. In each section, the subcellular localization of survivin antigen and the intensity of staining were assessed. Overall, survivin was expressed in 90 cases (77.6%). Cytoplasmic positivity was observed in 46/116 cases (39.7%), while nuclear and combined nuclear and cytoplasmic reaction in 44/116 cases (37.9%). High grade dysplasia was diagnosed in 52 cases (44.8%) and low grade dysplasia in 64 cases (55.2%). Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between subcellular survivin localization and the degree of dysplasia, size of polyps and colon localization. On the other hand, survivin expression pattern did not correlate with the age of patients. Statistically significant trend was confirmed between intensity of survivin immunoreaction and tumor size and dysplasia grade, and also the trend between negative/strong survivin intensity and polyp localization. Another statistically significant association was found between the degree of dysplasia and the size of polyps. Our findings revealed that survivin is frequently expressed in different subcellular compartments of adenoma cells. Our recent results suggest that the nuclear and combined nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin localizations are strongly associated with poor prognostic parameters in the assessment of colon adenomas. Thus, survivin may represent a promising biomarker in immunohistochemical evaluation of these lesions.",

     "abstract": "Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), can be isolated from bone marrow or other tissues, including fat, muscle and umbilical cord. It has been shown that MSC behave in vitro as stem cells: they self-renew and are able to differentiate into mature cells typical of several mesenchymal tissues. Moreover, the differentiation toward non-mesenchymal cell lineages (e.g. neurons) has been reported as well. The clinical relevance of these cells is mainly related to their ability to spontaneously migrate to the site of inflammation/damage, to their safety profile thanks to their low immunogenicity and to their immunomodulation capacities. To date, MSCs isolated from the post-natal bone marrow have represented the most extensively studied population of adult MSCs, in view of their possible use in various therapeutical applications. However, the bone marrow-derived MSCs exhibit a series of limitations, mainly related to their problematic isolation, culturing and use. In recent years, umbilical cord (UC) matrix (i.e. Wharton's jelly, WJ) stromal cells have therefore emerged as a more suitable alternative source of MSCs, thanks to their primitive nature and the easy isolation without relevant ethical concerns. This review seeks to provide an overview of the main biological properties of WJ-derived MSCs. Moreover, the potential application of these cells for the treatment of some known dysfunctions in the central and peripheral nervous system will also be discussed.",

     "abstract": "Making a correct diagnosis when dealing with a small round blue cell tumor (SRBCT) of children and adolescents may be relatively straightforward if the tumor arises in the typical clinical setting and the classic pathologic features are all recognizable. However it is widely known that diagnostic difficulties may arise because of: (i) many tumors share overlapping morphological and/or immunohistochemical features; (ii) considerable clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical variations do exist; (iii) the increasing use of small biopsies in daily practice makes the diagnosis of these neoplasms more challenging. Accordingly, immunohistochemical analyses are currently mandatory in establishing the correct diagnosis. In this regard there is the need to identify more sensitive and specific immunomarkers useful in the distinction of the several tumor entities. Over the last decades, several markers, such as CD99, WT1 protein, desmin, myogenin, NB84, and INI1 have been identified, providing a considerable help in recognition of the most common solid tumors (ESW/pPNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, Wilms\u2019 tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor; malignant rhabdoid tumor) in children and adolescents. However, at the same time, their unusual, unexpected expression can result in a misinterpretation of the immunohistochemical results, especially by pathologists who are not familiar with oncologic pediatric pathology. Therefore the present review focuses on the potential immunohistochemical pitfalls which should be kept in mind by pathologists to prevent diagnostic errors when dealing with SRBCTs.",

     "abstract": "The protein cyclin D1 (CD1), which belongs to a family of proteins functioning as regulators of CDKs (cyclin-dependent kinases) throughout the cell cycle, has been immunohistochemically detected in a wide variety of human malignant tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate immunohistochemically the expression and distribution of CD1 in the developing human peripheral sympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and in childhood peripheral neuroblastic tumors (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas). The above mentioned fetal and neoplastic tissues represent an in vivo model in which undifferentiated neuroblastic cells undergo ganglion cell differentiation. During development, a strong nuclear expression of CD1 was restricted to neuroblasts, disappearing progressively from the maturing ganglion cells with increasing gestational age. In neoplastic tissues, CD1 immunoreactivity was restricted to neuroblastic cell component of all neuroblastomas and ganglioneuroblastomas, whereas it was absent or only focally detectable in maturing/mature ganglion cell component of differentiating neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas. We conclude that CD1 is a reliable marker, which can be used routinely to stain neuroblastic cells in both developing and neoplastic tissues. Furthermore, our results indicate that CD1 expression in childhood peripheral neuroblastic tumors recapitulates the changes during normal development of PSNS, as previously reported for Bcl-2 oncoprotein, c-ErbB2, insulin-like growth factor 2, \u03b2-2-microglobulin, and cathepsin D. This is consistent with the current view that childhood peripheral neuroblastic tumors exhibit gene expression profiles mirroring those occurring during PSNS development.",

While many studies about the immune system in healthy and diseased adult human skin exist, our knowledge about the cutaneous prenatal/developing immune system and especially about the phenotype and function of antigen-presenting cells such as epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) in human skin is still scarce. It has been shown previously that LCs in healthy adult human skin express receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK), an important molecule prolonging their survival. In this study, we investigated at which developmental stage LCs acquire this important molecule. Immunofluorescence double-labeling of cryostat sections revealed that LC precursors in prenatal human skin either do not yet [10\u201311 weeks of estimated gestational age (EGA)] or only faintly (13\u201315 weeks EGA) express RANK. LCs express RANK at levels comparable to adult LCs by the end of the second trimester. Comparable with adult skin, dermal antigen-presenting cells at no gestational age express this marker. These findings indicate that epidermal leukocytes gradually acquire RANK during gestation \u2013 a phenomenon previously observed also for other markers on LCs in prenatal human skin.",

For the study, clinical and imaging data were obtained from the medical records. All cases were histologically reviewed, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to confirm the diagnosis. Four cases of head and neck solitary infantile myofibroma were identified. All patients were females and presented a mean age of 3 years old (ranging from 2 to 6 years). The site of the tumors were the mandible, right cheek, subcutaneous tissue adjacent to basal cortical of the mandible and upper anterior gingiva. No symptoms, such as pain or paresthesia, were reported. Computerized tomography revealed well-delimited tumors. All tumors were positive for vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin. All patients underwent surgical excision and no signs of recurrence were observed after long-term follow-up. In summary, head and neck solitary infantile myofibromas are rare and present excellent prognosis. The correlation between clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical features are essential for a correct diagnosis.",

The number of Ki-67 positive cells in the epithelium of canaliculare (88\u00a0cells/mm2) and sacculare stage (93\u00a0cells/mm2) were significantly higher than in the epithelium of pseudoglandular stage (12\u00a0cells/mm2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0008 vs. p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The number of Ki-67 positive cells in the mesenchyme of canaliculare stage (132\u00a0cells/mm2) was significantly higher than in the mesenchyme of pseudoglandular stage (37\u00a0cells/mm2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The proliferation of mesenchymal cells was higher than the epithelial cells in all developmental stages, especially in the canaliculare stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Similarly, the number of caspase-3 positive cells in the epithelium of canalicular stage (13\u00a0cells/mm2) was significantly higher than in the epithelium of pseudoglandular stage (6\u00a0cells/mm2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) with peaks in the conductive epithelium of canalicular stage. The number of caspase-3 positive cells in the mesenchyme of canaliculare stage (3\u00a0cells/mm2) was significantly higher than in the mesenchyme of saccular stage (0\u00a0cells/mm2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). There were no caspase-3 positive cells in the mesenchyme of pseudoglandular stage. However, unlike the Ki-67 expression, mesenchymal cells in comparison to epithelial cells express substantially less caspase-3 in all developmental stages. Up to the saccular stage, the expression of MMP-9 in mesenchymal cells showed a linear increase with most pronounced expression in that stage. The number of MMP-9 positive cells in the mesenchyme of canaliculare (20\u00a0cells/mm2) and sacculare (39\u00a0cells/mm2) stage were significantly higher than in the mesenchyme of pseudoglandular stage (12\u00a0cells/mm2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04 vs. p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The first epithelial cells that express MMP-9 were present only at the alveolar stage. Increased proliferation and apoptosis of the mesenchymal cells of canalicular stage is important for formation of definite structures within the stroma of the lung parenchyma. Although apoptosis in the epithelium is not pronounced as proliferation, it is important for thinning of the epithelium and consequent spread of respiratory tract. However in the saccular stage when mesenchyme disappears, MMP-9 expression is more important for primitive alveoli differentiation.",

During pseudoglandular phase strong nuclear TTF-1 staining was detected in the columnar nonciliated epithelial cells, while NCAM, CgA and Syp had a moderate expression in the proximal airways and mild expression in the distal airways. Neuroendocrine cells (NECs) in proximal lung airway were co-localizing TTF-1 and other neuroendocrine markers while neuroendocrine bodies (NEBs) exhibit only staining with NCAM and Syp. In the canalicular phase TTF-1 nuclear staining was expressed only in several epithelial cells in proximal airways, while budding airways epithelium showed strong TTF-1 expression. Expression of NCAM, CgA and Syp in this phase equals the one in pseudoglandular phase. NEBs cells were co-localizing TTF-1 and NCAM in proximal airways and few NECs in distal airway were co-localizing TTF-1 and Syp. TTF-1 staining in the saccular phase was limited to subsets of epithelial cells in the proximal airways with stronger positivity in the distal airways. NCAM expression is moderate only in proximal airways, while Syp and CgA show mild expression in proximal and distal airways. NECs were co-localizing TTF-1 and NCAM in proximal lung airway. With regard to NECs, all small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells had strong TTF-1, NCAM, Syp and CgA positivity and TTF-1 co-localized with other neuroendocrine markers.

In vitro studies have shown that cyclin D1 is overexpressed in Ewing's sarcoma (EWS)/peripheral Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor (pPNET), but not in rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Only a few immunohistochemical studies are available on cyclin D1 expression in EWS/pPNET, which confirmed its expression only in a limited number of cases. The aim of the present study was a comparative immunohistochemical analysis of the expression and distribution of cyclin D1 in a large series of pediatric/adolescent soft tissue EWS/pPNETs and rhabdomyosarcomas (both embryonal and alveolar subtypes) to assess its potential usefulness in their differential diagnosis. Notably cyclin D1 was strongly and diffusely expressed in all cases (20/20) of EWS/pPNET, while it was lacked in all cases (15/15) of rhabdomyosarcomas. Immunohistochemical overexpression of cyclin D1 in EWS/pPNET is a novel finding which could be exploitable as a diagnostic immunomarker for this tumor. Although highly sensitive, cyclin D1 is not specific for EWS/pPNET, and thus it should not be evaluated alone but in the context of a wide immunohistochemical panel. Accordingly, we first emphasize that when pathologists are dealing with a small round blue cell tumor of soft tissues in pediatric/adolescent patients, a strong and diffuse nuclear expression of cyclin D1 is of complementary diagnostic value to CD99 and FLI-1 in confirming diagnosis of EWS/pPNET and in ruling out rhabdomyosarcoma.",

Occasional mild RAGE expression was observed in Ose during week 15, while strong expression characterized primordial follicles in week 22. In the reproductive human ovary, IGF-1 was mildly to moderately expressed in all ovarian cell lineages except in theca cells of the tertiary follicle where IGF-1 was negative. RAGE was strongly positive in the granulosa cells and some theca cells of the tertiary follicle, while negative to mildly positive in all cells of the secondary follicle. In the postmenopausal human ovary IGF-1 and RAGE were mildly expressed in Ose and stroma. In OSC, cells were strongly positive to IGF-1 and RAGE, except for some negative stromal cells. Different levels of IGF-1 and RAGE co-expression characterized fetal ovarian cells during development. In reproductive ovaries, IGF-1 and RAGE were co-localized in the granulosa and theca interna cells of tertiary follicles, while in postmenopausal ovaries and OSC, IGF-1 and RAGE were co-localized in Ose and OSC cells respectively.

Due to the particular properties of brain tumors, such as growth and division, examination of brain tumors and the analysis of results are not simple. Up to date there is a dearth of useful biomarkers that have been validated and clinically implemented for pediatric brain tumors. In order to identify the new genetic alterations we recognized, using microarray dataset, chitinases as new potential biomarkers of CNS tumors. The modulation of chitinases was confirmed also in the different histologic subtypes. Our study revealed that distinct patterns of chitinases expression characterize the diverse histological subtypes. In addition evaluating other lisosomal enzymes such as glycosidases and proteases we found that NEU4, CTBS and GBA2 belonging to glycosidases family and CTSC, CTSK and CTSF belonging to proteases family were differently modulated. Future investigations are needed to be performed before some of these enzymes could finally be used as biomarkers of specific types of CNS neoplasms.",

We investigated patterns of anti-oxidants, biomarkers of oxidative stress, and Hsp60 levels in sera from newborns and found significant associations between glutathione (GSH) levels and gestational age, delivery modality, and lipid hydroperoxydes (LOOH) level. LOOH levels and spontaneous (vaginal) delivery were independently associated with increased GSH levels when these were above the median. Hsp60 and LOOH levels were positively correlated whereas Hsp60 and GSH levels were inversely correlated in spontaneously delivered newborns; in contrast, Hsp60 and GSH levels were positively correlated in newborns delivered by cesarea. Our results point to new directions in the search for definite patterns of GSH, LOOH, and Hsp60 in the newborn's serum that might have functional and diagnostic significance and that could help in the monitoring of newborn health during and after delivery. In addition, the data provide a starting basis for investigating the precise roles and interplay of GSH and Hsp60 in the maintenance of an optimal redox balance at birth to cope with the stress inherent to delivery, and also for investigating the predictive value of any given pattern of GSH, LOOH, and Hsp60 at birth with regard to health status and risk of disease in adult life.",

In order to better understand the possible role of WT1 protein in human skeletal myogenesis and oncogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma, we assessed immunohistochemically its comparative expression in a large series of human developing, adult and neoplastic skeletal muscle tissues. The present study shows that WT1 protein is developmentally expressed in the cytoplasm of human myoblasts from the 6 weeks of gestational age. This expression was maintained in the myotubes of developing muscles of the trunk, head, neck, and extremities, while it was down-regulated in fetal skeletal fibers from 20 weeks of gestational age as well as in adult normal skeletal muscle. Notably, WT1 immunostaining disappeared from rhabdomyomas, whereas it was strongly and diffusely re-expressed in all cases (27/27) of embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The comparative evaluation of the immunohistochemical findings revealed that WT1 cytoplasmic expression in rhabdomyosarcoma may represent an ontogenetic reversal, and this nuclear transcription factor can also be considered an oncofetal protein which can be exploitable as an additional, highly sensitive immunomarker, together with desmin, myogenin and MyoD1, of this tumor.

The present ultrastructural immunogold study aimed to detect the specific location of three broadly expressed antimicrobial peptides in the tongue of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. The immunocytochemical study indicated that beta-defensin-15, the likely main defensin of granulocytes and skin, is poorly expressed in some dense and medium-dense granules of glandular cells of the papillated tongue. Conversely beta-defensin-27 appears highly expressed in numerous pale and cribriform dense granules of glandular cells and is also secreted on the tongue surface. The immunostaining for cathelicidin-1 indicated a variable but however positive immunolabeling in numerous granules in the tongue glands, suggesting that this antimicrobial peptide previously found on the epidermal surface is also present in the tongue secretions and participates to the formation of the anti-microbial oral barrier. The study suggests that among the numerous beta-defensins and cathelicidins identified in the genome of this lizard is present a specific distribution of different peptide subtypes in various body regions, including the tongue, and that these peptides contribute to the formation of local antimicrobial barriers.",

Western blotting analysis confirmed higher protein expression of VEGF in the fetal femur respect to the mandible.

The staining working solution comprises sodium 2-hydroxybutyrate (an affinity substrate of LDH-C4), nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and naphthol blue. The positive products were purple black lumps concentrated in the neck segment of the spermatozoa and weakly in the middle piece. A normal reference range for the integral enzyme activity was constructed from 120 healthy males based upon the scoring criteria. The study further compared the staining method with the routine spectrophotometry technique in terms of the results of 96 cases with infertile status. Moreover, we found the down-regulated LDH-C4 expression was significantly correlated with the lowered enzyme activity (r\u00a0=\u00a00.865, P\u00a0=\u00a00.000).

Human menisci were sampled from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Histological staining (H&E, PAS/Alcian Blue for neutral and charged carbohydrate residues) and (immuno)histochemistry were performed for detection of HA, CD44, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (EDG-1) as a marker for endothelial cells, CD3 as a marker for T-cells, CD20 as a marker for B-cells and CD68 as a marker for macrophages. The extracellular matrix in the vascularized zone showed higher amounts of HA as well as acid carbohydrate residues in comparison to the poorly vascularized zones of the meniscus in both disease entities. EDG-1 positive endothelial cells were present in all zones, with fewer cells being detected in the inner zones of the rheumatoid menisci than in the osteoarthritic ones. Macrophages, T- and B-cells as well as CD44-positive cells were more prominent in the vascularized zone of the meniscus than in the poorly vascularized central zone. The distribution patterns of the extracellular matrix components as well as the CD44-positive cells and the inflammation markers in the peripheral zone resembled the distribution in synovial tissue, indicating that both synovia and meniscus were involved in pathological changes in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In conclusion: the distribution of extracellular glycoconjugates and of cells modulating their synthesis showed similar results in both arthropathies, not enabling a differentiation between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis but underlining the role of these markers in inflammation and degradation in human meniscus.",

We also evaluated the eventual alterations of hormone production such as growth hormone (GH), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) that control and regulate growth, metabolism and efficiency of the skeletal muscle. Our results showed a strong decrease of 5-HT, GH, TSH, T3 and T4 levels associated to a clear difference in body weight between experimental and control rats. Moreover, the muscle samples of experimental rats showed histological and ultrastructural alterations. These findings thus supported a strong link between l-Trp, serotonergic system, hormone secretion and morphology of skeletal muscle tissue and thus, the importance of a balanced daily diet.",

To better understand the roles of the two parts in development, homeostasis, wound repair and regeneration of eccrine sweat glands, we must distinguish between them. In this study, the localization of keratins and alpha-SMA in human eccrine sweat glands was examined by immunofluorescence staining. Based on the differential localization of keratins and alpha-SMA in different cell types, four pairs of antibodies (K5/K7, K5/alpha-SMA, K14/K7 and K14/alpha-SMA) were used to differentiate secretory coils from ducts by double-immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence staining showed that myoepithelial cells of secretory coils expressed K5, K14 and alpha-SMA, whereas secretory cells of secretory coils expressed K7, K8, K15, K18 and K19. Ductal cells expressed K5, K8, K14 and K19. Double-staining showed that the secretory coils were K5+/K7+, K5+/alpha-SMA+, K14+/K7+ and K14+/alpha-SMA+, whereas ducts were K5+/K7\u2212, K5+/alpha-SMA\u2212, K14+/K7\u2212 and K14+/alpha-SMA\u2212. In conclusion, by combining use of keratins and alpha-SMA antibodies, secretory coils can be easily differentiated from ducts in morphology.",

     "abstract": "Tissue engineering has special interest in bone tissue aiming at future medical applications Studies have focused on recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and natural latex proteins due to the osteogenic properties of rhBMP-2 and the angiogenic characteristic of fraction 1 protein (P-1) extracted from the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis. Furthermore, heterologous fibrin sealant (FS) has been shown as a promising alternative in regenerative therapies. The aim of this study was to evaluate these substances for the repair of bone defects in rats. A bone defect measuring 3\u00a0mm in diameter was created in the proximal metaphysis of the left tibia of 60 rats and was implanted with rhBMP-2 or P-1 in combination with a new heterologous FS derived from snake venom. The animals were divided into six groups: control (unfilled bone defect), rhBMP-2 (defect filled with 5\u00a0\u03bcg rhBMP-2), P-1 (defect filled with 5\u00a0\u03bcg P-1), FS (defect filled with 8\u00a0\u03bcg FS), FS/rhBMP-2 (defect filled with 8\u00a0\u03bcg FS and 5\u00a0\u03bcg rhBMP-2), FS/P-1 (defect filled with 8\u00a0\u03bcg FS and 5\u00a0\u03bcg P-1). The animals were sacrificed 2 and 6 weeks after surgery. The newly formed bone projected from the margins of the original bone and exhibited trabecular morphology and a disorganized arrangement of osteocyte lacunae. Immunohistochemical analysis showed intense expression of osteocalcin in all groups. Histometric analysis revealed a significant difference in all groups after 2 weeks (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), except for the rhBMP-2 and FS/rhBMP-2 groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). A statistically significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was observed in all groups after 6 weeks in relation to the volume of newly formed bone in the surgical area. In conclusion, the new heterologous fibrin sealant was found to be biocompatible and the combination with rhBMP-2 showed the highest osteogenic and osteoconductive capacity for bone healing. These findings suggest a promising application of this combination in the regeneration surgery.",

Although multiple analyses have investigated the function of SR-B1 in the liver, adrenal and ovary, its expression in rat ovary and uterus during the estrous cycle is lacking. In the present study, real-time PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate SR-B1 expression in the rat ovary and uterus during the estrous cycle. The results demonstrated that ovarian SR-B1 expression was in a stage-dependent manner, continuously increased from proestrus and kept elevated during metoestrus, while uterine SR-B1 expression decreased from proestrus to diestrus. To determine whether ovarian and uterine SR-B1 expression were affected by sex steroid hormones, immature rats were treated with 17 \u03b2-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), or their antagonists from postnatal days 24\u201326. Results showed that the levels of SR-B1 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated by E2 in both the ovary and uterus. IHC results showed that SR-B1 was primarily localized in the oocytes, theca internal cells (T-I) of follicles, interstitial cells (IC) as well as corpus luteum (CL), but not granulosa cells (GC) in the ovary during the estrous cycle. Uterine SR-B1 was highly expressed in the endometrial luminal epithelial cells (LEC) and glandular epithelial cells (GEC) as well as in the circular muscle (CM) cells, and weak staining in stromal cells (SC) through estrous cycle. Taken together, SR-B1 expression in the ovary and uterus across the estrous cycle demonstrate that SR-B1 may be involved in uterine function, follicular development as well as luteal function.",

This latter was chosen as species of reference because the monogastric herbivore shows intense salivation during their masticatory activity.Tissue samples were collected from four adult donkeys, of both sexes, following slaughter. Samples were fixed, embedded in paraffin, and processed for immunohistochemical analysis using primary antibodies directed against leptin and its receptor. Controls for non-specific staining were always included.Leptin and its receptor were found in the minor salivary glands. Their distribution was similar to that described in the major salivary glands of animal species that have been investigated to date.

In rats, fetal\u2013placental exposure to maternally administered glucocorticoids decreases birth weight and placental weight. Proper placental development depends on the proliferation and differentiation of trophoblasts. Our knowledge about the mitotic regulators that play key roles in synchronizing these events is limited. Also the mechanisms underlying the placental growth inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunolocalization, mRNA and protein levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclin D3, p27 and p57 in normal and dexamethasone-induced IUGR Wistar rat placentas by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and Western blot. We also compared apoptotic cell numbers at the light microscopic level via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling (TUNEL) and transmission electron microscopy. Glucocorticoid levels were higher in IUGR rats than in control rats after 60 and 120\u00a0min of injection. We showed reduced gene and protein expressions of PCNA and cyclin D3 and increased expressions of p27 and p57 in IUGR placentas compared to control placentas. Apoptotic cell number was higher in the placentas of the IUGR group. In brief we found that maternal dexamethasone treatment led to a shift from cell proliferation to apoptosis in IUGR placentas. Dexamethasone induced placental and embryonal abnormalities which could be associated with reduced expressions of PCNA and cyclin D3, increased expressions of p27 and p57 and increased rate of apoptosis in IUGR placentas.",

     "abstract": "Previous reports have indicated that exogenous bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has a neuroprotective effect after cerebral ischemia injury and promotes motor function recovery, but the appropriate BMP-7 concentration and time course are unclear. Here, we assessed endogenous BMP-7 expression in hypoxia and ischemia-damaged brain tissues and investigated the effects of different BMP-7 concentrations in pre- and post-hypoxic primary rat neurons. The results showed that BMP-7 expression was significantly higher in the ischemic hemisphere. The expressions of BMP-7 and caspase-3 were localized in the cytoplasm of the primary cerebral cortical and caudate\u2013putamen neurons 24\u00a0h after hypoxia/reoxygenation. After BMP-7 treatment, the number of caspase-3 positive neurons began to decrease with increasing BMP-7 concentrations up to 80\u00a0ng/ml, but not beyond. Although the numbers of caspase-3-positive neurons between pre- and post-hypoxia/reoxygenation were not significantly different, more dendrites were observed in the groups treated prior to hypoxia/reoxygenation. These results suggest that increased BMP-7 expression can be induced in the cerebral cortex and caudate\u2013putamen both in vivo and in vitro in hypoxic-ischemic states. The neuroprotective mechanism of BMP-7 may include apoptosis suppression, and its effect was enhanced from 40 to 80\u00a0ng/ml. Pre-hypoxic BMP-7 treatment may be useful to stimulate dendrite sprouting in non-injured neurons.",

In the present study, using an immunohistochemical approach, we have shown that cortical stab injury (CSI) in adult Wistar rats significantly affects temporal pattern of expression of neurofilament proteins (NFs), a major cytoskeleton components of neurons, and microtubule-associated proteins (MAP2). At 3 days post-injury (dpi) most of the NFs immunoreactivity was found in pyknotic neurons and in fragmentized axonal processes in the perilesioned cortex. These cytoskeletal alterations became more pronounced by 10\u00a0dpi. At the subcellular level CSI also showed significant impact on NFs and MAP-2 expression. Thus, at 3\u00a0dpi most of the dendrites disappeared, while large neuronal somata appeared like open circles pointing to membrane disintegration. Conversely, at 10\u00a0dpi neuronal perikarya and a few new apical dendrites were strongly labeled. Since aberrant NF phosphorylation is a pathological hallmark of many human neurodegenerative disorders, as well as is found after stressor stimuli, the present results shed light into the expression of neurofilaments after the stab brain injury.",

This study indicated that the reduction of estrogen levels led to a decrease of both ER \u03b1 and ER \u03b2 resulting in a decline in muscle mass and PV levels. The decrease of PV levels affected muscle performance, whereas estrogen replacement increased both the ER \u03b1 and ER \u03b2.

Results showed strong PI signals detected as patterns of granules in the neuronal cytoplasm of all nervous tissues, whereas the staining of neuronal nuclei was weaker.

Furthermore, the PI positive granules in neuronal cytoplasm co-localized with Nissl bodies stained by the fluorescent Nissl stain. When the tissue was pretreated with DNase, PI only stained the cytoplasmic granules of neurons, but not that of glial cells.

A prolonged significant increase in the myeloperoxidase-positive cells and intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers in the flaxseed\u00a0+\u00a0lactobacilli group was detected. In contrast, the number of CD163-positive cells in the flaxseed\u00a0+\u00a0lactobacilli group was significantly lower on the day of weaning (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and 3 days after (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The same effect was observed in the group with lactobacilli alone during the first 3 days after weaning (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively) and these findings indicate down-regulation of CD163 expression in the jejunal mucosa by lactobacilli. The presence of lactobacilli in the diet had a stimulatory effect on goblet cell quantity in the epithelium (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a distinct 50% reduction in the flaxseed group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared with the basal diet was observed on the weaning day. A significant increase in myeloperoxidase-positive cell number in the jejunal mucosa in the flaxseed\u00a0+\u00a0lactobacilli group was the only significant difference (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively) found 21 days after weaning in comparison with all the other groups, indicating the pro-inflammatory effect of this feed additive combination. We conclude that dietary supplementation with flaxseed and lactobacilli on the cells of local innate immunity response in the jejunal mucosa in piglets after weaning might be linked with significant anti-inflammatory effects in the jejunal mucosa.",

However, in the mud crab, Scylla olivacea, the distributions of 5-HT and DA in the CNS have not yet been investigated. The aim of our study was to map the distributions of these two neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS) of the female of this crab during the late stage of ovarian development. We found 5-HT immunoreactivity (-ir) and DA-ir in many parts of the CNS, including the eyestalk, brain, and thoracic ganglia. In the eyestalk, 5-HT-ir was localized in the medulla terminalis (MT), hemi-ellipsoid body (HB), and protocerebral tract (PT), whereas DA-ir was present in neuronal cluster 1, the LG neuropils, and PT. In the brain, 5-HT-ir and DA-ir were detected in cells and fibers of neuronal clusters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15. In the ventral nerve cord, 5-HT-ir was present in neurons of the abdominal ganglia, whereas DA was only present in fibers. These spatial distributions of 5-HT and DA suggest that they may be involved in the neuromodulation of important physiological functions, including ovarian maturation, as shown in other non-crab decapods.",

     "abstract": "Gastrin is a gastrointestinal hormone secreted by G cells. Hypergastrinemia can improve blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels. These positive effects are primarily due to the trophic effects of gastrin on \u03b2-cells. In recent years, many receptors that regulate secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) have been identified in enteroendocrine L cell lines. This led us to hypothesize that, in addition to the trophic effects of gastrin on \u03b2-cells, L cells also express cholecystokinin2-receptor (CCK2R), which may regulate GLP-1 secretion and have synergistic effects on glucose homeostasis. Our research provides a preliminary analysis of CCK2R expression and the stimulating effect of gastrin treatment on GLP-1 secretion in a human endocrine L cell line, using RT-PCR, Western blot, immunocytochemistry, and ELISA analyses. The expression of proglucagon and prohormone convertase 3, which regulate GLP-1 biosynthesis, were also analyzed by real-time PCR. Double immunofluorescence labeling was utilized to assess the intracellular localization of CCK2R and GLP-1 in L cells harvested from rat colon tissue. Our results showed that CCK2R was expressed in both the human L cell line and the rat L cells. We also showed that treatment with gastrin, a CCK2R agonist, stimulated the secretion of GLP-1, and that this effect was likely due to increased expression of proglucagon and PCSK1 (also known as prohormone convertase 3 (PC3 gene)). These results not only provide a basis for the role gastrin may play in intestinal L cells, and may also provide the basis for the development of a method of gastrin-mediated glycemic regulation.",

A sequential PMSG/hCG treatment paradigm was used to obtain a single, well-defined generation of corpora lutea (CL) in rats. Rats were treated with PGF for 0\u20134\u00a0h on day 7 of pseudopregnancy. Results showed that serum progesterone (P4) concentrations declined in a time dependent manner. Western blot results revealed that ATF3 increased within 2\u00a0h post-PGF injection. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK) and JNK (p-JNK) increased within 30\u00a0min and then were gradually reduced in response to PGF. In contrast, the levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38) were not significantly altered. The immunostaining density for p-ERK decreased from the periphery to the center of the corpus luteum following treatment with PGF, while ATF3 was expressed uniformly in the nuclei of luteal steroidogenic cells. These results indicated that treatment with PGF in vivo could induce increases in MAPK phosphorylation, especially in p-ERK, which might be correlated with the increases in ATF3 expression and the decline in P4 concentrations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence for temporal relationships between MAPK activation and ATF3 expression during PGF-induced luteal regression in the rat.",

     "abstract": "Tripeptidyl aminopeptidase I (TPP I) is a lysosomal exopeptidase that is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and internal organs in many mammalian species. The enzyme is involved in the breakdown of collagen and different peptides. The carotid body (CB) is the main peripheral arterial chemoreceptor playing an important role in the control of breathing and the autonomic control of cardiovascular function. In response to hypoxia its neuron-like glomus cells release a variety of peptide transmitters that trigger an action potential through the afferent fibers, thus conveying the chemosensory information to the CNS. In the present study we investigated the histochemical localization of TPP I in the CB of rats. Enzyme histochemistry showed high activity of TPP I in CB glomeruli. In particular, the glomus cells contained many TPP I-positive granules, while the glial-like sustentacular cells displayed a slightly fainter reaction. The interglomerular connective tissue was also weakly stained. The results show that both the parenchymal cells of the rat CB express, albeit with different intensity, TPP I. Taken together with our previous enzyme histochemical investigations on the rat CB, it seems likely that the glomus cells possess enzymatic equipment necessary for the neuropeptide intracellular and collagen extracellular initial degradation. These findings also suggest that TPP I is involved in the general turnover of chemotransmitters between glomus cells and sensory nerve endings which emphasizes its importance for chemoreception under hypoxic conditions.",

Our research group has studied in a new proposed rodent model the participation of cellular and molecular components in the prostate microenvironment that contributes to cancer progression. Our group adopted the gerbil Meriones unguiculatus as an alternative experimental model for prostate cancer study. This model has presented significant responses to hormonal treatments and to development of spontaneous and induced neoplasias. The data obtained indicate reorganization of type I collagen fibers and reticular fibers, synthesis of new components such as tenascin and proteoglycans, degradation of basement membrane components and elastic fibers and increased expression of metalloproteinases. Fibroblasts that border the region, apparently participate in the stromal reaction. The roles of each of these events, as well as some signaling molecules, participants of neoplastic progression and factors that promote genetic reprogramming during epithelial\u2013stromal transition are also discussed.",

Morphometric software was used to determine the area of blood and lymphatic vessels (BVA and LVA) and also the VEGF positive area. Statistical analysis of these parameters confirmed a significant enlargement of both the blood and lymphatic microcirculatory beds in psoriatic and CLP lesions. BVA in CLP lesions was increased by 56% however this augmentation was not as great as in psoriatic lesions where BVA was increased by 123%. Interestingly, LVA in psoriatic and CLP lesions was increased equally by 85%. The strongest VEGF expression was detected in psoriatic lesions, with lower, but still significant, overexpression in CLP lesions. VEGF-C was significantly increased in both psoriatic and CLP lesions in comparable level. Noticeably higher VEGF and VEGF-C expression was observed in the epidermis than in the dermis. Finally, our results indicate that the level of angiogenesis is considerably greater in psoriatic lesions than in CLP lesions, but the level of lymphangiogenesis is equal in both psoriatic and CLP lesions.",

Nevertheless further investigations are needed to deepen our understanding of pathogenic pathways involving oxidative and nitrative damage. Our aim is to deepen the understanding of the biological effects on A549 cells of these materials regarding DNA damage related proteins (p53, its isoform p73 and TRAIL) and nitric oxide (NO) production during inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated inflammation. Increments of p53/p73 expression, iNOS positive cells and NO concentrations were found with RCA, compared to HT-CA and controls mainly at 48\u00a0h. Interestingly, ferrous iron causing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated DNA damage was found in RCA as a contaminant.HT-CA thermal treatment induces a global recrystallization with iron in a crystal form poorly released in media. HT-CA slightly interferes with genome expression and exerts lower inflammatory potential compared to RCA on biological systems. It could represent a safe approach for storing or recycling asbestos and an environmentally friendly alternative to asbestos waste.",

We detected neuronal hyperactivity through the expression of the glutamate-induced c-fos protein, by means of immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in the vermis and in the hemispheres. Generalized seizures were induced by means of intraperitoneal 4-aminopyridine injections. Following the 4-aminopyridine seizures, the c-fos expression of cerebellar granule cells was significantly elevated at 1.5\u00a0h in every lobule. Maximum c-fos expression was seen at 3\u00a0h. The role of the ponto-cerebellar mossy fiber afferents in the induction of c-fos expression was examined after the transection of the middle cerebellar peduncle on the left side. Immunohistochemical analysis 14 days after the surgery revealed that the synapsin I immunoreactivity was significantly reduced in the cerebellar cortex on the operated side, compared to the sham-operated controls and to the non-operated cerebellar hemisphere of the operated animals, indicating the degeneration of mossy fiber terminals. Transection of the middle cerebellar peduncle suppressed cerebellar c-fos expression in the vermis and in the hemispheres significantly.

Immunohistochemistry revealed weak Dab-2 immunostaining in some neurons, glial cells, and ependymal cells in the spinal cords of the control animals, compared to staining in the macrophages and reactive astrocytes in lesions of the SCI animals.

In birds, cyclooxygenases have been studied in very few species only. In this study we report on the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in the ovary of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) using immunohistochemistry and non-radioactive in situ hybridization techniques. Our results demonstrate that COX-1 is strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of oocytes of previtellogenic follicles, whereas COX-2 shows the strongest immunostaining in the granulosa cells of previtellogenic follicles. The signals of both isoenzymes fade significantly with increasing diameter and finally nearly vanish in the vitellogenic follicles with a size >1.8\u00a0cm. This expression pattern in the ostrich (S. camelus) is, therefore, completely different from the localization of COX-1 and COX-2 in the hen (Gallus gallus), a finding which also suggests different functions of the cyclooxygenases in the ostrich species. Non-radioactive in situ hybridization confirmed that COX-1 is synthesized in the ooplasm and COX-2 in the granulosa layers of early previtellogenic follicles. According to the results of this study it appears unlikely that COX-1 or COX-2 play a major role in ovulation and oviposition in the ostrich.",

Combinations of the two molecules differentially marked several types of SMG epithelial cells, including acinar cells (CD66a-intense, CD117-negative), intercalated duct cells (CD66a-intense, CD117-positive), a subset of the striated and excretory duct cells (CD66a-weak, CD117-positive). Most of the CD117-positive ductal cells were negative for cytokeratin 5 and overlapped with the NKCC1-expressing cells. The CD117- and keratin 5-positive cells resided only in the excretory duct were suggested to correspond to the recently identified salivary stem cells. CD66a and CD117 may be useful markers to isolate several cell types consisting of SMG epithelium and to analyze their molecular and cellular nature. Our data also suggest that CD117-expressing epithelial cells of the gland include at least two distinct populations of the stem/progenitor cells.",

Experiments were performed in Hyal1\u2212/\u2212 and Hyal2\u2212/\u2212 mice and in their wild-type controls. HA concentration was measured in the plasma and kidney tissue and its distribution through the different kidney zones was examined by immunohistochemistry. Relative mRNA expressions of HYAL1, HYAL2 and the 3 main HA synthases were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR.Kidney function was not impaired in the knockout mice but they displayed elevated HA concentrations in the plasma and in the kidney. Hyal1\u2212/\u2212 mice presented an accumulation of HA inside the proximal tubular cells whereas Hyal2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed HA accumulation in the interstitial space. In the cortex and in the outer medulla, HYAL1 mRNA expression was up-regulated in Hyal2\u2212/\u2212 mice. From our study we conclude that somatic hyaluronidases are not required for renal function. However, HYAL1 is necessary for the breakdown of intracellular HA in the cortex, whereas HYAL2 is essential for the degradation of extracellular HA in all kidney regions.",

Based on the need for the involvement of phagocytic cells to achieve apoptosis clearance and that follicular atresia is triggered by weak apoptotic stimuli, we postulate that granulosa cells engullng apoptotic corpses (ACs) must carry out this macrophagic process. Since apoptosis was early defined in terms of morphological aspects, here we describe apoptosis induced by a GnRH analog (leuprolide acetate, LA) at histological level on bovine granulosa cells (primary culture, CPGB, and an established cell line, BGC-1). We observed two main types of apoptosis. In type A, the whole cell or most of it is compacted into a single large AC that is then engulfed by neighboring cells or simply detached. In type B, small portions of cells, either with or without nuclear material, become ACs that are also phagocytosed. Apoptosis and homologous phagocytosis were confirmed by TUNEL and immunocytochemistry for Bax and active caspase 3. Induction of apoptosis was significant in BGC-1 cells treated for 24\u00a0h with 100\u00a0nM LA. CPGB cells showed two types of response with different doses of LA. Fetal calf serum was necessary to find apoptosis induced by LA.",

Non-fertile oocytes can lead to time-dependent processes of aging, which will affect the results of human spermatozoa examination. As a consequence there is a need to investigate the aging and anti-aging processes of golden hamster oocytes. In order to study the aging processes and parthenogenetic activation of golden hamster oocytes, in vivo oocytes, oocytes cultured with or without cumulus cells, and oocytes treated with Trichostatin A (TSA) or caffeine were collected and investigated. We found that: (1) spontaneous parthenogenetic activation, developmental potential (cleavage rate), and zona pellucida (ZP) hardening undergo age-dependent changes in in vivo, in vitro, and after TSA or caffeine treatment; (2) in vivo, oocytes became spontaneously parthenogenetic 25\u00a0h post-hCG treatment; (3) in vitro, cumulus cells did not significantly increase the parthenogenetic activation rate of cultured hamster oocytes; and (4) TSA or caffeine could delay spontaneous oocyte parthenogenetic activation and the aging processes by at least 5\u00a0h, but also accelerated the hardening of the ZP. These results define the conditions for the aging and anti-aging processes in golden hamster oocytes. TSA and caffeine play roles in controlling spontaneous activation, which could facilitate the storage and use of golden hamster oocytes for studying processes relevant to human reproduction.",

Other variants of multipolar mitosis show even more mitotic poles and are relatively rare. In nature, this phenomenon was frequently observed or suspected in multiple common cancers, infected cells, the placenta, and in early human embryos with impaired pregnancy-yielding potential. Artificial causes include radiation and various toxins. Here we combine several pieces of the most recent evidence for the existence of different types of multipolar mitosis in preimplantation embryos together with a detailed review of the literature. The related molecular and cellular mechanisms are discussed, including the regulation of centriole duplication, mitotic spindle biology, centromere functions, cell cycle checkpoints, mitotic autocorrection mechanisms, and the related complicating factors in healthy and affected cells, including post-mitotic cell\u2013cell fusion often associated with multipolar cell division. Clinical relevance for oncology and embryo selection in assisted reproduction is also briefly discussed in this context.",

The expressions of carbonic anhydrase III (CAIII), fatty acid synthase (FAS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) were assessed by proteomics and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions. The liver redox status was examined by measuring the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), as well as protein carbonylation. Because oxidative stress can result in apoptosis, the activity and content of caspase-3, as well as the x-linked inhibitor of the apoptosis protein (XIAP) and mitochondrial caspase-independent apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) contents were assessed. In addition, the liver histomorphology was examined. Compared to the controls fed a normal complete diet throughout, feeding with 3PFD-CD increased the FAS content, decreased the CAIII content, decreased both the SOD and CAT activities, and increased protein carbonylation. It also activated caspase-3, decreased the XIAP content, decreased the AIF content, increased the number of GSTP1-positive foci and caspase-3-positive cells, and caused fatty livers. Conversely, the changes were lessened to varying degrees in mice fed 3PFD\u00a0+\u00a0Met-CD. The present results indicate that a regular Met supply lessens the biochemical changes, damage, and caspase-dependent apoptosis provoked by recurrent dietary amino acid deprivation in the mouse liver.",

Animals were sacrificed at scheduled times after EGCG administration and then quantitative and qualitative analysis were performed. Compared with the control group, the STZ group showed an increase in levels of blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and urine protein amounts with a decrease in body weight. All the above parameters were significantly reversed with EGCG treatment, especially in the EGCG100 group. After STZ injection, there was a mesangial proliferation with increased renal osteopontin accumulation and its protein expression in the glomeruli and the proximal tubules. Mice kidneys after EGCG-treatment showed a reduced expression of above parameters and relatively improved histopathological findings.

Our aim was analyze the adaptation ability of rehabilitated muscular tissue in rats during different periods of eccentric training after 10 days of limb immobilization. Twenty-seven Wistar rats were divided into six groups: immobilized 10 days, immobilized and eccentric trained for 10 days, immobilized and eccentric trained for 21 days, and three age-matched control groups. After sacrifice, soleus and plantaris muscles were frozen, cut and stained for general histology using hematoxylin and eosin and Gomori trichrome methods and immunohistochemical methods for fiber typing (mATPase, NADH2-TR), for capillaries (CD31) and intermediate filaments (desmin, vimentin) and high resolution microscopy of resin embedded material. Immobilization resulted in more intense morphological alterations in soleus muscles such as formation of target fibers, nuclear centralization, a reduction in the number of type I fibers, diameter of type I, IIA, IIAD fibers, and capillaries. After 10 days of eccentric training, increases in the nuclear centralization and the number of lobulated fibers were observed. This period was insufficient to reestablish the capillary/fiber (C/F) ratio and distribution of fiber types as that observed in the control group. However, 21 days of rehabilitation allowed the reversal of all morphological and quantitative abnormalities. For the plantaris muscles, 10-days of training restored their basic characteristics. Despite the fact that immobilization affected soleus and plantaris muscles, 10 days of eccentric training was insufficient to restore the morphological characteristics of soleus muscles, which was not the case observed in plantaris muscle.",

Our previous study found that RGMb was expressed in the reproductive axis, but whether RGMb expression in reproductive organs changes across the estrous cycle remains unknown. Here, we show in the rat that RGMb mRNA expression in the uterus was significantly higher during metesterus and diestrus than during proestrus and estrus. Western blotting indicated that RGMb protein was significantly lower during estrus compared with the other three stages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that RGMb protein was mainly localized to the uterine luminal and glandular epithelial cells of the endometrium. RGMb mRNA and protein in the ovary remained unchanged during the estrous cycle. RGMb protein was expressed in the oocytes of all follicles. Weak staining for RGMb protein was also found in corpora lutea. RGMb was not detected in granulosa cells and stromal cells.

     "abstract": "Leptin is a polypeptide secreted by adipocytes which binds to a specific receptor (Ob-R) that is expressed in various tissues. The wide distribution of the Ob-R suggests that leptin might exert diverse biological functions, not only by regulating energy metabolism and appetite, but also by acting as a mitogen in many cell types, including keratinocytes.In this study, the presence and localization of Ob-R was investigated in the skin of the dog using RT-PCR and immunohistochemical techniques. RT-PCR revealed the presence of Ob-R m-RNA in the skin specimens collected from the dorsal region of two smooth coat breed dogs. Through immunohistochemistry performed on the skin of five dogs, the expression of the receptor was observed in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the hair follicles as well as in the apocrine sweat and sebaceous glands. No staining for Ob-R was detected in the suprabasal epidermis layers. Strong positive signals were observed in many cells of the outer root sheath of hair follicles in growing and in regressive phases. The identification of Ob-R in the above targets suggests that leptin may play a role in the regulation of cyclic renewal of the epidermis and skin appendages in dog. This study represents an important contribution to understand the complex mechanisms that are involved in the skin biology in this species.",

The tripeptides PSL and KRR do not fit the major PTS1 consensus but cause green fluorescent protein to accumulate in peroxisomes of stably transformed Arabidopsis.

Nitric oxide (NO) is a tiny, highly reactive lipophilic molecule produced by nitric oxide synthases (NOS). Three isoforms of NOS (neuronal NOS, inducible NOS and endothelial NOS) have been identified. Our aim was to investigate the effect of water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) on NOS in the testis, and the effect of Big-leaf mulberry to protect against WIRS. The activity and expression of NOS, and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the mouse testis of different treatment groups (non-WIRS, 3 h-WIRS, WIRS-recovery) were examined. Histological analysis of WIRS-induced testicular damage and immunohistochemical staining of NOS were also analyzed. Results demonstrated that WIRS-exposed mice produced several injuries and showed an increased iNOS and eNOS mRNA expression in testes, whereas pretreatment with Big-leaf mulberry down-regulated iNOS and eNOS mRNA expressions and up-regulated T-AOC activities. Immunohistochemical studies showed that both iNOS and eNOS were localized in germ cells, spermatozoa and blood vessels in addition to Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, but nNOS was not present in these areas. In conclusion, our results suggested that Big-leaf mulberry exerted a protective effect on WIRS-induced testicular dysfunction, and iNOS and eNOS appeared to exert an important action in mouse testes exposed to WIRS.",

The SCI model was induced by a heavy object falling. At 30\u00a0min after the SCI was successfully induced, the animals were intraperitoneally given 40\u00a0mg/kg curcumin. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan scores showed that curcumin moderately improved the recovery of the motor function in the injured rats, and hematoxylin\u2013eosin staining demonstrated the role of this compound in reducing the hemorrhage, edema and neutrophil infiltration of the traumatic spinal cord. Furthermore, curcumin also inhibited the SCI-associated aquaporin \u2013 4 (AQP4) overexpression and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and repressed the unusual activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that curcumin exhibits a moderately protective effect on spinal cord injury, and this effect might be related to the inhibition of overexpressed AQP4 and GFAP and the activated JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

Western blotting analysis found that compared with the controls, the levels of ERK1 and ERK2 proteins were relatively unchanged in fluoride-exposed fish, while p-ERK1 and p-ERK2 protein levels decreased significantly with the increased fluoride concentrations. The immunohistochemical analysis found the proteins of ERK and p-ERK were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the renal tubules of C. carpio. Compared with the control group, the levels of ERK protein were relatively constant, yet the levels of p-ERK protein and p-ERK/ERK ratio were reduced with fluoride exposure dose. These findings indicate that the renal damage in carp exposed to fluoride is mediated via the ERK pathway.

     "abstract": "Congestive heart failure is often associated with impaired kidney function. Over-activation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) contributes to avid salt and water retention in heart failure. While the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in the synthesis of angiotensin II (Ang II), is well established, the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), an enzyme responsible for angiotensin 1\u20137 generation, is largely unknown. This issue is of a special interest since angiotensin 1\u20137 counteracts many of the proliferative and hypertensive effects of angiotensin II. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the expression of both enzymes in the kidney and heart of rats with heart failure. Heart failure (CHF) was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a09) by the creation of a surgical aorto-caval fistula. Sham-operated rats served as controls (n\u00a0=\u00a08). Two weeks after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and their hearts and kidneys were harvested for assessment of cardiac remodeling and ACE and ACE-2 immunoreactivity by immunohistochemical staining. ACE immunostaining was significantly increased in the kidneys (4.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39% vs. 2.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and hearts (4.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54% vs. 2.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of CHF rats as compared with their sham controls.

This study showed that both ACE and ACE-2 are overexpressed in the cardiac and renal tissues of animals with heart failure as compared with their sham controls. The increased expression of the beneficial ACE-2 in heart failure may serve as a compensatory response to the over-activity of the deleterious isoform, namely, angiotensin converting enzyme 1(ACE-1).",

In this study we aimed to evaluate the expression and localization of cyclin D1 in arsenic trioxide (ATO) treated Jurkat cells (lymphoblastic leukemia cell line) and to correlate these results with the extent of cell death and/or cell cycle alterations. Jurkat cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of ATO (0.2, 0.6 and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h in standard cell culture conditions. To reach our goal we performed annexin V/PI labeling for detection of cell death and RNase/PI labeling for evaluation of cell cycle distribution, which were followed by the respective flow cytometric analyses of ATO-treated Jurkat cells. Transmission electron microscopy was applied for visualization of the cell ultrastructure. For cyclin D1 estimation a biparametric cyclinD1/cell cycle assay was done and localization of the protein was shown after immuno-labeling using light microscopy (ABC procedure) and confocal fluorescence microscopy. We found that there were no significant changes in the percentages of cyclin D1-positive cells after the treatment with ATO, but at the same time mean fluorescence intensity reflecting cyclin D1 content was gradually increasing along with the cell cycle progression, irrespective of the applied dose of the drug. On the other hand, we found a nuclear-cytoplasmic shift of this protein as a major treatment-related response, which was in good accord with an increased rate of cell death and suggested that cyclin D1 cytoplasmic degradation is an important determinant of the therapeutic efficiency of ATO in the Jurkat cell line.",

Additionally, differences and similarities between pure elastin and collagen bundles (CB) were investigated by Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy. Although elastin exhibited a faint birefringence, the elastin\u2013collagen complex aggregates formed in solution exhibited a deep birefringence and formation of an ordered-supramolecular complex typical of collagen chiral structure. The FT-IR study revealed elastin and CB peptide NH groups involved in different types of H-bonding. More energy is absorbed in the vibrational transitions corresponding to CH, CH2 and CH3 groups (probably associated with the hydrophobicity demonstrated by 8-anilino-1-naphtalene sulfonic acid sodium salt [ANS] fluorescence), and to \u03bdCN, \u03b4NH and \u03c9CH2 groups of elastin compared to CB. It is assumed that the \u03b1-helix contribution to the pure elastin amide I profile is 46.8%, whereas that of the B-sheet is 20% and that unordered structures contribute to the remaining percentage.

Both the processes of cell migration and anchorage to the substrate are essential for the development of metastasis. These processes occur by rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton, regulated by Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK-1). The degradation of the extracellular matrix, influenced by metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) also exerts greater cell invasiveness. The present study evaluated the ROCK-1 and MMP-9 proteins using an immunohistochemical method through the selection of invasive ductal breast carcinoma. The protein expression was correlated to clinicopathological parameters and overall survival of the patients. High expression of the ROCK-1 protein was correlated statistically to the status of lymph nodes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and showed variable expression in different clinical stages of the tumor. MMP-9 showed a strong immunostaining in patients with metastasis that had died, whereas there was no marker in normal breast tissues. In addition, 46.6% of patients classified as poor prognosis showed high expression of ROCK-1 and MMP-9 protein and another 40.0% just showed high expression of MMP-9.

     "abstract": "Cholinergic innervation of the rat adrenal gland has been analyzed previously using cholinergic markers including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). In the present study, we demonstrate putative cholinergic neurons in the rat adrenal gland using an antibody to pChAT, which is the product of a splice variant of ChAT mRNA that is preferentially localized in peripheral cholinergic nerves. Most of the ganglionic neurons as well as small single sporadic neurons in the adrenal gland were stained intensely for pChAT. The density of pChAT-immunoreactive (IR) fibers was distinct in the adrenal cortex and medulla. AChE-, cChAT- and VAChT-immunoreactivities were also observed in some cells and fibers of the adrenal medulla, while the cortex had few positive nerve fibers. These results indicate that ganglionic neurons of the adrenal medulla and nerve fibers heterogeneously express cholinergic markers, especially pChAT. Furthermore, the innervation of the adrenal gland, cortex and medulla, by some cholinergic fibers provides additional morphological evidence for a significant role of cholinergic mechanisms in adrenal gland functions.",

The indirect immunohistochemical method was used for localization of monitored proteins. A total of 135 tissue samples of NSCLC were characterized according to histopathological type of tumor. Next, we compared our results with basic clinicopathological parameters (histopathological type of tumor, tumor grade and TNM stage of disease). In MRP1 and GSTp1 positive tumor cells, strong brown cytoplasmic immunostaining was visible. In our set of samples 71% showed MRP1 positivity, while according to histopathological type the squamous cell carcinoma reached the highest level of positivity (76%). Our GSTp1 results showed that similarly to MRP1, 70% of samples were GSTp1 positive. According to histopathological type the adenocarcinoma samples showed the highest GSTp1 expression (77%). For precise statistical evaluation the Kruskal\u2013Wallis, Chi-square and Mann\u2013Whitney tests were used. We did not find any statistically significant correlations between MRP1 and clinicopathological parameters. In the group of GSTp1, by Mann\u2013Whitney test we found a statistically significant correlation between GSTp1 and histological grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025) in adenocarcinoma samples. As this was only one group of statistically significant correlation we wanted to confirm this finding. For this we applied also Chi-square test which revealed no statistically significant dependence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.077). No statistically significant relation was seen in the coexpression of both proteins (p\u00a0=\u00a00.753). Despite this, the majority of samples simultaneously expressed MRP1 and GSTp1 proteins. In conclusion, our results show that MRP1 and GSTp1 proteins represent independent prognostic features in NSCLC. Nevertheless, the clinical outcome in individual patients is often difficult to predict. Identification of the factors that characterize the resistant cases would permit immediate treatment of the patients with alternative therapeutic approaches.",

For this purpose, the expression of some chondrocyte markers, such as collagen type I, collagen type II, RUNX2 and lubricin was investigated at different times (7, 14, 21 and 28 days) of chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, by using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. The second aim of the study was to demonstrate that the expression of lubricin, such as the expression of collagen type II, could be a possible biomarker for the detection of chondrocytes well-being and viability in the natural self-assembling constructs, called \u2018cell pellets\u2019. Histology (hematoxylin and eosin) and histochemistry (alcian blue staining) methods were used to assess the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. The results showed that after 21 days the differentiated chondrocytes, when compared with MSCs cultured without chondrogenic medium (CD44, CD90 and CD105 positive; CD45, CD14 and CD34 negative), were able to produce significant quantities of collagen type I, collagen type II, and lubricin, suggesting hyaline cartilage formation. During the differentiation phase, the cells showed a reduced expression of RUNX2, a protein expressed by osteoblasts. Our studies demonstrated that 21 days is the optimum time for the implantation of chondrocytes differentiated from adipose tissue-derived MSCs. This information could be useful for the future development of cell-based repair therapies for degenerative diseases of articular cartilage.",

The results indicated that the six types of GHs were all present in the bullfrog skin and were most predominant in the epidermis and mucous glands. In dorsal skin, the density of the GHs-IR cells in mucous glands was higher than that in epidermis except for GAS-IR cells. In ventral skin, the density of 5-HT, PP and NPY-IR cells in mucous glands was also higher than that in the epidermis. During hibernation, the density of the six types of GHs-IR cells and the IR intensity of GAS, SS, NPY and GLU-IR cells in the epidermis of dorsal skin increased significantly. The IR intensity of SS, PP and NPY-IR cells in granular glands of ventral skin also increased significantly during hibernation. These results suggested that multiple types of GHs-IR cells present in the skin of R. catesbeiana, may play important roles in the regulation of the physiological functions of skin. Also, adaptive changes in the density and IR intensity of GHs-IR cells occurred during hibernation.",

Since oncogenic c-kit may activate major pathways of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we decided to investigate this issue in the major protein phosphorylation cascades. In normal pancreas labeling with antiphosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) antibody was mainly confined to islets of Langerhans in close overlapping with insulin containing cells. Phosphorylated p38 (pp38) showed a similar pattern of distribution, while only weak labeling was evident for pJNK and no labeling of pMEK was observed. As expected, general ERK1/2 (gERK1/2), general p38 (gp38), general JNK (gJNK) as well as general MEK (gMEK) were all evident in islets of Langerhans and in the exocrine tissue. In early development of PDAC, pERK1/2 and pp38 retained their localization in islets of Langerhans. Intensive staining of pERK1/2 was also evident in the cancerous ducts, while the labeling with antibodies to pp38 was more moderate. While pJNK staining in islets of Langerhans was weak, with no labeling in the cancerous ducts, antibodies to gJNK revealed intensive staining suggesting the weak staining of pJNK is not due to the lack of the enzyme. In a more advanced stage of PDAC the carcinomas were clearly stained with pERK1/2 and pp38, while moderate staining with pJNK was also evident. In liver metastases, the cancer cells were heavily labeled with all three phospho-MAPKs. It should be noted that the localization of all three kinases was mainly in the cell nuclei. In the more advanced stage of PDAC, heavy labeling was evident using antibodies to gERK1/2, gp38, gJNK and gMEK. However, no labeling to pMEK was evident in parallel sections. Our data suggest that both in normal and cancerous pancreas, most of the MAPK activities are located in islets of Langerhans and cancerous ducts.

Previously, an ethanolic extract from Curcuma longa Linn. (CL) containing the curcumin constituent has been reported to produce antioxidant effects. However, its neuroprotective property on brain histology has remained unexplored. This study has examined the effects of a CL extract on the densities of cresyl violet positive neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive (GFAP-ir) astrocytes in the hippocampus of Dx treated male rats. It showed that 21days of Dx treatment (0.5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p. once daily) significantly reduced the densities of cresyl violet positive neurons in the sub-areas CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus, but not in the CA2 area. However, CL pretreatment (100\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) was found to significantly restore neuronal densities in the CA1 and dentate gyrus. In addition, Dx treatment also significantly decreased the densities of the GFAP-ir astrocytes in the sub-areas CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus. However, CL pretreatment (100\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) failed to protect the loss of astrocytes in these sub-areas. These findings confirm the neuroprotective effects of the CL extract and indicate that the cause of astrocyte loss might be partially reduced by a non-oxidative mechanism. Moreover, the detection of neuronal and glial densities was suitable method to study brain damage and the effects of treatment.",

The purpose of this experiment was to examine the chemopreventive effects of Pitavastatin alone and in combination with the pineal hormone melatonin in the model of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-induced mammary carcinogenesis in female Sprague-Dawley rats. Pitavastatin was administered dietary (10\u00a0mg/kg) and melatonin in an aqueous solution (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Chemoprevention began 7 days prior to carcinogen administration and subsequently continued for 15 weeks until autopsy. At autopsy, mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Compared to controls, Pitavastatin alone reduced average tumor volume by 58% and lengthened latency by 8 days; on the other hand, the drug increased tumor frequency by 23%. Combined administration of Pitavastatin with melatonin decreased tumor frequency by 23%, tumor volume by 44% and lengthened tumor latency by 5.5 days compared to control animals. The analysis of carcinoma cells showed significant increase in caspase-3 expression in both treated groups and a tendency of increased caspase-7 expression after Pitavastatin treatment alone. Significant expression decrease of Ki67 was found in carcinoma cells from both treated groups. Compared to control carcinoma cells, Pitavastatin alone increased VEGF expression by 41%, however melatonin totally reversed its undesirable effect. Pitavastatin combined with melatonin significantly increased femur compact bone thickness in animals. Pitavastatin alone decreased plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, however it significantly increased levels of glucose. In summary, our results show a partial antineoplastic effect of Pitavastatin combined with melatonin in the rat mammary gland carcinoma model.",

     "abstract": "Protein kinase CK2-alpha (CK2\u03b1), one isoform of the catalytic subunits of serine/threonine kinase CK2, has been indicated to participate in tumorigenesis of various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, in order to explore the potential role of CK2\u03b1 in human HCC, we employed short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology to inhibit the endogenous CK2\u03b1 expression in HCC cells and established a Hep G2 cell line with stable knockdown of CK2\u03b1. Results from wound healing and transwell invasion assays indicated that stable knockdown of CK2\u03b1 markedly inhibited Hep G2 cell migration and invasion as compared with those transfected with a negative control plasmid. This alteration was accompanied with expression down-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, Snail, Slug, Vimentin, and up-regulation of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin). Moreover, CK2\u03b1 silencing also induced inactivation of Hedgehog signaling pathway by inhibiting Gli1 and Patched homolog 1 (PTCH1) expressions in HCC cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that knockdown of CK2\u03b1 can suppress cell migration and invasion, reduces expression of MMPs, inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process and induces inactivation of Hedgehog pathway in HCC cells in vitro. Our study provides in vitro evidence to demonstrate that the pathogenesis of human HCC may be correlated with the high expression of CK2\u03b1.",

In addition lectins are often responsible for the binding of pathogens to cells and for cancer cell clumping that increases their escape from body defenses. It is important to define precisely the activity of inhibitors of lectin-binding that may be used in anti-infection and anti-cancer therapeutics. Here we describe a kinetic assay that measures the activity of saccharide inhibitors of lectin binding using a model system of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and lectin (Concanavalin A, Con A) derivatized agarose microbeads that mimics pathogen-cell binding. We show that old methods (part I of this study) used to identify inhibitor activity using only one sugar concentration at one time point can easily provide wrong information about inhibitor activity. We assess the activity of 4 concentrations of 10 saccharides at 4 different times in 400 trials and statistically evaluate the results. We show that d-melezitose is the best inhibitor of yeast binding to the lectin microbeads. These results, along with physical chemistry studies, provide a solid foundation for the development of drugs that may be useful in anti-infectivity and anti-cancer therapeutics.",

In the present study, the infection of A. actinomycetemcomitans in human osteoblastic MG63 cells was established. Accordingly, A. actinomycetemcomitans infection enhanced significant apoptosis of MG63 cells. We found that both expression levels of NLRP3 and ASC were increased dramatically after MG63 cell cultures exposed to A. actinomycetemcomitans. Moreover, the secretion of mature interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 were extensively induced in A. actinomycetemcomitans-infected cells as compared with non-invasion group of MG63 cell cultures, indicating the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome during infection. Finally, we found that the knockdown expression of NLRP3 by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated apoptosis of A. actinomycetemcomitans-infected MG63 cells. Our data suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans promotes apoptosis of human osteoblasts at least partially through the NLRP3 inflammasome.",

Therefore, the objective of this qualitative study was to simultaneously examine the distribution of both tenascin-C and type I collagen in ovarian follicles and corpora lutea induced to develop in response to gonadotropin treatments. In preantral follicles both matrix proteins were present in the focimatrix, theca externa and the interstitium. Equine gonadotropin induced the appearance of both proteins in the theca interna. Subsequent to administration with human chorionic gonadotropin, tenascin-C appearance in the thecal capillaries preceded type I collagen expression. Tenascin-C was also observed in the capillaries of functional and regressing corpora lutea, while type I collagen was predominantly present in the interstitium and tunica albuginea. Western blots showed both an increase in and degradation of tenascin-C in the regressing corpora lutea. The ovarian surface epithelium also showed immunoreactivity for both tenascin-C and type I collagen. The study reveals that tenascin-C and type I collagen may participate in the morphogenesis of ovarian follicles, and in the formation and regression of corpora lutea.",

     "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that Wilms\u2019 tumor transcription factor-1 (WT1) is expressed in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells from different benign and malignant tumors. Only a few studies on WT1 cytoplasmic immunolocalization are available in pediatric tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate immunohistochemically the expression and distribution of WT1 in a large series of soft tissue fibroblastic/myofibroblastic lesions occurring in children and adolescents. Notably WT1 was not expressed in nodular fasciitis and desmoid-type (adult) fibromatosis, while it stained diffusely and strongly in several infantile-type fibromatoses, such as fibrous hamartoma of infancy, myofibroma/myofibromatosis, and lipofibromatosis. Interestingly, WT1 cytoplasmic expression was also found in all cases (10/10) of infantile fibrosarcomas examined. The present study shows that a diffuse WT1 cytoplasmic expression is of complementary diagnostic value to conventional myofibroblastic markers (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin; desmin) in confirming diagnosis of young-type fibromatoses or infantile fibrosarcoma and in ruling out both desmoid-type fibromatoses and nodular fasciitis. WT1 cytoplasmic expression in infantile fibrosarcoma is a novel finding which could be exploitable as an immunomarker for this tumor. Although highly sensitive, WT1 cytoplasmic immunostaining is not specific for infantile fibrosarcoma, and thus it should be evaluated in the context of a wide immunohistochemical panel when pathologists are dealing with spindle cell lesions of soft tissues in children and adolescents. Accordingly we recommend that a correct diagnosis of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic soft tissue lesion in pediatric patients is usually achieved on the basis of a careful correlation of morphological and immunohistochemical findings in the appropriate clinical context. The different cellular localization of WT1, namely nuclear, cytoplasmic or nucleo-cytoplasmic, in different benign and malignant tumors supports the hypothesis that this transcription factor plays a complex role in tumorigenesis, likely as a chameleon protein functioning as either a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene, depending on cellular context.",

After injury, the organ size significantly increased and marked changes in structure and TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactivity were detected in the medullary microenvironment when the granulation tissue was present in the repair area. Most of the lymphocytes present in this wound connective tissue were found to be immunoreactive to specific T cell markers. Thymic mucocyte-like cells and epithelial cysts increased in number, the myoid cells acquired a faster turnover and associated in large clusters, blood vessels were dilated and corpuscles similar to mammalian Hassall's bodies were formed in medulla. A higher number of stronger medullary TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactive cells, i.e., dendritic, epithelial, granular basophilic and myoid cells were also induced after wounding. With progression of healing the thymus gradually returned to histochemical patterns of controls. Our results suggest that during the scar-based skin repair of Xenopus adults the activity of the thymus may be stimulated and associated with the T lymphocyte infiltration observed into injured granulation tissue.",

Whereas the histopathological progression of atherosclerotic lesions is well documented, much less is known about the development of unstable or vulnerable plaque, which can rupture leading to thrombus, luminal occlusion and infarct. Apoptosis in the fibrous cap, which is rich in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and macrophages, and its subsequent weakening or erosion seems to be an important regulator of plaque stability. The aim of our study was to improve our knowledge on the biological mechanisms that cause plaque instability in order to develop new therapies to maintain atherosclerotic plaque stability and avoid its rupture. In our study, we collected surgical specimens from atherosclerotic plaques in the right or left internal carotid artery of 62 patients with evident clinical symptoms. Histopathology and histochemistry were performed on wax-embedded sections. Immunohistochemical localization of caspase-3, N-cadherin and ADAM-10 was undertaken in order to highlight links between apoptosis, as expressed by caspase-3 immunostaining, and possible roles of N-cadherin, a cell-cell junction protein in VSMCs and macrophages that provides a pro-survival signal reducing apoptosis, and ADAM-10, a \u201cdisintegrin and metalloproteases\u201d that is able to cleave N-cadherin in glioblastomas. Our results showed that when apoptosis, expressed by caspase-3 immunostaining, increased in the fibrous cap, rich in VSMCs and macrophages, the expression of N-cadherin decreased. The decreased N-cadherin expression, in turn, was linked to increased ADAM-10 expression. This study shows that apoptotic events are probably involved in the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaque.",

Both B7-H1 and B7-H4 are expressed in many tumors and are classified as co-inhibitors of cell-mediated immunity. FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the maintenance of tumor immunity tolerance. However, the implication of B7-H1 and B7-H4 expression and their interaction with Tregs infiltration in colorectal cancer are unknown. The present study aimed to determine the expression of B7-H1 and B7-H4 as well as Tregs infiltration in colorectal cancer and to explore the clinical and pathological implication of suppressor immune cells and molecules. Frozen sections and immunohistochemical assay were undertaken to assess B7-H1, B7-H4 expression and Tregs infiltration in fresh specimens collected from 56 patients with colorectal carcinoma. The results showed that expression of B7-H1 and B7-H4 in colorectal carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than in adjacent normal mucosa (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). B7-H1 expression was positively correlated to the infiltration depth, lymph node metastasis and advanced Duke's stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively), whereas B7-H4 expression was positively related to the infiltration depth and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively). Furthermore, Tregs infiltration was more frequent in tumor tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa and was associated with poor differentiation and positive lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively). The statistical analysis indicated a significant correlation between Tregs infiltration and B7-H1 or B7-H4 expression respectively.

Signaling is mediated by CK-associated proteins, such as Annexin A1 (ANXA1), a ligand of the CK18/CK8 complex. ANXA1 has a pivotal role in cellular and immunological responses, and together with CK18 have been implicated in several processes related to malignant transformation in breast cancer (BC). Our aim was to demonstrate how their interaction might be linked to BC development. We investigated transcript levels, protein expression and distribution for both targets in breast tissues of 92 patients (42 BCs and 50 benign diseases) using qPCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. ANXA1 and CK18 mRNAs were inversely correlated, and their ratio in each TNM stage significantly differentiated BC from benign diseases (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.62). These differences did not mirror tissue protein levels, but a significant dichotomous protein distribution in tumor tissues was observed, differing from the expected co-localization observed during cell homeostasis. The disequilibrium of transcriptional levels between ANXA1/CK18 and alterations in their tissue distribution are present either in initial events or tumor progression, which suggest a critical event in BC. The broken dialog between ANXA1 and CK18 in normal breast tissues may play a critical role in BC development, and together may be used as combined targets for BC diagnostics.",

The animals in the ES group were electrically stimulated using rectangular waveform (RS) on the left calves and sine waveform (SS) on the right calves, twice a day, for 2 weeks during unloading. HU for 2 weeks resulted in a loss of the muscle mass, a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the muscle fibers, and overexpression of ubiquitinated proteins in the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. In contrast, electrical stimulation with RS attenuated the HU-induced reduction in the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers and the increase of ubiquitinated proteins in the gastrocnemius muscle. However, electrical stimulation with RS failed to prevent muscle atrophy in the deep portion of the gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles. Nevertheless, electrical stimulation with SS attenuated the HU-induced muscle atrophy and the up-regulation of ubiquitinated proteins in both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. This indicates that SS was more effective in the prevention of deep muscle atrophy than RS. Since the skin muscle layers act like the plates of a capacitor, separated by the subcutaneous adipose layer, the SS can pass through this capacitor more easily than the RS. Hence, SS can prevent the progressive loss of muscle fibers in the deep portion of the calf muscles.",

Results show that all clock genes investigated were found to be expressed both in RA and OA synovial tissues. Double staining against cell specific markers revealed that clock proteins were especially seen in macrophages, SFs and B-lymphocytes. Cell counting showed that clock proteins were found in approximately 5\u201320% of cells. Additionally, preliminary cell culture experiments showed that TNF-\u03b1 treatment resulted in differential 24\u00a0h expression profiles between RA and OA samples and also compared to the results obtained from the serum shock experiments. From our study we conclude that the major clock genes, including DBP, are expressed in samples from RA and OA patients, especially in macrophages and synovial fibroblasts, but also in B-lymphocytes. Preliminary experiments suggest that TNF-\u03b1 seems to be able to modify clock gene expression in synovial fibroblasts.",

     "abstract": "Laryngeal carcinoma is a common malignant neoplasm occurring in the head and neck, threatening human health. Protein casein kinase 2-alpha (CK2\u03b1) has been indicated to participate in the pathogenesis of this cancer; however, the underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. In this study, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) technology was utilized to inhibit the CK2\u03b1 expression in HEp-2 laryngeal carcinoma cells. Results showed that both mRNA and protein expression levels of endogenous CK2\u03b1 were markedly decreased in HEp-2 cells transfected with CK2\u03b1 specific shRNA. Transwell assays revealed that stable knockdown of CK2\u03b1 significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of HEp-2 cells. As compared with cells treated with negative control shRNA, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) expression was increased, but snail, slug and vimentin were decreased in cells transfected with CK2\u03b1 shRNA, indicating that inhibition of CK2\u03b1 expression may suppress the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of laryngeal carcinoma in vitro. Moreover, suppression of CK2\u03b1 was found to enhance the apoptosis induced by cisplatin in laryngeal carcinoma cells, probably through inhibition of permeability glycoprotein (P-glycoprotein) and multidrug-resistance protein (MRP1). In conclusion, our study may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for human laryngeal carcinoma by targeting CK2\u03b1.",

MMR mutations predominantly in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and rarely in PMS1, may cause the production of abnormally short or inactivated proteins. The antiapoptotic protein survivin functions in the inhibition of apoptosis, regulation of cell division and also enhances angiogenesis. Both MMRP and survivin are considered to be powerful prognostic parameters. This study was designed to determine the relationship between MMRP and survivin in colon lesions. The study included 113 cases of colon carcinoma and 51 cases of colon polyps. Survivin expression and MMRP status were assessed by immunohistochemistry. In each section, expression, intensity of immunostaining and percentage of labeled cells were analyzed. In carcinomas, immunoreaction was detected in 100/113 cases for MLH1 (88.5%), 112/113 cases for MSH2 (99.1%), 110/113 cases for MSH6 (97.3%), and 103/113 cases for PMS2 (91.2%). Survivin was shown in 47/113 cases (41.6%). The statistical analysis confirmed a significant correlation between the expression of MMRP and survivin in the assessed parameters. All 51 polyp samples were positive for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. Only 8 of those (15.7%) were positive for survivin. Statistically significant differences were observed between the expression of MMRP and survivin. In conclusion, this study revealed that MMRP may suppress the antiapoptotic function of survivin through p53 inactivation of its promoter in grade 1 and grade 2 colon carcinomas.",

Immunocytochemistry is widely used in studies with overexpressed proteins to determine cellular localization and in the case of histidine-tagged proteins can be carried out with anti-polyhistidine antibodies. Recent studies have suggested that polyhistidine sequences are present within a small number of human proteins and may direct expression to the nucleus and nuclear speckles compartments of the cell. In this study immunocytochemical staining of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lines with the HIS-1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody were determined. Results showed that the HIS-1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody stained endogenous nuclear proteins in SH-SY5Y cells. The stained proteins were contained within the nuclear membrane, but were not directly linked to DNA. In a histidine-tagged catalase overexpressing cell line the HIS-1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody showed nuclear staining, whilst staining with the CAT-505 anti-catalase monoclonal antibody showed primarily cytoplasmic staining. These results suggest that anti-polyhistidine antibody staining shows significant cross-reactivity with endogenous nuclear proteins in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and may not be suitable for localization studies of histidine-tagged proteins. Immunocytochemical studies with anti-polyhistidine antibodies and localization of histidine-tagged proteins must be confirmed with protein specific antibodies or other methodology.",

The aim of the present investigation was to study the distribution and degree of co-localization of CART with substances taking part in conducting sensory stimuli, such as: substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and Leu 5 enkephalin (L-ENK) in the circular muscle layer of the human caecum. CART-like immunoreactive (CART-LI) nerve fibers formed a very dense meshwork in the circular muscle layer of the caecum in all patients studied. Moreover, all neuronal substances tested during the present investigation were observed in CART-LI processes, but the degree of co-localization depended on the type of substance. The highest number of CART-positive nerves also contained L-ENK. A slightly lower level of co-localization was observed in the case of CART and SP or NKA, while only single nerve fibers were simultaneously CART- and CGRP-positive.",

We used three groups of 1-, 2- and 3-month-old male animals: (1) G. centralis, (2) G. griseoflavus and (3) hybrids obtained by crossing G. griseoflavus females with G. centralis males. Testicular ultrastructure was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. TUNEL was studied using an in situ cell death detection kit and the expression of apoptotic molecules by immunohistochemistry. The data confirmed arrest of spermatogenesis and intense apoptotic processes of germ cells in hybrids. These animals also showed ultrastructural alterations in the Leydig cells. Fas, FasL and calbindin D28k overexpression without an increase in DNA fragmentation was detected in the Leydig cells from hybrids. In conclusion, the sterility of Graomys hybrids occurs with ultrastructural changes in germ and Leydig cells. The enhancement of Fas and FasL is not associated with cell death in the Leydig cells.

Adult male mice were exposed to whole body irradiation at a total dose of 1\u00a0Gy. Radiation exposure was continued 24\u00a0h a day (0.1\u00a0Gy/day) throughout the 10 days exposure period either in the absence and/or presence of l-carnitine at an i.p. dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day. Results revealed that \u03b3-rays irradiation suppressed the expression of ABP and CYP450SCC mRNA, whereas treatment with l-carnitine prior and throughout \u03b3-rays irradiation exposure inhibited this suppression. Treatment with \u03b3-ray irradiation or l-carnitine down-regulated expression of aromatase mRNA. With combined treatment, l-carnitine significantly normalized aromatase expression. \u03b3-Ray irradiation up-regulated expression of FasL and Cyclin D2 mRNA, while l-carnitine inhibited these up-regulations. Results also showed that \u03b3-ray-irradiation up-regulated TNF-\u03b1, IL1-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expressions compared to either controls or the l-carnitine treated group. Moreover, \u03b3-irradiation greatly reduced serum testosterone levels, while l-carnitine, either alone or in combination with irradiation, significantly increased serum testosterone levels compared to controls. In addition, \u03b3-irradiation induced high levels of sperm abnormalities (43%) which were decreased to 12% in the presence of l-carnitine. In parallel with these findings, histological examination showed that \u03b3-irradiation induced severe tubular degenerative changes, which were reduced by l-carnitine pre-treatment.

The delivery route, however, for transplantation of ADSCs in clinical application remains controversial regarding the time window, cell type, safety issues, \u2018first pass\u2019 effect and therapeutic effect. To determine the optimal administration route in transplantation of ADSCs, we compared the therapeutic effect of the three mainly used administration routes of ADSCs in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Cells isolated from the adipose tissue of adult rodents were differentiated and characterized in vitro, and further transplanted in vivo by intravenous, intra-arterial or intra-ventricular delivery. The infarct volume, expression of neurotrophic factors and the neurobehavioral improvements were evaluated after the equal dose of BrdU labeled ADSCs transplantation. Our results indicated that the equal dose of ADSCs delivered intravenously were effective in improving the neurological outcome and reducing the infarct volume after ischemic brain injury in long term duration in contrast to intra-arterial and intra-ventricular delivery. At 1\u20137 days after transplantation, the increased expression levels of BDNF, VEGF, bFGF, Bcl-2, IL-10 and decreased levels of caspase-3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the intra-ventricular and intra-arterial groups were significant in contrast to the intravenous group. There was no significant difference among the three groups after 7 days. Our findings suggest that compared with the intra-ventricular delivery, intravascular injection allows higher dose injection with fewer invasions and appears to be optimal in application with regard to therapeutic efficacy, safety and feasibility.",

     "abstract": "Radiation has been widely used for cancer therapy in human medicine. However, the side effects of radiation are problematic and can limit its application. Radiation generates reactive oxygen species, leading to cell death via multiple signaling pathways. The blocking of certain signaling cascades using antioxidants represents a compensatory therapy of radiation-induced tissue injury. Although synthetic chemicals have been investigated in recent decades, anti-oxidants from natural resources have been searched for continuously. Among them, phlorotannins from marine algae, including Ecklonia cava, have been shown to protect cells from radiation-induced injury as well as oxidative stress. In the present review, the radioprotective capacity of phlorotannins derived from marine algae and the mechanisms involved are discussed.",

These receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system and periphery and play a role in the regulation of fluid and glucose homeostasis, feeding behavior, vessel formation, cell proliferation and immunity. We aimed to investigate whether water immersion and restraint stress have effects on apelin and APJR expression and apoptosis in heart tissue of male Wistar rats. The cardiac tissues were obtained from control, water immersion and restraint stress (WIRS) and apelin antagonist (F13A)\u00a0+\u00a0WIRS groups of rats and embedded in paraffin wax. Immunohistochemical staining methods were used to localize apelin, APJR and TUNEL immunopositive cells. H-SCORE was used for semi-quantitative determinations. Apelin protein levels were determined by Western blot in the cardiac tissues and plasma corticosteroid levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Apelin immunolocalization was found especially in endothelial cells and mast cells and faintly in cardiomyocytes, APJR immunostaining was shown in endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes, and TUNEL reaction was observed in endothelial cells and in some fibroblasts. Apelin expression was significantly increased in the WIRS and F13A\u00a0+\u00a0WIRS groups compared to the control group. The APJR reaction was similar in all groups. The number of TUNEL-positive cells was significantly higher in the F13A\u00a0+\u00a0WIRS group than that of the control group. Our study showed that WIRS for 6\u00a0h increased plasma corticosterone levels and cardiac apelin expression in rats. The increased levels of apelin inhibited stress-induced apoptosis in heart. These results may be important for the therapeutic approach to a variety of stress-related heart disease.",

Three-week-old male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (n\u00a0=\u00a08) were given a single oral dose of 1000\u00a0mg/kg butylparaben. The rats were sacrificed under anesthesia at 3, 6 and 24\u00a0h after administration and their testes were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Results showed a gradual collapse of Sertoli cell vimentin filaments and decreased actin staining intensity without accompanying changes in the pattern of tubulin expression, while spermatogenic cells became separated from the basement membrane and sloughed into the lumen in the butylparaben-treated rats, compared to the controls. To determine the direct effects of butylparaben on Sertoli cells, primary Sertoli cell cultures with and without butylparaben treatment were examined. Toluidine blue staining in butylparaben treated-cultured Sertoli cells showed an increased number and size of vacuoles in their cytoplasm. In agreement with the in vivo experiment, the in vitro study also clearly demonstrated disruption of vimentin filaments in Sertoli cells after butylparaben treatment. Considering both our present and previous reports, we can speculate that butylparaben-induced disruption of Sertoli cell vimentin filaments may lead to precocious release of spermatogenic cells from underlying Sertoli cells, and the released cells may undergo apoptosis owing to loss of support provided by the Sertoli cells.",

Tumor tissues of 64 patients were obtained by complete excisional or curettage biopsy of BCC and these were immunohistochemically stained for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-13 and E-cadherin. In the morpheaform and recurrent BCC, MMP-9 expression significantly increased in the stroma, while E-cadherin expression was negative in epithelial cells.

While purigenic signaling is relatively well studied in mammalian retinas, little is known about it in retinas of lower vertebrates. The aim of present study was to investigate, using immunocytochemistry, the distribution of purinoreceptors P2X in retinas of frog and turtle, which are appropriate models of the brain neuron-to-glia interactions. The results showed widespread expression of all seven ionotropic purinoreceptors (P2X1\u2013P2X7) in both frog and turtle retinas. They were predominantly expressed in M\u00fcller cells, the principal glial cells in the retina. All structures typical of M\u00fcller cells: the outer and the inner limiting membranes, the cells bodies in the inner nuclear layer, the radial processes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and the so called endfeet (frog) or the orthogonal arrays of particles (turtle) in the ganglion cells layer were immunostained. Colocalizations between P2X1\u2013P2X7 and the glial cell marker Vimentin proved that the immunostaining was in the M\u00fcller cells. In addition to the glial staining, neuronal staining was also seen as fine puncta in the inner plexiform layer and by small dots and patches in the outer plexiform layer. Some cell bodies of horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells were also stained. The results obtained imply that the purinergic P2X receptors may significantly contribute to the neuron-to-glia signaling in retinas of the lower vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "Chicken d-serine dehydratase (DSD) degrades d-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. The enzyme requires both pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate and Zn2+ for its activity. d-Serine is a physiological coagonist that regulates the activity of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) for l-glutamate. We have recently found in chickens that d-serine is degraded only by DSD in the brain, whereas it is also degraded to 3-hydroxypyruvate by d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) in the kidney and liver. In mammalian brains, d-serine is degraded only by DAO. It has not been clarified why chickens selectively use DSD for the control of d-serine concentrations in the brain. In the present study, we measured DSD activity in chicken tissues, and examined the cellular localization of DSD using a specific anti-chicken DSD antibody. The highest activity was found in kidney. Skeletal muscles and heart showed no activity. In chicken brain, cerebellum showed about 6-fold-higher activity (1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0U/g protein) than cerebrum (0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0U/g protein). At the cellular level DSD was demonstrated in proximal tubule cells of the kidney, in hepatocytes, in Bergmann-glia cells of the cerebellum and in astrocytes. The finding of DSD in glial cells seems to be important because d-serine is involved in NMDAR-dependent brain functions.",

There were no positive results in the negative control group. Our study revealed that BIOCHIP has high sensitivity and specificity comparable to that of the ELISA assays. Therefore the BIOCHIP technique seems to be an appropriate method for the diagnosis of P. vulgaris as it has been shown to be a simple, standardized and readily available novel tool, which could facilitate the diagnosis of this autoimmune bullous disease.

Adult male orchidectomized Wistar rats received estradiol-dipropionate or soy extract in oil/ethanol solvent subcutaneously for 3 weeks. Both controls, sham-operated (So) and orchidectomized (Orx) rats, were injected with solvent, in the same regime. Changes in pituitary volume, total volume, total number and volume of individual corticotropes were evaluated stereologically, while ACTH levels were determined biochemically. In comparison with So rats, estradiol treatment provoked increases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of: ACTH level (166%), pituitary weight (167%) and volume (102%), total volume (20%) and total number of corticotropes (18%). In comparison to Orx, following estradiol treatment elevation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of: ACTH level (69%), pituitary weight (131%) and volume (82%), total (30%) and individual volume (29%) of corticotropes was observed. Soy extract treatment led to enhancement (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of: ACTH level (28%), total (25%) and individual volume (20%) of corticotropes. It can be concluded that soy extract acts in a similar way to estradiol, but the increased activity of corticotropes was weaker.",

We found that miRNA-99a antagonism significantly increased proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of AsPC-1 cells, which was accompanied by increased expression of mesenchymal phenotype cell biomarkers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, and \u03b1-SMA), and decreased expression of epithelial phenotype cell biomarker (E-cadherin). Interestingly, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) remarkably restored miRNA-99a antagonism-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin. In conclusion, our data suggest that miRNA-99a is involved in pancreatic cancer migration and invasion by regulating mTOR, and may provide a target for effective therapies against pancreatic cancer.",

Although the expression of ECM proteins after vocal fold injury has been widely studied, such observations have lacked time continuity and integrity of marker proteins. In this study, we observed the morphology of injured vocal folds in a canine model. We used immunofluorescence staining to evaluate the expression and distribution of ECM proteins, such as collagen, elastin, hyaluronic acid, decorin and fibronectin, from 15 days to 6 months after injury. The results showed that large amounts of ECM proteins were secreted 15\u201340 days after injury. Collagen and fibronectin secretion increased significantly, and were disorderly deposited. The secretion of decorin and elastin increased slightly, while hyaluronic acid decreased. The 15\u201340 day post-injury period may be the critical intervention stage in wound healing of vocal folds. From 3 to 6 months after injury, the secretion of ECM proteins declined. However, collagen and fibronectin secretion were still significantly higher than normal with irregular arrangement, while the secretion of elastin, hyaluronic acid and decorin decreased significantly at 6 months. This led to vocal fold inelasticity and stiffness, which required effective long-term interventions to treat scar formation.",

Neuronal NADPH-diaphorase is a nitric oxide synthase that provides a specific histochemical marker for neurons producing nitric oxide (NO). NO acts as a neurotransmitter and intracellular signaling molecule in the nervous system. We observed in 7 day old rats NADPH-d containing neurons that were intensely stained. These neurons were bipolar with a short dendrite with average length of 23\u00a0\u03bcm. During the second postnatal week, the neurons were mainly bipolar and were rarely multipolar. By P14 the cells were located primarily in cortical layers III\u2013VI. Nitrergic neurons of the 21 day old rats were histochemically identified as multipolar cells with long radial extending dendrites. Dendrites of neurons in 14 and 21 day old rats were a similar length with an average of 57\u00a0\u03bcm.

Clinicopathological analysis indicated that high ILK expression was significantly associated with poor tumor differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024), advanced TNM stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), tumor invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves demonstrated that patients with high ILK expression had substantially shorter overall survival that those with low ILK expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043, log-rank test). Furthermore, Cox multivariate regression analysis identified ILK expression as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of gastric cancer patients (hazard ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval, 1.02\u20133.13; P\u00a0=\u00a00.026). In conclusion, our data suggest that ILK may contribute to the malignant progression of gastric cancer and serve as a novel prognostic indicator for gastric cancer patients.",

In this study, we aimed to determine the localization of putative stem cell markers such as CD90, STRO-1, OCT-3/4, CD105 and CD166 in adult human articular cartilage tissue sections and demonstrate the expression of these markers within the expanded surface zone colony-forming (CF) cells and evaluate their differentiation potential. Biopsy samples were either fixed immediately for immunohistochemical analyses or processed for in vitro cell culture. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry analyses were performed by using CD90, STRO-1, OCT-3/4, CD105 and CD166 antibodies. Isolated colony-forming (CF) cells were further stimulated, by using the appropriate growth factors in their pellet culture, to obtain cartilage, bone and adipose lineages. We observed that the expression of the stem cell markers were in various zones of the human adult cartilage. Flow cytometry results showed that in CF cells the expression of CD90 and CD166 was high, while OCT-3/4 was low. We also determined that CF cells could be stimulated towards cartilage, bone and adipose lineages. The results of this research support the idea that the resident stem-like cells in adult human articular cartilage express these putative stem cell markers, but further experimental investigations are needed to determine the precise localization of these cells.",

Pupae obtained from treated larvae were used in the study at five days after the completion of cocoon spinning to investigate the effects of neem oil on the replacement of the midgut epithelium during the larval-pupal transition. We observed that the old larval epithelium was shed into the midgut lumen and transformed into the yellow body. Old cells from the yellow body were destroyed by apoptosis and autophagy and were not affected by neem oil. However, neem oil did affect the new pupal epithelium. Cells from treated pupae showed cellular injuries such as a loss of microvilli, cytoplasmic vacuolization, an increase of glycogen stores, deformation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and dilation of the perinuclear space. Additionally, the neem oil treatment resulted in the release of cytoplasmic protrusions, rupture of the plasma membrane and leakage of cellular debris into the midgut lumen, characteristics of cell death by necrosis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers and its late detection results in poor prognosis. Therefore, we decided to examine whether TADG-12 appears early in PDAC development. In normal pancreas, pale to moderate immunostaining is present in islets of Langerhans, while exocrine tissue and ducts are free from labeling. In contrast, in cancer patients, who still preserve the integrity of the exocrine and the endocrine tissues, a pronounced immunolabelling of TADG-12 was evident mainly located in the insulin containing \u03b2 cells. In a more progressive stage of the disease TADG-12 was also evident in the deteriorated exocrine tissue. TADG-12 was also heavily labeled in islets of Langerhans, which were embedded in the stroma of the residual pancreatic tissue. Again, there was a considerable overlap between the labeling of insulin and TADG-12 in these islets. Close correlation between insulin and TADG-12 was also evident in islets of Langerhans surrounded by adipose cells. The TADG-12 labeled was confined to the cytoplasm and the membrane of the cells. In the progressive stage of PDAC, the cancerous ducts were clearly labeled with TADG-12 with no labeling of insulin. At high magnification the TADG-12 clearly labeled the cytoplasm and the cell wall membrane of duct cells, while the nuclei remained unstained upon incubation with antibodies to TADG-12. The present findings may assist in early detection of PDAC as well as targeting of TADG-12 in order to attenuate the rapid progression of the disease.",

The loss of IGF-IR contributes to the development of diabetic gastroparesis. However, the nature and the function of the IGF-IR+ cells in the gastric myenteric plexus remain unclear. In this study, anti-ChAT, anti-S100\u03b2 or anti-c-KIT antibodies were used to co-label IGF-IR+ cells and neurons, glial cells or interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), respectively. We also generated type 1 diabetic mice (DM) to explore the influence of impaired IGF-I/IGF-IR in the myenteric neurons. Results showed that IGF-IR was expressed in the epithelium, smooth muscles and myenteric plexi of the mouse stomach. Most of the IGF-IR+ cells in the myenteric plexi were ChAT+ cholinergic neurons, but not enteric glial cells and there were more IGF-IR+ neurons and fibers in the gastric antrum than in the corpus. The IGF-IR+/ChAT+ neurons and ICCs were closely juxtaposed, but distinctly distributed in the myenteric plexus, indicating a possible role for the IGF-IR+/ChAT+ neurons in the mediation of gastric motility through ICCs. Moreover, the decrease of IGF-IR and cholinergic neurons in the myenteric plexi and smooth muscles of DM mice suggested that IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling might play a role in neuron survival and neurite outgrowth, as well as stem cell factor (SCF) production, which is required for the development of ICCs. Our results provide insights into the effects of IGF-I/IGF-IR signaling on the development of gastrointestinal motility disorders.",

Apoptotic cells were found in gonads of both sexes. At E18 the percentage of apoptotic cells (the apoptotic index, AI) in the ovarian medulla and the testis was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than in the ovarian cortex. In the ovarian medulla, the AI at E18 was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than on E12. In the testis, the AI was significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at E18 than at E15 and 1D. The percentage of proliferating cells (the proliferation index: PI) within the ovary significantly increased from E15 to 1D in the cortex, while proliferating cells in the medulla were detected only at E15. In the testis, the PI gradually increased from E12 to 1D. The mRNA expression of caspase-3 and -6 as well as Bcl-2 was detected in male and female gonads at days 12 (E12), 15 (E15) and 18 (E18) of embryogenesis and the day after hatching (1D). The expression of all analyzed genes on E12 was significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in female than in male gonads. This difference was also observed at E15 and E18, but only for the caspase-6. The results obtained showed tissue- and sex-dependent differences in the number of apoptotic and proliferating cells as well as mRNA expression of caspase-3, -6 and Bcl-2 genes in the gonads of chicken embryos. Significant increase in the number of proliferating cells in the ovarian cortex and lack of these cells in the ovarian medulla (stages E12, E18, 1D) simultaneous with decrease in the intensity of apoptosis only in the medulla indicates that proliferation is the dominant process involved in the cortical development, which constitutes the majority of the functional structure of the fully developed ovary. No pronounced changes in the expression of apoptosis-related genes found during embryogenesis suggest that they cannot be considered as important indicators of gonad development. The molecular mechanisms of the regulation of balance between apoptosis and proliferation in developing avian gonads need to be further investigated.",

Reports implicating a role for DSG3 expression in cancer are few and contradictory. In this study, immunohistochemical staining was employed to investigate DSG3 expression and subcellular localization in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and to correlate changes with clinical characteristics. Results indicate that in normal squamous cell epithelia, strong DSG3 immunoreactivity was observed in the Stratum spinosum, and localization occurred only at the cell membrane. In ESCC, DSG3 immunoreactivity displayed an abnormal cytoplasmic localization that was correlated with cell differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Most strikingly, in 74.1% of the tumors, DSG3 expression was up-regulated and correlated with regional lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Moreover, in patients without lymph node metastasis, cytoplasmic localization of DSG3 correlated with poor prognosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044).

Lung structure was investigated by light microscopy. TGF-\u03b21 and Smad protein expressions in the lung were assayed by biochemical methods. Hyperoxic mice exhibited damage to the alveolar walls, increased cell proliferation and induced Smad3/TGF-\u03b21 signaling. Smad2 and phospho-Smad2 protein expressions were unchanged in all groups. Retinoic acid administration improved the degenerative alterations caused by hyperoxia and helped in alveolar repair. This positive effect of retinoic acid resulted from the inhibition of Smad3/TGF-\u03b21 signaling via reduced Smad4 mRNA and increased Smad7 protein expression. Retinoic acid also induced alveolarization and restricted Smad3/TGF-\u03b21 signaling by decreasing Smad4 mRNA in healthy mice. Thus, retinoic acid helped repair Smad3/TGF-\u03b21-induced lung damage in hyperoxic mice.",

As a potential means to augment PNS regeneration, the effects of cerebrolysin (CL), a proteolytic peptide fraction, were tested in vitro on Schwann cell (SC) proliferation, stress resistance, phagocytic and cluster-forming capacity. Primary SC/fibrocyte co-cultures were prepared from dorsal root ganglia of 5\u20137-day-old rats. SCs were subjected to mechanical stress by media change and metabolic stress by serum glucose deprivation (SGD). Cell survival was assessed using MTT test. SC proliferation was determined by counting BrdU-labeled cells. SC clustering was studied by ImageJ analysis of S100 immunostaining. Wallerian degeneration (WD) was evaluated by measuring acetylcholine-esterase staining within sciatic nerves in vitro. It was found that CL caused no effect on MTT turnover in the tested doses. CL inhibited SC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Media change and additional SGD stress inhibited SC clustering. CL enhanced the reorganization of SC clusters and was able to counteract SGD-induced cluster defects. Moreover, CL accelerated WD in vitro. CL was able to enhance the functions of SCs that are relevant to nerve regeneration. Thus, our findings suggest that CL may be suitable for therapeutic usage to enhance PNS regeneration/reconstruction.",

Recently interest in peroxisomes and their possible roles in physiological and pathological processes have significantly increased. In order to identify peroxisomes, several cytochemical techniques have been developed that require fairly complex procedures or are too expensive to be used for screening. In this paper we show that it is possible to label peroxisomes in several cell lines and in tissues by a simple and cheap technique based on 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reactivity. The number of peroxisomes detected with this technique in each cell line was similar to that shown by catalase immunoreaction. The technique appears specific because it was able to detect increased number of peroxisomes after treatment with the specific PPAR\u03b3 antagonist G3335. Gomori's technique for acid phosphatase activity was used to demonstrate that the DAB positive organelles were not lysosomes. The DAB technique has also been applied to transmission electron microscopy, where it labels round structures that are identified as peroxisomes on the basis of morphology, size and localization. The DAB technique has proved to be specific, simple, fast and cheap, which make it ideal to screen possible peroxisome changes in physiological and pathological conditions.",

Conversely, during the process, a gradual increase in SRAP expression was observed. Furthermore, there is a negative relationship between the expressions of these two molecules. Overall an increase in SRAP and a reduction in ER-\u03b2 expression might be associated with malignant transformation of EAOCCC.",

Eight-week-old mice were exposed to a single scrotal heat treatment (42\u00a0\u00b0C for 25\u00a0min). The testes displayed severe damage, with multinucleated giant cells, nuclear condensation and germ cell loss in the seminiferous epithelium. Increased malondialdehyde levels and reduced antioxidant enzyme activities were consistent with an acute oxidative stress response. The number of cleaved caspase 3-positive germ cells per tubule was markedly increased. In addition, scrotal heat caused increased expression of Nrf2 mRNA and translocation of Nrf2 protein into interstitial cell nuclei accompanied by elevated mRNA levels for Nrf2-regulated genes. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the time dependent response of the Nrf2-antioxidant system to a single treatment of scrotal heat in the mouse testes, making this pathway a potential target for new drugs designed to prevent oxidative stress-induced male infertility.",

Evidence underlines the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of SLE, but the exact etiology of this disease is unknown. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore regulation of abnormal miRNAs in SLE using microarray analysis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients and their matched controls were isolated appropriately. Total RNAs from each cell sample were extracted and used for microarray analysis. A total of 29 miRNAs were identified to be down-regulated in PBMCs of SLE patients as compared with healthy controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05, fold change\u00a0>\u00a02). No significant up-regulated miRNAs were found in SLE patients. Results of gene ontology analysis indicated that the potential target genes of these miRNAs mainly enriched in the development process, transcription regulator activity, ligand binding, etc. Meanwhile, these putative genes were also found to be involved in diverse signaling transduction pathways, including multiple cancer pathways, Wnt and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways, etc. This study revealed possible dysregulated biological processes and pathways in SLE that were targeted by the differentially expressed miRNAs, indicating the involvement of these miRNAs in the pathogenesis of SLE.",

Periodontitis and peri-implantitis can be defined as inflammatory processes that affect the tissues surrounding a tooth or an osseointegrated implant, respectively. To date, there are limited data about the involvement of AQPs in these diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible link between the histomorphological alterations and the expression of AQP1 in healthy, pathological and healed periodontal and peri-implant gingival tissues. The results obtained showed that changes in organization of collagen fibers were observed in periodontitis and peri-implantitis, together with an increase in the percentage of area occupied by inflammatory cell infiltration and an increase of AQP1 immunostaining, which was located in the endothelial cells of the vessels within the lamina propria. Moreover, in healed periodontal and peri-implant mucosa a restoration of histomorphological alterations was observed together with a concomitant decrease of AQP1 immunostaining. These data suggested a possible link between the degree of inflammatory state and the presence of AQP1, where the latter could be involved in the chain of inflammatory reactions triggered at periodontal and peri-implant levels.",

Among neoplastic tissues, WT1 has been documented in the cytoplasm of benign and malignant vascular tumors and in rhabdomyosarcoma, while there are no available studies about its expression in myofibroblastic tumors. Accordingly, we studied immunohistochemically the potential expression of WT1 in mammary myofibroblastoma (MFB), a prototypical myofibroblastic tumor. A series of 18 cases of mammary MFB, including several morphological variants (classic, fibrotic, myxoid, lipomatous, Schwannian-like, and epithelioid variants), were tested with antibodies against the N-terminal of WT1. The most striking finding was a diffuse and strong WT1 cytoplasmic immunostaining restricted to the \u201cepithelioid cell MFB\u201d, a rare and diagnostically challenging variant. Conversely the other variants of MFB, including the classic-type, were negative or only focally positive. The present study shows that mammary epithelioid cell MFB should be added to the list of mesenchymal tumors which express WT1 in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells. Accordingly, we suggest that the detection of WT1 cytoplasmic immunoreactivity is of complementary diagnostic value to conventional myofibroblastic markers in identifying epithelioid cell myofibroblastoma.",

Notch-1, a ligand-activated transmembrane receptor, has been reported to be down-regulated in preeclamptic human placentas. This study was conducted to explore the role of Notch-1 in the cell migration and invasion of a human trophoblast cell line, JEG3 cells. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated RNA interference was performed to effectively suppress the endogenous expression of Notch-1 at both mRNA and protein levels in JEG3 cells. Results of wound healing and transwell assays showed that knockdown of Notch-1 reduced trophoblast cell migration and invasion. The protein expressions and activities of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 were reduced in JEG3 cell when Notch-1 was decreased. Furthermore, the epithelial-cadherin (E-cadherin) expression increased in JEG3 cells when Notch-1 was inhibited, whereas its suppressor Snail decreased in these cells. Moreover, knockdown of Notch-1 also suppressed NF-\u03baB signaling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB p65) inhibitor (I\u03baB\u03b1) and the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB subunit p65 in JEG3 cells. In summary, we demonstrate that Notch-1 contributes to trophoblast cell migration and invasion and that it may be involved in the pathology of human preeclampsia.",

In this study the expression of monomeric and polymeric sialic acids was evaluated in human skeletal muscle during adult life. Surgical biopsies of the Quadriceps femoris muscle from men aged 18\u201325 years (young group; n\u00a0=\u00a08) and men aged 72\u201378 (elderly group; n\u00a0=\u00a010) were collected for analysis. Expression of sialic acids was evaluated using lectin histochemistry, associated with enzymatic and chemical treatments to characterize monomeric and polymeric sialic acids. The polysialic acid expression was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Various types of sialic acid in the muscle tissue, in different amounts in the study groups, were detected. Monomeric sialic acids decreased in the elderly group compared with the young group, whereas polysialic acid increased. Sialic acid acetylation was present only in the young group. These findings demonstrated that changes in the expression of sialic acids in skeletal muscle tissue may be related to morphofunctional modifications occurring during aging.",

Due to denervation and unloading for 14 days, muscle atrophy markedly occurred in the denervated and unloading animals, and the atrophy in the former was significantly more severe than that in the latter. In the denervated muscle, the atrophy was significantly attenuated by the electrical stimulation, but not in the unloaded muscle.

In the unloaded animals, though the expression level of calpain-2 appeared to be slightly higher than that in the control, the expression level of ubiquitinated proteins was almost the same as that in the control. The overexpression of calpain-1, calpain-2, and ubiquitinated proteins in the denervated muscle was inhibited by the electrical stimulation.

The immunolabeling of periderm granules present in the initial embryonic epidermis of the chick is obtained with a lizard anti-defensin antibody (Ac-BD-15) that recognizes a homologous peptide in the chick beta-defensin 9. Similar granules, termed honeycomb granules, are also stored in some basophilic granulocytes of adult and hatchling chicks, but did not show immunoreactivity to the antibody. It is unclear whether this morphology indicates different organelles, content or lack of available antigens due to organelle packaging. The remarkable ultrastructural similarity between periderm granules and the honeycomb granules present in basophil granulocytes further indicates that embryonic keratinocytes can synthesize antimicrobial peptides together with corneous proteins. These peptides may participate in the formation of an epidermal microbial barrier during ontogenesis or protect the embryo in case of damage to the amniotic-periderm barrier. These transient organelles, apart from the early keratinization of the epidermis that forms the initial barrier before hatching may also contribute to the formation of an efficient anti-microbial barrier against the penetration of microbes during embryonic life until hatching when the adaptive immunity system is still immature.",

One trial of mild hypoxia (360\u00a0Torr, 2\u00a0h) also reduced by half the number of BDNF-expressing cells, but had no effect on pCREB expression in the neocortex. In contrast, the exposure to three trials of mild hypoxia at 24\u00a0h intervals considerably up-regulated pCREB and BDNF levels in the neocortex of rats. Only preconditioning by three trials of mild hypoxia (360\u00a0Torr, 2\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h intervals), but not a single trial preconditioning, was neuroprotective significantly enhancing the pCREB and BDNF neuronal expression in response to severe hypoxic challenge.

Lubricin expression was studied in samples from 40 patients and in 9 normal donors after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. Histological analysis confirmed normal microanatomy and the absence of structural changes in control samples. Menisci derived from OA patients showed evidence of structural alterations, fibrillations and clefts. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed very strong lubricin immunostaining in normal menisci in contrast to weak/moderate staining seen in osteoarthritic menisci. Quantitative ELISA and Western blot analysis confirmed the above results. The findings of this study support the notion that changes in lubricin expression and boundary-lubricating ability of cartilage is followed by the development of OA.

This study was conducted to explore the role of SOCS2 in the development and progress of DN in a rat model of streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetes.

Increased expression levels of proinflammatory proteins (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrotic factor-alpha and interleukin-6) and profibrotic proteins (transforming growth factor-beta, collagen IV and fibronectin) in the diabetic kidneys were decreased after SOCS2 gene delivery. Additionally, adenovirus-mediated upregulation of renal SOCS2 markedly inhibited STZ-induced phosphorylation increases of Janus kinase (JAK) 2, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, STAT5 and extracellular receptor-activated kinase (ERK) 1/2.

This is the first study to indicate both GIP and GIPR expression in the rat major salivary glands, as well as its variation in the rat SMG during the growth period. These findings are crucial for a better understanding of the physiological function of GIP in rat major salivary gland.",

We have since reported on StarD6 in the developing hypothyroid rat brain. Therefore, we investigated qualitative and quantitative changes of StarD6 in the aging rat brain and testes of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Serum testosterone levels decreased with aging and total protein levels of StarD6 in the testes decreased. While the immunolocalization of StarD6 in the spermatocytes decreased, cytoplasmic localization appeared in the aged testes. Compared with young rats, aged rats showed decreased StarD6 in the cerebrum and cerebellum without changes in immunolocalization in the cortical neurons of the cerebral cortex and Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. Aged rats also showed increases in StarD6 in the hippocampus with changes in its immunolocalization from the Stratum pyramidale to the Stratum radiatum and Stratum lacunosum-moleculare. Taken together, StarD6 decreased with aging in the testes, which implies that StarD6 might play a role in impaired spermatogenesis in the aged rat. StarD6 decreased in the cerebrum and the cerebellum, but slightly increased in the hippocampus, which suggests that StarD6 might also play a role for neurosteroidogenesis in the hippocampus of aged rats.",

     "abstract": "The fat sand rat (Psammomys obesus) is a model to study seasonal reproductive cycle changes and several metabolic disorders. In order to show a possible involvement of estrogens in the male reproductive functions, the expression of estrogen receptors (ESR1 and ESR2) and androgen receptor (AR) were investigated in the caput epididymidis of fat sand rats during the breeding season, resting season, after castration, after castration followed by testosterone treatment, and after ligation of efferent ducts. In the breeding season, principal cells presented a strong immunostaining of AR in both nuclei and cytoplasm, a strong staining of ESR1, mainly in the apical zone, and a strong immunoexpression of ESR2, mainly in nuclei. In the resting season, a moderate immunostaining of AR in both cytoplasm and nuclei was observed. ESR1 staining showed a strong immunoreactivity in the nuclei. In contrast, the nuclei were negative for ESR2. After castration, a low and selective signal distribution was observed: the nuclei were moderately positive for AR and ESR2, and negative for ESR1. After castration and testosterone treatment, an androgen-dependence for AR and the restoration of ESR1 but not ESR2 immunoexpression were observed. After ligation of the efferent ducts, a considerable reduction of AR immunoreactivity was observed in contrast to ESR1 and ESR2, which gave a strong immunostaining signal. These results illustrate the complexity of the regulation of the androgen and estrogen receptor expression in the epididymis and argue for the coexistence of both androgenic and estrogenic pathways.",

From embryonic day 20, iron-positive mature myelinating oligodendrocytes were localized in the white matter and the granular layer. From post-hatching day 2, iron accumulation was observed in Bergmann glia in the Purkinje cell layer as well as in mature myelinating oligodendrocytes.

     "abstract": "The chick Ebf1 (early B-cell factor-1) gene is a member of a novel family of helix loop helix transcription factors. The expression profile, regulation and significance of this gene have been extensively studied in lymphatic, nervous, adipose and muscular tissues. However, cEbf1 expression, regulation and function in the feather of chick embryo have not yet been investigated. cEbf1 expression was first detected throughout the mesenchymal core of some few feather placodes (D7\u2013D7.5). After feathers became mature and grew distally (D9 and D10), the mesenchymal expression of cEbf1 became confined to the caudal margin of the proximal half of all formed feather buds. Because this dynamic pattern of expression resembles that of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) protein and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp4) plus the crucial role of these two major signals in feather development, we hypothesized that cEbf1 expression in the feather may be regulated by Shh and Bmp4. In a feather explant culture system, Shh signals are necessary to initiate and maintain cEbf1 expression in the posterior half of the feather bud, while Bmp4 is crucial for the initial cEbf1 expression in the anterior half of the feather bud. Inhibition of Shh, not only down-regulates cEbf1, but also changes the morphology of feather buds, which become irregular and fused. This is the first study to demonstrate that cEbf1 expression in the feather bud is under the control of Shh and Bmp4 signals and that expression may play a role in the normal development of feathers.",

We found that honokiol inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced RASMC proliferation and migration in a dose-dependent manner. At the molecular level, pretreatment with honokiol blocked TNF-\u03b1-induced protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9, nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB activation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation. Moreover, NF-\u03baB inhibitor (BAY 11-7028) and ERK inhibitor (U0126) also mimicked the inhibitory effects of honokiol in TNF-\u03b1-treated RASMCs. In conclusion, these results indicate that honokiol suppresses TNF-\u03b1-induced migration and MMP expression by blocking NF-\u03baB activation via the ERK signaling pathway in RASMCs.

In the present study, F-actin was stabilized by the overexpression of tropomyosin-1, which is known to stabilize actin filaments in muscle and non-muscle cells. Our study showed that the stabilization of F-actin significantly increased the survival of cells treated with 25% CSE. In addition, after stabilization of F-actin the migratory potential of EA.hy926 cells subjected to CSE treatment was increased. Our results also showed increased fluorescence intensity of alpha- and beta-catenin after CSE treatment in cells which had stabilized F-actin. Analysis of fluorescence intensity of Zonula occludens-1 did not reveal any significant differences when EA.hy926 cells overexpressing tropomyosin-1 were compared with those lacking overexpression. It would appear that overexpression of tropomyosin-1 preserved the structure of actin filaments in the cells treated with CSE. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that stabilization of F-actin protects EA.hy926 cells against CSE-induced loss of both adherens and tight junctions. The data presented in this study suggest that overexpression of tropomyosin-1 stabilizes the organizational structure of actin filaments and helps preserve the endothelial barrier function under conditions of strong oxidative stress.",

During weeks 5\u20136, moderate expression of \u03b1-tubulin and Oct-4 characterized the ventral part, with mild expression in the dorsal part of the caudal SC. In weeks 7\u20138, their expression increased in the VZ and IZ, and decreased in the MZ. In both parts of the SC Ki-67 and \u03b1-tubulin co-localized in the VZ.

Excision wounds in the nape region of the skin were induced in sixty albino Wistar rats. Animals were allocated in 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and kept individually in clean cages. The first group served as negative untreated controls without medication; the second group was treated with ointment base (vehicle); the third group represented the positive control and was treated with a reference ointment and the fourth one served as the experimental group and received the test plant extract (as ointment). Animal groups received the respective medications for 14 successive days. Wounds were measured and photographed every 3 days till the end of the experiment (day 21) in order to determine the wound closure rate (WCR). Specimens from wounds and surrounding skin were collected from sacrificed animals for histological and molecular studies. Both morphometric (based on WCR) and histological findings showed that the healing in animals treated with the sharah plant extract was better than those in control group or vehicle-treated group and was similar to that in the group that received the reference ointment. Moreover, the molecular findings concerning the expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (c-Met) displayed a reasonable healing enhancing effect of the plant extract with the expression levels of both being higher in the extract-treated group than in the control group.",

The different embryonal stages were identified according to the normal table of Hamburger and Hamilton (1951). The development of the feather follicle complex is closely related to skin layer development, making use of the controlling function of connexins. This was evident during feather follicle differentiation, based on communication between ectomesodermal (fibroblasts) and ectodermal cells (developing epidermis), but also by the subsequent separation of the two cell line types related to their connexin-dependent differentiation degree. With the increase in mesenchymal cell numbers during feather placode development, the multiple connexins Cx26 [chicken 31sim] and 43, supported by Cx30 [chicken 31], 31 and 32, were increasingly activating the fibroblast concentrations as related to epidermal follicle buds, the specific follicle structure, the endothelial cells of capillaries and larger blood vessels, as well as the collagen fiber production and the growing feather musculature shortly before hatching; Cx45 could not be demonstrated.

The pharyngeal jaw apparatus consists of a lower pharyngeal jaw and a chewing pad. Histochemical analysis reveals that the epithelium covering the lower pharyngeal jaw is mucogenic and is involved in the secretion of different classes of glycoproteins (GPs) including GPs with oxidizable vicinal diols, GPs with O-sulphate esters and GPs with sialic acid residues with and without O-acyl substitution. Characteristically, the epithelium at irregular intervals is differentiated into simple or branched tubular pharyngeal glands, which often extend deep into the sub-epithelial tissues. Copious mucus secretion from pharyngeal glands may be associated with transportation of chewed food particles toward the esophagus. Histochemistry and fluorescence microscopy show that the epithelium covering the chewing pad is keratinized. The keratinized surface of the chewing pad may be considered to serve as an occlusion surface for the lower pharyngeal jaw teeth forming an efficient pharyngeal mill for chewing food materials.",

Disease-free and overall survival were calculated and compared with steroid receptor and HER2 status as well as clinicopathological features using the Cox Proportional Hazards model. A mean follow-up period of 43.6 months (interquartile range\u00a0=\u00a041.4 months) was achieved where 44% of patients had serous tumor, followed by mucinous (23%), endometrioid (9%), mixed (9%), undifferentiated (8.5%) and clear cell tumors (5.3%). ER-alpha staining was associated with grade II\u2013III tumors. Progesterone receptor staining was positively associated with a Body Mass Index\u00a0\u2265\u00a025. Androgen receptor positivity was higher in serous tumors. In stand-alone analysis of receptor contribution to survival, estrogen-alpha positivity was associated with greater disease-free survival. However, there was no significant association between steroid receptor expression, HER2 status, or TNEOC status, and overall survival. Although estrogen-alpha, androgen receptor, progesterone receptor and the HER2 status were associated with key clinical features of the women and pathological characteristics of the tumors, these associations were not implicated in survival. Interestingly, women with TNEOC seem to fare the same way as their counterparts with non-TNEOC.",

In this study, we developed a simple experimental model produced by intracortical injection to rats of the cyst fluid content collected from human CPs to explore its possible contribution to brain tissue damage. The cyst fluid of the CPs (\u201coil machinery fluid\u201d) was collected during surgical removal, briefly preserved and further tested in rats through intracortical infusion. The group receiving \u201coil machinery fluid\u201d presented increased reactive oxygen species formation, oxidative damage to lipids and reactive gliosis accompanied by augmented immunoreactivity to peroxiredoxin and thioredoxin reductase 1 at 15, 30 and 45 days post-injection. Other markers of inflammation and cell damage were stimulated at all post-lesion days tested. There was also a body weight gain. The persistence of tissue damage and oxidative stress suggests that \u201coil machinery fluid\u201d exerts progressive alterations similar to those observed in patients with CPs, supporting the concept that some components of cyst fluid may contribute to brain tissue damage in these patients.",

Analysis revealed that AQP5 immunostaining appeared in preantral follicles and formed a characteristic ring encircling and touching the oolemma. The staining represented most likely AQP5 functioning at the ends of corona radiata cell projections, anchoring on the oocyte surface. However, several hours after the presumptive preovulatory LH surge, when the process of expansion of COCs started, the AQP5 staining appeared also on the cumulus granulosa cells and in the extracellular matrix. In the postovulatory ampullary COCs the fluorescent ring was not observed, which may be the result of the well-established preovulatory withdrawal of projections from the zona pellucida. At that time-point immunofluorescent staining of AQP5 appeared in most oocytes and was also present in the apical membrane of epithelial cells of the oviduct ampulla. The latter observation suggests that after ovulation AQP5 is involved in the transcellular movement of water in the oviduct ampulla and oocytes in rats.",

Some parabens, including butylparaben, exert an estrogenic activity as determined by in vitro estrogen receptor assay and in vivo uterotrophic assay, and adversely affect endocrine secretion and male reproductive function. We conducted a research study to evaluate the acute effects of butylparaben on testicular tissues of prepubertal rats. Three-week-old male rats (n\u00a0=\u00a08) were given a single dose of 1000\u00a0mg/kg butylparaben. The rats were sacrificed under anesthesia at 3, 6 and 24\u00a0h after administration, and their testes were collected for histopathological examination. The study revealed progressive detachment and sloughing of spermatogenic cells into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules at 3\u00a0h, and this effect was enhanced at 6\u00a0h after administration. Thin seminiferous epithelia and wide tubular lumina were seen at 24\u00a0h in the butylparaben-treated group, compared to the control. In order to clarify whether sloughed spermatogenic cells underwent apoptosis, TUNEL assay was carried out. We found a significant increase in the number of apoptotic spermatogenic cells in all the treated groups, compared to the controls and a maximal number of apoptotic cells were detected at 6\u00a0h after administration. In semithin sections, apoptotic cells were easily detected by their prominent basophilia and condensed chromatin, mainly found in spermatocytes. Ultrastructurally, the condensed chromatin and shrunken cytoplasm and nucleus, hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, were observed in butylparaben-treated groups. These observations lead us to postulate that butylparaben, similar to other estrogenic compounds, also induces spermatogenic cell apoptosis.",

Results showed that the content of glycolytic fibers in the bulbospongiosus muscle was higher than that of oxidative fibers. Meanwhile, the opposite was true for the pubococcygeus. In the bulbospongiosus muscle, the content of type IIb muscle fibers was higher than that of type I, but was similar to that of type IIa/IId. In contrast, the content of each fiber type was similar in the pubococcygeus muscle.

The soleus and plantaris muscles were analyzed using fiber distribution, lesser diameter, capillary/fiber ratio, and morphology. Results showed that the immobilization reduced the diameter of all fiber types, caused changes in fiber distribution and decreased the number of transverse capillaries in both muscles. The recovery period of the soleus muscle is longer than that of the plantaris after detraining. Moreover, eccentric training induced greater hypertrophic and angiogenic responses than passive stretching, especially after 21 days of rehabilitation. Both techniques demonstrated positive effects for muscle rehabilitation with the eccentric exercise being more effective.",

     "abstract": "Owing to its susceptibility to radiation, the small intestine of mice is valuable for studying radioprotective effects. When exposed to radiation, intestinal crypt cells immediately go through apoptosis, which impairs swift differentiation necessary for the regeneration of intestinal villi. Our previous studies have elucidated that acidic polysaccharide of Panax ginseng (APG) protects the mouse small intestine from radiation-induced damage by lengthening villi with proliferation and repopulation of crypt cells. In the present study, we identified the molecular mechanism involved. C57BL/6 mice were irradiated with gamma-rays with or without APG and the expression levels of apoptosis-related molecules in the jejunum were investigated using immunohistochemistry. APG pretreatment strongly decreased the radiation-induced apoptosis in the jejunum. It increased the expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XS/L) and dramatically reduced the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins (p53, BAX, cytochrome c and caspase-3). Therefore, APG attenuated the apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway, which is controlled by p53 and Bcl-2 family members. Results presented in this study suggest that APG protects the mouse small intestine from irradiation-induced apoptosis through inhibition of the p53-dependent pathway and the mitochondria/caspase pathway. Thus, APG may be a potential agent for preventing radiation induced injuries in intestinal cells during radio-therapy such as in cancer treatment.",

However, the potential role of ILK in cancer cell migration and invasion remains to be elucidated. In this study, we introduced the human ILK gene into a low ILK-expressing human CRC cell line SW480. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by the wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay, respectively. The epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were detected by Western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. We found that enforced overexpression of ILK in SW480 cells dramatically promoted their migratory and invasive ability in vitro. Furthermore, SW480 cells stably overexpressing ILK underwent EMT, as indicated by mesenchymal morphology, decreased expression of E-cadherin, and increased expression of vimentin, Snail, and Slug. Finally, the nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB inhibitor BAY 11-7028 or NF-\u03baB p65 small interfering RNA significantly restored the reduced E-cadherin level in ILK-overexpressing cells, suggesting that ILK-mediated down-regulation of E-cadherin is dependent on NF-\u03baB activation. Overall, our study demonstrates a pivotal role of ILK in EMT and metastasis, and suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of CRC.",

However, there is little evidence regarding the localization of Tfh cells in synovium tissues from RA patients, owing to the lack of an available method to characterize their localization in tissue. The aim of our present study was to characterize the Tfh cells in rheumatoid synovium tissues from RA patients by using immunohistochemistry and triple-fluorescence immunostaining methods. Our results showed that specific staining of CD4, CXCR5 and ICOS could be found on infiltrating immune cells in rheumatoid synovium tissues. The use of triple-fluorescence immunostaining and confocal laser scanning showed immunolocalization of CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+T cells (Tfh cells) in the rheumatoid synovium tissues, whereas these signals were absent in osteoarthritis (OA) synovium and in normal synovium tissues. Thus the data from our present preliminary study support the notion that CD4+CXCR5+ICOS+Tfh cells could be found in rheumatoid synovium tissues from RA patients, indicating the possibility that this T cell subset in synovium tissues may have important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of RA.",

     "abstract": "Midkine (MK), a heparin-binding growth factor, was previously found to be expressed in the rat myotube-forming stage. We investigated MK gene-deficient (Mdk\u2212/\u2212) mice in terms of skeletal muscle degeneration and regeneration after injury by bupivacaine injection into the tibialis anterior muscle. Injured muscles showed intense inflammatory cell infiltration. Myotubes, myofibers with centrally located nuclei in their cytoplasm, were significantly smaller in Mdk\u2212/\u2212 mice than in wild type (Mdk+/+) mice 7 days after injury (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The distribution of myotube sizes showed quantitative differences between the two groups at 5 and 7 days, but not at 14 days. Many small myotubes were found in the regenerative area of Mdk\u2212/\u2212 mice compared with that of Mdk+/+mice 5 and 7 days after injury. The expression of Iba1, a macrophage marker, was significantly lower in Mdk\u2212/\u2212 mice 3 days after injury (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The number of desmin-positive cells like myoblasts in Mdk\u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly fewer than that in Mdk+/+ mice 3 days after injury. Our results suggested that deletion of MK results in a delay in regeneration, preceded by decelerated migration of macrophages to the damaged area, and that MK has a role in cell differentiation and maturation after skeletal muscle injury.",

     "abstract": "Influences of heat stress on skeletal muscle regeneration were examined in experimental rats. After crush injury to the Extensor digitorum longus muscle (EDL) of the left hindlimb, animals were randomly divided into non-heat and heat groups. In the latter, packs filled with hot water (42\u00a0\u00b0C) were percutaneously applied to the injured EDL muscle for 20\u00a0min to the front of the lower leg, soon after the injury. During the early stages of muscle regeneration, due to the heat stress, secondary degeneration at the injured site progressed faster, and migration of macrophages, proliferation and differentiation of satellite cells were facilitated. At 14 and 28 days after the injury, the ratio of regenerating muscle fibers exhibiting central nuclei in the heat treated group was significantly lower than that in the non-heat group, and cross sectional area in the heat group was evidently larger than that in the non-heat group. Moreover, in the heat group, the ratio of collagen fiber area at 14 and 28 days after the injury was smaller than in the non-heat group. Together, these findings suggest that acceleration of degeneration processes by heat stress soon after injury is likely to promote skeletal muscle regeneration and inhibit collagen deposition.",

     "abstract": "Serotonin (5HT) is a neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons of the central nervous system and in the enterochromaffin cells of the gastrointestinal tract. 5HT regulates growth and maturation of some cerebral regions in the developing brain as well as the secretion of pituitary growth hormone. This hormone is necessary for development and growth through the stimulation of insulin-like growth factor synthesis. The precursor of 5HT, tryptophan (Trp), is an essential amino acid, since the human organism is unable to synthesize it and it is assumed only through diet. The aim of our study was to analyze how a high-tryptophan diet in pregnant rats affects growth and survival of pups until weaning. We monitored the number and weight of pups until weaning. Then, we detected serotonin and growth hormone levels in whole blood by ELISA of surviving pups at the end of the lactation period. We also analyzed by means of immunohistochemistry and Western blot the expression of serotonin in rat gastric tissue and the morphological structure of skeletal muscle tissue of both control and experimental pups. Hyperserotonemia and very low levels of growth hormone were detected in experimental pups compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated a strong serotonin expression in stomach samples confirming that a high intake of tryptophan increases the production of serotonin in enterochromaffin cells, thereby resulting in hyperserotonemia in pups. These data were also strengthened by Western blot analysis. Histological alterations of skeletal muscle fibers in experimental pups were found and showed that in experimental samples the muscle tissue demonstrated deleterious alterations, being less developed and defined. Our data suggest that a high-tryptophan diet in pregnant rats induces hyperserotonemia in the fetus. Hyperserotonemia results in an excess of serotonin in the brain where it has a negative influence on development of serotonergic neurons and consequently on growth hormone production.",

     "abstract": "The interruption of supraspinal input to the spinal cord leads to motor dysfunction and the development of spasticity. Clinical studies have shown that Baclofen (a GABAB agonist), while effective in modulating spasticity is associated with side-effects and the development of tolerance. The aim of the present study was to assess if discontinued Baclofen treatment and its repeated application leads antispasticity effects, and whether such changes affect neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the brainstem, nNOS and parvalbumin (PV) in lumbar \u03b1-motoneurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to Th9 spinal cord transection. Baclofen (30\u00a0mg/b.w.) diluted in drinking water, was administered for 6 days, starting at week 1 after injury and then repeated till week 4 after injury. The behavior of the animals was tested (tail-flick test, BBB locomotor score) from 1 to 8 weeks. Our results clearly indicate the role of nitric oxide, produced by nNOS in the initiation and the maintenance of spasticity states 1, 6 and 8 weeks after spinal trauma. A considerable decrease of nNOS staining after Baclofen treatment correlates with improvement of motor dysfunction. The findings also show that parvalbumin and astrocytes participate in the regulation of ion concentrations in the sub-acute phase after the injury.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that the iron content of the body is tightly regulated. Iron excess induces adaptive changes that are differentially regulated in each tissue. The pancreas is particularly susceptible to iron-related disorders. We studied the expression and regulation of key iron proteins in the pancreas, duodenum and liver, using an animal model of iron overload (female CF1 mice injected i.p. with iron saccharate, colloidal iron form). Divalent metal transporter 1, prohepcidin and ferritin (pancreas, duodenum, liver) were assessed by immunohistochemistry; divalent metal transporter 1 (pancreas, duodenum) by Western blot. In the iron overloaded mice, prohepcidin expression increased in islets of Langerhans and hepatocytes, and divalent metal transporter 1 expression decreased in cells of islets and in enterocytes. In the iron overloaded mice, ferritin expression decreased in islets of Langerhans and increased in acinar cells; hemosiderin was localized in connective tissue cells. The inverse relationship between divalent metal transporter 1 and prohepcidin may indicate a negative regulation by hepcidin, and hence reduction of iron stores in islets of Langerhans. Our data showed that in iron overloaded mice model, induced by colloidal iron form, a coordinated expression of key iron proteins in the pancreas, duodenum and liver may occur. Further research will be necessary to determine the adaptive responses induced by iron in the pancreas.",

Some immunopositive granulocytes were also observed among the keratinocytes of the wound epithelium covering the tail stump and occasionally in the regenerating epidermis of the tail. Immunolabeling for cathelicidins was also seen in low electrondense amorphous material present on the surface of the wound epidermis and on the plasma membrane of bacteria present on the surface of corneocytes of the epidermis. Immunolabeling for cathelicidins was absent in the other cell types and in control sections. The study suggests that cathelicidins are normally stored in granulocytes in the blood or in connective tissues, while keratinocytes can be stimulated to produce and possibly release these molecules only after injury or microbial invasion.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the potential relationship between the preoperative serum TPS levels and the outcome in Chinese breast cancer patients. 975 consecutive female patients, affected by invasive breast cancer under investigation from January 2005 to December 2011, had their TPS levels measured with a one-step solid phase radiometric sandwich assay detecting the M3 epitope on cytokeratin 18 fragments. The cut-off value was 80\u00a0U/L. The average age diagnosed with breast cancer was 48, ranging from 23 to 71. About 19% (185) patients displayed an elevated preoperative TPS level (>80\u00a0U/L) associated with older age (>45), advanced cancer stage, larger tumor size (>2\u00a0cm), axillary lymph node metastasis, negative progesterone receptor status, and positive HER2 status. In addition, preoperative TPS levels were also significantly connected with recurrence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), particularly distant metastasis and visceral metastasis. The mean preoperative TPS level was 68.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0116.43\u00a0U/L (range 0\u20131839\u00a0U/L). In multivariate analysis, high preoperative TPS level was recognized as an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). From these results we conclude that the serum preoperative TPS level may be a valuable and independent marker for breast cancer.",

In addition, Color Doppler examination of the uterine wall perfusion was analyzed. A significant decrease of values of PI and SV/DV ratio as well as an increase of end diastolic velocity and time averaged maximum velocity was noted. With the use of color coded sonography, the increased intensity of the blood flow in the uterine wall was observed.

For this, we investigated the presence and the distribution of neurotensin binding sites in the human hypothalamus, using an in vitro quantitative autoradiography technique and the selective radioligand monoiodo-Tyr3-neurotensin (2000\u00a0Ci/mM). This study was performed on nine adult human postmortem hypothalami. We first determined the biochemical kinetics of the binding and found that binding affinity constants were of high affinity and do not differ significantly between all cases investigated. Our analysis of the autoradiographic distribution shows that NT binding sites are widely distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus. However, the distribution of NT binding sites is not homogenous and regional variations exist. In general, the highest densities are mainly present in the anterior hypothalamic level, particularly in the preoptic region and the anterior boarding limit (i.e. the diagonal band of Broca). Important NT binding site densities are also present at the mediobasal hypothalamic level, particularly in the paraventricular, parafornical and dorsomedial nuclei. At the posterior level, relatively moderate densities could be observed in the mammillary complex subdivisions, apart from the supramammillary nucleus and the posterior hypothalamic area. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the occurrence of high concentrations of NT binding sites in various structures in many regions in the human adult hypothalamus, involved in the control of neuroendocrine and/or neurovegetative functions.",

CART-IR neurons additionally exhibiting the presence of SP/CGRP (ca. 12%), SP/CALB (ca. 12%), SP/LENK (ca. 5%) were found. The vast majority of CART-IR/CGRP-IR neurons did not display immunoreaction to SP (ca. 60%). Subclasses of CART-IR/LENK-IR/SP-negative (ca. 5%), as well as CART-IR/CALB-IR/SP-negative neurons (ca. 10%), were also visualized. In addition, CART-IR neurons with no immunoreactivities to any of the neuropeptides studied were also shown. In porcine DRGs none of the CART-IR neurons exhibited the presence of galanin. The results obtained in the study suggest that CART may functionally modulate the activity of the porcine primary sensory neurons.

We investigated whether in normal morphological appearance and in early stages of ovarian tumorgenesis typical cancer cell markers such as CD24 and Nanog are expressed. In 25% of normal appearing ovaries of post-menopausal women there was co-localization of CD24 and Nanog in the walls of the ovarian cysts, leaving the epithelial cells on the surface of these ovaries free of Nanog or CD24 expression. In benign ovarian tumors 37% of specimens were positive to CD24 and Nanog labeling while 26% of them were localized in the cyst walls. In contrast, in serous borderline tumors 79% specimens were labeled with CD24, 42% of them were localized in cysts and in 32% of them showed co-localization with CD24 and Nanog was evident: the rest were labeled in the ovarian epithelial cells. In serous ovarian carcinomas 81% specimens were labeled with CD24 antibodies. In 45% of them co-localization with Nanog was evident in the bulk of the cancerous tissue. In mucinous carcinomas no labeling with CD24 or Nanog was evident. In view of the synergistic effect of CD24 and Nanog expressed in malignant cancer development in other systems, it is suggested that such an analysis can be valuable for early detection of ovarian cancer. Moreover, the abundance of these markers in cysts in the development of ovarian cancer may suggest that they present an intrinsic source of the development of the highly malignant disease. Finally, since CD24 is exposed on the surface of the cancer cells, it may be highly beneficial to target these cells with antibodies to CD24 conjugated to cytotoxic drugs for more efficient treatment of this malignant disease.",

Photography, determination of percentage wound contraction, and collection of granulation tissue were done on days 3, 7, 11 and 14 post-wounding. Topical application of gel (once daily) significantly increased the wound closure on days 11 and 14. The gel application increased the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-\u03b21) on days 3 and 7. Histopathologically, more leukocyte infiltration followed by well formed granulation tissue with marked fibroblast proliferation was evident in the gel-treated group, as compared to the saline-treated control group. Immunohistochemistry of CD31 on day 7 revealed significant higher microvessel density in gel-treated wounds. Picrosirius staining demonstrated higher collagen fraction in gel-treated wounds. Thus, from the results, it could be concluded that pluronic F-127 gel has a mild inflammatory nature and enhanced the healing by stimulating expression of VEGF and TGF-\u03b21.",

     "abstract": "Abundant secretory granular cells (GCs) in the Giant African land snail atrium harbor a range of bioactive substances and undergo rapid total degranulation in response to stimulation of the cardiac nerve or stressful influences. Here we have analyzed exocytotic events in the non-stimulated GCs. It was shown that the GCs contain three major distinct types of granules that differ histochemically, immunocytochemically and ultrastructurally, each performing specific functions. The type I granules characteristically filled with electron-lucent homogeneous materials exhibit intense immunoreactivity for bioactive proteins and therefore are considered to be storage granules. Histochemistry using vital staining with Acridine Orange and Gomori acid phosphatase technique has revealed lysosomal-related nature of the electron-dense type II granules. Digestion remnants appearing as fine filamentous materials fill the type III granules. Only the type III granules fuse together and with the plasma membrane form degranulation channels and surface pores, through which the debris is removed from the cell. The finding of granules exhibiting intermediate ultrastructural, histochemical and immunocytochemical features suggests that the major granule types represent most stable states along a granule empting continuum. Thus, under physiological conditions, the GCs continuously produce secretory proteins and so maintain readiness for stress-response, but use protein degradation machinery to prevent massive release of these bioactive substances into hemolymph.",

Exposure of human skin to UVB at doses that induce mild sunburn reactions causes epidermal hyperproliferation and alterations in the expression of several epidermal differentiation markers. This study investigated the effects of UVB irradiation on the expression of hornerin, a member of the S100 fused-type protein family, using the xenotransplantation of normal human skin onto nude mice. Hornerin mRNA was detected in the UVB-irradiated skin on day 2 using RT-PCR. In accordance with the results of the RT-PCR, the expression of hornerin was induced in the granular layers of the UVB-exposed skin beginning two days after UVB irradiation and occurred in parallel with the expressions of cytokeratin 6 and Ki67. This finding suggests that hornerin induction in UVB-irradiated skin might be associated with epidermal hyperproliferation. This study demonstrated that hornerin is a protein whose expression is changed by UVB irradiation and suggests that the expression of hornerin might be a useful marker of acute UV damage in skin.",

Hypoglycemic effect of chard extract was demonstrated by a significant reduction in the fasting blood glucose and increased glycogen levels in liver of chard extract-treated hyperglycemic rats. Moreover, activity of adenosine deaminase, which is suggested as an important enzyme for modulating the bioactivity of insulin, was decreased by chard treatment. Immunostaining analysis showed increased nuclear translocation of Akt2 and synthesis of GLUT2 in the hepatocytes of chard or/and insulin-treated hyperglycemic rats. The oxidative stress was decreased and antioxidant defense was increased by chard extract or/and insulin treatment to hyperglycemic rats according to the decreased malondialdehyde formation, the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, myeloperoxidase and increased glutathione levels.

We have investigated immunohistochemically the developmentally regulated expression and distribution of WT1 in the human fetal peripheral sympathetic nervous system (PSNS) and the gastro-enteric nervous system (GENS) from weeks 8 to 28 gestational age. WT1 expression was restricted to the cytoplasm of sympathetic neuroblasts, while it progressively disappeared with advancing morphologic differentiation of these cells along both ganglionic and chromaffin cell lineages. In adult tissues, both ganglion and chromaffin cells lacked any WT1 expression. These findings show that WT1 is a reliable marker of human sympathetic neuroblasts, which can be used routinely in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The progressive loss of WT1 in both ganglion and chromaffin cells, suggests its potential repressor role of differentiation in a precise temporal window during the development of the human PSNS and GENS.",

The aim of this study was to determine if extra-virgin olive oil improved the adaptive responses in conditions of oxidative stress. Twenty-four 12-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in three groups: (1) rats fed with standard chow and not subjected to physical exercise; (2) rats fed with standard chow and subjected to exhaustive exercise; (3) rats fed with a diet rich in oleic acid, the major component of extra-virgin olive oil, and subjected to exhaustive exercise. Exhaustive exercise consisted of forced running in a five-lane 10\u00b0 inclined treadmill at a speed of 30\u00a0m/min for 70\u201375\u00a0min. We studied some biomarkers of oxidative stress and of antioxidant defenses, histology and ultrastructure of the Quadriceps femoris muscle (Rectus femoris). We observed that, in rats of group 3, parameters indicating oxidative stress such as hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances decreased, parameters indicating antioxidant defenses of the body such as non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity and Hsp70 expression increased, and R. femoris muscle did not show histological and ultrastructural alterations.

In Europe and the United States, the first single most prominent cause of peripheral neuropathy is diabetes, affecting 60\u201370% patients with long-term diabetes followed by idiopathic neuropathy, peripheral nerve damage of unknown etiology, diagnosed in 10\u201340% of all patients admitted to hospitals with symptoms of peripheral nerve damage. The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disorder are not yet fully understood, however a few potential molecular contributors, such as Munc13-1, have been recently suggested. Munc13-1 is a diacylglycerol (DAG) receptor and a multifunction active zone protein essential for synaptic vesicle priming and crucial for insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Here, for the first time, we focused on the comparative expression of Munc13-1 in human and porcine peripheral nerves. Our results revealed significantly reduced number of Munc13-1 in human (64.26%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.68%) and porcine (84.09%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.21%) diabetic nerve fibers and lower number of the double stained, neuronal marker, Neurofilament (NF) and Munc13-1 positive, human (56.83%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.77%) and porcine (65.87%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.86%) nerve fibers. Optical density quantification of Western blots showed similar results. Our study indicates that Munc13-1, on account of its role in both insulin and neurotransmitter exocytosis and through its binding properties, may be an important factor contributing to the development or progression of diabetic neuropathy.",

The integrity of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells for cardiac regeneration is dependent on cell\u2013cell or cell\u2013matrix interaction, which is adversely affected by reactive oxygen species in an ischemic environment. Treatment with erythropoietin was shown to protect human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells in an ischemic injury in vitro model. The analyses indicated that expression of erythropoietin receptors played a pivotal role in erythropoietin mediated cell survival. In this study, the anti-apoptotic effect of erythropoietin on stem cells was analyzed in apoptosis-induced human mesenchymal stem cells. Apoptosis was induced in cultured adult human adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells by hydrogen peroxide. A group of cultured cells was also treated with recombinant human erythropoietin in a concentration of 50\u00a0ng\u00a0mL\u22121. The degree of apoptosis was analyzed by flow-cytometry and immunohistochemical staining for Caspase 3. The average percentages of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in H2O2-induced stem cells than in cells co-cultured with erythropoietin (63.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.96% vs 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.41%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

To clarify the involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors in PRL regulation, their mRNA expression was determined on hypothalamic tissue sections from birds in different reproductive stages. A significant difference in 5-HT1A receptor was observed, with the POM of hypoprolactinemic short day and photorefractory birds showing the highest expression. 5-HT2C receptors mRNA did not change during the reproductive cycle. The data presented support the notion that DA neurons in the PMM and POM mediate the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of 5-HT, respectively, on PRL secretion and the 5-HTergic system can both stimulate and inhibit PRL secretion.",

In Japanese Silky embryos, ventral areas, including the anterior- and posterior-half somites, expressed ephrin-B1 in a pattern that correlates with the atypical migratory pathways taken by Japanese Silky melanoblasts. White Leghorn embryos displayed little to no ephrin-Bs in the ventral paths.

Cells undertake adaptive measures such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expressed under the control of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). CD34 is an endothelial marker which can show the presence and distribution of blood vessels. This study evaluated the presence and relative expression of VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1 and CD34 using immunohistochemistry of 60 breast tumors and double staining, correlating the findings with clinical and pathological variables. High VEGF expression was correlated with low cell proliferation, lymph node-negative, smaller tumor size and patients not receiving hormone therapy. High HIF-1\u03b1 expression predominated in younger (<50-year) patients, subjected to neo-adjuvant therapy and in p53-negative tumors. Absence of metastasis, radiotherapy or hormone treatment, and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors showed high CD34 immunoreactivity. We suggest that the angiogenic factors VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1 and CD34 are important in breast cancer progression and their abundance in breast tumors has prognostic and predictive value.",

Our results showed that feeding high fat diet to rats for 12 weeks significantly increased SPARC expression in adipose tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, SPARC overexpression in stably transfected 3T3-L1 cells induced insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, lower ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mature adipocytes. Finally, overexpression of SPARC also modulated the expression levels of several inflammatory cytokines, which play important roles in insulin resistance, glucose and lipid metabolism during adipogenesis. In conclusion, our data suggest that SPARC is involved in obesity-induced adipose insulin resistance and may serve as a potential target in the treatment of obesity and obesity-related insulin resistance.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on apoptosis, cell proliferation, oxidative stress and the antioxidant system in intestinal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion in rats and to determine if EGF can ameliorate these toxic effects. Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury was produced by causing complete occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 60\u00a0min followed by a 60-min reperfusion period. Animals received intraperitoneal injections of 150\u00a0\u03bcg/kg human recombinant EGF 30\u00a0min prior to the mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion. Mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion caused degeneration of the intestinal mucosa, inhibition of cell proliferation, stimulation of apoptosis and oxidative stress in the small intestine of rats. In the ischemia/reperfusion group, lipid peroxidation was stimulated accompanied by increased intestinal catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, however, glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activities were markedly decreased. EGF treatment to rats with ischemia/reperfusion prevented the ischemia/reperfusion-induced oxidative injury by reducing apoptosis and lipid peroxidation, and by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities. These results demonstrate that EGF has beneficial antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects on intestinal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion in rats.",

Fish were exposed to acute (1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0 and 7.5\u00a0\u03bcl/l) for 24\u00a0h and sublethal concentrations of CPF 1.79\u00a0\u03bcl/l (1/3 of LC50) and 0.538\u00a0\u03bcl/l (1/10 of LC50) for 3 and 7 days respectively. Several endpoints related to the histoarchitectural profile in the optic tectum were evaluated. Histological examination showed detachment in the superficial zone of the Stratum opticum, Str. marginale due to degeneration of neuronal cells. Spongiosis, congestion, necrosis and appearance of clear areas around the nucleus of mononuclear cells in the lining of the Str. fibrosum grisium superficiale, Str. griseum centrale, Str. album centrale were seen. Granular cells found in the innermost layer of optic tectum, i.e. the Str. periventriculare, were severely degenerated and vacuolized and they migrated toward the Torus semicircularis. The histopathological changes were more pronounced with higher concentrations of CPF. The degree of neurodegeneration found in the deep layers of the optic tectum in higher concentration treatment (6.0 and 7.5\u00a0\u03bcl/l) was more pronounced. These alterations of the optic tectum affected the functioning of motor coordination of the fish body, because CPF inhibited acetylcholine in neuronal synapses. Due to apoptosis in the superficial zone of the optic tectum, normal visual response was affected. Fish showed microphthalmia (reduced size and eye shrinkage in the eye orbit) because of detachment, necrosis, degeneration and vacuolization in different regions after CPF treatment. This study shows that CPF is highly toxic to fish and affect their population survival in environment.",

Some of these toxic effects are probably mediated by the gas nitric oxide (NO). We studied by morphometric analysis the numerical density of neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in cortical and hypothalamic areas of eight heroin overdose victims and nine matched controls. Heroin addicts showed significantly increased numerical densities of nNOS immunoreactive cells in the right temporal cortex and the left paraventricular nucleus. Remarkably, in heroin abusers, but not in controls, we observed not only immunostained interneurons, but also cortical pyramidal cells. Given that increased cellular expression of nNOS was accompanied by elevated NO generation in brains of heroin addicts, these elevated levels of NO might have contributed to some of the known toxic effects of heroin (for example, reduced adult neurogenesis, mitochondrial pathology or disturbances in synaptic functioning).",

We have investigated the appearance of c-kit, a stem cell marker, in both normal adult pancreatic tissue and in cancerous tissue. Apart from some very pale staining of islets of Langerhans, normal pancreas was devoid of staining with antibodies to c-kit. In contrast, in cancerous tissue that still preserves the overall integrity of the pancreatic tissue, there was a clear labeling in islets of Langerhans, which seemed to be co-localized with insulin containing \u03b2 cells. In other cases, where the pancreatic tissue was completely deteriorated, intensive labeling was clearly evident in remnants of both the exocrine and the endocrine tissues. The duct cells of the adenocarcinoma were moderately but clearly labeled with antibodies to c-kit. In contrast, in metastasis of PDAC, very intensive labeling of c-kit was evident. The location of KRAS, which is strongly associated with PDAC, was also analyzed at the initial stages of the disease, when islets of Langerhans still preserve their integrity to a large extent. KRAS was found exclusively in islets of Langerhans and overlapped in its location with insulin and c-kit expressing cells. It is suggested that the modulation of the expression of c-kit, visualized by antibodies to the oncogene molecule, may play an important role in the formation and progression of PDAC. The absence of c-kit in normal pancreas and its appearance in PDAC is probably due to a mutational event, which probably allows conversion of the \u03b2 cells into cancer stem cells (CSC). Co-expression of both c-kit and KRAS, typical markers for CSC with overlapping with insulin in islets of Langerhans, strongly support the notion that \u03b2-cells play a central role in the development of PDAC. The use of specific drugs that can attenuate the kinase activity of c-kit or target KRAS expressing cancer cells should be tested in order to attenuate the progression of this lethal disease.",

The identification of elements that influenced the survival of this cell type was performed by morphometric, nuclear phenotypes, ultrastructural and immune histochemical analysis. The most significant responses to treatment, by analyzing morphometric features, were observed during the first three time points (day 1, day 3, and day 7), after which there appeared to be an adjustment of the gland to the hormone ablation. All treatments led to changes in the state of chromatin condensation, DNA methylation pattern and phenotypic changes indicated cell senescence. Additionally, an increase in the basal cells seemed to guarantee self-renewal properties to the epithelium. These data indicate that changes occur at many levels, including gene expression and nuclear architecture in the epithelial cells, when aging and steroidal blockade are associated. These aspects are important when considering castration-resistant prostate cancer, a malignant tumor posing difficult therapeutic intervention.",

The objective of this study was to characterize the morphology of ghrelin cells in the stomach and duodenum and the levels of ghrelin and leptin in the serum of a 52-year-old obese woman. Material for the study was obtained from the stomachs and duodenum, of obese and control women. Each subject had been treated at the Intensive Care Unit of the Clinical University Hospital in Bia\u0142ystok, due to brain damage, due to primary cardiac arrest. After brain death was diagnosed and individual death was confirmed by doctors, stomach and duodenum samples were collected from each body. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and processed for immunolocalization of ghrelin. The density of ghrelin cells in each part of the gastrointestinal tract was estimated under a light microscope with a digital camera. Ghrelin-IR cells were also analyzed in terms of morphometric features such as length, width and area. The ghrelin and leptin concentrations in each blood sample were measured by ELISA.Immunohistochemical studies revealed a small number of ghrelin cells in the stomach and duodenum which did not reflect the high level of hormone. The obese woman had lower number of ghrelin cells in the stomach and duodenum and elevated ghrelin and leptin levels in serum. It can therefore be assumed that additional source of ghrelin and probably changes in activity of ghrelin o-acylotransferase, are responsible for the high concentration of ghrelin in the obese woman.",

Keratins were found in all esophageal layers of all species, except for the equine Stratum corneum. The positive reaction staining of Pan-keratin was remarkable, but decreased in intensity toward the outer layers, whereas in the pig and cat, staining was confined to the corneal layer. The herbivores revealed positive staining reactions in the upper Stratum spinosum, particularly in the sheep. Regarding single keratins, CK6 immunostating was found in most esophageal layers, but only weakly or negatively in the porcine and equine Stratum corneum. CK13 staining was restricted to the sheep and here was found in all layers. CK14 could be detected in the equine and feline Stratum basale, and upper vital layers of the dog and rat. CK17 appeared only in the Stratum spinosum and Stratum granulosum, but in all layers of the dog and cat. Disulfides reacted strongest in the Stratum corneum of the herbivores, as corroborated by the sulfur concentrations in the esophagus. Our study emphasized that keratins are very important for the mechanical stability of the epithelial cells and cell layers of the mammalian esophagus. The role of these keratins in the esophageal epithelia is of specific interest owing to the varying feed qualities and mechanical loads of different nutrition groups, which have to be countered.",

The F. brasiliensis females were collected in seawater off the Guarapari coast, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Five cell types were identified in this digestive gland: B (vesicular), E (embryonic), F (fibrillar), M (basal) and R (resorptive). The digestive gland was stained with the following techniques: PAS/Alcian blue (for polysaccharides), bromophenol blue (for protein), von Kossa (for bound calcium) and Baker (for lipids). Acid glycoconjugates were found inside vacuoles in the R cells, while neutral polysaccharides were present in the B cells and near to the microvilli. In females with exhausted gonads polysaccharides were also seen in the intertubular spaces and inside the lumina of the tubules. The F and M cells were the most marked by the presence of large amounts of proteins observed in R cells and also inside the vacuoles of B cells. The bound calcium was mainly found in the F and M cells. The F cells showed strong positive staining for lipid while the R cell only stained weakly. The E cells did not react to any of the applied staining techniques. The similarities in the histochemical composition of these hepatopancreatic cells in females with developed gonads, compared to exhausted ones, is justified by the fact that transfer of these elements to the oocytes occurs, in significant quantity, only during the initial stages of gonadal development in F. brasiliensis. Also, they may be more related to the molt stage, as in the case of calcium salts.",

The number of FJB-positive degenerated neurons was decreased in ventral horns of both bradykinin groups. Significantly decreased activities of total SOD and mitochondrial Mn-SOD were also detected in both bradykinin groups versus ischemic group while CuZn-SOD and catalase activities were significantly decreased only in the bradykinin group after 24\u00a0h of reperfusion versus ischemic group.

To assess radiation-induced late effects, adult male Wistar rats received whole-body exposure with fractionated doses of gamma rays (a total dose of 4\u00a0Gy) and were investigated thirty, sixty and ninety days later. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to determine the density of neuroblasts derived from the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa) and brain resident microglia distributed along and/or adjacent to subventricular zone\u2013olfactory bulb axis (SVZ\u2013OB axis). Cell counting was performed in four anatomical parts along the well defined pathway, known as the rostral migratory stream (RMS) represented by the SVZa, vertical arm, elbow and horizontal arm of the RMS. Strong overdistribution of neuroblasts was seen in the SVZa thirty and sixty days after irradiation replaced by a steep decline in the following parts of the RMS and the highest decrease ninety days after radiation treatment along the entire SVZ\u2013OB axis. Radiation treatment led to a decline or loss of microglia in almost all counted parts through the entire experiment. Results showed that ultimate decline of the SVZa descendants and loss of microglia suggests a contributory role of reduced neurogenesis in the development of radiation-induced late effects.",

We analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the brain cortex, evaluated SIRT6 expression and its localization by immunohistochemistry comparing db/db mice to lean control mice, examining the six cortical layers and the motor and somatosensory cortex. Finally, we calculated a SIRT6 labeling index. We observed the absence of significant morphological differences between lean and db/db mice, indicating that young db/db mice showed a neuronal morphology and distribution similar to that of lean mice and also normal brain tissue architecture with intact cortical layers. Moreover, sirtuin 6 is mainly localized in the nucleus of both lean and db/db mice. In particular, the db/db mice showed few positive cells compared to lean control mice in all cortical layers. We found a lower sirtuin 6 labeling index without significant differences between the motor and somatosensory cortex.Our findings contribute to further understanding the sirtuin 6 immunohistochemical changes in the early stages of type II Diabetes mellitus and propose its possible implication in the pathogenic processes associated with Diabetes mellitus and diabetes-induced neurodegeneration.",

Using immunofluorescence of spinal cord tissue of rats from the first postnatal day (P1) until the end of the 5th postnatal week (P36), we observed that these neurons show both immature (doublecortin+, \u03b2-III-tubulin+, neurofilament 200\u00a0kDa\u2212) and more mature (weak NeuN+, P2X2+, GAD65+) characteristics during the first postnatal weeks. Because of the gradually decreasing number of CSF-cNs in the central canal lining during development, we were also interested in the migration potential of these cells. However, the assessment of the number of CSF-cNs in the lining of the central canal during postnatal development revealed that this decline is most likely associated with the growth of the spinal cord. Lastly, to reveal the birth date of CSF-cNs, we performed 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine administration and colocalization analyses. We found that production of these cells appears from day 12 of embryonic development (E12) until E22. The vast majority of CSF-contacting neurons arise on E14 and E15. In contrast with other types of spinal neurons, the production of CSF-cNs is not restricted to a particular neuroepithelial region and occurs even after what is thought to be the termination of neurogenesis.",

The presence of OX1R immunopositive cells in seminiferous tubules of the boar testis enables us to hypothesize a possible role of OXA on male germ cells cycle in pig.

The synthetic melatonin was dissolved in 1% ethanol and added to the drinking water from postnatal week 5\u201313 at a final dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day. Compared with the obese mice, melatonin intake was associated with a significant decrease in body weight and water consumption. Histological analysis showed that the aortic wall of ob/ob mice had a high Tunica media/lumen ratio and that the elastic fibers in the media layer appeared disrupted and degraded. Moreover, the aorta of ob/ob mice displayed a higher degree of collagen accumulation in the Tunica media compared to the normal aorta. The aorta of ob/ob mice treated with melatonin had a lower Tunica media/lumen ratio and collagen accumulation in comparison with untreated ob/ob mice. Our results showed that whereas melatonin had no apparent histological effects on the aorta in lean mice with normal weight, its administration in ob/ob mice can lead to a reduction in body weight and can ameliorate aorta histopathological dysfunction. This experimental study indicates an apparent protective role for melatonin on the aorta in obesity and melatonin could possibly be an effective tool in the management of obesity-related vascular complications.",

     "abstract": "Melanoma, a cancer notorious for its high potential to metastasize, arises from melanocytes, cells dedicated to melanin production and located in the basal layer of the epidermis. Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) is an inhibitory molecule that down-regulates the effects of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The aim of this study was to examine the expression of RKIP and pRKIP in melanomas at different stages. We evaluated the RKIP and pRKIP protein by immunohistochemistry in control skin, pigmented nevi and melanomas, and through Western blotting in human normal melanocytes and in four different melanoma-derived cell lines (WM35, A375, M14, and A2058). Our results demonstrated a correlation between the expression of RKIP and pRKIP, and metastatic ability in melanoma cells. This raises the possibility to analyze both RKIP and pRKIP in all melanomas. Down-regulation of both RKIP and pRKIP expression could represent a useful marker of metastatic melanoma. On the contrary for non-metastatic melanoma, especially in Clark I and II, low RKIP and high pRKIP expression could be indicative. In conclusion, the observed negative correlation of the RKIP and pRKIP expression in metastatic melanomas indicates that expression of these proteins may become a prognostic marker for the progression of human cutaneous melanoma. We propose that the investigation of both RKIP and pRKIP may provide a useful tool indicative for metastatic or non-metastatic melanoma in different Clark's level melanomas. Further studies are required to verify the molecular background of the observed RKIP and pRKIP variations.",

Aorto-aortal and porto-caval anastomoses were performed using the end-to-side microsurgery technique. Graft tissues were compared to the intestinal tissues of the recipients. This study demonstrates that: (1) Distinct injury to the graft mucosa 1\u00a0h after transplantation was accompanied by significant reduction in numbers of epithelial secretory cell populations. The injury was more intense in the mesenteric portion. Six hours after transplantation the graft mucosa was covered by a continuous epithelium, but the number of goblet and Paneth cells was found to be less than 30% of that in the recipient epithelium. (2) In comparison with recipients, myeloperoxidase-positive cell numbers increased significantly in the graft mucosa 1\u00a0h after transplantation. In the epithelial layer, denudation and destruction of villi was associated with a significant reduction in intraepithelial lymphocyte numbers. A significant decrease in mucosal mast cell numbers was detected 6\u00a0h after transplantation. They attained only 10% of the number found in the recipients. (3) Time-dependent changes in the graft mucosa revealed that CD163-positive cells increased significantly in the graft mucosa during 6\u00a0h after transplantation and reached the level found in the recipients. In contrast, the myeloperoxidase-positive cell population significantly decreased in the graft mucosa within the initial 6\u00a0h.",

However, the biological function and clinical significance of OIP5 in human Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (CCRCC) remains unknown. In the present study, we found the expression of OIP5 was markedly upregulated in surgical CCRCC specimens and CCRCC cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that paraffin-embedded archival CCRCC specimens exhibited higher levels of OIP5 expression than normal renal tissues. Further statistical analysis suggested the upregulation of OIP5 was positively correlated with the Fuhrman grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), T classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015), N classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and clinical stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Also, patients with high OIP5 expression dramatically exhibited shorter survival time (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In addition, the OIP5 expression was an independent prognostic marker of overall survival of CCRCC patients in a multivariate analysis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Experimentally, we demonstrated that silencing OIP5 in CCRCC cell lines by specific siRNA clearly inhibited cell growth. In conclusion, our findings suggested that OIP5 could be a valuable marker of CCRCC progression and prognosis, and a promising therapeutic target for CCRCC.",

Furthermore, tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were also determined. In the vehicle-treated SCI group, the renal histology was disturbed compared to controls, whereas the melatonin-treated SCI group showed significantly reduced degeneration of renal tissue as seen by both light and electron microscopy. MDA levels, MPO and SOD activities were increased and GSH levels were decreased in the vehicle-treated SCI group compared to controls. On the other hand, decreased MDA levels and MPO activities and increased GSH levels were observed in the melatonin-treated SCI group compared to vehicle-treated SCI group. These results showed that experimentally induced SCI caused oxidative stress in the rat kidney, whereas melatonin treatment reduced oxidative stress, suggesting that it may be used as a complementary therapy of renal problems occurring following SCI.",

Results measured by MTT (methyl thiazoyltetrazolium) assay showed that cell viability was markedly reduced in a dosage-dependent manner, when treated with paeonol for 24\u00a0h. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining results indicated that the rate of apoptosis in the paeonol pretreatment group was higher than the control group. After co-culture with paeonol, cleaved Caspase 3 protein levels increased while survivin protein levels decreased.

In this study we investigated in experimental adult Sprague-Dawley rats how Iba-1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) (+) resident macrophages in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are activated after a spinal nerve ligation (SNL) or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The activation profile was defined by comparing the responses of resident macrophages against microglia in the spinal cord as they share a common origin. After SNL, the Iba-1 (+) macrophages in L5 DRG reached their activation peak 5 days later, clustered as satellite cells around large A-neurons, expressed the MHC-II marker, but did not show p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 activation and did not secrete IL-18. After STZ-induced diabetes, the Iba-1 (+) macrophages reached their activation peak 1 week later in L4 and L5 DRG, remained scattered between neurons, expressed the MHC-II marker only in L5 DRG, did not show p-p38 and p-ERK1/2 activation and did not secrete any of the investigated cytokines/chemokines. These responses suggest that depending on the type of lesion DRG Iba-1 (+) resident macrophages have different activation mechanisms, which are dissimilar to those in microglia.",

Estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) and Mucin 1 (MUC1), a glycoprotein, are both implicated in breast cancer progression. We assessed whether Anastrozole and RU486 treatment affects the expression of, and relationship between, ER\u03b1 and MUC1 in the ER\u03b1+ MUC1+ MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. MCF-7 cells, treated with physiological concentrations of either Anastrozole or RU486 for 18\u00a0h or 72\u00a0h, were subjected to immunolocalization of both markers. CellProfiler software was used to quantify intensity for statistical analyses. ER\u03b1 expression increased at both time periods following treatment. MUC1 expression increased with RU486-treatment at both times, whereas Anastrozole induced increased MUC1 expression at 72\u00a0h only. The biomarkers demonstrated increased point association at 72\u00a0h within treatment groups despite MUC1 diverging from correlation with ER\u03b1. We propose that tumor progression is independent of MUC1 and ER\u03b1 correlation. These preliminary results indicate that withdrawal of adjuvant treatment may result in residual cell populations expressing increased ER\u03b1 and MUC1. This phenotype may allow enhanced estrogenic and metastatic capacity influencing cancer recurrence, a hypothesis we are investigating further.",

One, three, seven and fourteen days post-surgery, cryostat sections of the spinal cord were examined by conventional histology and by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against F4/80 (microglia/macrophage), GFAP (astroglia), neurofilament, fibronectin, laminin and collagen type IV. Fibronectin immunoreactivity was significantly down-regulated in tenascin-C-deficient mice. Moreover, fourteen days after injury, immunodensity of neurofilament-positive fibers was two orders of magnitude higher along the incision edges of tenascin-C-deficient mice as compared to control mice. In addition, lymphocyte infiltration was seen two days earlier in tenascin-C-deficient mice than in control mice and neutrophil infiltration was increased seven days after injury. The increase in thin neurofilament positive fibers in tenascin-C-deficient mice indicates that lack of tenascin-C alters the inflammatory reaction and extracellular matrix composition in a way that penetration of axonal fibers into spinal cord scar tissue may be facilitated.",

The present electron microscope immunolocalization study indicates that two protein markers for desmosomes such as desmoglein 4 and plakophilins 1 and 3 are still present in mature cortical and cuticle cells. These proteins remain mainly localized in the cornified cytoplasmic side of desmosomal remnants of cortical cells, but also in the delta layer of the extracellular region of the membrane complex. This suggests that the delta layer represents an extensive desmosomal remnant formed between mature cortical cells and in cuticle cells. The endocuticle appears to be the site of accumulation of desmosomal proteins and degraded nuclear material. The cornification of desmosomal junctions in both cortical and cuticle cells likely contributes to stabilize the integrity of the hair shaft.",

Our present results provide evidence for disruption induced by AGEs of the osteoblastic actin cytoskeleton (geodesic domes) and significant alterations in cell morphology with a decrease in cell-substratum interactions leading to an increase in apoptosis of osteoblasts and a decrease in osteoblastic proliferation. High concentrations of alendronate (10\u22125\u00a0M, such as could be expected in an osteoclastic lacuna) further increase osteoblastic morphological and cytoskeletal alterations. However, low doses of alendronate (10\u22128\u00a0M, compatible with extracellular fluid levels to which an osteoblast could be exposed for most of its life cycle) do not affect cell morphology, and in addition are able to prevent AGEs-induced alterations and consequently apoptosis of osteoblasts.",

We found that these testicular developments were closer to that of humans when compared with rats, a species commonly employed in reproductive research. On comparing these results with those obtained from other breeds, there are clear differences favoring the use of this species as a research model in the field of male reproductive biology.",

     "abstract": "Polarized Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) was used to compare the orientation of vibrational chemical groups of bovine tendon collagen bundles (CBs) to that of nylon 6, a simpler polyamide model, in terms of linear dichroism (LD). Subtraction of spectral profiles identified the most significant differences regarding the amide regions. At 1630\u00a0cm\u22121, the CBs displayed higher peak areas and absorbance when positioned perpendicularly (A\u22a5) to the plane of polarized light, in comparison with nylon 6. In contrast, at the 1526\u00a0cm\u22121 amide II spectral region the inverse occurred. In the amide III region (1232\u00a0cm\u22121), the LD was positive and higher for CBs. Dichroic ratios (DR\u00a0=\u00a0A||/A\u22a5) calculated from the average of ten measured spectra for CBs and nylon 6 revealed that the values for CBs were <1.0 in the 3298\u20131655\u00a0cm\u22121 wavenumber range and >1.0 in the 1536\u20131234\u00a0cm\u22121 wavenumber range. From 1535 to 1120\u00a0cm\u22121, nylon 6 displayed DR values higher than those of CBs. The LD band integrated areas were higher in CBs than in nylon 6. The LD differences between CBs and nylon 6 are probably due to a more complex chemical composition and supramolecular oriented architecture in CBs in comparison to nylon 6.",

Tissue factor (TF), an essential initiator of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, is also involved in the angiogenesis and the pannus formation of RA progression. In the present study, we used immunofluorescence and confocal scanning methods to characterize TF immunolocalization in RA synovium. We showed that positive staining of TF could be immunolocalized in synoviocytes, CD19+ B cells and CD68+ macrophages, whereas weak or negative staining of tissue factor could be found in CD34+ endothelial cells of neo-vessels, CD3+ T cells and CD14+ monocytes in RA synovium tissues. Our study demonstrates a detailed local expression of TF in the rheumatoid synovium, and supports the notion that TF, expressed not only by the synoviocytes themselves, but also the infiltrating CD19+ B cells and CD68+ macrophages, is involved in the pannus invasion in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis.",

The birds were subjected to zinc-induced molt by mixing zinc oxide at the rate of 3000\u00a0mg/kg in the feed. After molting, one group was fed control diet (CP16%). The other groups were fed vitamin E (100\u00a0IU/kg), vitamin C (500\u00a0IU/kg), probiotics (50\u00a0mg/L of drinking water), protein (CP14%) and combination of these components. These treatments were given for five weeks. After the feeding period, semen samples were taken and analyzed for semen volume, sperm concentration, motility and dead sperm percentage. Pituitary samples were collected from three birds per replicate and were processed for immunohistochemical study. The results of semen quality parameters revealed that semen volume and sperm motility were significantly high in the vitamin E fed group, while the dead sperm percentage decreased significantly in the vitamin C group. The morphometric analysis revealed that compared to other groups, vitamin E caused a significant increase in the size and area of FSH, LH gonadotropes and lactotropes. These results showed that vitamin E alone may play some role in the enhancement of semen quality and growth of gonadotropes and lactotropes.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Huaier extract on the inhibition of proliferation and promotion of apoptosis in a melanoma cell line, A875, and to explore the possible mechanisms of its anticancer effects. Cell proliferation was measured using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and PCNA-Western blot. The cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis levels were analyzed by flow cytometry, and Western blot was used to test the apoptotic pathways. We found that Huaier extract strongly inhibited cell proliferation of the A875 melanoma cells and induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. P53 expression was increased and cell apoptosis executed by caspase-3. Down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bcl2-associated X protein (BAX) indicated that Huaier extract induced apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. As expected, the inhibitor Huaier decreased melanoma cell line A875 proliferation, and induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that Huaier extract is an effective complementary agent for cancer treatment of melanoma.",

HB-EGF is a promising target for cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to find new insights on the biological features of the soft tissue sarcomas, in order to consider the possibility to use HB-EGF as an immuno-target in histotype characterization and to facilitate therapeutic intervention. In our study we did HB-EGF-immunostaining on tissue samples collected from 43 human soft tissue sarcomas. We analyzed HB-EGF immunoexpression in some types of tumors such as clear cell sarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, phyllodes sarcomas, chondrosarcomas and liposarcomas. In relation to the different histotypes, we detected different immunostaining localization. From our results it was evident that pleomorphic cells, a signal of tumor progression, were HB-EGF immunostained, and this was accompanied by an extracellular matrix immunostaining. Moreover statistical analysis showed a correlation between HB-EGF immunostaining and the different types of analyzed soft tissue sarcomas. In conclusion, in some types of soft tissue sarcoma HB-EGF could be considered a useful diagnostic marker for their characterization.",

Histopathology, Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, Sirius red staining, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) assay, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) were used to examine the livers of the HBx transgenic fish injected with AFB1. We found that HBx and AFB1 synergistically promoted steatosis as indicated by histopathological examinations and the increased expression of lipogenic factors, enzymes, and genes related to lipid metabolism. Moreover, treatment of AFB1 in HBx transgenic fish accelerated the development of liver hyperplasia and enhanced the expression of cell cycle related genes. PCNA was co-localized with active caspase 3 protein expression in HBx zebrafish liver samples and human HBV positive HCC samples by double fluorescence immunostaining. Finally, we found that in human patients with liver disease, significant glycogen accumulated in the inflammation, cirrhosis stage, and all cases of hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma showed a moderate cytoplasmic accumulation of glycogen.

The gene expressions of: somatostatin, cholecystokinin, apelin and the altered active caspase-3, active caspase-8, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, were investigated in the pyloric region of the stomach and antioxidant parameters were measured in all the stomach. Although ghrelin treatment to diabetic rats lowered the stomach lipid peroxidation levels, the stomach glutathione levels were increased. Exogenous ghrelin caused an increased activities of stomach catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase in diabetic rats. Numbers of somatostatin, cholecystokinin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoreactive cells decreased in the diabetic\u00a0+\u00a0ghrelin group compared to the diabetic group. Apelin mRNA expressions were remarkably less in the diabetic\u00a0+\u00a0ghrelin rats than in diabetic rats. The results may indicate that ghrelin treatment has a protective effect to some extent on the diabetic rats. This protection is possibly accomplished through the antioxidant activity of ghrelin observed in type 2 diabetes.

The presence and the distribution of leptin receptor were also investigated in the initial portion of the duodenum, near the duodenal ampulla. The immunohistochemical investigation demonstrates the immunolocalization of both leptin and its receptor in the endocrine cells of pancreatic islets, which led us to hypothesize that leptin may possibly exert an autocrine/paracrine action on the endocrine pancreas. Examination of the exocrine pancreas in the same treated sections showed the presence of leptin-positive cells in the wall of the interlobular ducts where, however, the receptor was not found. This observation led us to consider that some cells of the ducts may perform some minimal secretory activity, and that leptin produced by these ductal cells may reach the duodenum in the pancreatic juice. This hypothesis is enhanced by the presence of leptin-receptor in the duodenum of the same animals, where the epithelial cells of the mucosa showed intense immunolocalization in the brush border. Consequently it is possible that the ductular leptin may play a regulatory role on the functionality of the enterocytes.",

     "abstract": "With the emerging success of commercially available personal computers and the rapid progress in the development of information technologies, morphometric analyses of static histological images have been introduced to improve our understanding of the biology of diseases such as cancer. First applications have been quantifications of immunohistochemical expression patterns. In addition to object counting and feature extraction, laws of thermodynamics have been applied in morphometric calculations termed syntactic structure analysis. Here, one has to consider that the information of an image can be calculated for separate hierarchical layers such as single pixels, cluster of pixels, segmented small objects, clusters of small objects, objects of higher order composed of several small objects. Using syntactic structure analysis in histological images, functional states can be extracted and efficiency of labor in tissues can be quantified. Image standardization procedures, such as shading correction and color normalization, can overcome artifacts blurring clear thresholds. Morphometric techniques are not only useful to learn more about biological features of growth patterns, they can also be helpful in routine diagnostic pathology. In such cases, entropy calculations are applied in analogy to theoretical considerations concerning information content. Thus, regions with high information content can automatically be highlighted. Analysis of the \u201cregions of high diagnostic value\u201d can deliver in the context of clinical information, site of involvement and patient data (e.g. age, sex), support in histopathological differential diagnoses. It can be expected that quantitative virtual microscopy will open new possibilities for automated histological support. Automated integrated quantification of histological slides also serves for quality assurance.

We found that chronic alcohol exposure to mice significantly increased both mRNA and protein levels of FoxO1 in all the examined intestinal segments with the most remarkable changes in the ileum. Alcohol treatment increased mRNA and protein levels of FoxO1 and promoted nuclear translocation of FoxO1 in Caco-2 cells. Furthermore, alcohol treatment with Caco-2 cells resulted in a significant decrease in the epithelial transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value, which was attenuated by knockdown of FoxO1 expression.

     "abstract": "Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign neoplasm of both the major and minor salivary glands. The histological features are diverse and are characterized by the involvement of epithelial\u2013myoepithelial structures. Metallothionein is a cysteine-rich protein present in myoepithelial cells of several benign and malignant neoplasms. The function of metallothionein is associated with DNA protection, oxidative stress and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of metallothionein in pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands. Additionally, we investigated the association of the clinicopathological features of the lesions with metallothionein, specifically its association with Bcl-2, in an attempt to evaluate the role of metallothionein in the control of apoptosis. Thirty-five cases of pleomorphic adenoma were selected and immunohistochemistry was performed for metallothionein and Bcl-2 proteins. The proteins were quantified by the Quickscore method. The samples showed epidemiological characteristics similar to those described in the literature. We did not find an association between the clinicopathological characteristics of pleomorphic adenomas and the proteins studied, but an association between metallothionein and Bcl-2 was demonstrated. The results suggest that metallothionein may have a role in the control of apoptosis in pleomorphic adenoma.",

     "abstract": "We have used human specimens and antibodies to pERK1/2 to detect early development of colon cancer using indirect immunocytochemistry. Two distinct sites were stained; one at the tip of the colon crypts and the other in the stromal tissue associated with the colonic tissue. These foci represent early stages of colon cancer initiation sites as established by enhanced Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Virus (KRAS) and the lack of p53 staining. The enhanced KRAS coincides with the initiation of tumor growth revealed by pERK1/2, both in the tip of the colon crypts, as well as in the stromal initiation site of the colon tumors. Foci of pERK1/2 staining were also detected in 50% of stromal tissue and tips of colon crypts, which were classified as normal tissues, adjacent to the malignant tissue according to general morphology. However, in colon specimens, where no malignancy was observed, no accumulation of pERK1/2 was observed. The staining of pERK1/2 at the stromal foci of the apparently non-malignant tissue appeared as aggregates in the perinuclear region, while in the colon epithelium it appeared in the cell nuclei. In low-grade colon cancer that was still free of induced mutated p53, staining of pERK1/2 was prominent in the cell nuclei, both in the stroma tissue and the tip of the colon crypts. In the intermediate stage, that exhibited significant p53 staining, only a fraction of p53-free tumor cells was labeled with pERK1/2 antibody, while in high-grade tumors, all cells of tumors were labeled with antibodies to p53, but not with antibodies to pERK1/2. We suggest that the down regulation in pERK1/2 labeling is due to the mitogenic capacity of the tumor cells, which are shifted from being driven by nuclear pERK1/2 to mutated p53 expression. We also found that the cytoplasm of low grade tumors was positive for epiregulin, while this labeling decreased in high-grade tumors. We found that the tumors arising from the stroma demonstrated poor structural differentiation, while the tumors initiating from the epithelial cells of the colon demonstrated high structural differentiation. We conclude that pERK1/2 is a sensitive marker of early colon cancer, which disappears at later stages of cancer development. Moreover, pERK1/2 staining can distinguish between tumor cells originating from the tip of the colon crypts and those developing in the stroma, which is present in the close vicinity to colon epithelial tissue, and thus can assist in selecting the appropriate therapy.",

Novel AmpliStain\u2122 detection systems (SDT GmbH, Baesweiler, Germany) seem to overcome these constraints offering a more compact and deformable conjugate design that facilitates agile penetration through the narrowest diffusion pathways in tissue sections. Here, we compared the level of signal amplification achievable with AmpliStain\u2122-HRP (SDT) and EnVision\u2122+-HRP (Dako). Our results show that the AmpliStain\u2122-HRP systems allow higher dilutions of primary antibodies in both immunohistochemistry and ELISA.

Some cells stained specifically in the intestinal mucosa and in tail epidermal cells with the lectins and their affinity changed during metamorphic transformation. For the most part, they decreased in the climax and postmetamorphic periods. It was also found that WGA, DBA and UEA-I lectins exhibited strong affinity to white blood cells in the liver and their binding affinities were the highest in prometamorphosis and they gradually decreased until the end of metamorphosis. These results suggest that the changes of lectin binding in metamorphosis may be an indication of some cellular events occurring in larval metamorphosis such as cell differentiation and damage of cell adhesion between death and differentiating cells. They also can be useful markers for detection of white blood cells in amphibian hematopoietic organs.",

Histological sections of the oviduct isthmus tissue were obtained from 18 women undergoing salpingectomy for hydrosalpinx, and from 15 women undergoing hysterectomy and salpingectomy for benign gynecologic diseases. The tissues were immunohistochemically stained for protein gene product (PGP) 9.5, protein S100, neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to reveal all nerve fibers, as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers, in the oviduct isthmus. We detected the presence of PGP9.5, S100, VIP, and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the oviduct isthmus in all study subjects. However, the densities of PGP9.5, S100, VIP, and NPY-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the oviduct isthmus were all significantly decreased in women with hydrosalpinx compared with those in women without hydrosalpinx (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Colocalization analysis revealed that the colocalization pattern was time-dependent and different for each studied protein.

In the present study, we describe the changes of the dopaminergic system occurring in the cirrhotic rats and concomitantly we investigated the effect of DHEAS on this system in Sprague-Dawley rats using the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a neuronal marker. Rats were submitted to bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery and TH immunohistochemistry was assessed in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), striatum, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the cortex. TH immunoreactivity showed a significant diminution in both SNc and VTA concomitantly with the cortical and the striatal outputs in the BDL rats vs. controls. Three daily injections of 5\u00a0mg/kg of DHEAS to BDL rats significantly normalized TH expression decrease in both SNc and VTA as well as dopaminergic projections to the striatum and the cortex of BDL rats. The present data support an involvement of the dopaminergic system in mild HE and a possible beneficial effect of the neurosteroid DHEAS as a potential pharmacological treatment of mild HE.",

Accordingly, the proportion of the perikarya with calcitonin gene related peptide ranged from 12.667% (\u00b12.66) for the left ganglion compared with 14.875% (\u00b12.33) for the right one. With regard to the neuronal isoform of the nitric oxide synthase expression, our study revealed a population of 18.703% (\u00b12.50) in the left and 13.336% (\u00b11.25) in the right ganglion, respectively. The immunoreactivity for galanin was found in a relatively small population of neurons of the left nodose ganglion, where galanin-immunoreactive perikarya constituted 1.163% (\u00b11.26), while in the contralateral ganglion 0.865% (\u00b10.32) of total perikarya. No nerve fibers immunopositive for the above studied substances were encountered.",

Specifically, Norrin is found to play a crucial role in retinal vascularization. Norrin's pivotal role in angiogenesis led us to investigate its expression and the primary source in the developing retina. In this study we demonstrate, for the first time, that Norrin protein is expressed along the retinal blood vessels. The expression of Norrin coincided with the pattern of vascular growth in the developing mouse retina, and its expression was identified from the endothelial cells of the retinal capillaries. Furthermore, Norrin was also expressed on endothelial cells of the developing human retina. Given that Norrin is crucial in the normal development and maintenance of ocular capillaries, our finding provides a hint of the involvement of Norrin in the self generative and protective mechanism of the endothelial cells in the developing retina.",

     "abstract": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) includes two different morphological subtypes. The differences of genetics and ultrastructure of the two subtypes have been rarely reported. Also, new biomarkers related to the diagnosis and prognosis of PRCC have still not been well elucidated. Immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and transmission electron microscopy were used systematically to determine the characteristics of 56 cases of PRCC and to reveal new diagnostic and prognostic information. Type 1 PRCC presented higher expression rates of EMA and CK7, whereas type 2 presented a higher expression rate of CD10. New immunohistochemical markers, including: p504s, PAX-2, PAX-8 and CA-IX showed extensive immunostaining in PRCC. We first revealed a distinct immunostaining pattern of CA-IX, which was located in multiple foci in PRCC. All tumors had at least one chromosomal aberration including loss of Y, gains of 7 or 17. Gain of chromosome 17 was common in type 1; losses of chromosome 18, 11 and 8 appeared in type 2. Ultrastructurally, glycogen granules and secondary lysosomes were seen in type 1, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum were scattered in type 2. Tumor subtype, nuclear grade, TNM stage, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) component and sarcomatoid elements, metastasis, CAIX expression, losses of chromosome 18 and 8 were related to poor outcome of PRCC. We conclude that the two subtypes of PRCC originate from different renal cells, and arise from partially common genetic pathways. EMA, CK7, CD10, p504s, PAX-2, PAX-8 and CA-IX are helpful markers in the differential diagnosis of PRCC. CA-IX expression, losses of chromosome 18 and 8 are new prognostic factors of PRCC.",

Gait variables, range of motion, serial sarcomeres number, localization and staining intensity of fibronectin, and expressions of types I and III collagen were analyzed. The hypokinesia changed the functional variables of gait, reduced the dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM), increased the number of fibers with intracellular fibronectin/total number of fibers (FIF/TNF), and decreased the expression of the type I collagen. After three days, morphological changes were exacerbated and the number of serial sarcomeres was increased in both groups, immobilized/stretched/free and immobilized/free.

However, only one study has investigated its prognostic value in CCRCC. In the present study, HLA-I protein expression was analyzed in 120 archived, paraffin-embedded CCRCC samples and 10 adjacent normal tissues using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between HLA-I expression and clinicopathological factors was evaluated by the \u03c72 test. Patients\u2019 overall survival was analyzed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. HLA-I down-regulation was observed in 38.3% (46/120) of renal tumor samples, but only in 10% (1/10) of adjacent normal tissues. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of HLA-I expression with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and Fuhrman grade. Patients with tumors displaying down-regulation of HLA-I showed significantly shorter overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021, log-rank test). More importantly, multivariate analysis indicated that down-regulation of HLA-I was an independent prognostic factor for CCRCC patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Overall, our data suggest that HLA-I down-regulation is associated with tumor progression and a poor prognosis in CCRCC patients, and emphasize the importance of HLA-I in natural and therapeutic immune surveillance of patients with CCRCC.",

Using RT-PCR analysis, we observed that MMP-13 mRNA was expressed in immature testis. In Western blot analysis, the expression level of MMP-13 protein peaked in the immature testes during marked tissue remodeling, whereas it gradually decreased during testis maturation. High expression levels of TIMP-1 (34-kDa) and TIMP-2 (55-kDa) were detected only in immature and pre-pubertal testes and not in adult testis. Four different forms of TIMP-2 protein were differentially detected in the testes of growing and adult chicken. Using immunohistochemistry we localized both secreted and intracellular forms of MMP-13, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 proteins. These proteins were temporally and spatially distributed in growing and adult testes, and all their expression levels were similar to the expression profile of Western blot results. These findings suggest that age-related changes of MMP-13 with balance of TIMPs act in concert to effect the controlled testicular remodeling and maturation.",

Traditionally, formaldehyde is employed for such biomolecular preservation in spite of its carcinogenicity. Moreover, formaldehyde induced cross-linking during fixation is reported to alter structural and functional properties of the preserved biomolecules. Therefore, formaldehyde-free preservatives are advantageous because they are safer for laboratory personnel and they protect the structural and functional integrity of the biomolecules. Streck Cell Preservative and Cell-Free DNA BCT reagents are used as formaldehyde alternative preservatives. However, no studies have been carried out to evaluate formaldehyde concentrations in these preservatives. In this study, we evaluated the free formaldehyde concentrations of these reagents by carbon-13 (13C) NMR spectroscopic analysis. Chemically non-invasive NMR analysis is more reliable than the traditional derivatization based techniques in formaldehyde detection. 13C NMR technique can be used for quantitative measurement by using 13C NMR-relaxation agents. In this manuscript, we report an optimized NMR analysis method using Gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate. Additionally the data reported herein provide spectral analyses that indicate Streck Cell Preservative and Cell-Free DNA BCT reagents do not contain detectable free formaldehyde. Therefore, these preservatives are safer alternatives than formaldehyde for laboratory use, which can protect the overall integrity of the biomolecules within preserved samples.",

Ultrastructural studies showed ATO-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Moreover, different patterns of QD-labeled F-actin after ATO treatment were seen. In the case of AU labeling, only a few gold particles were seen and it was impossible to see any difference in F-actin distribution. TEM imaging experiments using QDs and colloidal gold (AU) showed that the strategy of bioconjugation of nanoprobes is the most important factor in biotinylated phalloidin detection of F-actin using streptavidin-coated nanoparticles, especially at the ultrastructural level. Additionally, the results presented in present study confirm the essential role of F-actin in chromatin reorganization during cell death processes.",

As a result, while generated bone was observed in each case that included BMSCs (the BMSCs and combination group), there was no generated bone observed in the group using fibroblasts only.

Ultrastructural analysis of immunolabeling for beta-catenin, plakophilin-1, desmoglein-4 and keratin-17 in human hairs has indicated that adherens junctions and desmosomes initially connect cells in mature IRS and the companion layer. Beta-catenin immunolabeling for adherens junctions is only seen in sparse regions of differentiating Huxley cells, Flugelzellen cells and Henle cells, but disappears in cornified cells of the IRS. Desmoglein-4 and plakophilin-1 immunolabeling are observed in differentiating and cornified desmosomes of the Huxley and Henle layers and in the membrane complex joining these cells. Desmoglein-4 and plakophilin-1 are more frequently immunolocalized in the intracellular side of the junctions, but some labeling is also present in the delta-layer of the membrane complex. The labeling indicates a prevalent intracellular redistribution of desmoglein-4 and plakophilin-1 when the final cornification of the IRS occurs. Intense keratin-17 immunolabeling is observed in tonofilaments of the companion layer joining the plakophilin-1 rich desmosomes of the Henle layer. This suggests that this elastic type of keratin is present at desmosome junctions during the movements of the companion layer along the slippage plane of the hair shaft.",

A subcutaneous endometriosis rat model was established by using auto-transplantation. Expression of PEDF, VEGF and MVD labeled by von Willebrand factor (v-WF) in endometriotic lesions and endometrial tissues was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining. We detected lower PEDF immunostaining and higher VEGF and MVD immunostaining in active lesions in a rat model of endometriosis than that in endometriosis endometrium or control endometrium (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but no differences between endometriosis and control endometrium were found (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In lesions, PEDF expression was negatively correlated with VEGF expression, MVD or sizes of cysts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). On the contrary, both VEGF expression and MVD were positively correlated with lesion sizes (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, VEGF expression was positively correlated with MVD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

A considerable increase was seen in the number of neuroblasts in the SVZa, vertical arm and elbow on day 7 after irradiation. Until days 14 and 21 there was a marked decline in the density of young neurons, mostly in the horizontal arm of the RMS. In contrast, the number of astrocytes gradually increased in the caudal parts of the RMS until day 14 after irradiation. Strong enhancement was replaced by a steep decline within the RMS up to 21 days after treatment.

     "abstract": "One paradigm of cancer development claims that cancer emerges at the niche of tissue stem cells and these cells continue to proliferate in the tumor as cancer stem cells. LGR5, a membrane receptor, was recently found to be a marker of normal colon stem cells in colon polyps and is also expressed in colon cancer stem cells. Nanog, an embryonic stem cell nuclear factor, is expressed in several embryonic tissues, but Nanog expression is not well documented in cancerous stem cells. Our aim was to examine whether both LGR5 and Nanog are expressed in the same clusters of colon stem cells or cancer stem cells, using immunocytochemistry with specific antibodies to each antigen. We analyzed this aspect using paraffin embedded tumor tissue sections obtained from 18 polyps and 36 colon cancer specimens at stages I\u2013IV. Antibodies to LGR5 revealed membrane and cytoplasm immunostaining of scattered labeled cells in normal crypts, with no labeling of Nanog. However, in close proximity to the tumors, staining to LGR5 was much more intensive in the crypts, including that of the epithelial cells. In cancer tissue, positive LGR5 clusters of stem cells were observed mainly in poorly differentiated tumors and in only a few scattered cells in the highly differentiated tumors. In contrast, antibodies to Nanog mainly stained the growing edges of carcinoma cells, leaving the poorly differentiated tumor cells unlabeled, including the clustered stem cells that could be detected even by direct morphological examination. In polyp tissues, scattered labeled cells were immunostained with antibodies to Nanog and to a much lesser extent with antibodies to LGR5. We conclude that expression of LGR5 is probably specific to stem cells of poorly differentiated tumors, whereas Nanog is mainly expressed at the edges of highly differentiated tumors. However, some of the cell layers adjacent to the carcinoma cell layers that still remained undifferentiated, expressed mainly Nanog with only a few cells labeled with antibodies to LGR5. Considering the different sites and pattern of expression in the tumor, our data imply that targeting the clustered stem cells expressing LGR5 in poorly differentiated colon cancer may require different strategies than targeting the stem cells expressing Nanog in the highly differentiated tumors. Alternatively, combined application of specific inhibitory miRNAs to Nanog and to LGR5 expression may assist therapeutically.",

     "abstract": "LGR5 and Nanog were recently characterized as stem cell markers in various embryonic, adult and cancer stem cells. However, there are no data on their precise localization in the normal adult ovary, which may be important for the initial steps of development of ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer. We analyzed by immunocytochemistry the precise localization of these markers in normal ovary (11 specimens, age range 43\u201376), in borderline specimens (12 specimens), and in serous ovarian cancer (12 specimens of stage II) which comprises the vast majority (80%) of all ovarian cancer. Surprisingly, we revealed that both Nanog and LGR5 are clearly localized in the epithelial cells of the normal ovary. However, in 5 of 12 ovaries there was no labeling at all, while in 3 ovaries staining of Nanog was more prominent with only weak labeling of LGR5. In addition, we found in 3 of 11 ovaries clear labeling in foci of both LGR5 and Nanog antibodies, with partial overlapping. Occasionally, we also found in the stroma foci labeled by either Nanog or LGR5 antibodies. In general, the stroma area of tissue sections labeled with LGR5 was much greater than that labeled with Nanog. In borderline tumors a significant portion of the specimens (7 of 12) was labeled exclusively with Nanog and not with LGR5. In ovarian carcinomas almost 100% of the cells were exclusively labeled only with Nanog (6 of 12 of the specimens) with no labeling of LGR5. These data may suggest the potential of ovaries from postmenopausal women, which express Nanog, to undergo transformation, since Nanog was shown to be oncogenic. We conclude that Nanog, which probably plays an important role in ovarian embryonic development, may be partially silenced in fertile and post-menopausal women, but is re-expressed in ovarian cancer, probably by epigenetic activation of Nanog gene expression. Expression of Nanog and LGR5 in normal ovaries and in borderline tumors may assist in the early detection and improved prognosis of ovarian cancer. Moreover, targeting of Nanog by inhibitory miRNA or other means may assist in treating this disease.",

Different HPV subtypes could regulate the cell cycle of infected cells at different levels. To date, the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E in Bowenoid papulosis (BP) tissues and its association with HPV infection still remains elusive. In the present study, genotyping was performed to identify the HPV subtypes in 44 BP specimens. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of cell cycle related proteins cyclin D1 and cyclin E in BP tissues as well as normal tissues. We found that there were 20 patients with hrHPV subtypes, 6 patients with lrHPV subtypes, and 18 patients with combined high and low (hr/lr) HPV subtypes.

The study included 83 patients. Slides were stained immunohistochemically for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, CK5/6, CK14, EGFR, Ki-67 and AR. Of the 83 TNBC samples, 32.5% showed positive immunostaining for AR, 66.3% had BL immunophenotype, and 48.2% had BL morphology. Positive AR immunostaining was inversely correlated with higher clinical stage, higher mitotic score, higher histological grade and higher proliferation index measured by Ki-67. Significantly more AR negative tumors were observed among the tumors with BL immunophenotype and BL morphology. There was no significant association between positive AR immunostaining and disease free survival or overall survival.

We examined the subcellular localization of \u03b1-ENaC in such larval and adult skins. Immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopy of apical cells in the larval epidermis revealed \u03b1-fENaC localization within intracellular vesicles, but not in the plasma membrane. In contrast, in adult skin \u03b1-fENaC was localized to the apical-side membrane and to intracellular vesicles in Stratum granulosum cells. This may support the view that amiloride-blockable SCC is absent from larval skin, but is present in adult skin.",

Another hallmark in CHF is a reduced exercise tolerance with impaired skeletal muscle function. The aim of this study was to investigate in an animal model the impact of Ang-II on skeletal muscle function and concomitant molecular alterations. Mice were infused with Ang-II for 4 weeks. Subsequently, skeletal muscle function of the soleus muscle was assessed. Expression of selected proteins was quantified by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Infusion of Ang-II resulted in a 33% reduction of contractile force, despite a lack of changes in muscle weight. At the molecular level an increased expression of NAD(P)H oxidase and a reduced expression of Sirt1, PGC-1\u03b1 and IGF-1 were noticed. No change was evident for the ubiquitin E3-ligases MuRF1 and MafBx and \u03b1-sarcomeric actin expression. Cytophotometrical analysis of the soleus muscle revealed a metabolic shift toward a glycolytic profile. This study provides direct evidence of Ang-II-mediated, metabolic deterioration of skeletal muscle function despite preserved muscle mass. One may speculate that the Ang-II-mediated loss of muscle force is due to an activation of NAD(P)H oxidase expression and a subsequent ROS-induced down regulation of IGF-1, PGC-1\u03b1 and Sirt1.",

Considering the specificity of cattle feeding and digestion, CART may play a highly significant role possibly associated with the option of administering greater amounts of high-volume feeds. Based on the results of immunohistochemical staining of abomasum samples prepared from hybrid bulls, the presence of CART-positive structures and CART distribution were determined in the mucosa, submucosa and muscularis layers of the stomach. Abundant sites of CART were found in the myenteric plexus, nerve fibers innervating the myocytes of the myenteron, neuroendocrine cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system and the submucous plexus. The preliminary stage of abomasal CART detection suggests that CART is an agent that strongly affects the regulation of motor activity involved in stomach emptying and in secretory functions of the stomach.

Ultrastructural alterations were investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Sperm morphology seemed to be more affected after cryopreservation in samples obtained from smokers. Ultrastructural examination showed alterations in the integrity of the membranes and increased subacrosomal swelling. Before freezing, the increase in DNA fragmentation rate in smokers was not statistically significant compared to that of non-smokers. However, after thawing, the DNA fragmentation rates were significantly high in both non-smokers and smokers compared to their respective rates before freezing. The extent of the increase in DNA fragmentation rate was significantly higher in smokers after thawing compared to that of non-smokers.

Mouse preadipocytic cell lines such as 3T3-L1, as well as primary derived preadipocytes, are important models to study adipogenic differentiation and obesity. However, in vitro adipogenic differentiation of primary derived preadipocytes remains incomplete, and identification of factors that will improve the adipogenic differentiation process is thus of high value. In this study we show that horse serum fails to improve adipogenic differentiation of mouse preadipocytes (both 3T3-L1 cells and primary derived mouse preadipocytes) as otherwise reported for bone marrow derived adipogenic precursors. Unexpectedly, while Dlk1 levels were indeed decreased using horse serum, this did not correlate with a high degree of adipogenic differentiation. In conclusion, our novel results thus reveal that horse serum clearly is insufficient for adipogenic differentiation of mouse preadipocytes and that low levels of Dlk1 alone are a poor marker of mouse in vitro adipogenesis. We would also like to emphasize that it is very important for the field of cellular differentiation that researchers thoroughly investigate the effect of individual reagents in their protocols.

The number of VIP-immunoreactive (VIP-ir) neurons in the Nucleus inferioris hypothalami (IH) and Nucleus infundibuli hypothalami (IN) of hens rearing chicks (R) were compared with those of non-rearing chicks (NR). Plasma PRL levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The localization and number of VIP-ir neurons were determined by immunohistochemistry. The numbers of VIP-ir neurons in the IH\u2013IN areas were high in the R hens, whereas the number of VIP-ir neurons decreased in the NR hens as compared to their respective R hens. During the rearing period, changes in the VIP-ir neurons within the IH\u2013IN were correlated with plasma PRL levels. The results of the present study indicate for the first time that the VIP/PRL system plays a role in neuroendocrine reorganization to establish maternal behavior in native Thai chickens. The VIP/PRL system functions not only as a well established key regulator of incubation behavior, but is also involved in the regulation of rearing behavior. It is possible that VIP and the decline in the number of VIP-ir neurons and in turn VIPergic activity and the decrease in PRL levels are related to their contribution to rearing behavior of this non-seasonal breeding, equatorial precocial species.",

     "abstract": "Lectins belong to a family of glycoproteins that can act both beneficially and detrimentally on the morphology of the small intestine. The aim of the study was to determine whether experimental treatment with red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) lectin influences the chemical code of the small intestine nervous system of suckling pigs. The immunolocalization sites of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), substance P (SP) and galanin were determined in control and lectin-treated animals. In all segments of the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), the subpopulations of VIP-, NOS-, SP- and galanin-immunoreactive (IR) myenteric neurons were unchanged. After lectin stimulation, increased proportions of NOS-IR and decreased numbers of VIP-IR submucous neurons/mucosa innervating nerve fibers were observed in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. In lectin-treated animals down-regulation of submucous neurons expressing SP and up-regulation of galanin-IR submucous neurons were seen in the duodenum and jejunum (but not in the ileum). The distribution patterns of NOS-IR, galanin-IR and SP-IR nerve fibers supplying the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of the lectin-treated animals showed no substantial differences in relation to control piglets. We conclude that exposure to red kidney bean (P. vulgaris) lectin substantially changes the chemical content of VIP, NOS, SP and galanin in submucous neurons of the small intestine. These results are in line with previous findings outlining the key role(s) of these substances in enteric neuroplasticity processes and may constitute the basis for further functional studies on maturation of the gut.",

In the secretory cells, reactive gold particles representing lysozyme were mainly detectable in the secretory granules and Golgi bodies.

Western blot analysis revealed transitorily elevated levels in StarD6, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) and 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase (Ogg1) in accord with the DNA damage marker phosphorylated H2AX. Immunohistochemistry revealed that increased intensity was transiently seen not only in the Stratum (Str.) radiatum and Str. lacunosum-moleculare with StarD6 and APE, but also in the Str. pyramidale with Ogg1. Intensities decreased 24\u00a0h after domoic acid injection in CA3 with APE and Ogg1 as well as in the Str. radiatum and Str. lacunosum-moleculare with StarD6 and APE.

HER2 oncoprotein is overexpressed or undergoes gene amplification in approximately 30% of invasive breast carcinomas and 20% of gastric adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of HER2 is primarily detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on neoplastic tissue sections. We produced five murine hybridoma clones secreting monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against HER2 protein. For hybridoma production, spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with a recombinant fragment of the extracellular portion of HER2 (rHER2) were fused to SP2/O-Ag14 cells, selected in HAT medium and screened by indirect ELISA. MAbs secreted were characterized according to isotypes, functional affinity constants, reaction with the native protein in MCF-7 cells by indirect immunofluorescence and in tissue sections from HER2 positive breast cancer specimens by IHC. Two MAbs were IgG2b and three were IgG1, and their affinity constants ranged from 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 to 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0M\u22121.

Cx36 punctate immunostaining was also evident in the intestine with localization restricted to the myenteric plexus of both the ileum and the colon, and this detection was also confirmed by Western blotting and RT-PCR.

In order to clarify some of these processes, the present study reports on the identification and function of aquaporin proteins in the sea urchin. Our results show, by immunoblot, immunoelectron microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis, the presence of aquaporin1- and aquaporin3-like proteins in virgin eggs and in early embryogenesis of Paracentrotus lividus and, by using known inhibitors of aquaporin functions, the functional and relevant role of aquaporin-3 in the fertilization process. AQP3 in particular seems to play a crucial role in high velocity water flux formations involved in the detachment of the vitelline layer during the slow block of polyspermy, while the presence of AQP1 and the increase of AQP3 in the first phase of the P. lividus developmental cycle, suggest their involvement in the appropriate homeostasis for embryo development.",

The results showed that from P0 to P56, CaMKII expression increased gradually, while NR2B expression decreased gradually, and the time points of their expression peak differed in CA1, CA3, and DG during postnatal development. Although the expression of CaMKII was negatively correlated with NR2B in CA1 and DG, the coexpression of CaMKII with NR2B existed in CA1, CA3, and DG during postnatal development. Interestingly, after P21, CaMKII expression and the coexpression of CaMKII with NR2B became obvious in the Stratum lucidum of CA3. The specific temporospatial distribution pattern of CaMKII with NR2B might be related to the different physiological functions during postnatal development. Discovery of the alteration of the relationship between expression of CaMKII and NMDAR subunits may be helpful for understanding mechanisms and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This study involved 25 children (17 girls and 8 boys) aged 7 months to 10 years treated for unilateral Wilms\u2019 tumor. 25 tissue samples of Wilms\u2019 tumor and 5 samples of normal human kidneys were obtained from the Department of Pathological Anatomy, Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin, Slovak Republic. We used an indirect immunohistochemical method to determine expression of Pgp/MDR1, MRP1 and wild-type p53 in 25 tissue samples of nephroblastoma. The minority of nephroblastoma specimens showed positivity for both MDR proteins, as well as for wild-type p53. 24% of tissue samples revealed positive results for Pgp/MDR1, 48% for MRP1 and 8% for wild-type p53.

Both alcohol-based fixatives preserved the tissue architecture and the specificity of immunoreactivity in excellent quality; the trimming approach did not result in detectable differences. Oligonucleotide fragments of length between 108 and 577 base pairs were amplified from all groups of alcohol-fixed skeletal muscle specimens in amounts comparative to the unfixed muscle tissue.

Relative optical density analysis showed increased expression in the material derived from animals treated with flutamide. The presence of AR in the placental barrier and in the umbilical cord components suggests a role of androgen in those temporary organs.

We previously used isobaric tags for a relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics approach to identify differentially expressed proteins in ESCC tissue as compared to the adjacent normal mucosa. Cornulin was identified as one of the major downregulated molecules in ESCC. Cornulin is a member of the S100 fused-type protein family, which has an EF-hand calcium binding motif and multiple tandem repeats of specific peptide motifs. Cornulin was 5-fold downregulated in ESCC as compared to normal epithelium mirroring our previous findings in a gene expression study of ESCC. In the present study, we performed immunohistochemical validation of cornulin (CRNN) in a larger set of patients with ESCC. Downregulation of cornulin was observed in 89% (n\u00a0=\u00a0239) of 266 different ESCC tissues arrayed on tissue microarrays (TMAs). Expression of cornulin was observed in the prickle and functional cell layers of normal esophageal mucosa, localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region. The large majority of ESCC cases had little or no expression of cornulin in the carcinoma or stroma. These findings suggest that cornulin is an important molecule in normal esophageal pathology and is likely lost during the conversion of normal to neoplastic epithelium.",

In order to help clarify the etiology of the pathological effects of asbestos, cellular reactions to natural and synthetic asbestos fibers were compared using a lung alveolar cancer cell line (A549 epithelial cells), considered the first target of inhaled micro-environmental contaminants. Natural asbestos tremolite (NAT) fibers were collected from rocks in NW Italy. Synthetic asbestos tremolite (SAT) was iron-free and therefore considered as standard tremolite. Both fibers, subjected to mineralogical characterization by X-ray powder diffractometry, electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometry, fell within the definition of respirable and potentially carcinogenic fibers. Several signs of functional and structural cell damage were found after treatment with both fibers, documented by viability, motility, and morphological perturbations. Phalloidin labeling showed irregular distribution of cytoskeletal F-actin, whereas immunohistochemical investigations showed abnormal expression of VEGF, Cdc42, \u03b2-catenin, assessed as risks indicators for cancer development. Both fibers caused significant loss of viability, even compared to UICC crocidolite, but, while SAT fibers exerted a more direct cytotoxic effect, survival of damaged cells expressing high VEGF levels was detected after NAT contact. This in vitro pilot study outlines potential health risks of NAT fibers in vivo related to their iron content, which could trigger signaling networks connected with cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation.",

One hundred and sixty-one (161) patients diagnosed with breast cancer negative for estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) were included. Of the total, 58 patients had double negative HER2-overexpressing (ER/PR-negative and HER2-positive) and 103 had triple negative (ER-negative, PR-negative and HER2-negative). ER and PR expression was assessed through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HER2 expression was measured by immunohistochemistry and Fluorescent in situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis in tissue microarray. More than 80% had stages II and III disease and histologic grade III and nuclear grade 3. Patients with triple negative breast carcinoma had undifferentiated histologic types in 11% of cases and vascular invasion in 14.5%. Both groups had more than 50% visceral metastases. HER2 expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.42) and vascular invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) did not interfere with survival. Survival of patients with Stages I-II disease was significantly longer than in those with Stage III disease both for double negative HER2-overexpressing carcinomas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and triple negative carcinomas (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The study shows that hormone receptor-negative breast carcinomas were undifferentiated and diagnosed at advanced stages and that HER2 expression was not associated with overall survival.",

     "abstract": "Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a member of the serine/threonine kinases, has been implicated in oncogenesis and progression of human cancers. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of ILK in lung cancer aggressiveness and the underlying molecular mechanisms. ILK protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, and a series of in vitro assays was conducted to elucidate the function of ILK in lung cancer. Overexpression of ILK protein was detected in 30.6% (33/108) of primary NSCLC tissues and correlated with the TNM stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033). Ectopic overexpression of ILK in lung cancer cells promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro, and led to the acquisition of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, as evidenced by the spindle-like morphology, down-regulation of E-cadherin, and up-regulation of vimentin, fibronectin, Snail and Slug. In addition, the down-regulation of E-cadherin induced by ILK was significantly reversed by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) inhibitor BAY 11-7028 and small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting NF-\u03baB p65, suggesting a role of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in ILK-induced EMT. Overall, our results suggest that ILK promotes lung cancer cell migration and invasion through the induction of EMT process.",

The survival was assessed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and proportional hazards model. Results showed that positive FOXP1 expression was detected in 68 (73.9%) cases and positive p65 expression was detected in 56 (60.9%) cases. There were 46 (50.0%) co-expression of FOXP1 and p65 protein in all cases, a positive correlation between the expression of FOXP1 and p65 was noted (r\u00a0=\u00a00.234, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025). The status of FOXP1 was correlated with patient's age, worse performance status score, higher lactate dehydrogenase levels and International Prognostic Index (IPI) factor score. The status of p65 was correlated with patient's age, B symptom and higher IPI factor scores. Both FOXP1 and p65 protein expression were associated with the non-GCB phenotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 or 0.000). The Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that both FOXP1 and p65 expression were associated with poor survival of patients.

In order to investigate the possible causes of pruritus, the epidermis of the thigh of 12 dialysis patients and 4 controls from patients without renal disease were examined. The sections of the epidermis were measured and immunohistochemically analyzed using antibodies to Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3 proteins and TUNEL method. While the mean thickness of normal epidermis was 53\u00a0\u03bcm, in dialysis patients it ranged between 23 and 34\u00a0\u03bcm during the 3\u20135 year period on dialysis. Compared to normal skin, the fine balance between the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins did not greatly change in the epidermis of dialysis patients during the three years of dialysis. Following five-year dialysis, the epidermis displayed increased Bax and decreased Bcl-2 expression in the basal and intermediate epidermal layers, as well as the presence of apoptotic cells (TUNEL and caspase-3 positive) both in the superficial and intermediate epidermal layers. Our study demonstrated the predominant expression of cell death Bax proteins over cell survival Bcl-2 proteins, and apoptotic cells in the deeper layers of the epidermis in patients on long-term dialysis. We speculate that the thinning of the epidermis might be associated with the appearance of dead cells in the deeper epidermal layers, while the changed internal milieu of epidermal cells could possibly affect the intra-epidermal nerve endings thus leading to the sensation of pruritus.",

FOXP3 in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on some tumor cells are known to be important for tumor escape and clinical tumor formation. Since FOXP3 was found recently in some tumor cells, we speculated if lung tumor cells express FOXP3 and then mimic Tregs to promote tumor escape. As TLR4 induces activation of Tregs, we also hypothesized that FOXP3 and TLR4 may have a correlation in NSCLC progression. The expression levels of FOXP3 and TLR4 protein were detected using immunohistochemistry in 53 postoperative specimens of NSCLC patients and in 15 normal lung tissues from excisions of benign lesion. The relationship between protein expression levels and clinical pathology parameters, as well as the relationship between the expression of FOXP3 and TLR4, were analyzed. FOXP3 and TLR4 expression in NSCLC were significantly elevated as compared to normal lung tissue. FOXP3 expression was closely related with lymph node metastasis and TNM staging, whereas TLR4 expression was closely related with tumor differentiation. The Spearman correlation coefficient indicated a significant positive correlation between FOXP3 and TLR4 expression. These results indicate that FOXP3 and TLR4 may coordinate to play a role in tumor escape and subsequent tumor progression.",

In the present study we assessed the distribution of serotonin, acetylcholine and catecholamines in the gills of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and goldfish (Carassius auratus) using immunohistochemistry, and an activity-dependent dye, Texas Red hydrazide (TXR). In fish the putative oxygen sensing cells are neuroepithelial cells (NECs) and the focus in recent studies has been on the role of serotonin in oxygen chemoreception. The NECs of trout and goldfish contain serotonin, but, in contrast to the glomus cells of mammals, not acetylcholine or catecholamines. Acetylcholine was expressed in chain and proximal neurons and in extrinsic nerve bundles in the filaments. The serotonergic NECs did not label with the HNK-1 antibody suggesting that if they are derived from the neural crest, they are no longer proliferative or migrating. Furthermore, we predicted that if serotonergic NECs were chemosensory, they would increase their activity during hypoxia (endocytose TXR), but following 30\u00a0min of hypoxic exposure (45\u00a0Torr), serotonergic NECs did not take up TXR. Based on these and previous findings we propose several possible models outlining the ways in which serotonin and acetylcholine could participate in oxygen chemoreception in completing the afferent sensory pathway.",

Vessel-associated cells expressing VEGFR-3 were found to be perivascular astrocytes in the peri-infarct region, whereas in the ischemic core, where astrocytes had virtually disappeared, induction of VEGFR-3 mRNA and protein was still prominent in vascular structures 3\u20137 days after reperfusion. VEGFR-3 and nestin expression were colocated in almost all cells associated with the vasculature in the ischemic core, and most (\u223c82%) of the VEGFR-3/nestin double-labeled cells were proliferative. A subpopulation of these VEGFR-3-expressing cells appeared to be included in two immunophenotypically distinct perivascular cells: NG2-positive pericytes and ED2- or OX6-perivascular macrophages. However, most of these cells did not show markers for vasculature-associated cell types such as endothelial cells, microglia/macrophages, and smooth muscle cells.

     "abstract": "Oogenesis involves a sequence of cellular divisions and developmental changes leading to the formation of oocytes, whose role in development is to transfer genomic information to the next generation. During this process, the gene expression pattern changes considerably concomitant with genome remodeling, while genomic information is maintained. The development of the gonad in zebrafish is unique in that it goes through an initial ovarian phase and subsequently into either ovarian or testicular phases. How the germ cells choose to commit to an oogenic fate and enter meiosis or alternatively not to enter meiosis and commit to a spermatogenetic fate remains a key question in development. Lack of suitable markers has hampered the understanding of the principles controlling sex differentiation in zebrafish. The current study was aimed at finding substantive cytochemical markers to identify specific oocyte stages primarily focusing on the DNA and RNA component of cells, using fluorescent dyes: acridine orange and propidium iodide. The pattern of synthesis and appearance of nucleoli was stage specific and may be used to identify stages of oogenesis. A distinguishing and possibly diagnostic feature of the staining pattern observed was the low level of chromatin staining compared to other cellular structures. This may be related to the more diffuse state of chromatin that occurs prior to thickening of chromosomes from the pachytene stage onwards. Although the fluorescent dyes may be useful in determining the localization of nucleic acids in tissue sections, it was not possible to quantify the relative contribution of the DNA and RNA components of specific stages of oocyte growth.",

Trichrome staining gives false positives that may be related to the chemical characteristics of both matrix components and dyes. By contrast, Sirius red constitutes a highly reliable method to detect collagen distribution. On the other hand, orcein heavily stains the bulbus of all teleosts examined. This includes the bulbus of the Antarctic teleosts, which do not show structurally discernable elastin fibers. In these cases, orcein may be staining non-elastin components, or basic elastin components not assembled into larger units. In the teleost bulbus, accurate identification of collagen and elastin cannot be based solely on histochemistry, but should be accompanied by structural identification of the components under study.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the expression and localization of GDF9, its receptor, ALK5, and its latent target protein, claudin-11 (one of TJ proteins) in adult alpaca testis using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Western blotting results demonstrated that GDF9, ALK5 and claudin-11 were expressed in the adult alpaca testis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that GDF9 was expressed stage-specifically in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids of the adult alpaca seminiferous epithelium. Type I receptor, ALK5 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of round spermatids and Leydig cells, and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes and Sertoli cells. Its latent target protein, claudin-11, was perpendicular or parallel to the basal lamina in the basal part of Sertoli cells. These results indicated that GDF9, as a paracrine and autocrine growth factor derived from round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes, is involved in regulating spermatogenesis via action on germ cells or somatic cells (i.e. Leydig cells, Sertoli cells).",

Our data suggest that MAT2A plays an important role in gastric cancer development and progression.",

Our results showed that JARID1B and PHF2 were overexpressed in ESCCs. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between JARID1B nuclear expression level and histological grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis showed a tendency that high cytoplasmic expression of JARID1B and PHF2 was associated with decreased overall survival of ESCC patients, whereas JARID1B high expression in the nucleus was associated with high overall survival, although there was no statistical significance.

However, the signaling molecules involved in these skin anomalies due to Gsdma3 mutations have not yet been addressed. In this study, using hematoxylin and eosin staining, we showed that Gsdma3 mutation gave rise to thickened skin and lengthened hair infundibula throughout the hair follicle cycle. Using immunofluoresence staining, we found that Gsdma3 had a spatial expression profile very similar to that of \u03b2-catenin in the epidermis and skin appendages. Furthermore, we showed that epidermal \u03b2-catenin expression was increased at all postnatal stages in Gsdma3 mutant mice.

Apart from a nuclear expression observed in the urogenital system, its precise localization in other developing human tissues is still largely unknown. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate immunohistochemically the temporal and spatial distribution of WT1 in epithelial and mesenchymal developing human tissues from gestational weeks 7\u201324. For this purpose we used antibodies against the N-terminal of WT1. As might be expected, WT1 nuclear expression was observed in mesonephric/metanephric glomeruli, metanephric blastema, celom-derived membranes (pleura, peritoneum, serosal surfaces) and sex cords. With regard to mesenchymal tissues, a similar nuclear staining was also obtained in the mesenchyme surrounding M\u00fcllerian and Wolffian ducts, as well as in the submesothelial mesenchymal cells of all celomatic-derived membranes. The most striking finding was the detection of strong WT1 cytoplasmic immunostaining in developing skeletal and cardiac muscle cells and endothelial cells. The tissue-specific expression of WT1, together with its different nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, both suggest that WT1 protein may have shuttling properties, acting as a protein with complex regulator activity in transcriptional/translation processes during human ontogenesis. The reported cytoplasmic expression of WT1 in human rhabdomyosarcomas and in many vascular tumors strongly suggests an oncofetal expression of this protein. Although not specific, WT1 cytoplasmic expression can be used as a marker of skeletal muscle and endothelial differentiation in an appropriate morphological context.",

Having suitable in vitro and in vivo models is important for understanding the pathogenesis and developing treatment strategies for bone metastasis in humans.In order to improve and characterize an in vitro model of bone metastasis from breast cancer an MRMT-1 rat breast carcinoma cell line or their conditioned medium were directly co-cultured with rat monocytes. To confirm the in vitro results, an in vivo model, in which MRMT-1 cells were inoculated into the proximal surface of the tibia, was also adopted. Osteoclast viability, activity and differentiation showed a significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005, respectively) between co-culture with MRMT-1 cells and the other culture conditions. Moreover, scanning electron microscopy analysis, phalloidin staining and 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear acid staining confirmed that co-culture with MRMT-1 cells also induced a greater differentiation in osteoclast structure and morphology. Finally, the in vivo outcome at 3 weeks showed the presence of a severe osteolytic lesion, thus confirming the effectiveness of the present in vitro results. These results demonstrated an improvement of an in vitro model of bone metastases from breast cancer in which co-culture with MRMT-1 cells was shown to be a dynamic system that closely mimics the in vivo situation.

     "abstract": "FOXM1, a member of the Forkhead Box (Fox) family of transcription factors, plays a critical role in tumor development and metastasis. The aim of this study was to elucidate its role in colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly prognosis and metastasis. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot assays were used to measure the expression levels of FOXM1 mRNA and protein in 15 CRC and adjacent normal mucosa tissues. Immunohistochemical assay was performed to detect FOXM1 protein expression in 112 CRC tissues and further determine its clinicopathological and prognostic significance. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown endogenous FOXM1 expression in CRC cell lines and to analyze the effects of FOXM1 knockdown on migration and invasion of CRC cells. The relative expression levels of FOXM1 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal mucosa tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In addition, the immunostaining of FOXM1 protein was stronger in CRC tissues than in adjacent normal mucosa tissues. By statistical analysis, we showed that high FOXM1 expression was closely correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis, incidence of liver metastasis, and advanced TNM stage. Moreover, the cumulative 5-year survival rate of CRC patients with high FOXM1 expression was lower than that of those with low FOXM1 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0047). Multivariate analysis showed that the status of FOXM1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025). Furthermore, RNAi-mediated FOXM1 knockdown could significantly inhibit growth, migration and invasion of CRC cells. Our results showed that FOXM1 over-expression is a molecular marker predicting increased invasive/metastatic potential of CRC and a poorer prognosis.",

Here we investigated the structure and the role of autonomic nerves in the physostome swim bladder of the cyprinid goldfish (Carassius auratus) and the respiratory bladder of lepisosteids: the longnose gar and the spotted gar (Lepisosteus osseus and L. oculatus) to demonstrate that these organs have different innervation patterns that are responsible for controlling different functional aspects. The goldfish swim bladder is a richly innervated organ mainly controlled by cholinergic and adrenergic innervation also involving the presence of non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurotransmitters (nNOS, VIP, 5-HT and SP), suggesting a simple model for the regulation of the swim bladder system. The pattern of the autonomic innervation of the trabecular muscle of the Lepisosteus respiratory bladder is basically similar to that of the tetrapod lung with overlapping of both muscle architecture and control nerve patterns. These autonomic control elements do not exist in the bladders of the two species studied since they have very different physiological roles. The ontogenetic origin of the pulmonoid swim bladder (PSB) of garfishes may help understand how the expression of these autonomic control substances in the trabecular muscle is regulated including their interaction with the corpuscular cells in the respiratory epithelium of this bimodal air-breathing fish.",

VEGF is a cytokine which can be induced by hypoxia, whose pathogenic mechanisms are still unclear and which is the subject of debate. Murine cutaneous lesions during Leishmania amazonensis parasite infection are chronic, although they are small and self-controlled in C57BL/6 mice and severe in BALB/c mice.

Hypoxia was detected in lesions from BALB/c mice by pimonidazole marking, which occurred earlier than in lesions from C57Bl/6 mice.

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation increases the risk of development of several types of malignancies including colon cancer. It also represents a paradigm for the connection between inflammation and cancer in terms of epidemiology and mechanistic studies in preclinical models. A key component of inflammation promoting cancer is the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which is known to play a critical role in the regulation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene. iNOS is an enzyme dominantly expressed during inflammatory reactions. Although synthesis of high amounts of nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS has been demonstrated in pathophysiological processes, such as acute or chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis, the role of iNOS activity in these diseases is still not well understood. Analysis of human biopsies of colitis and colon cancer using immunohistochemistry revealed elevated iNOS protein expression levels, which were strongly paralleled by increased expression of nitrotyrosine suggesting that iNOS has been highly activated in these tissues. These results were corroborated in an in vitro study showing the presence of high iNOS levels in a colon cancer cell line (HT-29) following inflammatory stimuli (TNF-\u03b1, peroxynitrite). In addition, the involvement of metastatic processes in the colon biopsies was assessed by means of in situ zymography of MMP activation. MMP 2 (gelatinase A) activation was higher in histopathological sections of colitis and cancer compared to controls. Overall, these data strengthen the findings that in inflammation and colon cancer in humans, iNOS expression and tyrosine nitration may be an indicator of cancer development and progression.",

Paraquat (60\u00a0mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally with or without chitosan oligosaccharide (500\u00a0mg/kg, p.o.) pretreatment. The changes on calretinin were compared with those of calbindin D-28k by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis. Calretinin was immunolocalized on the apical surface of proximal tubule cells in the deeper cortex of normal kidney, and disappeared after paraquat administration with minor changes of calbindin D-28k immunoreactivity in the distal tubules and collecting ducts. Chitosan oligosaccharide pretreatment caused increased expression of calretinin and calbindin D-28k before paraquat injection and helped preserve proximal tubules after paraquat treatment. However, Western blot analysis on calretinin and calbindin D-28k could not explain the degeneration of the proximal tubule cells in paraquat-induced nephrotoxicity.

We used cardiac samples (sinoatrial nodes/right atrial walls) from cadavers of normal and diabetic donors (6 normal adults, 10 type II diabetic adults, 1 child) for neurofilament immune labeling. Positive labeling of endothelial cells, microvascular and endocardial, was obtained in all samples. As this is the first such evidence, we can only presume that the neurofilament positive labeling of endothelial cells may be due to interactions of nestin and neurofilaments. Further studies are needed to evaluate the hypothesis we reached and, in order to explore whether or not neurofilament antibodies can qualify as markers of angiogenesis.",

Distribution of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 were evaluated on MCF-7 cells following gemcitabine and 5-FU treatment and in the absence of drug treatment by an indirect immunohistochemical method. It was observed that JAK1, JAK3, STAT5 and particularly STAT2 activation were more effective than the other JAK/STATs in breast cancer progression. Following treatment with 5-FU, JAK1 and STAT5 immunoreactivities were decreased in MCF-7 cells in comparison with both gemcitabine-treated and non-treated groups. These results suggest that the JAK/STAT pathway plays an important role in breast cancer pathogenesis and may be more affected after 5-FU treatment rather than gemcitabine.

We investigated the interrelationship between APE and p53 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat kidneys. Variable parameters on kidneys were checked 12 weeks after streptozotocin administration with or without chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) treatment. Streptozotocin administration caused changes as seen in early diabetic nephropathy with increased kidney size, increased p53, decreased APE, and increased cleaved caspase-3. COS was not suspected as being detrimental to renal measurements, and caused the augmentation of APE after streptozotocin administration. The augmented APE, in association with increased p53, suppressed cleaved caspase-3. 8-OHdG was mainly immunolocalized in the distal tubules, but also in the proximal tubules after streptozotocin administration without COS treatment, while APE was observed in proximal tubules in all groups. These results suggested that p53-dependent apoptosis resulting in suppressed APE might be an underlying mechanism of streptozotocin-induced nephropathy.",

Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is a transcription factor thought to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation, however, it is not known whether the developmental changes and subcellular localization of Id2 are related to myelination. Therefore, we investigated the developmental changes in and the subcellular localization of Id2 immunoreactivity in the rat Corpus callosum, at post-natal developmental stages P0, P7, P14, P21, P42 and P90, by immunohistochemistry. Id2 expression increased from P0 to a peak at P42, the late stage of myelination in the Corpus callosum. Id2 immunostaining decreased slightly, but still remained high at P90. Subcellular localization of Id2 changed from presence in cytoplasm at P14 to the nuclei at P42. Moreover, Id2 was mainly co-localized with CC-1-immunopositive mature oligodendrocytes at P42. These results may be consistent with Id2 inhibitory function in oligodendrocyte differentiation, at the end of myelination or in compaction of myelin in the Corpus callosum of postnatal rat brain.",

In vitro adsorption of the vitelline envelope protein onto the sperm surface showed that primary binding occurred between the sperm anterior spike of acrosome intact sperm and the vitelline envelope. Results from streptavidin blotting revealed that the component of the vitelline envelope that interacts with the sperm integral membrane protein is a 370\u00a0kDa protein. In addition, it was shown that the vitelline envelope protein had no ability to induce acrosome reaction.

Accumulation of argyrophilic proteins encircling the chromocenter did not always correlate with that of GC-rich DNA. Methylated DNA identified by immunodetection was found sparsely distributed in the euchromatin of both sexes and at some points around the chromocenter edge, but it could not be considered responsible for chromatin condensation in the chromocenter, like in T. infestans. However, unlike in T. infestans, no correlation between the chromocenter AT-rich DNA and nucleolus organizing region (NOR) DNA was found in P. megistus.",

Whether brain structures with strategic positions in the interface of blood\u2013brain barriers such as the circumventricular organs are involved in hepatic encephalopathy is not yet established. Among the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural organ secretes a glycoprotein known as Reissner's fiber, which condenses and forms an ever-growing thread-like structure into the cerebrospinal fluid. In the present work we describe the Reissner's fiber material within the subcommissural organ and its serotoninergic innervation in an animal model of chronic hepatic encephalopathy following bile duct ligation in experimental rats. The study involved immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies against Reissner's fiber and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Four weeks after surgical bile duct ligation, a significant rise of Reissner's fiber immunoreactivity was observed in all subcommissural organ areas compared with controls. Moreover, significant Reissner's fiber immunoreactive materials within the ependyma and inside the parenchyma close to the ventricular borders were also seen in bile duct ligated rats, but not in control rats. Increased Reissner's fiber material in bile duct ligated rats seems to be related to a reduction of 5-HT innervation of the subcommissural organ, the ventricular borders and the nucleus of origin, the dorsal raphe nucleus. Our data describe alterations of the subcommissural organ/Reissner's fiber material and the subcommissural organ 5-HT innervation probably due to a general 5-HT deficit in bile duct ligated rats.",

     "abstract": "Prenatal development of the epididymis was studied in bovine fetuses ranging from 10 to 90\u00a0cm crown-rump length (CRL) (75\u2013285 pcd). The studies aimed to apply both glycohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry for the detection of the differentiation of the developing prenatal epididymis. Both conventional histological and histochemical techniques were applied on paraffin sections of the epididymis from different fetal stages. Establishment of the urogenital junction between the extra-testicular rete testis and the mesonephric duct, via the growing efferent ductules (ductuli efferentes) was first evident in fetuses with 10\u00a0cm CRL. At the fetal age of 110 pcd (24\u00a0cm CRL), the mesonephric duct began to lengthen and coil forming three distinct regions (caput, corpus and cauda). In addition to the macroscopical modifications in the extra-testicular excurrent duct system, histological differentiation involved both the tubular epithelial and the peritubular mesenchymal cells. The epithelium lining the efferent ductules was differentiated into ciliated and non-ciliated columnar cells. The simple epithelium of the epididymal duct increased in height and developed stereocilia on the apical surface. Additionally, some basal cells first appeared at 185 pcd (56\u00a0cm CRL), within the epithelium lining the cauda only. Lectin histochemistry (WGA, PNA, GSA-I) showed early immunostaining in epithelium of the efferent ductules and in peritubular mesenchymal structures. Immunoreactivity for different proteins (S-100, fibroblast growth factor-1 and factor-2, angiotensin converting enzyme, laminin, alpha-smooth muscle actin) was evident, both in the epithelial and in the peritubular mesenchymal cells as early as at 75 pcd. On the basis of our histochemical observations, we conclude that both glycohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry are useful tools to demonstrate that the differentiation in the peritubular structures and efferent ductular epithelium begins earlier than other components.",

Therefore, the primary goal of the reported study was an attempt to identify and localize CART in healthy human pancreas. Nineteen deceased subjects (donors of organs) with normal pancreas and alimentary tract were used in the study. After determination of brain death and confirmation of death by the relevant doctors committee, pancreas samples, about 1\u00a0cm long, were collected from each corpse (the same part of the pancreas) after the organs were harvested for transplantation. Paraffin sections were made and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and then subjected to CART immunohistochemistry. In the normal pancreas of human adults, CART is mainly present in both nerve fibers and in nerve cell bodies in pancreatic ganglia. In addition to pancreatic neurons, immunoreactivity to CART was also seen in islet endocrine cells. This is the first report on the presence of CART-IR structures in the normal human pancreas.

     "abstract": "Lubricin is a protein which contributes to the boundary lubrication, facilitating low friction levels at the interfacing surfaces of joints. In tendons and ligaments it facilitates the relative movement of collagen bundles. Its expression is affected by mechanical signals and cytokines. During application of orthodontic forces to teeth, there is a transduction of mechanical forces to the cells of the periodontal ligament (PDL), which triggers several biological reactions causing the synthesis of prostaglandins, cytokines and growth factors. The aim of the present study was to examine the immunolocalization of lubricin and to evaluate if it is time-dependently and differentially detected within the PDL following the application of orthodontic forces to create areas of compression and tension. This was achieved by placing elastic bands between the maxillary first and second molars of 16 male Sprague-Dawley rats (each weighing 120\u2013200\u00a0g) for 12 and 24\u00a0h. The molar-bearing segments were dissected and processed for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Binding of a monoclonal antibody was used to evaluate lubricin localization using an indirect streptavidin/biotin immunperoxidase technique. Lubricin, was constitutively expressed in the PDL of rat molars. After the experimental force was applied to the tooth, lubricin was down-regulated, on both sides (compression and tension) of the PDL, in a time-dependent fashion, although to a different extent, being at any time more expressed on the tension side. Furthermore, in every sample, almost all PDL cells in the adjacent tooth cementum and alveolar bone, were more heavily immunolabeled by lubricin antibody, contrary to those located in the central portion of the PDL. Lubricin expression therefore seems related to PDL remodeling and tooth displacement following the application of an orthodontic force, and it appears that lubricin may play an important role during tooth movement.",

To determine the relevance of such interaction to cancer pathology, we analyzed biopsied tissue samples from a variety of normal and cancer tissues. Our data reveal that human TMEM176A and 176B protein levels are significantly elevated in lymphoma, but not in normal tissues. The protein levels of TMEM176A are also significantly increased in lung carcinoma. Finally, analysis of the protein expression ratio of TMEM176A over 176B showed significant differences between normal and cancer tissues of the breast, lymph, skin, and liver, which indicates that both TMEM proteins could be potential useful markers for certain human cancers.",

In the pig, the VNO epithelium increased in height with postnatal development from fetus to adult. In the VSE of all stages examined, galectin-3 immunostaining was seen in the supporting cells and free border, but not in receptor or basal cells. Galectin-3 immunostaining was seen in all layers of the VRE, and the intensity increased with postnatal development. In the lamina propria, galectin-3 was detected in some ductal epithelial cells and the vomeronasal nerve sheath, but not in the acini of the Jacobson glands in all age groups. In view of these observations, we postulate that galectin-3 plays a role in cell survival and cell adhesion in both the VSE and VRE of porcine VNO in all age groups.",

Cancer-associated B7 molecules including B7-H1, B7-DC, B7-H3 and B7-H4 are thought to be involved in the immunoescape of cancer cells and to function as prognostic markers. However, the expression and distribution of these molecules in LCS have not been described. Here we report that all of these molecules were observed in LCS sample sections by immunohistochemistry analysis. At the cellular level, they were found on the cell membrane and in the cytoplasm. Fluorescence dual staining indicated that B7-H1, B7-H3 and B7-H4 were principally associated with Langerin+ tumor cells. More interestingly, B7-H1, B7-H3 and B7-H4 were co-expressed on the same tumor cells. Z39Ig, the novel B7-related protein, was also found in the LCS sample sections. Fluorescence dual staining showed that Z39Ig was restricted on CD68+ macrophages. Our results suggest that B7-H1, B7-H3 and B7-H4 may be potential biomarkers to identify LCS, and a clear understanding of their functional roles may further elucidate the pathogenesis of this carcinoma and potentially contribute to the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.",

In contrast to what was previously described in the chicken and ostrich, we noted GLP-1 positive cells in the duodenum.

In this study MMPs (types 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 14) were examined immunohistochemically in the normal rabbit corneal epithelium and in epithelium irradiated in vivo with similar doses of UVB or UVA radiation (UVB rays 312\u00a0nm, UVA rays 365\u00a0nm, daily dose 1.01\u00a0J/cm2 for four days). Results show that MMPs studied revealed low expression in the normal corneal epithelium, whereas after repeated UVB irradiation the expression of MMPs was significantly increased in the corneal epithelium, in ascending order: MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-1, and MMP-7 with MMP-8. In contrast, compared to normal corneas, repeated UVA radiation did not significantly change the expression of MMPs in the irradiated corneal epithelium. MMP-14 was expressed at very low levels in all studied corneas, whereas no significant changes were detected upon UV exposure. In conclusion, UV radiation of shorter wavelength (UVB) induced an increase in expression of all MMPs except MMP-14. It is suggested that overexpression of MMPs in the corneal epithelium contributes to the damaging effect of UVB radiation to the cornea.",

In contrast to virgin females, the corticosterone levels on day 21 of gestation reached control levels. Between days 19 and 21 of pregnancy, a significant increase in estrogen levels and the fall of progesterone influence, at least partially, the presented differences.

The correlation of microRNA-21 expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of patients with cutaneous melanoma was statistically analyzed. Additionally, the effects of microRNA-21 expression on growth, apoptosis and chemo- or radiosensitivity of melanoma cells were also investigated by transfection of microRNA-21 inhibitor. We firstly showed that increased levels of microRNA-21 expression were shown from dysplastic nevi to primary cutaneous melanomas to melanoma metastases. Moreover, high miR-21 expression was found to be correlated with Breslow thickness and advanced clinical stage. Patients with high microRNA-21 expression showed shorter 5-year disease-free or overall survival than those with low microRNA-21 expression. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed that the status of microRNA-21 expression was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of patients. Antisense-mediated microRNA-21 inhibition could significantly suppress growth, increase apoptosis and enhance chemo- or radiosensitivity of human cutaneous melanoma cells by inducing the increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio.

MDR-1 acquired in vitro differs from MDR-1 acquired in vivo, but has important consequences on the cellular phenotype and metastatic behavior. Here we report that the human colonic cancer cell line HT29 (MDR-1 negative) is more malignant than its MDR-1 overexpressing variant (HT29 MDR-1 positive). HT29 MDR-1 negative cells produce undifferentiated signet ring carcinomas when implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice, while HT29 MDR-1 positive cells form tumors with tubular structures, but without signet ring cells. Immunohistochemical proliferation marker analysis revealed that the MDR-1 positive cells proliferate much more slowly than the MDR-1 negative cells. MDR-1 overexpression results in a less differentiated phenotype at the cellular level (absence of mucin producing cells) but in a more differentiated phenotype at the tissue level (tubule formation). In addition, lectin binding patterns including that of Helix pomatia agglutinin (HPA), an indicator of metastatic potential, differed between the two cell lines. HT29 MDR-1 positive cells had less HPA binding sites than HT29 MDR-1 negative counterparts and metastasized less frequently in SCID mice. As slow proliferation, low degree of differentiation and multidrug-resistance is a hallmark of cancer stem cells and all were present in MDR-1 positive tumors, it is attractive to speculate that they represent a stem cell rich tumor. As shown by global gene expression analyses, genes involved, e.g. in cell adhesion, glycosylation and signal transduction, were deregulated in MDR-1 positive tumors compared to MDR-negative tumors. Overexpression of E-cadherin and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules 1 (CEACAM1) may provide clues to the mechanisms responsible for the reduced metastatic potential of MDR-1 overexpressing tumors. Since drug treatment shifted the cells towards a less metastatic phenotype in this in vivo model, it seems conceivable to achieve this using drug treatment also in a clinical situation.",

Most studies have focused on domestic and laboratory animals; however, the study of desert animals allows improved understanding about water balance and resistance to dehydration and associated behavioral changes, including those related to mood disorders. Meriones shawi (Shaw's Jird) is a desert rodent characterized by its resistance to long periods of thirst that can extend for several months. In the present study, M. shawi were subjected to water deprivation for 1 and 3\u00a0months. We used 5-HT immunohistochemistry to evaluate the effects of prolonged dehydration on the serotoninergic system in both dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DRN, MRN), which are the main sources of 5-HT input to several brain areas. In addition, a dark/light box was used to evaluate the anxiolytic-like or anxiogenic-like effects of dehydration on M. shawi. The results showed a reduction in the 5-HT immunolabelling in both DRN and MRN following 1 and 3\u00a0months of dehydration. This diminution of serotonin immunoreactivity was accompanied by noticeable changes in anxiety behavior of Meriones, with animals spending more time in the light box, suggesting anxiogenic-like effects caused by dehydration. Overall, the results indicate that dehydration is able to reduce serotoninergic neurotransmission, which might be involved in generating anxiety behavior in this desert animal.",

     "abstract": "Our previous studies demonstrated that Meckel's chondrocytes, which are derived from ectomesenchyme, have the potential to transform into osteogenic phenotypes. The present study aimed to clarify the role of cell origin in the phenotypic transformation of chondrocytes. Cell pellets from ectomesenchyme-derived Meckel's cartilage and mesoderm-derived costal cartilage from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic mice were transplanted into the spleen for up to 4 weeks. Chondrocyte pellets from both cartilages adapted well to the splenic tissues and formed an alizarin red-positive calcified matrix, with increasing duration of transplantation. Following the production of cartilage-specific type II and type X collagens, newly-formed type I collagen appeared in the chondrocyte pellets from Meckel's cartilage during the late stage of transplantation. Although the bone-marker proteins: osteocalcin, osteopontin, osteonectin and bone morphogenetic protein-2, were detected in pellets from both Meckel's and costal cartilage, only type I collagen in Meckel's cartilage was a significant marker protein for detecting transformation. These bone-type protein-producing cells represented osteogenic cells transformed from GFP-expressing cells, rather than from recipient cells. These results indicate that neural crest-derived Meckel's cartilage displays a higher potential for phenotypic switching than mesoderm-derived costal chondrocytes under in vivo conditions.",

     "abstract": "The Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway plays many key roles in the development of Drosophila and vertebrate embryos, including regulating craniofacial development. The GLI family of transcription factors (GLI1, 2, and 3) mediates the SHH morphogenetic signal by regulating the expression of downstream target genes. Signaling aberrations seriously affect vertebrate development. To better understand the regulation of GLI transcription factors, we investigated the expression patterns of Gli1\u20133 during murine embryonic craniofacial development using in situ hybridization with whole-mounts and sections and quantitative real-time PCR. We found that Gli1 expression was mostly detected in the mesenchyme in embryonic dermis, and strongly detected in embryonic oral mucosa at late stages of face development. Gli2 was strong in mesenchyme, both in dermis and oral mucosa. Gli3 expression was detected fainter in the epithelium than the mesenchyme at 11 days post-coitum (dpc), but at 14.5\u00a0dpc, expression was stronger in the epithelium. Of the three genes, Gli1 expression was highest in early stages of face development, Gli3 expression was highest in the second half of facial development (and remained stable thereafter), whereas Gli2 expression remained low throughout facial development. The present findings suggest that Gli1\u20133 may play different roles during facial development.",

The gills consist of gill arches, gill rakers, gill filaments and secondary lamellae. Major components of the epithelium of gill arches and gill rakers are epithelial cells, mucous goblet cells, rodlet cells, lymphocytes, eosinophilic granular cells and taste buds. In contrast, in the gill filament epithelium, rodlet cells and taste buds, and in secondary lamellae epithelium, rodlet cells, lymphocytes, eosinophilic granular cells and taste buds are not discernible. The epithelial cells, the mucous goblet cells and the eosinophilic granular cells elaborate glycoproteins with oxidizable vicinal diols and glycoproteins with sialic acid residues without O-acyl substitution. In addition, glycoproteins with O-sulphate esters are secreted by the mucous goblet cells. The rodlet cells elaborate glycoproteins with oxidizable vicinal diols. Different types of glycoproteins elaborated on the epithelial surface of gills are discussed in relation to physiological significance of glycoprotein classes with special reference to their roles in lubrication, protection and inhibition of invasion and proliferation of pathogenic micro-organisms.",

The distribution of GnRH-I neurons and changes in GnRH-I-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons throughout the reproductive stages and between incubating and nest-deprived hens were analyzed utilizing immunohistochemical techniques. The results revealed that GnRH-I-ir neurons were distributed in a discrete region lying close to the third ventricle from the level of preoptic area through the anterior hypothalamus, with the greatest abundance found within the nucleus commissurae pallii (nCPa). The number of GnRH-I-ir neurons in the nCPa was highest in laying hens when compared with that in the other reproductive stages. Nest deprivation caused an increase in the number of GnRH-I-ir neurons in the nCPa of nest-deprived hens when compared with incubating hens. These results indicate that GnRH-I expression is correlated with the reproductive state in the native Thai chicken and may be, in part, regulated by it.

Ninety male Wistar rats used in this study were randomly divided into six equal groups (n\u00a0=\u00a015). Group 1 rats served as negative controls; group 2 received a single i.p. injection of DENA and served as positive controls. Rats in both groups were fed on basal diet. Group 3 rats were fed a diet containing 5% turmeric, whereas group 4 rats were fed a diet containing 2% myrrh. Rats in groups 5 and 6 received a single i.p. injection of DENA and were fed diets containing 5% turmeric and 2% myrrh, respectively. The study demonstrated that DENA caused a significant increase in serum indices of liver enzymes and also severe histological and immunohistochemical changes in hepatic tissues. These included disorganized hepatic parenchyma, appearance of pseudoacinar and trabecular arrays of hepatocytes and alterations in CD10-immunoreactivity. Dietary supplementation of turmeric relatively improved the biochemical parameters to values approximating those of the negative controls and delayed the initiation of carcinogenesis. In contrast, myrrh did not improve the biochemical parameters or delay the hepatocarcinogenesis. Both turmeric and myrrh induced significant biochemical and histological changes in non-treated rats. In conclusion, DENA significantly changes the biological enzymatic activities in serum and the integrity of hepatic tissues. Phytochemicals with potential hepatoprotective effects must be applied cautiously owing to their potential hepatotoxicity.",

Smad proteins are downstream signal mediators, which transduce TGF-\u03b2 signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. Smad4 protein is the common transducer of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily that participates in the signaling of all the members of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily. Smad4 is expressed in the mammalian testis and is believed to play an important role during testicular development and spermatogenesis. Information about Smad4 distribution and function in the testis of birds, including the domestic fowl, is still unclear. In the current study, our objective was to clarify the signal transduction pathway of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily in the regulation of testicular development and spermatogenesis by investigating the expression of Smad4 protein in the testis of newborn, prepuberty, puberty and adult domestic fowl. Cellular localization of Smad4 was determined by immunohistochemistry. Our study revealed that the Smad4 was widely expressed in the fowl testis, mainly immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells and germ cells. The presence of Smad4 protein in these testicular cells provides molecular and morphological evidence for TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction during testicular development and spermatogenesis.",

Distinct labeling was found in the Golgi zone, apical cytoplasm and on stereocilia of principal cells in the camel (WGA and DBA) and donkey (DBA) caput region, while other lectins exhibited variable reactivity in the other regions in both species. The basal cells showed variable binding to most of the lectins, however, they displayed distinct binding to WGA and PSA throughout the duct in camel and donkey respectively.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of RIN1 mRNA in 25 cases of NSCLC and corresponding non-tumor tissue samples. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of RIN1 in 90 NSCLC tissues. We found that the expression levels of RIN1 mRNA in NSCLC tissues were significantly higher than those in corresponding non-tumor tissues. High-level RIN1 expression was observed in 53.3% (48 of 90 cases), and correlated with poor tumor differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024), TNM stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.032), and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018).

Pleura and pericardium developing from the visceral mesoderm gradually transform into mesothelial cells and connective tissue. EMA appeared in mesothelium of both serous membranes during the early fetal period, whereas during further development, EMA expression was retained only in the pericardial mesothelium. It increased in both pleural mesothelium and connective tissue. Mesothelin appeared first in pericardial submesothelial cells and later in surface mesothelium, while in pleura it was immediately localized in mesothelium. In adult serous membranes, EMA and mesothelin were predominantly expressed in mesothelium. Nestin never appeared in mesothelium, but in connective tissues and myocardial cells and subsequently decreased during development, apart from in the walls of blood vessels. Mesothelial cells in the two serous membranes developed in two separate developmental pathways.

     "abstract": "Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a variety of serine/threonine-protein kinase, has been reported to play important roles in malignant transformation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of PLK1 expression in malignant glioma. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to detect the expression of PLK1 mRNA in 68 cases of glioma tissues and corresponding non-cancerous brain tissues. Additionally, the correlation of PLK1 mRNA expression with clinicopathological factors or prognosis of glioma patients was statistically analyzed. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors was performed using the Cox proportional hazard model. Small interfering RNA was used to knockdown PLK1 expression in a glioma cell line and analyze the effects of PLK1 inhibition on growth, cell cycle, apoptosis and chemo- or radiosensitivity of glioma cells. Results showed that the expression of PLK1 mRNA was significantly higher in glioma tissues than in corresponding normal brain tissues. The expression of PLK1 mRNA was closely correlated with WHO grade, KPS and tumor recurrence of glioma patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022, 0.030 and 0.041, respectively). Meanwhile, the disease-free and overall survival rates of patients with high PLK1 mRNA expression were obviously lower than those of patients with low PLK1 mRNA expression. Multivariate analysis showed that high PLK1 mRNA expression was a poor prognostic factor for glioma patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The expression of PLK1 mRNA and protein was significantly down-regulated in stably transfected U251-S cells. PLK1 down-regulation could inhibit growth, induce cell arrest in G2/M phase of cell cycle and apoptosis enhancement in glioma cells. Further, PLK1 down-regulation could enhance the sensitivity of glioma cells to cisplatin or irradiation. Thus, the status of PLK1 mRNA expression might be an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients and targeting PLK1 could be a novel strategy for chemo- or radiosensitization of human malignant gliomas.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women worldwide. Prognostic markers are important for diagnosis, allowing therapeutic strategies to be defined more efficiently. The expression of the glutathione S-transferase pi isoenzyme (GSTpi) in tumor cells has been evaluated as a predictor of prognosis and in response to cytotoxic treatments. Its immunoexpression was assessed in 63 women diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma in a retrospective study. The results were statistically correlated with clinicopathological parameters of patients. The results showed that high GSTpi expression was related to p53-positive tumors, grade III histology, large tumor size and death (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The 37 patients who received adjuvant treatment, checked separately, showed high expression of GSTpi in relation to local recurrence, metastasis and death (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, high levels of GSTpi expression were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). To confirm this suspicion, GSTpi gene expression was checked by Real-time PCR in neoplastic mammary cells cultured and subjected to treatment with doxorubicin. Our results suggest that high levels of GSTpi may be related to the development of resistance to chemotherapy in these tumors, the response of these tumors to treatment and the clinical course of the patients involved.",

We tried to determine whether neurons located below the site of injury are protected by the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). Changes of nNOS immunoreactivity (IR) in spinal cord were correlated with the level of nNOS protein in dorsal and ventral horns. Ten days after transection, nNOS was upregulated predominantly in lateral gigantocellular nuclei. In the spinal cord, we revealed a significant increase of nNOS protein in the dorsal horn. This is consistent with a higher density of punctate and fiber-like immunostaining for nNOS in laminae III\u2013IV and the up-regulation of nNOS-IR in neurons of the deep dorsal horn. After surgery, the perikarya of motoneurons remained nNOS immunonegative. Contrary to nNOS, the PV-IR was upregulated in \u03b1-motoneurons and small-sized neurons of the ventral horn. However, its expression was considerably reduced in neurons of the deep dorsal horn. The findings indicate that spinal transection affects nNOS and PV in different neuronal circuits.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies in humans have reported a link between maternal stress and disturbed infant physiological behavior. The objective of our study was to examine in experimental rats how maternal prenatal stress induced by a forced swim test affects offspring afferent spinal responses mediated by stimulation of vaginocervical receptors. The activation of spinal cord neurons showing c-fos expression was examined following vaginocervical mechanical stimulation in adult rats, which were the offspring of dams exposed to gestational stress from E10 until delivery. Vaginocervical stimulation of both prenatal-stressed and non-prenatal-stressed rats induced an increase in immunoreactive protein in the spinal cord ranging from T12 to S1 segmental levels. However, a significantly higher (40%) increase in the expression of Fos-immunoreactive neurons was observed in vaginocervical stimulated prenatally stressed rats than in non-stimulated prenatally stressed ones. This increase was higher in L5\u2013S1 levels than in T12\u2013L4. When the regional distribution was examined, results showed that up to 80% of activated neurons were located in the dorsal horn in both non-stimulated prenatally stressed and stimulated prenatally stressed groups, with a significantly higher density in the latter. Our results demonstrate that maternal prenatal stress can have consequences on vaginocervical responses conveyed to the spinal cord. The increase in Fos labeled neurons in T12\u2013S1 in prenatally stressed rats induced by vaginocervical stimulation suggests the hypersensitivity of the genital tract associated with activation of spinal circuits spanning multiple segments.",

     "publication date": "07-2012",
     "abstract": "Mast cells are involved in various liver diseases and appear to play a broader pathogenic role than originally thought. They may participate in the splanchnic alterations related to a porto-systemic shunt. To verify this hypothesis we studied the serum and hepatic histological changes in rats four weeks after an end-to-side portacaval shunt. In this experimental model of chronic liver insufficiency we also assessed the mucosal mast cells (MMC) and connective tissue mast cells (CTMC) in the liver, mesenteric lymph nodes and small intestine, as well as the serum levels of rat mast cell protease-II (RMCP-II). The results show liver and testes atrophy, with hypoalbuminemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), hyperbilirubinemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and increase in aspartate aminotransferase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and alanine aminotransferase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Hepatic histopathology demonstrates hepatocytic necrosis and apoptosis, portal inflammation, biliary proliferation, steatosis and fibrosis. There is a decrease of MMCs and CTMCs in the liver, while in the ileum CTMCs increase and MMCs decrease. These results suggest the involvement of mast cells in the pathophysiological splanchnic impairments in this experimental model. In particular, the decreased number of liver mast cells may be associated with the hepatic atrophy. If this is the case, we propose that the disruption of the hepato-intestinal axis after a portocaval shunt in the rat could inhibit the ability of the liver to developing an appropriate repair response mediated by mast cells.",

The principal goal in treating surgical and non-surgical wounds is the need for rapid closure of the lesion. This study investigated whether topical application of PerClot\u00ae could improve impaired wound healing in Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats. Full-thickness skin wounds were created on the back of the rats. Immediately, PerClot\u00ae was introduced into the wound bed, while wounds receiving starch or nothing served as controls. Wound closure was monitored using well-recognized wound-healing parameters: histological examination for inflammatory cells and fibroblast infiltration, newly formed capillaries, and collagen deposition. Meanwhile, transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21) was measured by immunochemistry. Wound closure was significantly accelerated by local application of PerClot\u00ae. Furthermore, PerClot\u00ae-treated wounds showed significantly increased fibroblast numbers at 5 days post-wounding, and newly formed capillaries at 7 days post-wounding, and collagen regeneration at 7 and 14 days post-wounding. The number of infiltrating fibroblasts expressing TGF-\u03b21 was significantly higher than that in the controls at 7 and 14 days post-wounding. PerClot\u00ae can improve the wound healing and this effect might involve an increase in the activity of fibroblasts and increased release of TGF-\u03b21.",

Hepatocytes from livers of fetal rats were separated by collagenase digestion and low centrifugation on gestational day 17.

     "abstract": "A morphofunctional analysis of the thymus from differently aged Xenopus laevis tadpoles during regeneration of the tail is reported. In stage 50 larvae, competent to regenerate, the appendage cut provoked thymic structural modifications that affected the medullary microenvironment cells and changes in TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactivity. Mucocyte-like cells, multicellular epithelial cysts, myoid cells and cells immunoreactive to TNF-\u03b1 increased in number. Increased numbers of lymphocytes were also found in regenerating areas and, at the end of regeneration, thymic structural and immunocytochemical patterns were restored to control levels. The observed cellular responses and the induction of molecules critical for thymus constitutive processes suggest a stimulation of thymic function after tail amputation. In older larvae, whose capacity to form a new complete and correctly patterned tail was reduced, thymic morphological changes were more severe and may persist throughout the regeneration process with a significant reduction in organ size. In these larvae the histological patterns and the marked thymic decrease may be related to the events occurring during regeneration, i.e. the higher inflammatory response and the reduced tail regenerative potential.",

Thirty adult male albino mice were divided into three equal groups and were given: (a) distilled water, (b) cold Hibiscus aqueous extract, and (c) boiled Hibiscus aqueous extract. Hibiscus extract was administered orally daily for 4 weeks in a dose of 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight/mouse. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, mice were decapitated and the testes and epididymides were excised and processed for transmission electron microscopy to assess ultrastructural and sperm abnormalities. The results clearly demonstrate that aqueous extracts from dried calyx of H. sabdariffa, either cold or boiled, alter normal sperm morphology and testicular ultrastructure and adversely influence the male reproductive fertility in albino mice. The current data suggest that Hibiscus extract should be consumed with caution, and reasonable estimates of the human risk associated with its consumption should be provided.",

     "abstract": "A Smad nuclear interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) homologous gene was identified in amphioxus. Phylogenic analysis showed that SNIP1 proteins from different species share a highly conserved FHA domain at the C-terminus, but their N-terminus varies remarkably. The genomic structure of SNIP1 varies in different species, especially at the 5\u2032 end. Through in situ hybridization, we studied SNIP1 expression patterns in amphioxus and zebrafish embryos. Amphioxus SNIP1 transcripts were specifically located in the notochord in larval and adult stages. In zebrafish, however, snip1 transcripts were specifically located not only in the notochord, but also in the rhombencephalic ventricle, otic vesicles and pectoral fin buds. This is the first report of SNIP1 expression pattern in early development, which clearly shows different expression patterns between invertebrates and vertebrates. Previous studies reported that it is the N-terminal domain of human and mouse SNIP1 that functions to inhibit both TGF-\u00df and the NF-\u03baB pathways. Therefore, it is most likely that the modification of SNIP1 expression pattern is related to the remarkable evolution in the N-terminal sequence. In addition, the difference in SNIP1 expression pattern between amphioxus and zebrafish implies the role of SNIP1 in the vertebrate body structural innovation of brain, otic vesicles and pectoral fins.",

Ascertaining ncRNAs spatiotemporal expression patterns is crucial for understanding the physiological roles of ncRNAs during tissue and organ development. In this study in mouse embryos, we focused on the developmental regulation expression of imprinted macro ncRNAs, Meg8 and Irm by using in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR). The in situ hybridization results showed that Meg8 and Irm were expressed in the developing brain at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) and E11.5, while Irm expression signals were strikingly detected in the somite, where Meg8 expression signals were undetectable. By E15.5, they were expressed in brain, tongue, liver, lung and neuroendocrine tissues, while Irm displayed more restricted expression in tongue and skeletal muscle than Meg8. Furthermore, quantitative analysis confirmed that they were highly expressed in tongue and brain at E12.5, E15.5 and E18.5. These results indicated that Meg8 and Irm might be coordinately expressed and functionally correlated in diverse of organs. Notably, Irm was more closely associated with morphogenesis of skeletal muscle in contrast to Meg8 during embryonic development.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor, c-met, have been shown to regulate cell proliferation, motility and morphology in a variety of cell types. A significant role of the HGF/c-met pathway has been demonstrated in various tumors, however, little is known about the role of HGF/c-met pathway in odontogenic tumors. The aim of this study was to characterize the expression of HGF and c-met in 30 ameloblastomas, 7 unicystic ameloblastomas (luminal type), 10 calcifying cystic odontogenic tumors, 10 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOTs), 30 keratocytic odontogenic tumors (KCOTs) and 6 ameloblastic carcinomas using an immunohistochemical method. HGF and c-met were generally immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of all epithelial tumor cells, except for keratinizing cells in acanthomatous ameloblastoma, in all the examined odontogenic tumors. These results, together with the expression of these two proteins in the epithelium of tooth germs, suggest that the HGF/c-met pathway is involved in the differentiation of odontogenic tumors. This pathway may also promote tumor proliferation in odontogenic tumors due to its potent mitogenic effect. The consistent and strong immunolocalization of HGF and c-met in squamous cells present in acanthomatous ameloblastomas, AOTs and ameloblastic carcinomas, and in the linings of KCOTs suggests that the HGF/c-met interaction may have an influence on squamous differentiation in these odontogenic tumors.",

Knowledge about a possible source of leptin in the seminal plasma may therefore be helpful in identifying and elucidating the physiological role of leptin hormone in male reproduction. In our investigation, the expression of leptin and its long receptor isoform (Ob-Rb) was studied in adult male Wistar rats using RT-PCR, Southern blot, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of both leptin and its Ob-Rb in the seminal vesicle and prostate gland. In situ hybridization also localized the mRNA transcripts of leptin and Ob-Rb in the glandular secretory epithelial cells of prostate gland and seminal vesicle. Immunohistochemistry detected the leptin hormone in the lining epithelium of both male genital glands. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the seminal vesicle and prostate gland could be the possible sources of leptin in the seminal plasma. This leptin might have a direct (paracrine, autocrine or both) effect on epithelial cells of the accessory male genital glands, on the spermatozoa via spermatozoan leptin receptors.",

The presence and relative amounts of genes specific to the sex-determining region of the Y-chromosome (Sry) originating from the bone grafts were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and by in situ hybridization, respectively. Additional samples were evaluated histologically. In the larger bone grafts, the expression of Sry decreased relatively early, disappeared by 1 week, reappeared at 4 weeks and continued to increase with time. In the fine particulate bone powders, Sry was detected all the time and its expression was statistically greater than in the larger bone grafts at each time point. Both bone grafts provided donor cells to repair the defects. The donor cells seemed to function differently between the two groups. The fine particulate bone powders contained more living osteocytes in comparison with the larger bone grafts and may accelerate the healing of bone defects compared with conventional autografts.",

In this study we detected c-Myc expression pattern in the process of mouse hair follicle development and normal cycle. We found that during hair follicle morphogenesis, the stage-specific expression of c-Myc was detected in mouse skin and was predominantly localized to the hair follicle epithelium. c-Myc expression was also consistently found in mouse skin throughout the hair follicle cycle. Through the in vivo injection of c-Myc inhibitory peptide and c-Myc expression plasmid, we also investigated the direct effects of c-Myc on the hair follicle structures during the hair follicle cycle. Our results showed that c-Myc inhibitory peptide significantly restrained the development of anagen hair follicles, while the injection of plasmid DNA encoding c-Myc in vivo clearly promoted anagen development. Our data indicate that c-Myc may play an important role in the proliferation and differentiation of the hair follicle keratinocytes during hair follicle development. c-Myc also was shown to participate in the regulation of the mouse hair growth cycle and could promote the proliferation of the hair matrix keratinocytes as well as the differentiation of the inner root sheath.",

During days 1\u20137, ovarian somatic structures lacked AR, 3\u03b2-HSD and P450c17, except for the surface epithelium, which featured the presence of these three proteins, suggestive of its androgen responsiveness and steroidogenic function. On day 10, AR appeared in many somatic structures, including the granulosa layers, which coincided with the P450c17 immunoexpression in some theca/interstitial cells, and an increase in ovarian androgen concentration. On the following days a further rise in ovarian androgen and progesterone contents paralleled an increase in 3\u03b2-HSD and P450c17 immunoexpression in the theca layer cells and primary interstitial cells. However, the development of the follicles constituting the first follicular wave was aberrant, since they lacked AR expression until the preantral stage and were characterized by a delayed onset and much lower expression of the thecal P450c17. They could not ovulate, since ovarian content of estradiol was too low to evoke the LH surge. The clusters of the secondary interstitial cells found on day 30 exhibited predominant expression of 3\u03b2-HSD over P450c17, suggesting more intensive progesterone than androgen synthesis in these structures.",

To investigate the muscle fiber types and to understand better the structure-function correlation of the extraocular muscles, the present study examined the ultrastructural characteristics of the superior rectus muscle of rat. The superior rectus muscle is organized into two layers: a central global layer of mainly large-diameter fibers and an outer C-shaped orbital layer of principally small-diameter fibers. Six morphologically distinct fiber types were identified within the superior rectus muscle. Four muscle fiber types, three single innervated fibers (SIFs) and one multiple innervated fiber (MIF), were recognized in the global layer. The single innervated fibers included red, white and intermediate fibers. They differed from one another with respect to diameter, mitochondrial size and distribution, sarcoplasmic reticulum and myofibrillar size. The orbital layer contained two distinct MIFs in addition to the red and intermediate SIFs. The orbital MIFs were categorized into low oxidative and high oxidative types according to their mitochondrial content and distribution. The highly specialized function of the superior rectus extraocular muscle is reflected in the multiplicity of its fiber types, which exhibit unique structural features. The unique ultrastructural features of the extraocular muscles and their possible relation to muscle function are discussed.",

The localization of ferritin was performed in epidermal, parenchymal and vascular tissues of shoots and leaves of I. cylindrica. The highest density of immunolabeling in shoots appeared in the intracellular space of cell tissues, near the cell walls and in the cytoplasm. In leaves, ferritin was detected in the proximity of the dense network of the middle lamella of cell walls, following a similar path to that observed in shoots. Immunolabeling was also localized in chloroplasts. The abundance of immunogold labelling in mitochondria for I. cylindrica was rather low, probably because the study dealt with tissues from old plants.

It was shown that in early spermatids, BASP1 and MARCKS accumulate in chromatoid bodies, which are characteristic organelles for these cells. During spermatogenesis, while the spermatid nucleus is still active, the chromatoid body periodically moves to the cell nucleus and absorbs the precursors of definite mRNAs and small RNAs. mRNAs are preserved in the chromatoid body until the corresponding proteins are needed, but their \u201cfresh\u201d mRNA cannot be formed due to the nucleus inactivation. The chromatoid body (0.5\u20131.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) has a cloud-like fibrous appearance with many fairly round cavities. In the chromatoid body, BASP1 and MARCKS are distributed mainly around the cavities and at periphery. Based on the known functions of BASP1 and MARCKS in neurons, it is conceivable that these proteins participate in non-random movements of the chromatoid body to the nucleus and in Ca2+-calmodulin enrichment. In late spermatids, BASP1 and MARCKS are located in the outer dense fiber layer belonging to a metabolically active spermatozoon region, the tail mid-piece. In spermatozoa, as in chromatoid body, BASP1 and MARCKS may bind Ca2+-calmodulin and therefore contribute to the activation of calcium-dependent biochemical processes.",

Volumes of FSH and LH cells were significantly increased by 19.7% and 20% and their volume densities by 20% and 20.2%, respectively. Estradiol markedly affected gonadotropes in the same manner, but to a greater extent. It can be concluded that genistein acted as an estrogenic agonist in the pituitaries of immature female rats, and as such, stimulated gonadotropic cells.",

Mesenteric ischemia lasting 1\u00a0h followed by 1\u00a0h of reperfusion caused a significant disintegration of the mucosa, reduction of the muscular layer and diminution of the wall thickness. The loss of epithelium included enterocytes, goblet cells and Paneth cells. Paradoxically, increasing numbers of serotonin-producing cells and the beginning of regenerative processes, expressed by significantly higher proliferation, were recorded in the epithelium during this period. Disintegration of connective tissue and massive degranulation of serotonin-positive cells were found in the lamina propria. After 24\u00a0h of reperfusion, restitution of the mucosa was found, expressed by normal villous morphology and re-epithelialization. However, some parameters were still significantly affected even more than in the acute phase of reperfusion. In the epithelium, decreased numbers of Paneth cells and increased population of serotonin-producing cells were found. The greatest proliferation of connective tissue cells and intensified reduction of the muscular layer were also detected in this reperfusion period. After 30 days of reperfusion, moderate damage remained, but only the increased number of Paneth cells and decreased number of serotonin-producing cells in the lamina propria were significant.",

In this study, we used immunofluorescent staining to assess NR1 or NR2A and PSD-95 expressions and the relationship between them in CA1, CA3, and DG of rat hippocampus on postnatal (P) days: P0, P4, P7, P10, P14, P21, P28, P56. The results showed that from P0 to P56, NR1, NR2A, and PSD-95 expressions increased gradually, and the time points of their expression peak differed in CA1, CA3, and DG during postnatal development. Interestingly, although the expression of PSD-95 was positively correlated to both NR1 and NR2A, the NR1 and PSD-95 coexpressed puncta were greatest in CA3, while NR2A and PSD-95 coexpressed puncta were greatest in CA1, compared to other subregions. Surprisingly, at P21, among different strata of CA1, the area of highest expression of NR2A was dramatically changed from stratum pyramidale to stratum polymorphum and stratum moleculare, and returned to stratum pyramidale gradually on the later observed days again, indicating that P21 may be one critical timepoint during postnatal development in CA1. The specific temporospatial distribution pattern of NR1, NR2A, and PSD-95 might be related to the different physiological functions during postnatal development. Discovering the alteration of the relationship between PSD-95 and NMDAR subunits expression may be helpful for understanding mechanisms and therapy of neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, it is not easy to obtain sufficient numbers of satisfactory reproducible sections owing to the differences between the mechanical properties of the medium and embedded tissue and the low cohesive force of the medium. We describe a modified PVA-based cryoembedding medium, composed of PVA (10\u00a0wt% and 15\u00a0wt%) with the addition of boric acid (from 0 to 5\u00a0wt%), that can improve the sectioning properties and efficiency of frozen tissue for histological analysis. The amount of load under the same compressive displacement as well as cohesive force increased with increasing boric acid and PVA contents. 15\u00a0wt% PVA and 3\u00a0wt% boric acid was determined as an optimal composition for cryoembedding material based on the sectioning efficiency measured by the numbers of unimpaired sectioned slices and the amount of load under the same compressive displacement test. On the basis of the results of routine hematoxylin and eosin staining of cryosections of tissue embedded in a medium with 3\u00a0wt% boric acid and PVA, it was concluded that the modified PVA cryoembedding medium can improve the efficiency of cryosectioning for subsequent histological or histochemical analysis of various tissues.",

Positive staining for Evi-1 was detected in the cytoplasm of oocytes. In postnatal mice, a high level of Evi-1 immunostaining was found from day 1 to 6, an intermediate level from day 10 to 16 and a low level on day 23. After gonadotropin treatment, Evi-1 was mainly expressed in small follicles and exhibited a very low level in large antral follicles. During the estrous cycle, the expression of Evi-1 was higher in diestrus and estrus than in proestrus and metestrus. Real-time PCR was performed to examine the relationship between Evi-1 mRNA and ovulation related genes (Ptgs2, Tnfaip6, Has2, Cd44, C1qbp). At 4\u00a0h after hCG treatment, Evi-1 mRNA was down-regulated whereas ovulation related genes were up-regulated. Overall, the results indicate that Evi-1 is expressed in a stage-specific manner during ovarian follicular development and may be involved in early follicle development.",

A single microvillus Merkel-like cell was found in each taste bud regardless of age or location. Merkel-like cells were neurosecretory, as indicated by labelling with the styryl dye, FM1-43, and the synaptic vesicle marker, SV2. Merkel-like cells were associated with SV2- and calretinin-positive taste receptor cells, received innervation from discoid aggregations of nerve fibers, and retained serotonin-filled synaptic vesicles oriented within the cytoplasm toward adjacent innervation. Moreover, a ring-like formation of nerve endings was identified with the neuronal marker, zn-12 that circumscribed the taste receptor area, surrounding calretinin-immunoreactive taste cell microvilli, and appeared to associate with the nerve plexus adjacent to Merkel-like cells. We suggest that these nerve fibers are somatosensory, perhaps associated with mechanoreception or the common chemical sense.",

This allows the identification of host specimens to species level as well as offering visualization of bacteria distributed within the host tissue. Previously published 18S rRNA host-specific oligonucleotide probes for Riftia pachyptila, Tevnia jerichonana and a newly designed Oasisia alvinae probe, as well as a 16S rRNA probe targeting symbionts found in all host species, were applied. A number of standard fixation and hybridization parameters were tested and optimized for the best possible signal intensity and cellular resolution. Ethanol conserved samples embedded in LR White low viscosity resin yielded the best results with regard to both signal intensity and resolution.

In this work we applied two automated techniques, fast Fourier transformation (FFT) and fractal dimension analysis (FA) to quantify the organization of collagen fibers or fibrils. Using multi-photon images of collagen fibers obtained from rat ligament we showed that for healing ligaments, FA differentiates more clearly between the different time-points during healing. Using scanning electron microscopy images of overstretched porcine flexor tendon, we showed that combining FFT and FA measures distinguishes the damaged and undamaged groups more clearly than either method separately.",

Previously, we have reported that overexpression of STAT3 potentiates growth, survival and radioresistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of STAT3 expression and its correlation with chemoresistance of NSCLC cells. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of STAT3 mRNA in 12 NSCLC and corresponding adjacent lung tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of STAT3 protein in 76 NSCLC tissue samples. Additionally, the correlation between STAT3 expression and prognosis of NSCLC patients was statistically analyzed. The role of STAT3 in chemoresistance of NSCLC cells was also assessed by the vector-based small interfering RNA. The expression level of STAT3 mRNA in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding adjacent lung tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Positive immunostaining of STAT3 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The expression of STAT3 protein was significantly correlated with tumor differentiation, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC patients. Moreover, the 5-year overall survival rate of patients with high STAT3 expression (42.3%) was significantly lower than that of patients with low STAT3 expression (58.8%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model showed that high STAT3 protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for NSCLC patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Furthermore, two stably transfected cell lines (A549/shSTAT3 and SPC-A1/shSTAT3) were successfully established, and RNAi-mediated STAT3 inhibition could significantly increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin by enhancing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Together, the expression of STAT3 might be an independent prognostic marker for NSCLC patients and RNAi-mediated STAT3 inhibition would be a potential strategy for chemosensitization of NSCLC cells.",

     "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mediated by alterations of growth factors. Members of the neuropoietic cytokine family, which include IL-6, LIF, and CNTF among others, have been shown to be important regulators of peripheral nerves and the muscles that they innervate. To investigate their potential role in diabetic nerve and muscle, we studied the expression of the shared receptor subunits, LIFR and gp130 in a mouse model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. The results of Western blotting and densitometric analysis showed that both LIFR and gp130 protein expression were increased in diabetic sciatic nerve compared to control mice at early time points following STZ injection. In diabetic gastrocnemius muscle, LIFR and gp130 were increased from 3 days to 24 weeks following STZ injection. In contrast, both LIFR and gp130 protein expression were decreased in diabetic soleus muscle at 3-days post-injection. Our results suggest that hyperglycemia results in changes to nerve and muscle soon after the onset of diabetes and that cytokines may play a role in this process.",

     "abstract": "The presence of mast cells has been reported in all classes of vertebrates, including many teleost fish families. The mast cells of teleosts, both morphologically and functionally, show a close similarity to the mast cells of mammals. Mast cells of teleosts, localized in the vicinity of blood vessels of the intestine, gills and skin, may play an important role in the mechanisms of inflammatory response, because they express a number of functional proteins, including piscidins, which are antimicrobical peptides that act against a broad-spectrum of pathogens. An increase in the number of mast cells in various tissues and organs of teleosts seems to be linked to a wide range of stressful conditions, such as exposure to heavy metals (cadmium, copper, lead and mercury), exposure to herbicides and parasitic infections. This study analyzed the morphological localization and abundance of mast cells in the intestine and gills of sea bream, Sparus aurata, after a 12, 24 or 72\u00a0h exposure to PCB 126, a polychlorinated biphenyl, which is a potent immunotoxic agent. In the organs of fish exposed to PCB 126, it was observed that in addition to congestion of blood vessels, there was extravasation of red blood cells, infiltration of lymphocytes, and a progressive increase in numbers of mast cells. These data confirm the immunotoxic action of PCB, and the involvement of mast cells in the inflammatory response.",

     "abstract": "Adult amphibian skin has served as a model for the investigation of Na+-transporting epithelia, such as mammalian renal tubules. The amiloride-blockable epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), which is located in the apical membrane of the outer living cell layer, regulates Na+ transport across the epithelium. ENaC is thought to develop during the terminal differentiation of epidermal cells, but the details are unclear. Here, we used in situ hybridization to examine the localization of the ENaC subunit mRNAs in skin of adult bullfrogs, to clarify the development of ENaC. We found that \u03b1-ENaC mRNA was expressed within the cells of the Stratum granulosum, the Stratum spinosum, and the Stratum germinativum, while \u03b2-ENaC mRNA was expressed within the cells of the S. granulosum and the S. spinosum. However, we could not detect expression of \u03b3-ENaC mRNA, possibly for technical reasons. \u03b1- and \u03b2-ENaC mRNAs, at least, were present in the sub-apical cells, in which ENaC protein is not necessary for amphibian skin to possess its Na+-transport function. Our results may mean that the sub-apical cells are already producing the ENaC subunit mRNAs prior to the final step in their differentiation.",

     "abstract": "Progression through mitosis and meiosis during early zebrafish ovarian development is accompanied by highly regulated series of transformations in the architecture of oocytes. These cytoskeletal-dependent membrane events may be assumed to be brought about by deployment of proteins. While the cytoskeleton and its associated proteins play a pivotal role in each of these developmental transitions, it remains unclear how specific cytoskeletal proteins participate in regulating diverse processes of oocyte development in zebrafish. Results from this study show that a pool of spectrin accumulates during oogenesis and parallels an increase in volume of oocytes at pre-vitellogenic stages of development. Spectrin labeling is restricted to the surface of oogonia, the cortex of post-pachytene oocytes and later accumulates on the cytoplasm of pre-vitellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes. Results here suggest a correlation between spectrin labeling, increased cytoplasm volume of oocytes, an increase in the number of nucleoli and accumulation of cytoplasmic organelles. Overall, these results suggest that synthesis and storage of spectrin during pre-vitellogenic stages of oogenesis primes the egg with a pre-established pool of membrane\u2013cytoskeletal precursors for use during embryogenesis, and that the presence of spectrin at the oocyte sub-cortex is essential for maintaining oocyte structure.",

Sections were incubated with diluted rabbit polyclonal anti-lubricin antibody and scored according to the percentage of lubricin immunopositive cells. Three different TMJ disc tissue compartments were analyzed, namely: the upper lamina, the inferior lamina and the loose connective tissue in the space between the laminae. The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to compare protein expression (lubricin) among disc specimens\u2019 regions. Staining was noted within the TMJ disc cell populations in every disc tissue sample, with almost every cell immunolabeled by the lubricin antibody. The number of disc cells immunolabeled was almost the same in the 3 bilaminar zone regions. Positive extracellular matrix staining was also seen. The results of the present study suggest that lubricin is expressed in the TMJ disc bilaminar zone.

Here, we show the elevated expression of Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 in diseased mucosa without nasal polyps and a correlation between Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 expression. Forty-six samples (26 patients with nasal polyps, 10 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and 10 control subjects) were included to this study. Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting were performed for the assessment of Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 localization and the expression of proteins. Double staining of both proteins showed that Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 were colocalized in the epithelium, inflammatory cells and the vascular endothelium of nasal mucosa. There was a significant increase in the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and Jab1 in patients without nasal polyps and a significant decrease in patients with nasal polyps compared to controls. Moreover, correlation was detected between the expression of Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 in chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis. Our results demonstrate that chronic rhinosinusitis is characterized by elevated expression of Jab1 and TGF-\u03b21 compared to nasal polyposis and Jab1 may play a vital role in the pathogenesis of both chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyposis.",

At the postnatal and sexually mature stages, the reactivity of some lectins, including WGA, UEA-I, DBA and SBA, were shown to increase in the VNO sensory epithelium as well as the free border. The increased reactivity of lectins as development progressed was also observed in Jacobson's gland acini.

Adult male Wistar rats were chronically exposed for 3 months to 0.5% lead acetate in drinking water. The serotoninergic system was evaluated using immunohistochemistry and the anxiety behavior was assessed by the light/dark box test. The results show that chronic lead exposure induces a significant increase of blood and brain lead levels in treated rats compared with controls. The density of the immunoreactive serotoninergic cell bodies was significantly higher in treated rats in all parts of the DRN. Assessment of animal behavior using the light/dark box test showed that lead-treated rats spent significantly more time in the light chamber compared with controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

Parvalbumin acts as a relaxing factor in cardiac myocytes. Adult female Wistar rats, 12 weeks old, were randomly divided into 5 groups of 10: sham-operated (SHAM), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX receiving estrogen replacement of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (Es10), 20\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (Es20) and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (Es40). After 10 weeks, serum estrogen levels were measured and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 estrogen receptors in cardiac myocytes were investigated by immunohistochemistry. PV levels were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Cardiac myocytes of all animals showed strong staining intensities for \u03b1 immunoreactive (Es \u03b1-ir), but weak staining for \u03b2 immunoreactive (Es \u03b2-ir) estrogen receptors. The Es \u03b1-ir was reduced in the cardiac myocytes of the OVX groups, but increased in the Es10, Es20 and Es40 groups. We therefore suggest that estrogen effects are mediated via Es \u03b1 receptors rather than Es \u03b2 receptors in female rat hearts. Estrogen and PV immunoreactive (PV-ir) levels and the intensity of the PV band observed in the OVX group were less than those of the SHAM group. In the Es10, Es20 and Es40 groups, the increased intensity of the PV-ir and PV bands correlated with the increased estrogen levels. The low PV levels in cardiac myocytes induced by low estrogen were restored by estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore a reduction of PV may lead to diastolic dysfunction in menopause.",

The mid-third of the mouse incisor pulp was transplanted into abdominal subcutaneous tissue. Two calcified tissues were independently formed within the implanted pulp at 7\u00a0days after the implantation, one developed in the peripheral region and the other was formed in the middle region of the pulp. Histological investigation indicated the existence of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the peripheral calcified tissue. Immunohistochemical study indicated the colocalization of types I and II collagen surrounding these cells. RT-PCR analysis indicated the transient expression of type II collagen at 7\u00a0days and the constant expression of type I collagen, osteonectin, osteocalcin and dentin matrix protein-1 and 2 at all examined times. Dentin sialophosphoprotein was only detected at 28\u00a0days after the transplantation. These results indicated that dental pulp cells might have the capacity to form calcified tissue by implanted dental pulp and it is possible that the difference of local environments induced the cells to form different types of calcified tissues within the implanted pulp.",

     "abstract": "The carotid labyrinth is an enigmatic endocrine structure of unknown chemosensory function lying in the gill region of the catfishes. The carotid body is found at the carotid bifurcation of amphibians and all mammalian vertebrates on the evolutionary tree. It is a vascular expansion comprised of a cluster of glomus cells with associated (afferent and efferent) innervations. In the catfish species studied (Clarias batrachus) a neurosecretory cell system consisting of pseudobranchial neurosecretory cells connect the carotid labyrinth or large vessels (both the efferent branchial artery and dorsal aorta), and is likely akin to the glomus cells, but comparing these structures in widely divergent vertebrate species, the conclusion is that the structural components are more elaborate than those of terrestrial vertebrates. However, these cells reveal both an endocrine phenotype (such as the association with capillaries and large vessels) and the presence of regulatory substances such as neurotransmitters and neuropeptides producing good evidence for high levels of conservation of these substances that are present in the glomus cells of mammalian vertebrates. VIP-immunopositive neuronal cell bodies are detected in the periphery of the carotid labyrinth. They are presumptive local neurons that differ from pseudobranchial neurosecretory cells, the latter failing to express VIP in their soma.",

     "abstract": "In veterinary medicine, there is an increasing interest in the study of the endo-cannabinoid system and the possible use of the cannabinoids for the treatment of several diseases. Cannabinoid receptors (CB) are widely distributed in human and laboratory animal tissues, justifying the involvement of the endo-cannabinoid system in a great number of metabolic ways. Since there are no data regarding cannabinoid receptors in hair follicles of domestic animals, we investigated the presence and localization of CB1 receptor in dog hair follicles. By using a goat anti-CB1 polyclonal antibody, we observed CB1 receptor in the proximal part of both primary and secondary hair follicles. Staining was localized in the inner root sheath cells. We suppose that the endo-cannabinoid system is involved in the molecular mechanisms regulating hair follicle activity in dog. The identification of CB1 receptor at the level of the inner root sheath may help in the understanding of hair follicle biology and the possibility that cannabinoid molecules could be considered as suitable therapeutic tools in dog.",

     "abstract": "Oocyte-secreted growth differentiation factor (GDF) 9 plays an essential role during follicle maturation through actions on granulosa cells. Despite its critical role in female reproduction, GDF9 expression, signalling and function are less well characterized during spermatogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate temporal and spatial expression and potential cellular targets of GDF9 in the adult cat testis. Our result confirmed that GDF9 is stage-specifically localized in the cytoplasm of round spermatids and pachytene spermatocytes of the cat seminiferous epithelium. In particular, activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 5, the type I receptor of GDF9, is principally localized in the cytoplasm of round spermatids. Smad2/3, signal transducers for GDF9 signalling pathway, is mainly immunolocalized in the cytoplasm of germ cells, Sertoli cells and Leydig cells, but the expression in germ cells are weaker than in Sertoli cells. The expression pattern of ALK5 and Smad2/3 show that GDF9-ALK5-Smad2/3 may not be the only signalling pathway for testicular cell to respond to GDF9. Overall, our results demonstrate that GDF9 is a germ cell-specific factor in the adult cat testis, and that GDF9 regulates the tight junctions of Sertoli cells by paracrine secretion, and regulates the germ cells by autocrine secretion.",

Apoptosis and proliferation assay were performed. We found increased GRP78 expression with progression along the normal tissue\u2013adenoma\u2013carcinoma sequence, while there was no difference in the relative mRNA expression of GRP78 among normal, adenoma and colorectal carcinoma. The shRNA-GRP78 plasmid caused a significant reduction of GRP78 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, knockdown of GRP78 not only efficiently suppressed proliferation of RKO cells, but also induced early apoptosis of cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that GRP78 may play some important roles in the development and progression of colorectal carcinomas. The expression of GRP78 is associated with the enhanced proliferation of colorectal carcinoma cells and with their resistance to apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Although Huntington's disease (HD) occurs only in humans, the use of animal models is crucial for HD research. New genetic models may provide novel insights into HD pathogenesis, but their relevance to human HD is problematic, particularly owing to a lower number of typically degenerated and dying striatal neurons and consequent insignificant reactive gliosis. Hence, neurotoxin-induced animal models are widely used for histopathological studies. Unlike in humans, the neurodegenerative process (NDP) of the HD phenotype develops very fast after the application of quinolinic acid (QA). For that reason, we compared three groups of rats in more advanced stages (1\u201312 months) of the QA lesion with 3 representative HD cases of varying length and grade. The outcomes of our long-term histological study indicate that significant parallels may be drawn between HD autopsies and QA-lesioned rat brains (particularly between post-lesional months 3 and 9) in relation to (1) the progression of morphological changes related to the neuronal degeneration, primarily the rarefaction of neuropil affecting the density as well as the character of synapses, resulting in severe striatal atrophy and (2) the participation of oligodendrocytes in reparative gliosis. Conversely, the development and character of reactive astrogliosis is principally conditioned by the severity of striatal NDP in the context of neuron\u2013glia relationship. Despite the above-described differences, morphological patterns in which the components of striatal parenchyma react to the progression of NDP are similar in both human and rat brains. Our study specifies the possibilities of interpreting the morphological findings gained from the QA-induced animal model of HD in relation to HD post-mortem specimens.",

The expression of Reg IV gene was analyzed by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize Reg IV protein. Reg IV protein was expressed in pancreas, stomach, small intestine, colon, brain, spleen, kidney and urinary bladder in two-month-old male Wistar rats. In addition, the expression of Reg IV mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was confirmed. Our study provides detailed information about the expression and localization of Reg IV protein in different rat organs.

It is overexpressed in many malignant tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is still unclear if Bcl-xL can be used as an independent molecular marker for predicting the prognosis of CRC patients. In this study, reverse transcription-PCR assay was performed to detect the expression of Bcl-xL mRNA in CRC and corresponding non-tumor colon tissues. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the immunolocalization of Bcl-xL protein in sixty-eight primary CRC tissue samples. The association between Bcl-xL protein expression and clinicopathological factors of CRC patients was analyzed and the survival was assessed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and proportional hazards model. The averaged level of Bcl-xL mRNA expression in CRC tissues (0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13) was significantly higher than that in non-tumor colon tissues (0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02). Immunohistochemical staining showed that the Bcl-xL protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells. The level of Bcl-xL protein expression was closely correlated with tumor differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010), venous permeation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and Duke's classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021).

Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the status of Bcl-xL protein expression might be an independent prognostic marker for CRC patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.032).

Three groups of male Wistar albino rats were used. The first group consisted of non-diabetic control rats. The second group was the untreated diabetic rats. The third group consisted of diabetic rats treated with Irbesartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, widely used in treatment for hypertension. Immunohistochemical stainings for TGF-beta 1, bax, caspase-3 and WT-1 were performed. The microalbuminuria levels of the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group were lower than those of the untreated diabetic group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The immunostaining of TGF-beta 1, bax and caspase-3 was decreased in glomeruli of the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group compared to the untreated diabetic group. WT-1 immunopositive podocyte numbers were found to be significantly lower in the untreated diabetic group than in the other groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In the Irbesartan-treated diabetic group, the WT-1 immunopositive cell numbers were higher compared to the untreated diabetic group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). We conclude that the decrease in the number of podocytes is an early marker of diabetic nephropathy, AT1 receptor blocker has renoprotective effects on the regulation of renal hemodynamics and on the control of tissue damage by preventing podocyte loss, which leads to decrease of bax and caspase-3 expressions of apoptosis related proteins, and may prevent glomerular cell apoptosis via angiotensin II.",

In general, these dimers act less specific towards PO activity than parent monomers. Synergetic interactions of the doubled basic dye compartments with cell constituents cause a pronounced staining of further targets at the cellular level. This behavior depends on the functional groups present in each dye compartment in a crucial manner.

Human meninges developed as two mesenchymal condensations in the head region. The simple squamous epithelium on the surface of leptomeninges developed during mesenchymal to epithelial transformation. Nestin appeared for the first time in week 7, EMA in week 8, while mesothelin appeared in week 22 of development. In the late fetal period and after birth, nestin expression decreased, whereas expression of EMA and mesothelin increased. EMA appeared in all surface epithelial cells and nodules, while mesothelin was found only in some of them. In adult meninges, all three proteins were predominantly localized in the surface epithelium and meningeal nodules. In meningothelial meningiomas (WHO grade I), EMA was detected in all tumor cells except in the endothelial cells, mesothelin characterized nests of tumor cells, while nestin was found predominantly in the walls of blood vessels. The distribution pattern of those proteins in normal meningeal and tumor cells indicates that nestin might characterize immature cells, while EMA and mesothelin appeared in maturing epithelial cells. Neoplastic transformation of these specific cell lineages contributes to the cell population in meningiomas.",

Newborn postnatal day 7 (P7) and young adult rats (P28) were exposed to pulsed electromagnetic fields (EMF) at a frequency of 2.45\u00a0GHz and mean power density of 2.8\u00a0mW/cm2 for 2\u00a0h. Post-irradiation changes were studied using immunohistochemical localization of Fos and NADPH-d. We found that short-duration exposure induces increased Fos immunoreactivity selectively in cells of the SVZ of P7 and P28 rats. There were no Fos positive cells visible within the RMS of irradiated rats. These findings indicate that some differences exist in prerequisites of proliferating cells between the SVZ and RMS regardless of the age of the rats. Short-duration exposure also caused praecox maturation of NADPH-d positive cells within the RMS of P7 rats. The NADPH-d positive cells appeared several days earlier than in age-matched controls, and their number and morphology showed characteristics of adult rats. On the other hand, in the young adult P28 rats, EMR induced morphological signs typical of early postnatal age. These findings indicate that EMR causes age-related changes in the production of nitric oxide (NO), which may lead to different courses of the proliferation cascade in newborn and young adult neurogenesis.",

We had previously identified and characterized two isoforms of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) from the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis that differ at their regulatory (R) subunit, namely, Rmyt1 or Rmyt2. Here we investigated the immunohistochemical expression of both PKA isoforms in various mussel tissues. Rmyt1 and Rmyt2 displayed a complementary subcellular localization. In general, Rmyt1 was found to be uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of most cell types, whereas Rmyt2 appears to be localized only in the cell periphery and associated with certain cellular structures, such as the cilia of labial palps and gill filaments. Thus, both PKA isoforms appear to be non-redundant, but they have specific functions. Rmyt1 was the main isoform present in catch muscle fibers, which suggests that PKAmyt1 may be the isoform involved in the regulation of the catch state. Conversely, Rmyt2 was the only isoform detected in the cilia of gill filaments, indicating that PKAmyt2 could mediate the effects of cAMP on the ciliary beat frequency.",

Aberrant glycosylation is a key feature of malignant transformation and the glycans involved influence the adhesive interactions of cancer cells often providing favorable conditions for tumor dissemination. This review focuses on glycans on the cancer cell surface and their association with endogenous lectins. In particular, E-cadherin and siglec-mediated disaggregation of tumor cells from the primary tumor mass; integrins, laminin and CD44-mediated invasion and migration of tumor cells through the connective tissue; the involvement of heparan sulphate in tumor angiogenesis and C-/S-type lectin interactions with the vasculature.

Glial and neuronal changes have been described during development following chronic or acute lead intoxication, however, little is known about the effects of chronic lead intoxication in adults. In this study we evaluated immunohistochemically the glial and dopaminergic systems in adult male Wistar rats. 0.5% (v/v) lead acetate in drinking water was administrated chronically over a 3-month period. Hypertrophic immunoreactive astrocytes were observed in the frontal cortex and other brain structures of the treated animals. Analysis of the astroglial features showed increased number of astrocyte cell bodies and processes in treated rats, an increase confirmed by Western blot. Particular distribution of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was observed within the blood vessel walls in which dense immunoreactive glial processes emanate from astrocytes. Glial changes in the frontal cortex were concomitant with reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neuronal processes, which seem to occur as a consequence of significantly reduced dopaminergic neurons within the nucleus of origin in the substantia nigra. These glial and neuronal changes following lead intoxication may affect animal behavior as evidenced by reduced locomotor activity in an open field test. These findings demonstrate that chronic lead exposure induces astroglial changes, which may compromise neuronal function and consequently animal behavior.",

It has been generally accepted that Wnt5a, a non-canonical Wnt gene, inhibits the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Several reports have addressed its mRNA expression in embryonic and postnatal hair follicles, but its exact role in the growth of hair follicles is currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the immunolocalization of Wnt5a protein in pelages of the dorsal skin and whisker follicles of mice. We found that in the anagen phase, dermal papilla cells showed the highest staining levels of Wnt5a protein, while in the catagen and the telogen phases the staining levels were lower. During the growth stage, Wnt5a protein was prominently located in the matrix and precortex cells in addition to the inner root sheath, outer root sheath and the dermal papilla. As the hair cycle progresses, the immunostaining of Wnt5a was gradually decreased in the catagen phase and was located in the bulge and secondary hair germ in the telogen phase. This Wnt5a immunostaining profile was consistent between dorsal skin pelages and whisker follicles. Furthermore, in an in vitro study using whisker follicle organ culture, we demonstrated that the growth of the hair shaft was significantly inhibited by adenovirus Wnt5a. Our findings suggest that Wnt5a is a dynamic factor in the hair cycle and it is important for the regulation of hair shaft growth.",

AGEs modify the tissue protein structure and function and stimulate the cellular responses mediated by a specific receptor for AGEs (RAGE). This study investigated the localization of AGEs in degenerated cartilage using newly identified epitope-specific antibodies to determine the linkage between the distribution of AGEs and the development and progression of OA. Osteochondral specimens of the tibial plateau from OA patients were immunostained by specific antibodies against N\u025b-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), N\u025b-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), pentosidine, GA-pyridine, and RAGE. The immunohistochemical distribution of these epitopes was evaluated during cartilage degeneration. The immunoreactivity (IR) of AGEs and RAGE was stronger in cells rather than in the extracellular matrix. Higher IR of cellular CML and CEL was observed in both mild and severe OA cartilage in comparison to macroscopically intact cartilage. There was a strong association between GA-pyridine and RAGE in the pattern of increasing IR with the OA grade. These IR patterns of AGEs varying with cartilage degeneration indicate that AGE modified proteins are associated with cartilage degeneration. The coincidental up-regulation of GA-pyridine and RAGE suggests that GA-pyridine is the most significant AGE for cartilage degeneration via the RAGE pathway.",

Osteopenia may result in an increased delay in healing of bone fractures and subsequently affect the quality of life. We evaluated the immunohistochemical localization of TRAIL and its receptor DR5 in the femoral bone of 10-week-old Sprague\u2013Dawley male rats treated with sesame oil (control, group 1), streptozotocin (STZ), a diabetes inducer (group 2), l-NAME, a general inhibitor of NOS activity (group 3), l-arginine (group 4), (arginine acts as a NO substrate) and iNOS immunostaining in group 1 and group 4. Histological and histochemical findings showed decreased growth of metaphyseal cartilage (which was thinner), decreased osteoid surface, and reduced mineral apposition rate in STZ- and l-NAME-treated rats. These findings confirm that bone formation is impaired in diabetic osteopenia. l-arginine supplementation seems to prevent diabetes-induced bone alterations and preserve the calcification process, allowing synthesis of new bone matrix. The immunohistochemical study revealed increased immunostaining of TRAIL and DR5 in osteoblastic cells of the diaphysis (pre-metaphysis) and epiphysis treated with STZ and l-NAME, related to activation of osteoblastic apoptotic death, while the group receiving l-arginine was comparable to the control group and the higher indications of iNOS activity that may reflect its induction by l-arginine administration. The action of l-arginine suggests that increased NO synthesis and availability is potentially useful for effective prevention and treatment of diabetic osteopenia.",

     "abstract": "The exact nature of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is still in dispute. In recent years, the main controversy of its nature has focused on hemangioma and vascular malformation. In this study, the immunolocalization of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-1/fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (VEGFR-1/Flt-1), VEGF receptor-2/fetal liver kinase-1 (VEGFR-2/Flk-1), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and CD34 was investigated in 28 cases of JNA and 20 cases of orbital cavernous hemangiomas (OCH). The immunostaining levels of VEGF, Flt-1, and Flk-1 were higher and more frequent in vascular endothelial cells of JNA than those of OCH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The average microvessel density (MVD) marked by CD34 in JNA was (49.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.1)/HPF (high power field), which was higher than OCH (29.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7)/HPF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Immunoreactivity of PCNA was localized in both endothelial and stromal cell components of JNA, but was predominantly seen in the stromal cells. However, no PCNA immunoreactivity was identified in any of the stromal and endothelial cells in cases of OCH. The immunostaining levels of CD34, VEGF, Flt-1, Flk-1, and PCNA in JNA were higher than those in OCH. These data support the view that JNA has biological characteristics of an angiogenic histogenetic tumor. In the future, anti-angiogenic therapy may represent a novel treatment strategy for JNA.",

The viscacha (Lagostomus maximus maximus) is a rodent with photoperiod-dependent seasonal reproduction. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of photoperiod seasonal variations and melatonin administration on the folliculostellate cells in pituitary pars distalis of viscacha. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis were used to measure the percentage of S-100-positive area (total, cellular and colloidal) and the number of folliculostellate cells. The S-100 protein was immunolocalized at intracellular (folliculostellate cells) and extracellular (follicular colloid) levels. The morphometric parameters analyzed exhibited seasonal variations with highest values in the summer (long photoperiod) and lowest values in the winter (short photoperiod). The administration of melatonin caused a significant decrease of immunostaining. Results suggest that the natural photoperiod might be the most important environmental signal causing the decrease in folliculostellate cells immunostaining observed in the winter. These findings agree with seasonal changes previously reported in endocrine cells and suggest that folliculostellate cells may be involved in the paracrine regulation of the secretory activity of pituitary pars distalis through S-100 protein production.",

Follicles were serially cut and used for histological and histochemical characterization and also for immunohistochemical detection of both c-kit and SCF. C-kit and SCF were localized in the follicles with a differing pattern with regard to the stage of sexual cycle or the cell type forming the follicular epithelium (granulosa). In pre-reproductive follicles, where the granulosa consists of three main different cytotypes, the c-kit receptor was prevalently localized on the plasmalemma of small cells, although some pyriform and intermediate cells also appeared positive. C-kit was also localized in the theca. In pre-reproductive follicles, SCF was markedly observed in the cytoplasm of some pyriform cells. Small cells and theca also stained moderately positive, whereas the intermediate cells were mostly negative. In reproductive follicles, where granulosa cells are morphologically rearranged, c-kit was observed in small cells and in some thecal elements, while SCF was weakly immunostained. At the site of follicular layer invaginations evident c-kit/SCF immunostaining was observed in the granulosa epithelium and in the theca. These observations suggest that the expression of c-kit and SCF changes as a function of follicular development and may reflect the involvement of this system in the maturation of the oocyte.",

The mechanisms of the synaptic plasticity remain to be determined. In our studies in mice and rats, pilocarpine-induced seizures were done in order to gain information on the process of synaptogenesis. After a 2-month survival period, changes in the levels of synaptic markers (GAP-43 and Syn-I) were examined in the hippocampus by means of semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) was examined in each brain using Timm's sulphide-silver method. Despite the marked behavioral manifestations caused by pilocarpine treatment, only 40% of the rats and 56% of the mice showed MFS. Pilocarpine treatment significantly reduced the GAP-43 immunoreactivity in the inner molecular layer in both species, with some minor differences in the staining pattern. Syn-I immunohistochemistry revealed species differences in the sprouting process. The strong immunoreactive band of the inner molecular layer in rats corresponded to the Timm-positive ectopic mossy fibers. The staining intensity in this layer, representing the ectopic mossy fibers, was weak in the mouse. The Syn-I immunoreactivity decreased significantly in the hilum, where Timm's method also demonstrated enhanced sprouting. This proved that, while sprouted axons displayed strong Syn-I staining in rats, ectopic mossy fibers in mice did not express this synaptic marker. The species variability in the expression of synaptic markers in sprouted axons following pilocarpine treatment indicated different synaptic mechanisms of epileptogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Mammals spontaneously prefer lipid rich foods. Overconsumption of high-fat diet leads to obesity and related diseases. Recent findings indicate that taste may participate in the orosensory perception of dietary lipids and the fatty taste may contribute to a preference for and excessive consumption of dietary fat. CD36, a trans-membrane glycoprotein, which is located in the taste buds of circumvallate papillae of rodents, appears to be a plausible receptor for this fatty taste. Obese subjects present a stronger preference for fatty foods, though the mechanisms involved are complex and are not fully investigated. Our data from immunofluorescence and real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression levels of CD36 in circumvallate taste buds were significantly lower in high-fat diet induced obese rats as compared with that of control rats fed a normal diet. These results suggest that decreased expression of CD36 in circumvallate taste buds of high-fat diet induced obese rats may be associated with diminished fatty taste sensitivity and in order to compensate the preference for dietary fat, rats consume more fatty foods. Therapeutic strategies designed to alter or manipulate CD36 expression or function in taste buds may have important implications in treating obesity and related diseases.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate immunocytochemically the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptors in the frog retina. Six primary antibodies were used. Three of them were directed to different splice variants of the NR1 subunit and the remaining three variants directed to NR2 subunits. All antibodies showed well expressed labeling in the frog retina. The labels had a punctate character and were located mainly in the inner and the outer plexiform layers. The results obtained indicate that the NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptor may participate in the glutamatergic neurotransmission from photoreceptors to second order retinal neurons, as well as from bipolar cells to third order retinal neurons. It has been proposed that in the frog retina, several subtypes of NMDA receptors exist each involved with different functions.",

We compared MSCs of BALB/c mice derived from BM and AT with respect to proliferation potential, immunophenotype, and multilineage differentiation capacity. In proliferation potential, MSCs from AT (ASCs) showed higher fibroblastoid colony-forming units frequencies and colony-forming efficiency than MSCs from BM (BMSCs). The flow cytometry analysis showed that both ASCs and BMSCs expressed MSCs-related antigens (CD90 and CD105), whereas they did not express hematopoiesis-related antigens (CD45 and CD11b). There was no significant difference in adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation between the murine ASCs and BMSCs. In conclusion, the present study has shown that ASCs had higher CFU-F frequencies and colony-forming efficiency than BMSCs. ASCs and BMSCs presented a similar surface immunophenotype and multilineage differentiation capacity. Therefore, ASCs in BALB/c mice might be a more useful material for cell therapy of the airway allergic experiment due to the abundance, relatively easy harvesting and high proliferation potential.",

A fine balance between cell proliferation (Ki-67), death (caspase-3) and cell survival (bcl-2) characterized early human upper jaw development. A rise in the number of apoptotic cells always temporally coincided with the decrease in number of surviving bcl-2 positive cells within the palatal region.

The rats were investigated at 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks after STZ-treatment. By means of immunohistochemistry, the expression of Ets-1 in glomeruli was significantly increased in STZ-treated rat kidneys from week 1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and reached the peak at week 4 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), followed by a downward trend at subsequent time points.

In the three-month-old pig uterus, the proliferation of stromal cells was observed only after prenatal exposure to flutamide, whereas ER\u03b1 staining was weaker. The neonatal administration of flutamide caused a significant decrease in the proliferation of the surface epithelium and diminished intensity of ER\u03b1 staining in the stromal cells of the uterus of three-month-old pigs, which paralleled decreased estrogen levels in these animals. Overall, prenatal flutamide exposure promoted growth and development of the neonatal porcine uterus.

In the present study, we investigated morphological change in tooth germ obtained from ENAM-mutant mice (EnamRgsc521 homozygotes) as a model for human AI using histological and immunohistochemical methodologies. The results showed that ameloblasts detached from developing dentin and lost cell polarity in mutant mice at post-natal day 3. Cyst-like structures, including amelogenin-immunopositive materials, were observed between these detached cells and the dentin. No enamel-like structure, however, was observed in the cusp of the crown. These results suggest that enamelin acts as an adhesion molecule and is involved in ameloblast cell differentiation during the early stages of tooth development.",

     "abstract": "In heart failure, exertional fatigue of skeletal muscles can occur. A transgenic mouse overexpressing calsequestrin can be regarded as an animal model of heart failure. The aims of the present study were to investigate, whether at the time of cardiac failure the composition of fiber types of skeletal muscles was altered, what kind of alterations in glycolytic and oxidative enzyme activities occurred in different muscle fiber types and whether these were affected by the administration of the angiotensin II receptor blocker, losartan. Hemodynamic parameters were determined using a working heart preparation. Four groups of mice were investigated: wild-type (WT) mice and transgenic (TG) mice overexpressing calsequestrin, with and without losartan treatment. Enzyme activities were measured in homogenates of Rectus femoris muscle and in muscle fibers, which were typed by their metabolic profile. Calcineurin expression was measured by Western blotting. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was increased by 275% in R. femoris muscle homogenates of TG compared to WT mice. This was due to a 57% increase in slow oxidative fibers, which was accompanied by an increased calcineurin expression in TG muscles. This increase was attenuated by losartan treatment. With respect to glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (GPDH), no difference was evident comparing WT and TG. Treatment with losartan resulted in a down-regulation of GPDH in WT and TG. In conclusion, changes in skeletal muscles occur in this mouse model of heart failure and these changes were antagonized by losartan. In contrast to heart failure patients, in the mouse model a shift to the oxidative phenotype of skeletal muscle was noted, possibly due to enhanced calcineurin expression.",

     "abstract": "In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that polyethylene wear particles are the main cause for osteolysis in prosthetic loosening. Elevated amounts of proteases including gelatinases (or matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9) have been found in fibrous tissue interfaces of loosened total hip arthroplasties suggesting that proteolysis plays a role in osteolysis. The presence of proteases does not mean that they are active, because activity of proteases is highly regulated at the post-translational level. We investigated whether the activity of two major proteases that are active extracellularly and have been associated with loosening, MMP-2 and MMP-9, is involved in loosening of non-cemented hip implants with polyethylene acetabular components. Eight interface tissues retrieved during revision were studied with light and electron microscopy and by in situ zymography to localize MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity in combination with immunohistochemistry to localize MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins. All interface tissues contained large amounts of polyethylene wear particles, either in large accumulations or dispersed in the extracellular matrix or intracellularly in fibroblasts. Particles were not encountered in association with MMP-2 or MMP-9 activity or leukocytes. Inflammation was never found. MMP-9 activity was restricted to macrophages and MMP-2 activity was restricted to microvascular endothelial cells mainly outside areas where particles were present. Our data indicate that wear particles do not induce activation of leukocytes or MMP-2 or MMP-9 activity. Therefore, aseptic loosening may not be particle induced but initiated by other mechanisms such as mechanical stress.",

However, most reports are based on studies of fewer than three Hh target genes and the data vary between different studies. In the present report, we have determined the expression levels of several important components of the Hh pathway in lung cancers by using RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. These molecules include Smoothened (SMO), Rab23, the downstream target platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1), hedgehog interacting protein (HIP) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-beta (HNF3\u03b2). Our data show that some components of the hedgehog pathway, such as SMO, Rab23 and PDGFR\u03b1 are expressed in many lung cancer specimens, although other hedgehog target genes are infrequently detected in lung cancer. Loss of HIP expression was found in several cases of lung cancers. Our study indicates that there might be some additional mechanisms involved in the hyperactivation of the Hh pathway. Thus, we suggest that lung cancer with heterogeneous tumor type harboring Hh signaling activation may have some novel and different regulatory mechanisms.",

The LpPAG immuno-complexes were visualized with secondary goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins-conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorophore (green), among all nuclei of placental cells stained with propidium iodide (red). This is the first study reporting the immunolocalization of the LpPAG family identified by htdF-IHC at the feto/maternal interface during different pregnancy stages of the alpaca. The most dominant and strongest immune-positive LpPAG signals were found in the well-developed chorionic cell layer. Our htdF-IHC indicated relatively high epitope resemblance to that of the PAGs in camelids and pigs.

Coronary blood vessels running in the adventitia receive a rich supply of nNOS positive nerve fibers, thus suggesting their importance in the nitrergic control of blood flow in the conus arteriosus.

     "abstract": "Functional studies of the autonomic innervation in the photophores of luminescent fishes are scarce. The majority of studies have involved either the stimulation of isolated photophores or the modulatory effects of adrenaline-induced light emission. The fish skin is a highly complex organ that performs a wide variety of physiological processes and receives extensive nervous innervations. The latter includes autonomic nerve fibers of spinal sympathetic origin having a secretomotor function. More recent evidence indicates that neuropeptide-containing nerve fibers, such as those that express tachykinin and its NK1 receptor, neuropeptide Y, or nitric oxide, may also play an important role in the nervous control of photophores. There is no anatomical evidence that shows that nNOS positive (nitrergic) neurons form a population distinct from the secretomotor neurons with perikarya in the sympathetic ganglia. The distribution and function of the nitrergic nerves in the luminous cells, however, is less clear. It is likely that the chemical properties of the sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the ganglia of luminescent fishes are target-specific, such as observed in mammals.",

No immunoreactivity specific for K13 and K14 was detected in the lingual epithelium of fetuses on day 15 after conception (E15), at which time the primitive rudiment of the circumvallate papillae was detectable by the thickening of several layers of cuboidal epithelial cells. On E17 and E19, the developing circumvallate papillae were clearly recognizable, consisting of a central papilla and the surrounding sulcus. No immunoreactivity specific for K13 and K14 was evident in the lingual epithelium around these structures at this time. K14-specific immunoreactivity was first detected in the basal layer of the epithelium of the circumvallate papillae on postnatal day 0 (P0) and K13-specific immunoreactivity was detected on P7. Morphogenesis of the circumvallate papillae progressed significantly from P0 to P14, and immunoreactivity specific for K13 and K14 was clearly recognizable after P7. The respective patterns of K13-specific and K14-specific immunoreactivity differed during the development of the circumvallate papillae: K13-specific immunoreactivity was generally evident in cells of the intermediate layer of the epithelium, while K14-specific immunoreactivity was detected in cells of the basal and suprabasal layers.

     "abstract": "The dysregulation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been reported to be associated with tumor progression, angiogenesis and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical value of STAT3 expression in human osteosarcoma. First, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of STAT3 mRNA in normal bone tissues, chondroma tissues and osteosarcoma tissues. Then, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of STAT3 protein in 76 osteosarcoma tissues and the relationship of STAT3 protein expression with clinicopathologic factors or prognosis of osteosarcoma patients. RNA interference (RNAi) technology was employed to inhibit STAT3 expression. MTT and flow cytometric assays were performed to analyze the effect of STAT3 inhibition on proliferation and apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells. Finally, the expression of STAT3-related target genes were also determined. Results showed that osteosarcoma tissues showed significantly higher expression levels of STAT3 mRNA than normal bone or chondroma tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that the staining of STAT3 protein was mainly located in cytoplasm of osteosarcoma cells in osteosarcoma tissue samples. The high level of STAT3 protein was associated with poor tumor differentiation and presentation of metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.039 and 0.022). Moreover, the 5-year overall and relapse-free survival rates for osteosarcoma patients with high STAT3 expression were lower than those for patients with low STAT3 expression. In addition, the status of STAT3 protein expression was an independent prognostic factor for both disease-free survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0235) and overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0032). RNAi-mediated STAT3 inhibition could induce proliferation inhibition and apoptosis enhancement in osteosarcoma cells, which might be associated with inhibition of some anti-apoptosis genes. Overall, STAT3 plays crucial roles in osteosarcoma development and might become a potential molecular target for gene therapy of human osteosarcomas.",

The function of Rad14 presumably precedes that of the Rad1\u2013Rad10 endonuclease complex, which functions in a downstream step incising DNA 5\u2032 to the site of DNA damage. We investigated whether recruitment of Rad10 to UV-induced DNA damage sites in live cells is dependent on Rad14 using fluorescence microscopy. Experiments were carried out using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in which the gene for Rad14 was fused to Cyan Fluorescent Protein (Rad14-CFP) and that of Rad10 was fused to Yellow Fluorescent Protein (Rad10-YFP). Rad14-CFP forms nuclear localized CFP fluorescent foci in response to UV irradiation with the peak induction occurring 15\u00a0min post-irradiation. In contrast, Rad10-YFP foci form in response to UV with the peak induction occurring 2\u00a0h post-irradiation. Recruitment of Rad14-CFP is not dependent on the RAD10 gene but Rad10-YFP is recruited to UV-induced YFP foci in a RAD14-dependent fashion. Time-lapse experiments indicate that Rad14-CFP foci are transient, typically persisting less than 6\u00a0min. Together these data support the model that yeast NER protein assembly is step-wise whereas Rad14 required to recruit Rad10 and Rad14 involvement is transient.",

Following targeted Alb-Cre-mediated deletion of Ikk\u03b2 in Ikk\u03b2\u0394hep mice (Ikk\u03b2F/F:Alb-Cre, a strain highly susceptible to chemically induced hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinogenesis), CD74 is expressed abundantly by adult hepatocytes throughout liver acini, albeit more intensely in midzonal-to-centrilobular regions. By comparison, CD74 expression is not observed in Ikk\u03b2F/F hepatocytes, nor is it augmented in the livers of Ikk\u03b2+/+:Alb-Cre mice; CD74 is barely detectable in cultured embryonic fibroblasts from Ikk\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice.

Changes in the abundance of bradykinin were correlated with changes in bradykinin B2-receptor in order to determine the functional significance of this peptide for follicular development, ovulation and luteinization. Bradykinin immunoreactivity was mainly observed in the granulosa cells of antral follicles, especially around the oocytes and lining the antral cavity during proestrus and estrus phases of the cycle. Recently formed corpora lutea showed mild immunoreactivity for both bradykinin and bradykinin B2-receptor.

Immunoblot analysis for bradykinin and bradykinin B2-receptor attained a peak during late evening in proestrus, which may be the time of the LH surge. Thereafter bradykinin and bradykinin B2-receptor declined sharply during the estrus phase. When the concentration of bradykinin was correlated with bradykinin B2-receptor throughout the estrous cycle, they showed strong positive correlation.

Purified S-GAGs obtained from the whole body of adult earthworms were composed of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS). In addition, an unknown, highly sulfated polysaccharide (HSP) was detected. In order to characterize specifically the S-GAG composition in the integument, earthworms were dissected and as much as possible of their viscera was removed. HS and CS were the predominant sulfated polysaccharides in the dissected integument, whereas in viscera, CS, HS and the HSP were found in proportions similar to those identified in the body. The qualitative S-GAG composition in juveniles was similar to that obtained from adult earthworms. CS was the predominant S-GAG in newborn earthworms, accompanied by lesser amounts of HS and by tiny amounts of the HSP. This study provides a detailed descriptive account of the pattern of S-GAG synthesis during development, and also the characterization of the tissue distribution of these compounds in the body of earthworms.",

     "abstract": "Anatomical and functional studies of the autonomic innervation of the photophores of luminescent fishes are scarce. The present immunohistochemical study demonstrated the presence of nerve fibers in the luminous epithelium and lens epithelium of the photophores of the hatchet fish, Argyropelecus hemigymnus and identified the immunoreactive elements of this innervation. Phenylethanolanine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and catecholamine (CA)-synthesizing enzymes were detected in nerve varicosities inside the two epithelia. Neuropeptides were localized in neuropeptide Y (NPY) and substance P (SP)- and its NK11 receptor-immunopositive nerves in the lens epithelium. Neuropeptides were also localized in non-neural cell types such as the lens cells, which displayed immunoreactivities for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) and their receptors R-12 and 93093-3. This reflects the ability of the neuropeptide-containing nerves and lens cells to turn on and off the expression of selected messengers. It appears that the neuropeptide-containing nerves demonstrated in this study may be sensory. Furthermore, neuronal nitric oxide synthase-immunopositive axons associated with photocytes in the luminous epithelium have previously been described in this species. Whereas it is clear that the photophores receive efferent (motor) fibers of spinal sympathetic origin, the origin of the neuropeptide sensory innervation remains to be determined. The functional roles of the above neuropeptides or their effects on the bioluminescence or the chemical nature of the terminals, either sensory or postganglionic neurons innervating the photophores, are still not known.",

A trained group injected with saline and an untreated control group were examined to compare changes in COx activity in the dorsal hippocampus, anterior thalamus, mammillary nuclei, prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area. The scopolamine-treated group showed an impairment of spatial learning. Also, a decrease in COx activity was found in this group as compared to the saline group in the anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei. Overall, these findings suggest that memory deficits induced by scopolamine may be due to impairment of the cholinergic function in the anterior thalamic nuclei.",

The results showed that the FITC-labeling index in antibody was negatively correlated with the binding affinity for its target antigen. Immunohistochemically, an antibody with a higher labeling index had a tendency to be more sensitive, but was also more likely to yield non-specific staining.

Furthermore, the two peptides were occasionally co-stored in the epithelial cells of the mucosa.

After sacrifice of adult male Wistar rats by perfusion fixation, the submandibular glands and mandibles were excised and placed together in each of the following solutions: (a) 5% nitric acid in 4% formaldehyde; (b) 4.13% EDTA pH 7.4; (c) 5% trichloroacetic acid.

It was observed that decalcification did not produce noticeable differences in terms of EGF and EGFR immunoreactivity, but had an effect on the quality of the morphology and staining.

Twenty male Wistar rats aged 10 weeks old were killed after general anesthesia. The circumvallate papillae, fungiform papillae and pancreas tissues were separately collected. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression and distribution of sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) or sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in rat taste buds. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to analyze the expression of SUR1 or SUR2 mRNA. The pancreatic tissues from the same rat were used as positive control. This is the first study to report that SUR1 is uniquely expressed in the taste buds of fungiform papillae of each rat tongue, while the expression of SUR1 or SUR2 was not detected in the taste buds of circumvallate papillae. SUR1 is selectively expressed in rat taste buds, and its distribution pattern may be functionally relevant, suggesting that the rapid insulin secretion-promoting effect of repaglinide may be exerted through the cephalic-phase secretion pathway mediated by taste buds.",

     "abstract": "Notch signaling is firmly established as a form of cell-to-cell communication that is critical throughout development. Dysregulation of Notch has been linked to cancer and developmental disorders, making it an important target for therapeutic intervention. One aspect of this pathway that sets it apart from others is its apparent reliance on endocytosis by signal-sending and signal-receiving cells. The subtle details of endocytosis-mediated molecular processing within both ligand- and receptor-presenting cells that are required for the Notch signal to maintain fidelity remain unclear. The endosomal system has long been known to play an important role in terminating signal transduction by directing lysosomal trafficking and degradation of cell surface receptors. More recently, endocytic trafficking has also been shown to be critical for activation of signaling. This review highlights four models of endocytic processing in the context of the Notch pathway. In ligand-presenting cells, endocytosis may be required for pre-processing of ligands to make them competent for interaction with Notch receptors and/or for exerting a pulling force on the ligand/Notch complex. In receptor-presenting cells, endocytosis may be a prerequisite for Notch cleavage and thus activation and/or it could be a means of limiting ligand-independent Notch activation. Recent advances in our understanding of how and why endocytosis of Notch receptors and ligands is required for activation and termination of signaling during normal development and in disease states are discussed.",

Islet cells showed variable shapes, angular or fusiform, with long cytoplasmic processes, granular cytoplasm, and a large eccentric nucleus. Cells were found scattered or as aggregates or cords.

Macroscopically, the Brockman body of H. didactylus is visible as a milky white nodule separated from the exocrine tissue.

However, Notch protein expression in Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) and Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) is not clear. In this study we aimed to clarify the immunolocalization of Notch proteins in full-term placentas after IUGR and PIH in comparison with normal placentas. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded term placentas obtained by caesarean operations were processed for immunohistochemical localization of Notch 1, 2, 4 and Jagged 2. Transmission electron microscopy was also performed. In normal term placentas, all Notch proteins were intensely immunostained in the brush border of cells of the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the basal (maternal) side and the chorionic plate (fetal) side. The endothelial cells were also intensely immunostained in both sides for Notch 1. However, in IUGR and PIH placentas, the immunoreactivities of all Notch proteins were decreased significantly in the brush border of cells of the syncytiotrophoblast layer and the reaction was generally observed in the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblast cells in the basal and chorionic plate sides. The reactivity in endothelial cells was also significantly decreased. Our results have shown that the immunoreactivity and localization of Notch proteins is altered in pathologic placentas. Therefore, we propose that deregulated expression of Notch proteins may contribute to the disruption of trophoblast differentiation, endothelial cell function and/or feto-maternal traffic down-regulation during pregnancy or vice versa in such pathologic conditions.",

Three-month old male Wistar rats were divided into control (C) and alcohol-exposed groups. The control group received distilled water, whereas the alcohol-exposed groups received either a low dose (2\u00a0g/kg body wt) or a high dose (5\u00a0g/kg) of ethanol for periods of 21 days, 3 or 6 months. The brains of the animals were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti-parvalbumin and anti-GFAP antibodies and the number of PV immunoreactive (PV-ir) neurons and GFAP immunoreactive (GFAP-ir) astrocytes were counted per unit area. Results showed that all groups exposed to ethanol had significantly reduced numbers of PV-ir neurons in all parts of the cerebral cortex compared to those of the control group (p<0.05). In contrast, the numbers of GFAP-ir astrocytes were increased in all parts of the cerebral cortex following the exposure to a high dose of ethanol after 21-days (but not a low dose) and both high and low doses of ethanol after 3-months or 6-months treatment compared to those of age-matched control groups (p<0.05). This indicated that in young rats (21-days), PV-ir neurons in all cerebral cortex areas seemed to be more sensitive to alcohol than GFAP-ir astrocytes. Moreover, the change in densities of both PV-ir neurons and GFAP-ir astrocytes became more apparent after exposure to prolonged and high doses of ethanol. The decrease of PV-ir neurons and the increase of GFAP-ir astrocytes indicated that alcohol may induce pathology in broad areas of the cerebral cortex. This may explain the underlying mechanism of brain atrophy and other impairments found in alcoholics. For investigations of the effects of alcohol on mediating brain pathology, we recommend the use of the two markers (PV and GFAP).",

     "abstract": "Our previous data indicated an important role for adrenocorticotropic (ACTH)-like molecules co-operating with macrophages to control the modifications in body homeostasis during the first period of the life of sea bass (up to 30 days post-hatching) before the lymphoid cells have reached complete maturation. The aim of the study was to determine the immunolocalization of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), which is a very important mediator of stress-related responses. Our data showed that immunostaining for CRF is localized already at 8 days after hatching in nerve fibers of the gastrointestinal tract wall from the pharynx to the anterior gut, when the larvae are still feeding on yolk. This pattern of immunolocalization appeared similar to that in 24-day-old larvae, but at this stage there were also large cells immunopositive to CRF located in the wall of the midgut and hindgut. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, which is a known stimulator of stress hormone responses, did not modify the CRF immunostaining pattern, though it did affect the immunolocalization of the peripheral CRF receptor, i.e. CRF-R2. Immunolocalization of CRF-R2 appeared in nerve fibers of the gut wall in larvae fixed 1\u00a0h after the end of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. The present results suggest that CRF plays important autocrine and/or paracrine roles in the early immune responses at the gut level in the larval stages of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) as already proposed for ACTH. Moreover, our studies taken together with other research on fish, in comparison with mammals, suggest a phylogenetically old role of CRF in immune\u2013endocrine interactions.",

     "abstract": "Synechococcus sp. IU 625 is one of the freshwater cyanobacteria responsible for harmful algal blooms (HAB). Cyanophages can serve as natural control agents and may be responsible for algal bloom prevention and disappearance. Cyanophage AS-1, which infects Synechococcus sp. IU 625 (Anacystis nidulans) and Synechococcus cedrorum, plays an important role in the environment, significantly altering the numbers of its hosts. Since seasonal (temperature-dependent) lytic induction of cyanobacterial prophage has been proposed to affect seawater algal blooms, we investigated if the AS-1 lytic cycle could be induced by a shift to high temperature. Our hypothesis was confirmed, as more phages were released at 35\u00a0\u00b0C than at 24\u00a0\u00b0C, with maximal induction observed with a shift from 24 to 35\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images provide direct evidence of lysogenic to lytic conversion with temperature shift. Thus, temperature is an important inducer for AS-1 conversion from lysogenic to lytic cycle and could have applications in terms of modulating cyanobacterial populations in freshwater aquatic environments. The study gives insight into the effect of climate change on the interaction between cyanophage and cyanobacteria in freshwater ecosystems.",

Corneal samples were collected and divided into three groups: (1) normal corneas from cadavers; (2) keratoconic corneal buttons; (3) keratoconic corneal buttons treated with cross-linking. A series of lectins including: DBA, SBA, PNA, ConA, WGA, UEA I, GNA, DSA, MAA, SNA, were used in combination with chemical and enzymatic treatments. Compared with the normal corneas, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine increased in the keratoconus corneas. L-fucose increased and/or appeared in the keratoconus and the cross-linked corneas. N-acetyl-D-galactosamine was more abundant in the epithelium of keratoconus corneas, but was lacking in the keratoconus and cross-linked endothelium. D-galactose-(\u03b21-4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine was absent in the whole stroma of the keratoconus corneas and in the deep layers of the cross-linked ones. Sialic acids increased in the keratoconus corneas and decreased in the cross-linked ones. These results showed altered glycosylation in the keratoconic corneas and partially similar glycosylation in the cross-linked corneas, compared to the normal ones. This suggests a role played by sugar residues in maintaining the corneal structure. The changes could be related to structural alterations in keratoconus. The present findings contribute to our understanding of the effect of cross-linking treatment of keratoconic corneas in therapeutic attempts to re-establish the normal corneal structure.",

Samples from patients with leiomyoma, cellular leiomyoma and cellular leiomyosarcoma (n=20 per group) were fixed in 10% formalin and processed using routine paraffin protocols. Following initial histological analysis, samples were immunostained with primary antibodies for VEGF, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, EGF-R and Ki-67 using an indirect avidin\u2013biotin peroxidase method. Immunostaining intensities were evaluated as mild, moderate or strong and a semi-quantitative method (H-Score) was used to compare the samples. While mild/moderate EGF-R immunostaining and moderate immunostaining for VEGF and its receptors were observed in samples of leiomyomas, much less immunoreactivity was observed in cellular leiomyomas. All immunoreactivities and immune-stained cells increased in leiomyosarcomas. When scores of intensity and percentage of positive staining cells were compared, all immunoreactivities were shown to be significantly increased in leiomyosarcomas compared to leiomyomas.These results suggest that in leiomyosarcoma, angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, its receptors and EGF-R, may be involved in tumor angiogenesis. Active tumor cells can trigger angiogenesis, interaction with surrounding tissue and in the tissue itself initiating angiogenic activity. Angiogenic growth factors play an important role and induce malignant transformation through both autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Anti-angiogenic agents may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of leiomyosarcoma.",

Data accumulating in recent years have confirmed that sensory inputs can influence the level of postnatal neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb. In this study, we studied neurogenesis in the rostral migratory stream of Wistar albino rat pups after exposure to an odor-enriched environment. The rats were olfactory stimulated twice daily with different odorants from the day of their birth up to 1, 2 or 3 weeks, respectively. Using bromodeoxyuridine, a marker of cell proliferation, we found an increased number of proliferating cells in the rostral migratory stream of rat pups submitted to olfactory stimulation.

In contrast, immunolocalization for Mel1a receptor was noted in various areas of the lung instead of in the bronchial region. Western blot analysis showed a single band at 37 and 39\u00a0kDa for Mel1a and Mel1b receptors, respectively, with the latter showing higher expression.

We further aimed to analyze the expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is regulated by PTEN and to investigate the possible mechanism of PTEN affecting the function of diabetic islet cells. The expressions of HIC1, PTEN and mTOR genes were examined in the pancreatic islets of 20 normal male Wistar rats and 47 diabetic male Wistar rats by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR. Results showed that expressions of HIC1 and PTEN in protein and mRNA levels were lower in pancreatic islets of diabetic rats than in normal rats. Expressions of mTOR in protein and mRNA levels were higher in pancreatic islets of diabetic rats than in the normal rats. Marked apoptosis of pancreatic islet cells was observed in 29 cases (29/47, 61.7%) in diabetic rats, but not in the remaining 18 (18/47, 38.3%) diabetic rats. The down-regulation of HIC1 and PTEN and up-regulation of mTOR in protein and mRNA level are positively correlated with functional impairment of islet cells in diabetic rats. From this study we conclude that HIC1, PTEN and mTOR cannot be recognized as the key influencing factors promoting pancreatic islet cells apoptosis of diabetic rats; however, lower expressions of HIC1 and PTEN and higher expression of mTOR may affect the function of the pancreatic islet cells in diabetic rats.",

The pancreas and liver, closely related developmentally, may retain a shared (hepatopancreatic) stem cell whose plasticity could be exploited to differentiate into either lineage, dependent on environmental signals. This novel study investigated whether signals from pancreatic mesoderm could induce the differentiation of adult hepatic stem cell-like cells into pancreatic endocrine cells in vitro. A porcine hepatic stem-like cell line, designated PHeSC-A2, was co-cultured with quail pancreatic mesoderm in a Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel\u2013Ham\u2019s F12.ITS culture system. Immunocytochemical studies revealed insulin- and glucagon-producing cells. Assessment of nuclear morphology indicated that these endocrine cells were PHeSC-A2-derived. It is thus proposed that the PHeSC-A2 cell line has a higher level of plasticity than previously indicated. These preliminary results and assessment of published data have led to the following postulations: (a) permissive signaling from pancreatic mesoderm suffices to induce hepatic stem cells to assume a pancreatic lineage, (b) the pancreatic phenotype assumed by hepatic stem cells is a default state, (c) the differentiation capacity embodied by these cells indicates the existence of a hepatopancreatic stem cell lineage.",

The mucin was produced in three different cell types: in sac-like cells in the esophagus, in surface epithelial cells in the stomach and in goblet cells in the caeca and intestine. Nearly the entire esophageal epithelial cell layer consisted of mucus cells, filled by both neutral mucin and non-sulfated acidic mucin. The gastric mucin occurred in the distal area of the surface epithelial cells only and contained mainly neutral proteoglycans rich in glucosamine and some galactosamine and sialic acid. The goblet cells contained mainly non-sulfated acidic mucin in the caeca and sulfated acidic mucin throughout the entire intestine. Much glucosamine and some galactosamine and sialic acid occurred regularly in these cells in both the caeca and intestine. The observation that goblet cells often displayed colors ranging between blue and purple\u2013magenta when alcian blue staining was followed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), or between blue and red\u2013brown when the alcian blue was followed by neutral red, may reflect different ages or stages of development and differentiation for these cells. The highly variable affinities to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-lectin) seen in these cells in the present study strengthens this view. However, such results may also suggest a true cellular heterogeneity reflecting various roles in lubrication, immunological defence, digestion and absorption.",

     "abstract": "When cultured cells are treated with fluorescent organelle probes or photosensitizer agents, a characteristic redistribution of fluorescence in cell structures occurs frequently after light irradiation. It is currently assumed that such changes, referred to as relocalizations of the fluorescent compounds, represent an important aspect of the photodynamic process, which is based on the excitation of photosensitizers by light in the presence of oxygen. As cell damage and death result from the oxidative stress induced by photodynamic treatments, we have studied here the redistribution of acridine orange (AO) and 3,3\u2032-dimethyl-oxacarbocyanine (DiOC1(3)) fluorescence after incubation of HeLa cell cultures with these compounds followed by blue light irradiation to achieve lethal effects. The relocalization of dyes from their original labeling sites (AO: lysosomes, DiOC1(3): mitochondria) to nucleic acid-containing structures (cytoplasm, nuclei and nucleoli) appeared clearly associated with cell death. Therefore, the relocalization phenomenon simply reflects fluorescence changes due to the different affinity of these dyes for living and damaged or dead cells. As fluorescent probes are often photosensitizers, prolonged light exposures using fluorescence microscopy will produce lethal photodynamic effects with relocalization of the fluorescent signal and changes in the cell morphology.",

Results revealed that uterine artery samples of women with prolapse showed a significantly weaker immunoreactivity to type VI collagen, vitronectin and elastin and a stronger immunostaining for type III collagen and tenascin as compared to control samples.Our results suggest that the ECM may be altered in response to mechanical stretch.

In the primordial follicles and early growing follicles, Smad4 protein was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of the oocyte with a half-moon staining pattern. In the pre-antral follicles, Smad4 protein was mainly located in the granulosa cells, theca cells and diffusely distributed in the interstitial cells surrounding the follicle.

     "abstract": "The strength and integrity of the human skeleton depends on a delicate equilibrium between bone resorption and bone formation. Bone resorption is an elementary cellular activity in the modelling of the skeleton during growth and development. Later in life a most important physiological process in the skeleton is bone remodelling, which is locally initiated by resorption. During remodelling bone resorption is coupled to new bone formation that ensures renewal of bone with only minor local and temporary bone loss. Cells responsible for bone resorption and subsequent bone formation are the osteoclasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The osteoclast is derived from the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell, which gives rise to a myeloid stem cell that can further differentiate into megakaryocytes, granulocytes, monocytes/macrophages and osteoclasts. The respective bone resorbing and forming actions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are finely coupled, so that bone mass remains remarkably stable in a healthy adult. Imbalance between osteoclast and osteoblast activities can arise from a wide variety of hormonal changes or perturbations of inflammatory and growth factors resulting in postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease, lytic bone metastases, or rheumatoid arthritis, leading to increased bone resorption and crippling bone damage. In view of the critical role of osteoclasts in diverse pathology, there has been immense effort aimed at understanding the biology of this unique cell. The present review is focused on the current knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate the functional links between bone turnover and the immune system helping us to understand the main factors that lead to bone loss observed in osteoporosis, cancer and in rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this review paper is to consider the key molecular interactions involved in the formation of osteoclast cells in normal and pathological conditions.",

The aim of this review is to describe the properties and roles of NK cells in the human uterus during pregnancy. Uterine natural killer cells (uNK) constitute a major lymphocyte population during early gestation in the uterus. The uterine natural killer cells are recognized owing to their CD56bright, CD16\u2212, CD3\u2212 phenotype. Their number increases in the first trimester with a subsequent decline as pregnancy progresses. They have been shown to be closely associated with cells of the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) and spiral arteries. They play important roles in remodeling of the spiral arteries, control of trophoblast invasion and in the development of the placenta. Some studies have shown the number and repertoire of receptors of uNK differ between women with healthy pregnancies and those with pathologic pregnancies, such as pre-eclampsia or intrauterine growth retardation. During pregnancy, the cytotoxic characteristics of the uterine killer cells are not directed towards the fetus, and scientists continue to question and explore this phenomenon with increasing evidence that these cells may perform differing beneficial roles during pregnancy.

Two types of parapsoriasis have been delineated: large-plaque parapsoriasis and small-plaque parapsoriasis. The lack of clinical and histological features, which may allow distinguishing parapsoriasis from early mycosis fungoides has prompted several investigations to assess the role of immunohistochemistry in establishing a conclusive diagnosis of these conditions. However, the additional data obtained by immunohistochemical analysis concerning the CD4/CD8 ratio, the aberrant expression of T-cell antigens and the expression of proliferation markers has not generally helped establish a more definitive diagnosis. This review critically discusses these immunohistochemical markers and their use in diagnosis of parapsoriasis.",

Wax-embedded sections from different regions of the epididymal duct from adult, clinically healthy, buffalo bulls were used. Primary antibodies against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), S-100, galactosyltransferase (GalTase), alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), connexin 43 (Cx43) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were used for immunohistochemical studies. The results showed that, in addition to the well-known principal and basal cells, the epididymal epithelium, similar to that of other species, possessed apical cells and intraepithelial leukocytes. IHC showed that, with the exception of VEGF which reacted negatively, all antibodies used displayed variable reactivity in the different epididymal structures. Apical cells expressed a strong reaction with ACE along the entire length of the duct. The principal cells in the caput epididymis exhibited a distinct reactivity with S-100 and GalTase. The peritubular muscular coat displayed a marked immunostaining for \u03b1-SMA and for Cx43. In conclusion these findings showed a regional-specific distribution pattern, distinct from that in bovine bulls. Some potential functional capacities, especially absorptive and secretory ones, are discussed in relation to the different epididymal regions.",

Multiple immunoenzyme labeling using heat treatment is a simple, reliable and straightforward technique wherein the heat treatment prevents mixed labeling and cross-reaction. The present study determined the inactivation time for primary antibodies by heat treatment in order to apply this procedure to routine histopathological diagnosis and research, and found that the inactivation time differed among the primary antibodies. The secondary antibodies and the labeling enzyme were completely inactivated by heating for 10\u00a0min. Therefore, the inactivation of the primary antibodies is crucial to perform multiple immunoenzyme labeling using heat treatment. The sequential combination of the primary antibodies is also important; in the study presented here, an anti-thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) antibody should be used first and anti-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 antibody second, but not in the opposite sequence, to avoid a mixed-colour-labeling reaction. The present data provided the optimum combination of primary antibodies for multiple immunoenzyme labeling using heat treatment.",

Sections of fresh-frozen, un-demineralized incisors of the rat mandible were prepared for immunohistochemical localization of elastin, fibrillin-2 and microfibril-associated glycoprotein-1 (MAGP-1). The structure of the periodontal ligament was well preserved in sections of fresh-frozen tissues. At the basal region of the ligament, intense immunolabelling for fibrillin-2 and MAGP-1 was observed as dot-like structures (transversely sectioned fibers) mainly on the tooth side of the ligament close to the cementum. These dot-like structures gradually increased in number towards the incisal area and were distributed throughout the tooth side of the ligament. This pattern of distribution was the same as that of reported oxytalan fibers. Elastin-immunopositive fibers were also detected in the ligament, although the labelling was limited and distribution was sparse. In conclusion, both fibrillin-2 and MAGP-1 immunopositive fibers may serve as a scaffold for deposition of tropoelastin during elastogenesis in the periodontal ligament. They may also provide guidance for the migration of fibroblasts to the occlusive side, which generates contractile forces for the movement of the tooth for continuous eruption of incisors.",

The present study was designed to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of COX-2 in Chinese patients with prostate cancer. Firstly, RT-PCR and Western blot assays were performed to detect the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in prostate cancer cell lines and 20 tissue samples (tumor or corresponding non-tumor). Next, immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of COX-2 protein in 88 prostate cancer tissue samples. Finally, the correlation between COX-2 expression and clinicopathological factors and patient survival was evaluated. We found that the expression levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein showed significant difference among four prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, the levels of COX-2 mRNA and protein were significantly higher in prostate cancer tissues than in corresponding non-tumor tissues. COX-2 staining was positive in the cytoplasm of prostate cancer cells. High-COX-2 expression was correlated with the Gleason score (P=0.009), tumor stage (P=0.012), and lymph-node status (P=0.036). Furthermore, patients with high-COX-2 expression showed lower disease-free (P=0.014) and overall survival (P=0.047) rates than those with low-COX-2 expression. Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that the status of COX-2 protein expression was an independent prognostic indicator for patients\u2019 survival. Taken together, higher COX-2 protein expression might provide an independent prognostic marker for Chinese patients with prostate cancer who have undergone surgery.",

The experimental basis was immunohistochemistry, which was evaluated in a qualitative and statistically relevant semi-quantitative manner.

Two formalin-based routine fixation solutions (Bouin's solution, Ca-acetate formalin) were compared with the recently introduced formalin-free HOPE\u00ae fixative. In this context, we clearly demonstrated a diminished immunoreactivity for Ca-formol fixed samples; satisfactory results were obtained, particularly, from samples fixed in Bouin's solution. The HOPE\u00ae fixation method offers a relatively cheap alternative, as the antibody amounts can be reduced. An application in routine diagnostic is not advisable, because of several variable parameters.

We demonstrated the existence of several innate immune parameters, including pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 2, which was primarily expressed in the stratum basale; however, the presence \u03b2-glucan receptors remained inconclusive. Furthermore, the group of cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) was shown, comprising \u03b2-defensins 2 and 3 and cathelicidin. The less keratinized esophageal epithelium of the carnivorous cat was protected by high amounts of CAPs; whereas the more strongly keratinized epithelium of the herbivorous and omnivorous species with its characteristic layer structure exhibited clearly weaker reactions. Moreover, lysozyme could distinctly be demonstrated in the cells of the esophageal epithelium. It can be concluded that a first line of defence mechanisms of the innate immune system contributes to maintaining a microbial homeostasis on the surface of the esophageal epithelium of domesticated mammals.

Twenty-five male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: euthyroid, false thyroidectomy, thyroidectomy-induced hypothyroidism, methimazole-induced hypothyroidism (60\u00a0mg/kg), and treatment with methimazole (60\u00a0mg/kg) and a T4 injection (20\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/d sc).

In addition, animals treated with methimazole and T4 showed cellular damage in the lung, spleen and renal medulla with lesser damage in the liver, renal cortex and heart. The thyroidectomy only altered the lung structure. The alterations were prevented by T4 completely in the heart and partially in the kidney cortex. These results indicate that tissue damage found in hypothyroidism is caused by methimazole.",

Additionally, anogenital distance (AGD) was measured both in male and female offspring. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and RT-PCR were performed to assess the immunoreactivity and the presence of Cx43 protein and it's mRNA, respectively. Following flutamide exposure strong immunostaining for Cx43 was observed between testicular Leydig cells, between granulosa cells of primary follicles, and between interstitial cells surrounding clusters of oocyte nests in the ovarian cortex as in the respective controls. Differences between the flutamide-treated groups and the controls obtained by qualitative immunohistochemistry were confirmed by quantitative image analysis (*P<0.05; **P<0.01). In Western blotting, Cx43 appeared as a band of 43\u00a0kDa, whereas electrophoresis revealed PCR products of the predicted sizes. Screening for Cx43 expression revealed the presence of a transcript, both in control and in flutamide-treated pigs. The AGD values differed significantly from the control (*P<0.05). Overall, since no obvious changes in gonad morphology were observed and the Cx43 signal was present in all the examined tissues, it seems likely that androgens acting through ARs are not involved in the control of Cx43 gene expression in neonatal pig gonads.",

     "abstract": "Proteins BASP1 and MARCKS are abundant in axonal endings of neurons. Similarly to brain-specific protein GAP-43, BASP1 and MARCKS are reversibly bound to the plasma membrane. These proteins control both actin polymerization and actin cytoskeleton binding to the membrane. Performing these functions, BASP1 and MARCKS take part in growth cone guidance during development and in neurotransmitter secretion in adults. These activities predetermine the pivotal role of BASP1 and MARCKS in learning and memory. BASP1 and MARCKS were also found in non-nerve tissues, in particular, in the kidney and testis. Evidently, the physiological roles of these proteins differ in different tissues. Correspondingly, their intracellular location and activities may not be similar to those in neurons. In this paper, we analyze subcellular fractions (cytoplasm and nuclei) of rat kidney and testis with the purpose of determining the intracellular location of BASP1 and MARCKS. Western blots demonstrated that in these tissues, as in the brain, both proteins are present in the cytoplasm of the cell. According to our immunohistochemical study, BASP1 and MARCKS are specifically distributed in the tissues studied. In kidney, both proteins are present in cells located in glomeruli. In the testicular tubules, BASP1 is mainly expressed at the late stage of spermatogenesis (in spermatids) and is preserved in mature spermatozoa, while MARCKS appears equally during all stages of spermatogenesis. MARCKS is not found in mature spermatozoa. The results indicate that study of functions of BASP1 and MARCKS in the kidney and in the reproduction system holds much promise.",

Electron microscopy revealed that aging rats had zona reticularis cells with many lysosomes and irregular nuclei. The result suggests that the level of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation is coordinated within the complex, but differs between the complexes.

Anti-albumin precursor and anti-Hsp70 antibodies were topically applied in healing corneal epithelium of rabbit eyes in organ culture. Corneas were allowed to heal in vitro for up to 120\u00a0h in serum-free medium with 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml or without (migrating control) anti-albumin precursor/ or anti-Hsp70 antibodies. Fibronectin (Fb) (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) was used as a positive control. Immunofluorescence labelling was used to detect proteins in corneal epithelium at various time intervals following an epithelial defect. Delay in wound healing (p<0.005) was observed with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml anti-albumin antibody labelling. A similar pattern was observed when anti-fibronectin antibody (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) alone and in combination with anti-albumin (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) was ectopically added with wound closure occurring at 120\u00a0h. However with anti-Hsp70 antibody (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) slightly delayed (p<0.005) wound closure was observed at 96\u00a0h and considerable retardation >120\u00a0h with 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Additionally, immunofluoresence showed a strong co-localization of Hsp70 and albumin precursor during the active phase of wound healing. The presence of albumin precursor and Hsp70 in the epithelial compartment of the cornea indicates a role for these proteins in modulating cell behavior such as epithelial growth, adhesion or regeneration, thus contributing to corneal epithelial wound healing.",

Numerous cilia-like structures were found on the surface of each notochordal cell at the sites of their attachment to the notochordal sheath. Ultrastructurally, these structures consisted of the characteristic arrangement of peripheral and central microtubular doublets and were anchored to the inner layer of the notochordal sheath. Immunohistochemically, a positive reaction to applied dynein and \u03b2-tubulin antibodies characterized the area of the cilia-like structures.

In contrast to the erythroid cell lineage, similar nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA density\u2013concentration values were found only in early granulocytic progenitors such as myeloblasts and promyelocytes. In advanced stages of the granulocytic development starting with myelocytes, these cells were characterized by a larger decrease in the cytoplasmic RNA concentration in comparison with that of the nucleoli.

The immunolabelling of iNOS was detected in all groups but this immunoreactivity was not different among the groups. In conclusion, while G treatment, induced S-phase arrest, triggered the NOS pathway after treatment of MCF-7 cells, V treatment, arrested microtubule organization and did not change the NOS pathway.

Decreased gap junction-mediated intercellular communication corresponds to decreased Cx43 and increased cellular proliferation rates, as measured by immunolabelling of the Ki67 nuclear antigen. This study demonstrated also the persistence in high grade astrocytomas of elevated levels of Cx43 mRNA. The reduced levels of Cx43 protein should not to be ascribed to a reduced genetic transcription, but to an alteration of the post-transcriptional mechanisms such as the regulation of its synthesis and/or the intracellular transport to membrane sites.",

To gain insight into the basis for the unique structural/functional diversity of EOM fiber types and to explain their high fatigue resistance, rat superior rectus muscle (SRM) was studied using histochemical techniques. Muscle fibers were typed with regard to their oxidative and glycolytic profiles generated from succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and phosphorylase activities in combination with their morphologic characteristics. Superior rectus muscle is organized into two layers, a central global layer (GL) of mainly large diameter fibers and an outer C-shaped orbital layer (OL) of principally small diameter fibers. Five muscle fiber types were recognized within the SRM: I, II, III, IV and V. In the global layer, four muscle fiber types were identified: type I (18.25\u00b10.96\u00a0\u03bcm; 32%) showed intermediate SDH (coarse type) and high phosphorylase activity. Type II fibers (14.45\u00b10.82\u00a0\u03bcm; 22%) exhibited high SDH (fine type) and intermediate phosphorylase activity. Low SDH (granular type) and high phosphorylase activity were demonstrated by type III fibers (22.65\u00b11.73\u00a0\u03bcm; 36%). Type IV fibers (26.24\u00b11.32\u00a0\u03bcm; 10%) were recognized by their low oxidative and glycolytic reactions. In the orbital region, only three muscle fiber types were recognized; fiber types I and II were found to compose approximately two-thirds of the layer. The third orbital fiber type (type V, 10.05\u00b10.99\u00a0\u03bcm) exhibited low SDH and low phosphorylase profiles.

Seven different propolis extracts, numbered PE 1\u20137, produced in their natural ecological environment, were collected from the Hacettepe University Beytepe Campus area in Ankara, Turkey. Individual extracts at 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.063\u00a0mg/ml were incubated with MCF-7 cells during 2 days culture. Cell growth and cytotoxicity were measured colorimetrically by MTT assay. Apoptotic cell death was determined by the TUNEL method (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-biotin nick end-labelling) and caspase activity was investigated by immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against caspase 6, caspase 8 and caspase 9. The results showed that the PE 5 and 6 extracts at 0.125\u00a0mg/ml dilution induced apoptosis in association with increased number of TUNEL positive cells. MTT results showed that cultures exposed to the same extracts and at the same dilution experienced better cell growth compared to those cultures exposed to the other extracts. Immunpositivity for all caspases was detected after treatment with all the extracts and at all dilutions, with stronger immunoreactivity for caspase 6 than caspases 8 and 9. Caspase 6 labelling was especially strong in PE 5 and PE 6. We conclude that propolis may have anti-tumour effects by increasing apoptosis through the caspase pathway.

A gradient of intensity of 3\u03b2-HSD immunolabelling was observed in the granulosa layer of pre-ovulatory follicles, with almost negative immunolabelling in COCs and with the strongest immunoreaction in the mural granulosa cells. Post-ovulatory COCs showed strong 3\u03b2-HSD immunolabelling in the peripheral regions and weak labelling near the oocyte, suggestive of responsiveness of cumulus cells to an anti-luteinizing effect exerted by the fertilized oocyte. In pre-ovulatory follicles, a weak P450c17 immunopositivity was limited to expanded cumulus granulosa cells and the positive labelling persisted in post-ovulatory COCs. P450c17 immunopositivity was also found in ampullary epithelial cells. A strong AR immunopositivity was confined mainly to the COCs in pre-ovulatory follicles and a similar immunoreaction was present in the granulosa cells of ovulated COCs. Simultaneous AR and cytochrome P450c17 immunolabelling in the pre- and post-ovulatory COCs is suggestive of an intra- and paracrine androgen regulation of the cumulus granulosa cell function.",

Nitrergic activity was quantified by densitometric measurement of formazan deposits in the hippocampus, cerebellum and striatum of two-month-old offspring following histochemical assay for NADPH-diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity. Compared to control subjects, an increase in nitrergic activity was found in the molecular layer of dentate gyrus and in the lacunosum molecular and stratum radiatum of CA1 (cornus amoni 1) in the EtOH+MeHg group, whereas a single administration of EtOH increased the activity in all striatal segments. The cerebellum seems to be less sensitive at this time-point to intoxication, and presented an increase only at the molecular layer of EtOH-exposed animals when compared to the MeHg and EtOH+MeHg groups (ANOVA, one-way followed by Tukey's test, p<0.05 or p<0.01). Taken together, results suggest that developmental exposure to EtOH and MeHg, singularly or in combination, alters nitrergic activity in adult rat in different ways depending on the region and layer of the central nervous system (CNS), and that these alterations might be related to different local metabolic properties.",

The objectives of this study therefore were to find out if PAD could be demonstrated immunohistochemically in liver biopsies of patients with chronic hepatitis and if it is associated with METAVIR activity and fibrosis scores.Liver biopsies were obtained from 100 patients with chronic liver diseases between September 2006 and 2007. The biopsies were scored by two histopathologists according to the METAVIR activity and fibrosis scores after histological preparation. Immunohistochemistry for PAD was performed on the biopsies using a monoclonal antibody against PAD. PAD could not be demonstrated in normal liver biopsies but was found in the hepatocytes of patients with chronic hepatitis. PAD labeling could distinguish patients with no fibrosis from either F1 or F2 or F3 or F4 fibrosis. Similarly, PAD labeling could separate patients with no inflammatory activity from those with mild or moderate or severe activity. We concluded that PAD could be demonstrated immunohistochemically in liver biopsies of patients with chronic hepatitis and that its immunodetection was significantly associated with Metavir activity and fibrosis scores.",

     "abstract": "Despite the favorable treatment of cranial nerve neuropathology in adulthood, some cases are resistant to therapy leading to permanent functional impairments. In many cases, suitable treatment is problematic as the therapeutic target remains unknown. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2) is involved in neuronal maintenance and wound repair following nervous system lesions. It is one of few neurotrophic molecules acting in autocrine, paracrine and intracrine fashions depending upon specific circumstances. Peripheral cranial somatic motor neurons, i.e. hypoglossal (XII) neurons, may offer a unique opportunity to study cellular FGF-2 mechanisms as the molecule is present in the cytoplasm of neurons and in the nuclei of astrocytes of the central nervous system. FGF-2 may trigger differential actions during development, maintenance and lesion of XII neurons because axotomy of those cells leads to cell death during neonatal ages, but not in adult life. Moreover, the modulatory effects of astroglial FGF-2 and the Ca+2-binding protein S100\u03b2 have been postulated in paracrine mechanisms after neuronal lesions. In our study, adult Wistar rats received a unilateral crush or transection (with amputation of stumps) of XII nerve, and were sacrificed after 72\u00a0h or 11 days. Brains were processed for immunohistochemical localization of neurofilaments (NF), with or without counterstaining for Nissl substance, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, as a marker of astrocytes), S100\u03b2 and FGF-2. The number of Nissl-positive neurons of axotomized XII nucleus did not differ from controls. The NF immunoreactivity increased in the perikarya and decreased in the neuropil of axotomized XII neurons 11 days after nerve crush or transection. An astrocytic reaction was seen in the ipsilateral XII nucleus of the crushed or transected animals 72\u00a0h and 11 days after the surgery. The nerve lesions did not change the number of FGF-2 neurons in the ipsilateral XII nucleus; however, the nerve transection increased the number of FGF-2 glial profiles by 72\u00a0h and 11 days. Microdensitometric image analysis revealed a short lasting decrease in the intensity of FGF-2 immunoreactivity in axotomized XII neurons by 72\u00a0h after nerve crush or transection and also an elevation of FGF-2 in the ipsilateral of glial nuclei by 72\u00a0h and 11 days after the two lesions. S100\u03b2 decreased in astrocytes of 11-day-transected XII nucleus. The two-color immunoperoxidase for the simultaneous detection of the GFAP/FGF-2 indicated FGF-2 upregulation in the nuclei of reactive astrocytes of the lesioned XII nucleus. Astroglial FGF-2 may exert paracrine trophic actions in mature axotomized XII neurons and might represent a therapeutic target for neuroprotection in peripheral nerve pathology.",

Inflammation leads to the mobilization of various cells in developing atherosclerotic plaque and simultaneously triggers the up-regulation of various cytokine secretions from effector cells. To understand early molecular events during atherosclerosis we developed a rabbit model in which male New Zealand White rabbits were fed high cholesterol diets for 12 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were significantly increased in the high cholesterol diet group when compared to the control group during the experimental period (P<0.05). In parallel, the immunolocalization of CD40, MMP9, S100, CD68, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and von Willebrand factor (vWF) in developing atherosclerotic plaque of the aorta and carotid artery was increased in comparison with the controls fed with a regular diet (P<0.05). From the present study, we conclude that a high cholesterol diet up-regulates CD68 and CD40, which may play a possible role in the remodelling and destabilization of the atherosclerotic plaque of arteries with the up-regulation of MMP9 and hsCRP.",

Our results showed laminin-1 in all 20 KOTs studied; its labelling intensity was weak in three cases (15%), moderate in five (25%) and strong in 12 cases (60%). Laminin-1 immunolocalisation was predominantly continuous in 18 (90%) KOTs, including areas of acanthosis, subepithelial split and epithelial buds. Weak immunolabelling was observed in regions exhibiting an inflammatory process, especially in the case of intense inflammation. These findings suggest that laminin-1 does not participate in biological processes such as cystic epithelium-cystic wall separation or the formation of epithelial islands in KOTs. Furthermore, the discontinuous and weak labelling of this protein in the basement membrane of these tumors is probably a consequence of the inflammatory process in the tumor stroma.",

The current study in male Wistar rats was designed to immunolocalise DDAH I and II in relation to NOS and to investigate changes in distribution, activity and ADMA content in the acute period following myocardial infarction (MI) resulting from coronary artery ligation. Seven days after the coronary artery ligation, l-Arg and methylated arginine content, as well as DDAH activity were determined in homogenates of left ventricular (LV) infarct and border. The distribution of immunoreactive DDAH I, DDAH II, eNOS and iNOS were determined in sections of LV. In healthy hearts, DDAH I was absent, however, DDAH II was localized to endothelium and endocardium with a similar distribution to that of eNOS. Following MI, LV DDAH activity was increased (to 210\u00b119% of control, P<0.05). Both DDAH I and DDAH II proteins were detected in peri-infarct cardiomyocytes, while DDAH II immunoreactivity was additionally localized to infiltrating inflammatory cells and blood vessels in the healing infarct. Both plasma and LV concentrations of the DDAH substrate, ADMA, were increased post-MI, although the ratio of Arg:ADMA was retained in the LV post-MI relative to sham operated controls. In conclusion, DDAH II has a distribution similar to eNOS in healthy myocardium. The increased levels and activity of DDAH I and DDAH II enzymes following myocardial infarction suggest a potential role for them in local protection of NOS enzymes from inhibition by methylated arginines during infarct healing.",

Female Wistar rats were separated randomly into two groups: the control group (n=8) was injected with isotonic salt solution and the corticosteroid group (n=8) was injected with 10\u00a0mg/kg intramuscular corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) once a week for a period of 8 weeks. Femoral head specimens from each group were obtained at the end of the treatment and processed for routine histological and immunohistochemical examinations. Quantitative data were obtained by H-SCORE and statistical evaluations were performed. The immunolocalisation of all markers was more apparent in the superficial zone and decreased through the deeper zones in all groups. However, the intensity of labelling was much less obvious in the group treated with corticosteroid compared to control. H-SCORE analysis confirmed that in the group treated with corticosteroid, the intensity of Notch-1, Delta, CD105 and CD166 labelling had decreased significantly compared to control (p<0.05). In conclusion, based on the immunolocalisation of stem cell-specific markers Notch-1, Delta, CD105 and CD166, the data suggest that the stem cells may continue to exist in adult rat articular cartilage. It was also observed that systemic corticosteroid treatment may effect the immunolabelling intensity of these markers, suggesting that corticosteroid treatment may reduce the function and the regenerative capacity of these cells in articular cartilage.",

It is advantageous to perform atherosclerosis studies in apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apo E\u2212/\u2212) mice models, which develop atherosclerosis very rapidly in comparison to humans. Darbepoetin is a synthetic erythropoietin analogue and stimulates erythropoiesis. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of 16 weeks of darbepoetin treatment on serum protein profiles in Apo E\u2212/\u2212 mice during atherosclerosis progression. Serum proteomic analyses were performed using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) in the darbepoetin-treated and non-treated (control) Apo E\u2212/\u2212 mice groups. The protein profiles obtained using three different chips, CM-10 (weak cation exchange), H50 (reversed-phase) and IMAC-30 (immobilized metal affinity capture), were statistically analyzed using the ProteinChip data manager 3.0 program. At the end of 16 weeks of darbepoetin treatment, there was no significant difference in the size and degree of atherosclerotic lesions between the darbepoetin and control mice groups. In contrast, 145 protein/peptide-clustering peaks, >5\u00a0kDa, had statistically significant differences in their peak intensities between the darbepoetin and control mice groups (p<0.05). That the proteomic profiles of darbepoetin-treated Apo E\u2212/\u2212 mice were found to differ from those of the control group indicates a potential beneficial role of darbepoetin in atherosclerosis.

The free radical gas nitric oxide (NO) has recently been found to function as a messenger molecule in both central and peripheral trigeminal primary afferent neurons.

The aim of the study was to evaluate the distribution of trigeminal neurons according to size (small, medium and large neurons) and to correlate the percentage of NOS-immunopositive neurons with regard to neuronal size. The results showed a significant relationship between the percentage of nNOS-immunopositive neurons and the size of neurons. Evaluation of the percentage of nNOS-immunopositive neurons showed that they constitute about 50% of the total number of neurons and that they are represented mainly as large-sized neurons. The iNOS immunolabelling was very faint in all neuronal types. Since the nitroxidergic system is well represented in human trigeminal ganglia, this study indicates that it could play a relevant role in trigeminal neurotransmission.",

The presence of fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF1) and -2 (FGF2) in the regenerating tail of the lizard Lampropholis guichenoti has been studied using immunofluorescence labeling. The study reveals that FGF2 is mainly localized in the wound and scaling epidermis, in differentiating muscles, in spinal ganglia, regenerating nerves and spinal cord. FGF1 is also present in the wound and differentiating epidermis, but is detectable at lower levels in the regenerating muscles and spinal cord. FGF1 is present in blastema cells, while FGF2 labeling is relatively low in these cells. Fibroblasts of the forming dermis are rich in FGF1 but not in FGF2. Developing blood vessels label for both FGF1 and FGF2 while the cartilaginous, bone and fat tissues are poorly labeled or unlabeled for FGFs. The present study suggests that most FGFs in the regenerating tail are located in the nervous system, in the epidermis and muscles, and these tissues most likely require these growth factors for their differentiation and growth.

     "abstract": "The principal goal in treating surgical and non-surgical wounds, in particular for aged skin, is the need for rapid closure of the lesion. Cutaneous wound healing processes involve four phases including an inflammatory response with the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. If inflammation develops in response to bacterial infection, it can create a problem for wound closure. Reduced inflammation accelerates wound closure with subsequent increased fibroblast function and collagen synthesis. On the contrary, prolonged chronic inflammation results in very limited wound healing. Using histological and immunohistochemical techniques, we investigated the effects of a new wound dressing called Vulnamin\u00ae that contains four essential amino acids for collagen and elastin synthesis plus sodium ialuronate (Na-Ial), compared with Na-Ial alone, in closure of experimental cutaneous wounds of aged rats. Our results showed that the application of Vulnamin\u00ae dressings modulated the inflammatory response with a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) immunolocalisation, while increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) immunolocalisation. Furthermore, the dressing increased the distribution density of fibroblasts and aided the synthesis of thin collagen fibers resulting in a reduction in healing time. The nutritive approach using this new wound dressing can provide an efficacious and safe strategy to accelerate wound healing in elderly subjects, simplifying therapeutic procedures and leading to an improved quality of life.",

Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were studied at various stages of embryonic development (from 8.5- to 13.5-day-old embryos \u2013 E8.5\u201313.5). During early odontogenesis, transcripts for Bmp-4, Shh and Wnt-5a were co-localised at the tooth initiation stage. At E8.5, Shh mRNA expression was restricted to diencephalon and pharyngeal endoderm. Before maxillae and mandible ossification, Bmp-4 and Wnt-5a signals were detected in the mesenchymal cells and around Meckel's cartilage. During palatogenesis, Shh was expressed only in the epithelium and Wnt-5a only in the mesenchyme of the elevating palatal shelves. During tongue development, Shh expression was found in mesenchyme, probably contributing to tongue miogenesis, while Wnt-5a signal was in the epithelium, possibly during placode development and papillae formation. Taken together, these findings suggest that Bmp-4, Shh and Wnt-5a gene expressions may act together on the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal interactions occurring in several aspects of the early mouse craniofacial development, such as odontogenesis, neuronal development, maxillae and mandible ossification, palatogenesis and tongue formation.",

Mice were divided into five groups: carcinogen control (CC), normal control (NC) and saffron-treated Groups A, B and C. Groups A, B, C and CC mice received three topical applications of 7,12 dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) followed by croton oil on shaven dorsal skin for 8 weeks. NC mice received topical skin applications of the vehicle, acetone, only. Saffron infusion was fed orally to three groups of mice either before (Group A) or after (Group C) or both before and after (Group B) DMBA applications. The activities of antioxidant enzymes glutathione-S transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue samples taken at 0, 6, 10 and 12 weeks from all groups were assessed. Standard histological examination of skin demonstrated a beneficial action of saffron in mice where saffron treatments were given both before and after the induction of skin carcinogenesis. Saffron ingestion inhibited the formation of skin papillomas in animals and simultaneously reduced their size. In conclusion, saffron inhibits DMBA-induced skin carcinoma in mice when treated early. This may be due, at least in part, to the induction of cellular defense systems.",

Large nerve trunks in the sinus venosus were shown to contain tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and indicate the location of adrenergic nerve fibers, which are also associated with a coronary circulation to the ventricular myocardium in the mullet heart. Fluorescence immunolabelling methods revealed that the atrium and the outer and inner compact muscle of the ventricle have nerves in which substance P and galanin (GA) are localized. It seems likely that the cell bodies (perikarya) of the substance P and GA-immunopositive axons are located at sites outside the heart. The GA-immunopositive nerve fibers may represent a population of axons of intramural postganglionic nerve cell bodies. Most intracardiac nerve cell bodies are located in the sinus venosus and in the sinoatrial junction and reveal immunoreactivity to substance P, GA, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP). Furthermore, substance P immunoreactivity is present in the cardiac cells intermingled with the substance P-immunopositive nerve fibers. A nerve plexus consisting of a well-developed network of nerve fibers and nerve cell bodies may possibly correspond to a cardiac pacemaker, but its function in fish cardiac regulation is unknown and remains to be elucidated.",

In the I/R groups, the right kidney was removed and the artery and vein of the left kidney were clamped for 45\u00a0min followed by reperfusion for 1\u00a0h. In the SC-treated groups, SC dissolved in saline solution was given as a single dose (1\u00a0mg/kg) 60\u00a0min before the operation. Renal histology was analyzed by scoring the tubular damage and neutrophil infiltration. Tissue myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation were analyzed. The histological damage and the neutrophil infiltration induced by I/R were significantly less in the SC+I/R group (p=0.004 and p=0.003, respectively).

These transporting functions differ in different species. Antibodies, such as those directed against band 3, H+-ATPase, and also peanut lectin (PNA), bind specifically to the mitochondria-rich cells, but do so differently in various species. Examination of these immunolocalizations and lectin labeling in the skin of over 10 amphibian species, including both Anurans and Urodeles, illustrate species-specific differences. The binding pattern and the transport capabilities of the skin in the various species do not show a universal correlation, they appear to be species specific and do not permit construction of a general scheme common to all the species studied. The mitochondria-rich cells of heterocellular epithelia and their roles in ion transport remain a subject that requires further studies to elucidate their particular functions within the framework of the whole epithelium.",

In this study, we analyzed the immunolocalisation of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 with particular attention to the ER\u03b2cx isoform, PR, HER2/neu and Ki67 in endometrioid carcinoma. Their correlations with each other and with the conventional morphological prognostic parameters of myoinvasion and tumor grade were analyzed with respect to overall survival.

ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, ER\u03b2cx, PR, HER2/neu and Ki67 were detected using immunohistochemistry. The histological grade of the tumor correlated inversely with the intensity of immunolabelling of ER\u03b1 and PR, and this was highly significant. The depth of myoinvasion showed an inverse correlation only with the ER\u03b22/\u03b2cx immunopositivity and was not significantly associated with any other receptor evaluated. Analysis of the inter-relationship between receptor immunopositivity revealed a significant association of ER\u03b1 immunolocalisation with ER\u03b2 and with PR.

Here, we investigated the relationship between the defence against oxidative stress and human renal cell carcinoma that originates from proximal tubular epithelium. Oxygen insensitivity of the histochemical assay of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity is a diagnostic tool for the detection of carcinomas. Its mechanism is based on high G6PD activity, reduced superoxide dismutase activity and reduced numbers of peroxisomes in the cancer cells. Five out of the 8 renal carcinomas studied here demonstrated oxygen insensitivity. These carcinomas showed high G6PD activity, whereas the other 3 carcinomas contained lower G6PD activity and were oxygen sensitive like non-cancer cells. Oxygen insensitivity did not correlate with tumour grade, staging or presence of metastases. Electron microscopy and immunofluorescence of catalase showed large numbers of peroxisomes in epithelial cells of proximal tubules of normal human kidney, whereas these organelles were completely absent in cancer cells of all carcinomas. As a consequence of the absence of peroxisomes in cancer cells, fatty acid metabolism is disturbed in addition to the altered glucose metabolism that is generally observed in cancer cells. Therefore, therapeutic approaches should focus on metabolism in addition to other strategies targeting signal transduction and angiogenesis.",

The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) transports maternal Ig across the gut wall and is involved in the transport of IgG in the mammary gland. In this study we used RT-PCR to examine the gene expression of FcRn in the mammary gland during several physiological states of the Egyptian water buffalo. The buffalo FcRn showed a high sequence homology to that of other mammalian species and especially the cow. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive immunolabelling of FcRn in the epithelial cells of the acini and ducts of the examined mammary gland tissue. Remarkable differences in both the cellular localization and in the intensity of FcRn immunopositivity were observed depending on the functional state of the mammary gland tissues. In late pregnancy, the FcRn immunolabelling was homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. In recently parturient animals, positive FcRn immunolabelling was mainly located at the luminal surface and apical cytoplasm of the mammary gland epithelium, while in dry and lactating animals, the FcRn immunolabelling was in the apical cytoplasm of the cells. The strongest FcRn immunolabelling was observed in late pregnancy and in recently parturient animals. In conclusion, the present data support the notion that FcRn might be involved in the transfer of maternal immunoglobulins and in the local defense mechanism of the mammary gland.",

Neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the pathology of the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex were investigated in experimental rats. Parvalbumin (PV), a calcium-binding protein, is a crucial component of GABAergic neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactive (GFAP-ir) astrocytes have been used as markers. We investigated the effects of ethanol exposure during adulthood on the PV-ir neurons and GFAP-ir astrocytes in the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex of 3-month-old male Wistar rats. The rats were divided into 2 groups: control (C) and alcohol-exposed groups. The control group received distilled water whereas the alcohol-exposed groups received either a low dose (20%\u00a0w/v, LD) or high dose (40%\u00a0w/v, HD) of ethanol for periods of 21 days, 3 or 6 months. The brains of the animals were processed for immunohistochemistry using anti-parvalbumin and anti-GFAP antibodies and the numbers of PV immunoreactive (PV-ir) neurons and GFAP-ir astrocytes were counted/unit area. For each period of administration, the number of PV-ir neurons was significantly reduced for groups exposed to both the low and the high doses of ethanol compared to those of control groups in both the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex (p<0.01). In addition, the number of PV-ir neurons was progressively reduced after prolonged ethanol exposure. In contrast, there was a significantly increased number of GFAP-ir astrocytes observed in the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex in all groups exposed to ethanol and this was a function of both the duration and the dose of ethanol exposure, indicating that PV-ir neurons are as sensitive as the GFAP-ir astrocytes to ethanol exposure. Our data indicate that alcohol exposure induced a reduction of PV-ir neurons and an increase of GFAP-ir astrocytes in the hippocampus and the cingulate cortex and this may be associated with the impairment of cognition, learning and memory after chronic alcohol administration.",

The measurements indicated a significant decrease of the nucleolar and cytoplasmic RNA concentration only in advanced stages of erythroblast differentiation (polychromatic and orthochromatic erythroblasts). The ratio of the nucleolar to cytoplasmic RNA concentration was otherwise very stable and did not change during differentiation, being similar in the early and advanced stages of erythroblastic development. In contrast, the nucleolar size significantly decreased even during the early stages of erythroid development (basophilic erythroblasts). This marked decrease in the nucleolar diameter in differentiating erythroblasts and the less marked decrease in the nucleolar RNA concentration suggest that the amount of RNA in the nucleolus is closely associated with nucleolar size rather than on its concentration within the nucleolar body.",

     "abstract": "Blood vessels develop via two subsequent processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, both being of crucial importance during menstrual cycle and implantation. These processes are also involved in the development of the fetal and placental vasculatures. During vasculogenesis, formation of the earliest primitive capillaries is achieved by in situ differentiation of hemangiogenic stem cells that are derived from pluripotent mesenchymal cells. The subsequent process, angiogenesis, is characterized by development of new vessels from already existing vessels, and is a well coordinated process initiated by stimulation of various growth factors. Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are important and complex processes involving extensive interplay between cells and growth factors. The development, maturation and maintenance of the vascular network are necessary for successful hemochorial placentation as well as normal embryonic development and growth. In this review, we outline the basic mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle and different stages of implantation, and consider how this data can be applied to human pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that during the initiation steps of implantation, angiogenic factors trigger vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Different inducers and stimulators affect angiogenesis and vasculogenesis by directly or indirectly stimulating proliferation, differentiation and migration of endothelial or respective precursor cells. As a conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of angiogenesis and the roles of angiogenic factors during the menstrual cycle and implantation may provide new insights and possible approaches for embryo implantation and healthy pregnancy.",

Univariate analysis demonstrated that tumor size (P=0.0095), depth of tumor invasion (P=0.0050), lymph node metastasis (P=0.0045) and distant metastasis (P<0.0001) were effective predictors of prognosis in patients. However, only distant metastasis could independently predict patients\u2019 outcomes by the analysis of multivariate proportional hazards regression (P=0.0043). Furthermore, the intratumoral microvessel density (MVD), evaluated by CD34 immunolabeling, indicated that MVD was positively correlated to the TF immunoreactivity (P=0.0056). It is concluded that TF immunopositivity in ESCC tissues is strongly correlated to the intratumoral angiogenesis and to poor patient prognosis.",

The optimization was conducted in terms of using GPC3 immunohistochemistry for biological study of GPC3 (Experiment 1) and as a diagnostic tool (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, GPC3 immunoreactivity (IR) and tissue architecture were compared among differently fixed and embedded specimens. In Experiment 2, using conventional formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) procedures, the effects of different fixation times and antigen retrieval treatments were assessed. In Experiment 1, the periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde (PLP)-fixed and AMeX method-embedded (PLP-AMeX) specimen showed superior immunoreactivity and excellent tissue architecture preservation. In contrast, the other specimens, especially frozen specimens, resulted in poor IR. In Experiment 2, specimens fixed for 24\u00a0h showed better IR than those fixed for 7 days and the most remarkable improvement in IR was achieved after protease treatment. These findings indicate that with GPC3 immunohistochemistry for biological studies, the PLP-AMeX specimen is preferable. For diagnostics using FFPE specimens, the fixation time should not be too long and protease should be used for the antigen retrieval treatment.",

Eight animals were included in each of the following five groups: untreated control, methylene blue control, sham-operated, bile-duct ligation, and bile-duct ligation plus methylene blue. Methylene blue was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days at a daily dose of 2\u00a0mg/kg per day. All rats were sacrificed 2 weeks following the experimental treatment and the livers of all groups were examined biochemically and histopathologically. The severity of cholestasis and hepatic injury were determined by changes in the plasma, including enzymatic activities: aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamine transferase, and also bilirubin levels. Malondialdehyde, nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase were measured to indicate the oxidative status in the liver tissue. Myeloperoxidase activity and levels of tissue hydroxyproline were determined as measures of neutrophil activation and collagen accumulation, respectively. Liver damage was significantly prevented in the bile-duct ligated rats treated with methylene blue compared with the control bile-duct ligated rats without methylene blue. Treatment with methylene blue markedly reduced activities of serum transaminase, gamma glutamine transferase and bilirubin levels as compared to bile-duct ligated rats without methylene blue. Positive immunolabelling for alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) was increased, especially in vascular smooth muscle cells, fibrotic septa and also around the proliferated bile ducts, after bile-duct ligation. Only weak \u03b1-SMA immunolabelling was seen in livers of rats treated with methylene blue. These results indicate that methylene blue can attenuate hepatic damage in extrahepatic cholestasis by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory processes.",

Parvalbumin (PV) is a calcium-binding protein present in cardiac myocytes and involved in mediating relaxation. Therefore, alteration of PV levels may affect relaxation in cardiac myocytes. This study investigated the effects of alcohol administration on the levels of PV in the rat heart. Male Wistar rats weighing 200\u2013250\u00a0g were divided into 2 groups: control (C) and alcohol-treated groups. The control group was provided with distilled water and the alcohol groups were provided with either a low dose (LD, 2\u00a0g/kg) or high dose of ethanol (HD, 5\u00a0g/kg) once daily for 21 days, 3 months or 6 months. The PV levels in the ventricles were investigated by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. In the 21-day ethanol-treated groups, parvalbumin immunoreactivity (PV-ir) and protein levels were not different when compared to the C, LD and HD groups. In the 3-month ethanol-treated groups, PV-ir and PV protein levels were decreased in both the LD and HD groups compared to that of the control group. In the 6-month ethanol-treated groups, PV-ir and PV protein levels decreased significantly in both the LD and HD groups (P<0.05). This indicates that short-term ethanol treatment may not affect PV levels, whereas, long-term ethanol treatment clearly reduced PV levels. The decrease of PV was predominantly due to the direct toxic effects of alcohol rather than malabsorption caused by pathological changes in the duodenum and liver. The toxic effects of alcohol leading to a reduction of PV levels may lead to diastolic impairment.",

Sections of 3\u20134\u00a0\u03bcm thick were cut and processed for immunohistochemistry. A mouse monoclonal anti-TIMP-1 antibody was used for the localization of TIMP-1 using an immunperoxidase technique. TIMP-1 immunoreactivity was observed in dentine of both sound and carious teeth. In both cases, the density of immunolabelled dentinal tubuli was typically higher toward the pulp chamber. In all the carious teeth, most, but never all, dilated dentinal tubuli were strongly positively immunolabelled. In sound teeth, a weak immunoreaction, only slightly above the background, was observed in dentinal tubuli. These results provide evidence for increased TIMP-1 immunolabelling in dentinal tubuli of carious teeth, in contrast to sound teeth. Overall, these in vivo findings indicate a possible role for TIMP-1 in the pathology of adult human dental tissues following an injury such as a caries lesion.",

Additionally, biotinylated glycoprobes can be immobilized on magnetic particles making it possible to separate a cell population according to its carbohydrate-binding profile. Here, we exemplify application of glycoprobes in the study of cellular siglecs and galectins, as well as lectin patterning of tumor cells. The specificity of sialic acid binding membrane-anchored lectins, siglecs-1, -5, -7, -8 and -9 was determined using this methodology. To study the carbohydrate-binding profile of soluble galactoside-binding lectins, galectins-1 or -3, these were loaded on (initially galectin free) Raji cells and probed using Glyc-PAA-fluo. Lessons learned from this model system allowed us to study the galectin distribution pattern of tumors: cells obtained from mice carrying mammary adenocarcinoma or lymphoma were probed with Glyc-PAA-fluo using flow cytometry.

At the same time we investigated the distribution of interneurons containing calretinin (CR), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in chronically treated animals in order to collect data on the involvement of inhibitory neurons in this process. Adult male rats were injected subcutaneously with 10\u00a0mg corticosterone, whereas controls received the vehicle (sesame oil). The animals were fixed by transcardial perfusion 12 and 24\u00a0h following single corticosterone injection, and the brains were processed for c-Fos and FosB immunohistochemistry. To investigate the effects of repeated corticosterone administration, rats were daily treated with the same amount of corticosterone (10\u00a0mg/animal, subcutaneously) for 21 days. Controls were injected with vehicle. At the end of the experiment, the rats were perfused and immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of the FosB protein, CR, VIP and NPY. Quantitative evaluation of immunolabelled cells was performed in the neocortex and the hippocampus. The number of immunoreactive nuclei per unit area was used as a quantitative measure of the effects of corticosterone. It was found that a single-dose administration of corticosterone resulted in a significant, time-dependent increase of c-Fos protein immunoreactivity in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, as well as in regions CA1 and CA3 of the hippocampus 12 and 24\u00a0h post-injection with respect to control animals. Significant enhancement of c-Fos immunoreactivity was also observed in the neocortex at 12 and 24\u00a0h post-injection. Single-dose treatment did not significantly alter FosB immunolabelling. Repeated administration of corticosterone produced a complex pattern of changes in FosB immunolabelling: significant increase in FosB immunoreactivity was detected in the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, with no significant changes in the CA1 and CA3 layers of the hippocampus and in the neocortex. However, a significant decrease of FosB induction in the neocortex was observed in chronically treated rats in comparison to single-dose injected animals (12\u00a0h before immunohistochemistry). Analysis of immunohistochemical detection of interneuronal markers revealed a significant reduction of the CR immunolabelling in the CA3 area of the hippocampus. No changes in VIP or NPY immunoreactivity were found in the Ammon's horn 3 weeks following daily corticosterone treatment. NPY immunoreactivity was significantly attenuated in the neocortex.The present data suggest that single-dose corticosterone treatment increases immunoreactivity of c-Fos protein in a time-dependent manner, 12 and 24\u00a0h post-injection in the rat hippocampus and the neocortex, whereas chronic corticosterone treatment influences FosB immunoreactivity, primarily in the dentate gyrus. Chronic corticosterone administration seems to affect CR levels in the CA3 area of the hippocampus.",

We have shown that the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 produces a sufficient amount of osteoprotegerin to bind TRAIL, resulting in an upregulation of receptor activator factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) expression. In conclusion, the presence of osteoprotegerin, as secreted by this cell line, acting as a paracrine factor, could affect breast cancer RANKL production inducing an enhancement of osteolysis and the perpetuation of a vicious cycle. A better understanding of the complex tumor cell\u2013host cell interactions in the bone microenvironment, and of the autocrine and paracrine effects of the secreted (from tumor cells) and released (from bone matrix) factors may facilitate development of effective strategies to inhibit disease progression.",

Statistical analyses showed no significant differences between the average brain weight of the control group and the experimental group. The assessment of brainstem nuclei showed patchychromatic appearance of neurons of the trapezoid nuclei in the experimental group as against the normal vesicular appearance of neurons of the trapezoid nuclei in the control group. The density of damaged trapezoid nuclei was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. The rats in the control group displayed normal balance and coordination, while rats in the experimental group showed abnormalities in balance and coordination.

     "abstract": "Metastasis, the process by which cancer cells leave the primary tumour, disseminate and form secondary tumours at anatomically distant sites, is a serious clinical problem as it is disseminated disease, which is often impossible to eradicate successfully, that causes the death of most cancer patients. Metastasis results from a complex molecular cascade comprising many steps, all of which are interconnected through a series of adhesive interactions and invasive processes as well as responses to chemotactic stimuli. In spite of its clinical significance, it remains incompletely understood. This review provides an overview of some of the molecular interactions that are critical to metastasis. It summarises the principle molecular players in the major steps of the metastatic cascade. These are: (1) tumour angiogenesis, (2) disaggregation of tumour cells from the primary tumour mass, mediated by cadherins and catenins, (3) invasion of, and migration through, the basement membrane (BM) and extracellular matrix (ECM) surrounding the tumour epithelium, and subsequent invasion of the BM of the endothelium of local blood vessels. This is mediated through integrins and proteases, including urokinase form of plasminogen activator (uPA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cathepsins, (4) intravasation of the tumour cells into the blood vessels prior to hematogeneous dissemination to distant sites, (5) adhesion of the circulating tumour cells to the endothelial cell lining at the capillary bed of the target organ site. This occurs through adhesive interactions between cancer cells and endothelial cells involving selectins, integrins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), (6) invasion of the tumour cells through the endothelial cell layer and surrounding BM (extravasation) and target organ tissue and (7) the development of secondary tumour foci at the target organ site.",

     "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract of vertebrate species contains melatonin, which participates in several physiological functions. Some of these effects are mediated via specific membrane receptors (MT1 and MT2). In the present study, the distribution of the MT2 receptor protein in the gastrointestinal tract was localized, and changes in MT2 receptor density were observed in relation to the expected circadian changes in melatonin concentrations. Immunohistochemistry was performed in the rat stomach, duodenum, colon and pancreas. The amount of MT2 was determined by Western blot. Melatonin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). In the stomach, duodenum and colon, the most intense immunoreactivity was observed in the Muscularis mucosae and in the Muscularis externa. In the pancreas, the immunolabelling was less intense. There was a clear daily rhythm of melatonin concentrations in the stomach, duodenum and pancreas, with higher levels during the dark period. The density of MT2 receptors did not exhibit circadian variation. Moreover, circadian changes in melatonin concentrations were not found in the colon. The density of MT2 was the highest in the colon. Our results provide evidence for the heterogeneous distribution of MT2 receptors in different parts and layers of the gastrointestinal tract, which could indicate a physiological role of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract.",

     "abstract": "Regulation of the uterine luminal environment is important for successful attachment and implantation of the blastocyst. The contents and volume of luminal fluid are regulated in part by the tight junctions. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, protein and RNA analysis, the cellular distributions of tight junction components claudins and occludin were observed during early pregnancy and under various hormonal regimens. Results indicate that occludin and claudin-4 distribution changed during early pregnancy and in response to ovarian hormones. At the time of implantation and in response to progesterone administration to ovariectomised rats, occludin and claudin-4 showed increased immunolabelling in luminal epithelium. Interestingly, occludin protein detection in uterine luminal epithelial cells at the time of implantation was statistically significantly decreased at the time of implantation compared to day 1 of pregnancy. This suggests that a cytoplasmic pool of occludin is present at day 1 of pregnancy and is redistributed to the tight junctions at the time of implantation. The presence of occludin and claudin-4 in the tight junctions at the time of implantation and in response to progesterone suggests that the paracellular pathway is impermeable to water and Na+ at this time, and that the transport of such substances takes place via the transcellular pathway.",

Various levels of birefringence intensity were determined principally by image analysis procedures, and periodicity in the birefringent images was revealed by FFT line profile and spectrum image patterns. Present results support the idea of a helical distribution for collagen bundles along the tendon long axis, and of a statistical architecture for the rat calcaneal tendons in terms of variability in the oriented distribution of their collagen fibers.",

CHO AA8 cells were treated with different Taxol concentrations (0.25\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h. The effects of Taxol exposure were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry (TUNEL and annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide assays). 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM Taxol caused the appearance of few multinucleated giant cells exhibiting extensive arrays of fine filaments. Slight increases in the level of polyploidy, phosphatidylserine externalization and in the percentage of TUNEL positive cells were noticed. Concentrations of 0.5 and 1\u00a0\u03bcM resulted in the appearance of a large number of giant cells, which exhibited, depending on the cell, an extensive microtubular network or loose or tightly packed bundles of microtubules. Cells of reduced volume and showing chromatin condensation were also seen. Cell cycle analysis revealed that almost half of the cell population was polyploid. Except in cells exposed to 1\u00a0\u03bcM Taxol, annexin V-FITC/PI labelling did not reveal the loss of plasma membrane integrity or increase in phosphatidylserine externalization; however, TUNEL assay revealed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with DNA fragmentation. These data indicate that CHO AA8 cells treated with Taxol undergo cell death of a type which considerably differs from apoptosis.",

The influence of aging and exercise on the distribution of PV in rat heart was investigated. Male Wistar rats aged 3, 6, 12 and 18-months were divided into sedentary and exercise groups. The exercise group underwent exercise in the form of regular swimming for 6 months. The hearts were processed for immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. The intensity of PV immunoreactivity was strong in the 9 and 12-month hearts and decreased in the 18-month hearts. The smallest amount was detected in the 24-month rat hearts when compared to those of the 9, 12 and 18-month rat hearts. Significantly less PV was detected in the 18 and 24-month hearts compared to the 12-month rat hearts (P<0.05). The intensity of PV immunoreactivity was considerably stronger in hearts of the 9, 12 and 18-months exercised rats than in hearts of age-matched sedentary rats. However, in the hearts of 24-month rats, immunoreactivity was only slightly stronger in the exercised rats in comparison with those of sedentary rats. A significant increase of PV detection in hearts was found in the exercised rats in comparison with sedentary rats in the 9 (P<0.05) and 18-month samples (P<0.01). Our data indicate that PV is down-regulated in the rat heart during aging. In addition, our data indicate that long-term swimming exercise could induce an increase of PV expression.",

Western blot analysis of PLD in the cerebrum showed that PLD1, a major PLD isoform in the brain, was detected weakly in the cerebrum at day 17 embryonic stage and its levels gradually increased until postnatal day 35 and remained unaltered thereafter. In the hindbrain, comprising the cerebellum and pons, the peak level of PLD1 was detected at 21 days postnatally and declined progressively thereafter. The level of PLD2 in both the cerebrum and hindbrain was minimal compared to that of PLD1. Based on immunohistochemistry, PLD was detected in some neurons and glial cells in the cerebrum. In the hindbrain, PLD was found in some Purkinje cells and some cells of the molecular layer, as well as glial cells, consistent with the results obtained from Western blot analysis. These findings suggest that PLD may differentially play a role in the course of early development of the brain, with special reference to the cerebrum and hindbrain, in rats.",

In all, 29 patients (20 NANP and 9 ANP) and 20 healthy subjects were included in this study. Plasma MMP-9 levels were measured using ELISA. Plasma MMP-9 levels were higher (p<0.05) in ANP patients than in NANP patients and controls. In the group with ANP, plasma MMP-9 levels showed a positive correlation (p<0.05) with eosinophil counts. Plasma MMP-9 levels of NANP patients and control groups were similar (p>0.05). Moreover, that the highest levels of MMP-9 were in ANP patients may indicate the usefulness of this parameter in differentiating between the different etiologic origins of nasal polyp.

In this study we describe a procedure for separating viable taste bud cells from the fungiform papillae in mice. After sacrifice with CO2, the mouse tongue was excised and immediately incubated in collagenase II and dispase II. The epithelium with fungiform papillae was then peeled away from underlying tissue and the anterior one-third region was incubated in a solution of 0.25% trypsin and 0.02\u00a0M ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 8\u201312\u00a0min. Following incubation, a cell suspension was obtained by mechanical dissociation. Cells in suspension were identified as taste bud cells by their morphology and by immunofluorescence. A 0.25% trypan blue staining demonstrated that nearly 90% of these cells remained viable. Micrographs from scanning electron microscopy illustrated that taste buds were dissociated from the fungiform papillae, while maintaining the integrity of the other part of the dissociated lingual epithelium during incubation. Such a method allows acquisition of viable taste cells and will aid further research in the study of gustatory characteristics.",
