     "abstract": "Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus contaminating food, feed ingredients and products of animal origin. In mammals, this toxin causes widespread organ-specific damage; it is immunotoxicity and could promote hepatotoxicity, alter intestinal functions and so on. In this study, we conducted transcriptome and histomorphology analyses of hepatopancreas and intestinal in Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) challenged with AFB1. Totally 12,014 and 1387 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified in the hepatopancreas and intestine, respectively. In hepatopancreas, a total of 1995 DEGs were mainly annotated and grouped into 18 processes or pathways related to animal immune system. With respect to intestine, a total of 152 DEGs were mainly annotated to 7 processes or pathways related to animal immune system. Meanwhile, we determined the relative mRNA expression of several crucial representative immune genes including Toll, immune deficiency (IMD), prophenoloxidase (proPO), Rab and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the hepatopancreas and intestines of shrimp at 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-d after challenged by AFB1. Exposure to AFB1 increased mortality, decrease weight gain rate, severely destroyed the histomorphology of hepatopancreas and intestine, and resulted in the damaged of immune system of shrimp. The present data reveals the different roles between hepatopancreas and intestine of L. vannamei in immune response to AFB1 challenge, and provides insight into the molecular basis of the relationship between hepatopancreas and intestinal immunity during either homeostasis or inflammation.",

The aim of this study is the physicochemical and kinetic characterization of brain and muscle ChE from Danio rerio (Zebrafish). Optimal activity was found for brain ChE at alkaline pH\u202f9.0 at 30\u202f\u00b0C, and for muscle ChE at alkaline pH\u202f8.5 at temperatures between 20\u202f\u00b0C and 35\u202f\u00b0C. The apparent kinetic constants, Kmapp and Vmaxapp, for brain ChE were determined as 0.191\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.024\u202fmM and 0.566\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.028\u202fU/mg protein, and for muscle ChE as 0.230\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.030\u202fmM and 0.677\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.039\u202fU/mg protein.

     "abstract": "Bivalve molluscs possess effective cellular and humoral defence mechanisms against bacterial infection. Although the immune responses of mussels to challenge with pathogenic vibrios have been largely investigated, the effects at the site of injection at the tissue level have not been so far evaluated. To this aim, mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis were herein in vivo challenged with Vibrio splendidus to assess the responses induced in hemolymph and posterior adductor muscle (PAM), being the site of bacterial infection. The number of living intra-hemocyte bacteria increased after the first hour post-injection (p.i.), suggesting the occurrence of an intense phagocytosis, while clearance was observed within 24\u202fh p.i. A recruitment of hemocytes at the injection site was found in mussel PAM, together with marked morphological changes in the volume of muscular fibers, with a recovery of muscle tissue organization after 48\u202fh p.i. A concomitant impairment in the osmoregulatory processes were observed in PAM by an initial inhibition of aquaporins and increased immunopositivity of Na+/K+ ATPase ionic pump, strictly related to the histological alterations and hemocyte infiltration detected in PAM. Accordingly, an intense cell turnover activity was also recorded following the infection event. Overall, results indicated the hemolymph as the system responsible for the physiological adaptations in mussels to stressful factors, such as pathogenicity, for the maintenance of homeostasis and immune defence. Also, the osmotic balance and cell turnover can be used as objective diagnostic criteria to evaluate the physiological state of mussels following bacterial infection, which may be relevant in aquaculture and biomonitoring studies.",

     "abstract": "Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by varieties of fungi that contaminate food and feed resources and are capable of inducing a wide range of toxicity. This problem is extensively aggravated due to the increasing replacement of fish meal by plant-derived proteins. Among the mycotoxins, aflatoxins have received a great deal of attention owing to their great prevalence in plant feedstuffs and to the detrimental effects on animals. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether dietary supplementation with tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) oil (TTO) would avoid or minimize the negative impacts on silver catfish (Rhamdia quelen) fed with aflatoxins-contaminated diets. Four treatments were tested: control (fish fed with a control diet); AFB (fish fed with a mycotoxin-contaminated diet \u2013 1893\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121 of AFB1 and 52.2\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121 AFB2); TTO (fish fed with a control diet + 1\u202fmL\u202fkg\u22121 of TTO), and TTO\u202f+\u202fAFB (fish fed with a mycotoxin contaminated diet - 2324\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121 of AFB1 and 43.5\u202f\u03bcg\u202fkg\u22121 AFB2\u202f+\u202f1\u202fmL\u202fkg\u22121 of TTO). Diets were tested in three replications and analyzed at days 5 and 10 of dietary intake. Significantly reduced antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GPx, and GST) and increased lipid peroxidation (LOOH) and protein carbonyl (PC) content in plasma and liver, with 16.6% mortality occurrence, were observed in the group fed aflatoxin-contaminated diet. Furthermore, aflatoxins also significantly increased plasmatic and hepatic ROS levels and decreased hepatic antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radical (ACAP) levels. Plasma cortisol levels were not altered by aflatoxicosis, but the intoxication induced hepatose. Notwithstanding, addition of TTO to the groups receiving aflatoxins showed a protective effect, avoiding the increase of ROS, LOOH, and PC levels in plasma and liver. Moreover, TTO treatment ameliorated the aflatoxin-associated liver damage. Thus, TTO supplementation at concentration of 1\u202fmL\u202fkg\u22121 in feed may be used in fish to increase antioxidant status and reduce the negative effects caused by aflatoxins toxicity.",

     "abstract": "During the past decade, the total population and overall reproductive performance of the oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) in the Anzali international wetland and its basin rivers has been severely reduced. This seems to be caused by an increase in heavy metal pollution from industrial wastewaters. We investigated the effects of chronic levels of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) on reproductive success, hemato-immunology, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (cHH), Pb/Cd bioaccumulation and histopathology of hepatopancreas of oriental river prawn. The present study was separately carried out using four chronic treatments for Pb (0 (control), 0.024, 0.072 and 0.12\u202f\u03bcM/l) and Cd (0 (control), 0.026, 0.053 and 0.08\u202f\u03bcM/l) in experimental tanks during 60\u202fdays. The broodstock were fed by commercial shrimp diet, ad libitum, twice a day. The results revealed that reproductive activities ceased when Pb levels were 0.072 and 0.12\u202f\u03bcM/l and also when Cd levels reached 0.08\u202f\u03bcM/l. At 0.024\u202f\u03bcM/l Pb, 0.026 and 0.053\u202f\u03bcM/l Cd, the prawns showed initial reproductive activity but after spawning, the egg-clutches were found detached from the pleopods of the brood females. Hemato-immunology results showed that by increasing the Pb and Cd concentrations, large granular hemocyte (LGH) and cHH values also increased. However, small granular hemocyte (SGH) count was inversely affected. A significant increase in mortality (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) was observed as both Pb and Cd concentrations increased. Histological observations are indicative of increased necrosis, lumen size, melanization, vacuolation and abnormal lumen shape, as the heavy metals concentrations increased. In conclusion, obtained results can help to elucidate effects of Pb and Cd on freshwater decapod crustaceans reproductive performance and related physiological parameters.",

     "publication date": "07-2019",
     "abstract": "The aim of this research study was to understand the mechanism of action of Salvia officinalis (Lamiaceae) essential oil (EO) on Aedes aegypti larvae. We evaluated the effect on DNA damage, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition and mitochondrial enzymatic alterations. The major components were analyzed in silico using OSIRIS and Molispiration free software. Aedes aegypti DNA was extracted from mosquito larvae between third (L3) and fourth (L4) instars to determine the DNA fragmentation or degradation at S. officinalis EO lethal concentrations (LC10, LC20, LC50, and LC90). DNA integrity was assessed in both LCs in larvae treated for 24\u202fh and in larvae homogenized with EO; we also assessed purified DNA larvae by a densitometric analysis. The AChE inhibition was quantified in protein larvae L3-L4 following Ellman's method and the enzymatic activities related to the mitochondrial respiratory chain of mitochondrial proteins was estimated by spectrophotometry. In silico analysis of 1,8-cineol and of \u03b1-thujone, major EO components, showed that they were highly permeable in biological membranes without mutagenic risks. Alterations in the integrity of DNA were observed in larvae exposed and homogenized with S. officinalis EO. The EO induced an AChE inhibition of 37\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.6% to IC50. On the other hand, mitochondrial bioenergetics suggest that EO inhibits electrons entry to the respiratory chain, via Complex II. AChE activity alteration causes mortality of individuals, by blocking the insect cholinergic functions. These results indicate that EO affects the integrity of DNA, the mitochondrial respiration chain and the AChE activity.",

     "abstract": "The freshwater red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans) is found not only in freshwater but also in coastal saline habitats. Hyperosmotic salinity can induce cell damage. p53, regarded as the guardian of the genome, is very important and versatile in response to the change of environment. In this study, the role of p53 in T. s. elegans under environmental salinity change will be explored. The results indicated that amino acid sequence of p53 showed high similarity to p53 of other species. In addition, the expression of p53 showed differences in various tissues under normal condition. Under salinity stress, the mRNA levels of p53 in the liver increased significantly at 48\u202fh with 15\u2030 group (15 practical salinity units-exposed group). In the heart, p53 mRNA levels increased at 6\u202fh in 5\u2030 (5 practical salinity units) and 15\u2030 groups. Furthermore, the changes of p21 mRNA expression levels in liver and heart were similar to p53, while cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase4 (CDK4) and cyclin-dependent kinase6 (CDK6) showed opposite changes to p53. Moreover, Bax and caspase 3 mRNA expression levels were similar to p53, respectively, while Bcl-2 showed opposite changes. The positive cells of apoptosis were found in the liver of 15\u2030 at 48\u202fh and 30\u202fd of chronic stress. Taken together, these results indicated that the T. s. elegans may protect itself by regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis of damaged cells under salinity stress, which played an important role for T. s. elegans in salinity adaptation.",

     "abstract": "The potential role of microplastic particles (MPs) as vectors for lipophilic organic pollutants enhancing their uptake by organisms has repeatedly been discussed in the scientific community. Likewise, several studies indicate an important role of surfactants in pollutant-transfer from MP to organisms. Employing polyethylene particles, the bioavailability of three MP-bound inducers of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) with variable lipophilicity was quantitatively compared via EROD activity in RTL-W1 cells. In addition, non-cytotoxic surfactant concentrations of Pluronic F-127, rhamnolipids, sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) supplemented to the medium were tested for their effects on pollutant desorption from MPs as well as on cellular EROD induction. Bioavailability of MP-bound pollutants was negatively correlated with lipophilicity, and all surfactants were found to modulate the cellular response towards inducers by unidentified mechanisms. After experimental correction for effects on the cellular response, all surfactants except SDS moderately increased desorption of inducer from MPs. Results on the impact of lipophilicity agree with previously published thermodynamic models, indicating that appreciable pollutant desorption from MPs may only occur for substances with comparatively low lipophilicity, the accumulation of which on MPs is negligible in the environment. However, the role of surfactants should be considered further with respect to potential effects on sorption of pollutants to and from MPs.",

     "abstract": "As erythrocytes are continuously exposed to plenty of metabolites and toxicants, the aim of the present work is to show whether erythrocytes from different sources may exhibit different susceptibility to hemolysis induced by two classes of xenobiotics, Cnidaria venoms, acting via pore forming mechanism on cell membrane, and Cd2+, inducing cell damage mainly via lipid peroxidation. To this end, the hemolytic power of crude venom from stinging cells of the anthozoan Aiptasia mutabilis and from the scyphozoan Pelagia noctiluca has been tested, along with Cd2+ (5 to 20\u202fmM), on erythrocytes (0.05% v/v) obtained from either rabbit, or dog, or chicken, or human source. Our results show a more significant susceptibility of rabbit erythrocytes to hemolysis induced by both crude venom and Cd2+ than erythrocytes from other sources. This difference seems to rely neither on the different specimens used to extract crude venom, nor on the different mechanism of toxicants. In this light, the present study may contribute: i) to confirm hemolytic test as a suitable biological assay to verify erythrocytes resistance to toxicants; ii) to show variability in hemolytic response to xenobiotics; iii) to propose rabbit erythrocytes as more sensitive to the lytic action of xenobiotics, adding more knowledge to the field of toxicology.",

Higher ammonia-N tolerance in the shrimp (Tolerance group) was achieved through nutritional fortification, whereas shrimp that were not nutritionally fortified comprised the Control group. The mortality rates in the Control and Tolerance groups at the end of the period of ammonia-N stress exposure were 64.44% and 40.00%, respectively. Within 1\u202fh of exposure to ammonia-N stress, the glucose concentration in both groups declined rapidly, and no significant difference was detected between the two groups. In general, the triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations in the Control group were higher than those in the Tolerance group, and accumulations and/or fluctuations in these metabolites to varying degrees were observed. The Tolerance group presented higher phosphofructokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity compared with the Control group from 1 to 48\u202fh of exposure to ammonia-N stress, whereas the opposite result was observed from 96 to 192\u202fh. Similarly, during exposure to ammonia-N stress, the Tolerance group showed higher and lower lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity than the Control group from 1 to 24\u202fh and from 48 to 92\u202fh, respectively. In addition, compared with the Control group, the shrimp in the Tolerance group exhibited higher succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, especially from 48 to 192\u202fh of exposure to ammonia-N stress. The results of this study suggest that anaerobic carbohydrate (in the early stage) and aerobic metabolism (in the late stage) plays an important role in the shrimp's response to ammonia-N stress. In addition, maintenance of the normal operation of lipid metabolism is equally important for improving the tolerance of L. vannamei to ammonia-N stress.",

     "abstract": "Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, approximately 7 million liters of the dispersant Corexit 9500A were released to promote oil biodegradation by breaking up surface oil slick formation. This process is accomplished via amphipathic anionic surfactants within dispersants that facilitate the mixing of aqueous and lipid phases. However, the amphipathicity of Corexit may also cause it to interact with biological membranes like the gill, impairing gill function and ultimately disrupting physiological processes mediated by it, such as osmoregulation. The goal of this study was to investigate the osmoregulatory effects and toxicity of Corexit in Gulf killifish. Killifish at the embryonic, larval, juvenile, and adult life stages were exposed to Corexit in water of different salinities to assess the interactive effects of ontogeny and salinity on Corexit toxicity. Corexit was not toxic to embryos except when exposed in hyperosmotic water where it had negligible effects; however, its toxicity to killifish increased dramatically following hatch, showing its greatest deleterious effects in adults. Corexit tended to increase sodium and chloride burdens in killifish when exposed in hyperosmotic waters and reduced whole-body and plasma ion concentrations in fish exposed to hypoosmotic waters. However, Corexit exposure at hyperosmotic salinities resulted in an increased differential accumulation of sodium over chloride as killifish matured. These findings suggest that Corexit may impair gill structure or alter specific components of osmoregulatory function, thus impacting osmoregulation in hypersosmotic and hypoosmotic waters, potentially impairing survival during osmotic challenges. Furthermore, the magnitude of these impacts continues to increase concomitant with gill ontogeny.",

In contrast, the mechanism of oxibendazole's anti-proliferative effect via cell signaling pathways and its role in pre-implantation has not been studied. Therefore, in this study we demonstrated the effects of oxibendazole on the proliferation of porcine trophectoderm (pTr) cells and porcine luminal epithelial (pLE) cells, a well-known in vitro model system of the fetal-maternal interface. Cell proliferation decreased in both pTr and pLE cells in response to oxibendazole, and we determined that this was modulated through intracellular cell signal transduction. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2, P90RSK, and S6 were downregulated by exposure to a 200\u202fnM dose of oxibendazole in both types of cells, while the expression of phosphorylated JNK, AKT, and P70S6K was upregulated. Pre-treatment with a PI3K/AKT inhibitor (Wortmannin), ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), and JNK inhibitor (SP600125) induced the signaling interactions of these molecules, and oxibendazole co-treatment with each inhibitor resulted in even greater decreases in cell proliferation. Furthermore, intracellular and mitochondrial calcium ion accumulation was observed, which would mean that calcium ion homeostasis was disrupted, causing damage to the mitochondrial membrane potential. These deteriorated conditions ultimately led to apoptotic cell death. Taken together, the results of the present study identified that the apoptotic effect of oxibendazole on pTr and pLE cells is regulated by cell signaling pathways, and thus oxibendazole could influence the connection between the conceptus and the maternal uterus.",

Microbiological analysis of the methanolic extracts of the roots (MESR), stem bark (MESB) and leaves (MESL) of S. terebinthifolius showed no microbial growth. The concentrations of phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and flavonoids were determined by spectrophotometry. The phenolic compounds of the MESL were identified by liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector and mass spectrometer (LC-DAD-MS). The antioxidant activities of the extracts were analyzed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl radical (DPPH), 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical (ABTS+), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), reducing power, \u03b2-carotene bleaching and malondialdehyde (MDA) assays in human erythrocytes. The antidiabetic properties of the extracts were demonstrated in vitro by their inhibition of the \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme and their anti-glycation activity via fructose and glyoxal. After showing no acute toxicity in vivo, MESL was able to lower postprandial glycemia after glucose overload in normoglycemic mice as well as the water and feed intake, liver weight, glycemia and serum levels of glycated hemoglobin, aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) in diabetic mice. Overall, S. terebinthifolius extracts showed microbiological safety along with antioxidant and antidiabetic activities, likely mediated by its chemical constituents, such as gallic acid, gallotannins and glycosylated flavonols.",

The results evidenced that dimethoate induces oxidative stress and alters biochemical parameters in freshwater snails. Cadmium also induced significant changes in biochemical parameters. The combination of the dimethoate and cadmium markedly increased the effects on G. truncatula. Dimethoate and cadmium mixture caused a decrease in Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activities, glycogen, and total antioxidant capacity (TAN) levels, and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase (CAT) activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in exposed snails. The increased toxicity and bioaccumulation of cadmium after the exposure to the highest concentration of dimethoate indicates a synergistic effect leading to a reduced performance of the detoxification system in the snail. Dimethoate contributed to the bioconcentration of cadmium in snails and increased its toxic effects evidenced in biomarkers of oxidative stress and cell damage.",

As the oil dispersed it contaminated ecosystems that support numerous Gulf species including mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus). The timing of the spill, and location of the surface slick, coincided with the spawning of many species in the region, raising concerns over embryonic and larval exposure. Numerous abnormalities due to crude oil exposure have been documented in fish early life stages, including cardiotoxicity; however, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that cause these phenotypes is still limited. Several transcriptomic studies have presented cholesterol biosynthesis as one of the top enriched pathways following PAH exposure. In this study we exposed mahi-mahi embryos to DWH oil collected from the surface slick. At exposures ranging from \u2211PAH 1.69\u202f\u03bcg/L to \u2211PAH 5.99\u202f\u03bcg/L, the resulting larvae demonstrated significant increases in farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (fdft1) and an upward trend in 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase (hmgcr) expression, genes that encode key enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. In addition to the increased expression of genes in cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, a significant decrease in total cholesterol was observed in larval homogenates, at \u2211PAH 8.3\u202f\u03bcg/L. These data confirm earlier transcriptomic studies and show that oil may diminish cholesterol and adversely impact numerous cellular functions due to altered membrane stability.",

Importantly, aquatic environments are also the sites of numerous other environmental disturbances that can impact the endemic fauna. While there have been a number of attempts to explore the potential additive and synergistic effects of oil exposure and environmental stressors, many of these efforts have focused on the cumulative effects on typical toxicological endpoints (e.g. survival, growth, reproduction and cellular damage). Fewer studies have investigated the impact that oil exposure may have on the ability of exposed animals to tolerate typically encountered environmental stressors, despite the fact that this is an important consideration when placing oil spills in an ecological context. Here we review the available data and highlight potentially understudied areas relating to how oil exposure may impair organismal responses to common environmental stressors in fishes. We focused on four common environmental stressors in aquatic environments \u2013 hypoxia, temperature, salinity and acid-base disturbances \u2013 while also considering social stress and impacts on the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis.

After the exposure period, mussels were analyzed for air-time survival, total and labile Zn levels in tissues, lipid metabolism (phospholipase A2, triglycerides levels) and oxidative stress (glutathione S-transferase, arachidonate cyclooxygenase, lipid peroxidation). The data revealed that mussels exposed to ZnSO4 in controlled aquarium water accumulated more total and labile Zn tissues, decreased oxidative stress and triglycerides and increased air time survival. While nZnO had few effects in aquarium water, oxidative stress was enhanced and total Zn in tissues were decreased in brown water and diluted municipal effluent and triglycerides were higher in nZn-exposed mussels in brown water. Air-time survival was decreased in mussels kept in green water and nZnO. It was also decreased in mussels exposed to ZnSO4 in green water and diluted municipal effluent.

The efficacy of putative antidotes to the three toxicants can routinely be assessed by observing shortened periods of paralysis with larvae given toxicant and antidote compared to larvae administered only the same dose of toxicant. The validity of the approach is demonstrated with agents previously shown to be antidotal towards cyanide intoxication in mice; namely, sodium nitrite and CoN4[11.3.1] (cobalt(II/III) 2,12-dimethyl-3,7,11,17-tetraazabicyclo-[11.3.1]-heptadeca-1(7)2,11,13,15-pentaenyl cation). These same compounds are shown to be antidotal towards all three toxicants in the G. mellonella caterpillars; findings that may prove important in relation to azide and sulfide poisonings, for which there are currently no effective antidotes available. The observation that sodium nitrite ameliorates cyanide toxicity in the larvae is additionally interesting because it unambiguously demonstrates that the antidotal action of nitrites does not require the involvement of methemoglobin, contributing to the resolution of an ongoing controversy.",

     "abstract": "In a previous study, we reported that Curcuma longa strain Ryudai gold (RD) showed antifungal activity against Fusarium solani sensu lato (FSSL) among the different species and varieties of turmeric. The present study focused on isolation, identification and structural elucidation of antifungal compounds in RD. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction was eluted with n-hexane and EtOAc with gradually increasing the concentration of EtOAc (n-hexane:EtOAc; 100:0; 80:20; 60:40, 40:60, 20:80 and 0:100). The antifungal compounds were isolated from the most effective fraction by using silica gel, TOYOPEARL\u00ae HW-40F column, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Structural identification of the antifungal compounds was conducted using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The MeOH extract of the rhizome of RD inhibited the growth of FSSL in a concentration-dependent manner. The EtOAc fraction of the MeOH extract of RD demonstrated the highest antifungal activity against FSSL. The purified antifungal compounds were turmeronol B (1), turmeronol A (2), (E)-\u03b1-atlantone (3), dihydrobisdemethoxycurcumin (4), demethoxycurcumin (5) and curcumin (6). These six compounds showed concentration-dependent antifungal activity against FSSL. The concentration required for 50% growth inhibition (IC50) of the four isolates of FSSL ranged from 116 to172, 127 to 185, 88 to 109, 90 to 112, 74 to 80 and 63 to 68\u202f\u03bcM/L for turmeronol B, turmeronol A, (E)-\u03b1-atlantone, dihydrobisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin and curcumin, respectively. These results suggested that RD contained potential antifungal compounds that could be useful to control FSSL. The isolated compounds of RD can be a good source of natural antifungal agents or the lead compounds for the development of new synthetic drugs.",

Nevertheless, the toxic effects of CNTs in natural aquatic systems are related to their ability to interact with abiotic compounds. Considering that salinity variations are one of the main challenges in the environment and thus may influence the behavior and toxicity of CNTs, a laboratory experiment was performed exposing the tube-building polychaete Diopatra neapolitana (Delle Chiaje 1841) for 28\u202fdays to pristine multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs) and carboxylated MWCNTs, maintained at control salinity 28 and low salinity 21. An innovative approach based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was adopted for the first time to assess the presence of MWCNTs aggregates in the organisms. Both CNTs generated toxic impacts in terms of regenerative capacity, energy reserves and metabolic capacity as well as oxidative and neuro status, however greater toxic impacts were observed in polychaetes exposed to carboxylated MWCNTs. Moreover, both CNTs maintained under control salinity (28) generated higher toxic impacts in the polychaetes compared to individuals maintained under low salinity (21), indicating that exposed polychaetes tend to be more sensitive to the alteration induced by salinity variations on the chemical behavior of both MWCNTs in comparison to salt stress.",

However, it has been neglected in what concerns to fish farming, disregarding the potential impact of endogenous/ exogenous factors. As marine macroalgae constitute a source of natural compounds with a large spectrum of biological activities, this study, situated in the interface of nutritional-genetic research and development of algae practical applications, aimed to evaluate the genoprotective properties of a macroalgae-enriched diet (total percentage of 5%, incorporating equal percentages of Ulva rigida, Gracilaria gracilis and Fucus vesiculosus) in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata). Protection was assessed in relation to a basal genome integrity and against an exogenous genotoxic challenge (cyclophosphamide; CP). Fish were reared for 30\u202fdays with the supplemented diet, being then injected with CP and sampled at days 3 and 10 post-injection (p.i.). To evaluate whether the favorable effects remain after the end of supplementation, a fish subgroup previously fed with algae-enriched diet was submitted to a diet reversion at day 3 p.i., being thereafter fed with the standard diet. Genetic damage was evaluated through the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) and comet assays and complemented by the assessment of the antioxidant system. Results pointed out that algae-enriched feed exhibits anti-genotoxic properties, mostly expressed in relation to the exogenous pressure, manifest in relation to DNA strand breaks and chromosomal lesions, also reducing oxidative DNA damage. Nonetheless, blood antioxidants were only punctually altered by the supplemented diet (e.g. catalase and glutathione-S-transferase). Analyzing the effect persistence, it was perceived that 7\u202fdays without algae uptake was enough to partially reduce the protection efficacy. Overall, these findings are promising towards the benefits of macroalgae inclusion in fish diet, and thus, to invigorate mariculture activity and the commercial use of algae, also providing new insights on the DNA protection mechanisms.",

Considering the importance of genomic integrity, it is critical to improve the knowledge on ozone-related genotoxic hazard to organisms reared in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) applying ozonation. Therefore, genetic damage induced by ozone exposure in the Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) was assessed, combining the comet and the erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities (ENA) assays, reflecting different damage levels, i.e. DNA and chromosomal damage, respectively. Fish were subjected to a daily 6-h ozone (0.15\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121) exposure, repeated for 3 consecutive days, simulating a short-term event of overozonation. To assess the temporal impact of the previous event, the progression of damage was evaluated 7\u202fdays later, following transference to ozone-free water or to 0.07\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 ozone, a routinely adopted level in RAS. Both endpoints pointed to the ozone genotoxic potential, displaying DNA oxidation as a possible mechanism of damage. Overall, the present findings pointed out the genotoxic hazard of ozone to fish, highlighting the importance of these types of studies and contributing to improve aquaculture practices, namely in RAS systems. These early genotoxic signals may be a prelude to negative repercussions on fish health, which may affect the aquaculture productivity. The present findings recommend precautions in relation to accidental or intentional overozonation in fish-farming, even when short-term events are considered. The strategies to mitigate the impact of ozonation in S. senegalensis may include a dietary extra supplementation of antioxidants (regularly, or punctually in cases of overozonation).",

     "abstract": "Acute exposure to crude oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can severely impair cardiorespiratory function and swim performance of larval, juvenile and adult fish. Interestingly, recent work has documented an oil induced decoupling of swim performance (Ucrit) and maximum metabolic rate (MMR) whereby oil causes a decline in Ucrit without a parallel reduction in MMR. We hypothesize that this uncoupling is due to impaired mitochondrial function in swimming muscles that results in increased proton leak, and thus less ATP generated per unit oxygen. Using high resolution mitochondrial respirometry, we assessed 11 metrics of mitochondrial performance in red and cardiac muscle from permeabilized fibers isolated from red drum following control or 24\u202fh crude oil (high energy water accommodated fractions) exposure. Two experimental series were performed, a Deepwater Horizon relevant low dose (29.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.4\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 \u2211PAH50) and a proof-of-concept high dose (64.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.9\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 \u2211PAH50). No effects were observed on any mitochondrial parameter in either tissue at the low oil dose; however, high dose exposure provided evidence of impairment in the OXPHOS respiratory control ratio and OXPHOS spare capacity in red muscle following oil exposure, as well as a shift from Complex I to Complex II during OXPHOS respiration. No effects of the high dose oil treatment were observed in cardiac muscle. As such, mitochondrial dysfunction is unlikely to be the underlying mechanism for decoupling of Ucrit and MMR following acute oil exposure in red drum. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction does not appear to be a relevant toxicological impairment in juvenile red drum with respect to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, although impairments may be observed under higher dose exposure scenarios.",

Due to its peculiar redox properties, nCeO2 may present unique hazards to environmental and human health. Previous data showed that in the hemocytes of the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, in vitro exposure to a particular type of nCeO2 (9\u202fnm, characterized by negative \u03b6-potential, high H2O2 scavenging capacity and Ce3+/Ce4+ surface ratio) reduced basal ROS production, lysosomal membrane stability and phagocytic activity in the presence of hemolymph serum; the effects observed were partly ascribed to the formation of a SOD-protein corona in the hemolymph.In this work, the in vivo effects of this type of nCeO2 were investigated in mussels exposed to 100\u202f\u03bcg/L nCeO2 for 96\u202fh; several lysosomal, immune, inflammatory and antioxidant biomarkers were measured at cellular (hemocytes) and tissue (gills, digestive gland) level. Molecular responses were evaluated in hemocytes and digestive gland by determining expression of 11 selected genes related to known biological functions. The results show specific immunomodulatory and antioxidant effects of nCeO2 at different levels of biological organization in the absence of Cerium tissue accumulation. These data further support the redox mechanisms at the basis of the physiological effects of nCeO2. Finally, in order to evaluate the possible impact at the whole organism level, the effects of nCeO2 were evaluated in the 48\u202fh embryotoxicity assay in a wide concentration range. However, nCeO2 exposure resulted in a small reduction in normal embryo development. Overall, the results demonstrate that in mussels nCeO2 can selectively modulate different physiological processes at different levels of biological organization.",

No significant differences were found among As LC50 values calculated for different salinity levels and same exposure times, concluding that low salinity did not affect shrimp sensitivity to As. Likewise, no significant differences were observed in As bioconcentration in shrimp exposed to the same waterborne As and distinct salinity, supporting the results of acute toxicity. Bioconcentration factors of As maintained a relatively stable tendency where all values (0.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2 to 1.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4) were statistically comparable to 1, indicating that As was accumulated in a similar proportion to waterborne As concentration at three salinity levels.

The effect on growth, colour, fatty acid (FA) profile, and liver and muscle antioxidant response in mullets (Mugil liza) were evaluated. A full substitution was not possible due to a final body weight reduction (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). The colorimetric analyses showed an improvement in fillet colouration (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Also, we found a saturation of carotenoids in muscle at 30% substitution. The content of highly unsaturated fatty acids - HUFA (DHA, EPA and ARA) in muscle diminished as the substitution level increased and, at the same time, the level of these FAs in the diet diminished. We found interesting evidence of elongation from 18:3n-3 to 20:3n-3 when substitution with linseed oil levels was above 50% but no desaturation to 20:4 or 20:5n-3 was found, which could insinuate a certain n-3 HUFA requirement under the experimental conditions. Moreover, we noted an increase in the antioxidant capacity up to the treatment SS70; the SS100 treatment showed a diminution in the antioxidant capacity. It is concluded that a partial inclusion of Spirulina and linseed oil (50%) is possible, and that this replacement can increase antioxidant responses, improve its growth performance and can modulate the mullets fillet quality without affecting negatively fillet fatty acid content.",

It is responsible for billions of dollars in losses every year, affecting meat and milk production, beef and dairy cattle, and the leather industry. The lack of knowledge and strategies to combat the tick only increases the losses, it leads to successive and uncontrolled applications of acaricides, favouring the selection of strains resistant to commercially available chemical treatments. In this paper, we tested 3\u2011bromopyruvate (3\u2011BrPA), an alkylating agent with a high affinity for cysteine residues, on the R. microplus metabolism. We found that 3-BrPA was able to induce cell death in an assay using BME26 strain cell cultures derived from embryos, it was also able to reduce cellular respiration in developing embryos. 3-BrPA is a nonspecific inhibitor, affecting enzymes of different metabolic pathways in R. microplus. In our experiments, we demonstrated that 3-BrPA was able to affect the glycolytic enzyme hexokinase, reducing its activity by approximately 50%; and it strongly inhibited triose phosphate isomerase, which is an enzyme involved in both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Also, the mitochondrial respiratory chain was affected, NADH cytochrome c reductase (complex I\u2013III) and succinate cytochrome c reductase (complex II\u2013III) were strongly inhibited by 3-BrPA. Glutamate dehydrogenase was also affected by 3-BrPA, showing a gradual inhibition of activity in all the 3-BrPA concentrations tested. Altogether, these results show that 3-BrPA is a harmful compound to the tick organism.",

     "abstract": "Analyzing effects of metal mixtures is important to obtain a realistic understanding of the impact of mixed stress in natural ecosystems. The impact of a one-week exposure to a sublethal metal mixture containing copper (4.8\u202f\u03bcg/L), cadmium (2.9\u202f\u03bcg/L) and zinc (206.8\u202f\u03bcg/L) was evaluated in the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). To explore whether this exposure induced oxidative stress or whether defense mechanisms were sufficiently fitting to prevent oxidative stress, indicators of apoptosis (expression of caspase 9 [CASP] gene) and of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA] level and xanthine oxidase [XO] activity) were measured in liver and gills, as well as activities and gene expression of enzymes involved in antioxidant defense (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], glutathione peroxidase [GPx], glutathione reductase [GR] and glutathione-S-transferase [GST]). The total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) was also quantified. No proof of oxidative stress was found in either tissue but there was indication of apoptosis in the liver. CAT, GPx, GR and GST total activities were reduced after 7\u202fdays, suggesting a potential decrease of glutathione levels and risk of increased free radicals if the exposure would have lasted longer. There were no major changes in the total activities of antioxidant enzymes in the gills, but the relative expression of the genes coding for CAT and GR were triggered, suggesting a response at the transcription level. These results indicate that C. carpio is well equipped to handle these levels of metal pollution, at least during short term exposure.",

     "abstract": "Previously we showed that arginine-vasotocin (AVT)-stimulated osmotic water permeability (OWP) of the frog urinary bladder was decreased if the mucosal side of the bladder has been naturally colonized by Gram-negative bacteria, or if bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was introduced into the lumen of the isolated bladder (J. Exp. Zool., 2013, 319, 487\u2013494). Taking into account that in different tissues and cell types, challenge with LPS causes significant metabolic shift and energy deficiency, we hypothesized that an LPS-induced decrease of AVT-stimulated OWP could depend on the reduction of fatty acid oxidation (FAO), which is important for generation of ATP in epithelia. Using an isolated frog Rana temporaria urinary bladder we showed that the AVT-induced increase of OWP did not depend on the external glucose, but was inhibited by oligomycin, an ATP-synthase inhibitor, and by etomoxir, an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. In primary cultured epithelial cells isolated from the bladder mucosa, LPS E. coli (25\u202f\u03bcg/ml, 21\u202fh), as well as etomoxir (100\u202f\u03bcM), decreased FAO accompanied by triacylglycerol accumulation. Both drugs impaired mitochondrial functions demonstrated by decreased ATP production and a reduced maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and OCR directed at ATP synthesis. Additionally, we found that LPS decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, a key player in the regulation of FAO. These data indicate that the impairment of AVT-induced water transport in osmoregulatory epithelium caused by LPS depends at least partly on defects in FAO and FAO-dependent energy production.",

Improving bioavailability would facilitate lower dietary inclusion levels to achieve the same therapeutic dose and therefore reduce the bitterness of feeds containing PZQ. Bioavailability was determined by co-administering feed with either pure PZQ, HCO-SLN or HCO-SLN coated with chitosan via intubation and quantifying the pharmacokinetics response. In contrast to studies with mammals, the results demonstrated that PZQ in HCO-SLN had equal bioavailability to pure PZQ in yellowtail kingfish, including when HCO-SLN were coated with chitosan. We hypothesise that the lack of improvement in bioavailability may be due to the lack of M cells and Peyer's patches in fish and the subsequent inability of fish to take nanoparticles directly into the lymphatic system. Furthermore, palatability of the feeds medicated with PZQ was not improved when the PZQ was incorporated into HCO-SLN, possibly due to the low loading rate of PZQ within the HCO-SLN and the subsequent thick coating of nanoparticles that was required on the surface of the feed pellets. Combined, these data demonstrate that the SLN used in the current study are not capable of delivering the benefits required to enable effective in-feed treatment of PZQ against monogenean parasites in yellowtail kingfish.",

Successful fish production and maintenance of disease free culturing systems in aquaculture with environment friendly practices is often affected by various environmental factors. Disease causing pathogens is one of the major factors. These can be controlled by the emerging technologies such as biopolymer based drug delivery systems, feed encapsulations processes and immersions of active ingredients which can possibly facilitate sustainable production by enhancing growth and immune responses in aquaculture animals. The focus of our study is on the identification of antibacterial and antioxidant compounds from two brown seaweeds, Gracilaria foliifera and Sargassum longifolium which have proven bioactive compounds. By a process of microencapsulation these bioactive compounds were encapsulated in the form of beads. Sodium caseinate and xanthan gum were mixed together to form the beads. This process helps to retain and protect the bio active ingredients from adverse reactions such as oxidation and nutritional deterioration. These microencapsulated beads were administered orally to 10 Oreochromis mossambicus the experimental fishes, with average body weight of 10\u201312\u202fg and challenged against the pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas salmonicida to assess their antibacterial efficacy to control this bacterial pathogen. Microencapsulated bio active compounds were further characterized by FT-Raman, GC\u2013MS, NMR, HPLC and SEM analysis. In this study, the effects of combined formulations of the different bioactive compounds were determined.

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial function is critical to support aerobic metabolism through the production of ATP, and deficiencies in mitochondrial bioenergetics will directly impact the performance capacity of highly aerobic tissues such as the myocardium. Cardiac function in fish has been shown to be negatively affected by crude oil exposure, however, the mechanism for this adverse response is largely unexplored. We hypothesized that lipophilic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in crude oil disrupt the electron transport system (ETS) ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, mitochondrial respiration and ADP affinity we measured using high resolution respirometery in permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers of young adult Mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) after an acute (24\u202fh) whole animal crude oil exposure. Oil exposure reduced both complex I-fueled ADP stimulated respiration (OXPHOSCI) and complex I,II-fueled ADP stimulated respiration (OXPHOSCI, CII) by 33%,while complex II-fueled ADP stimulated respiration (OXPHOSCII) was reduced by 25%. These changes were found without changes in enzyme activity or mitochondrial density between control and oil exposed Mahi. Additionally, mitochondrial affinity for ADP was decreased three-fold after acute exposure to crude oil. We purpose that acute crude oil exposure selectively impairs mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport system and ATP supply to the cell. This limited ATP supply could present several challenges to a predatory animal like the mahi; including a reliance on anaerobic metabolism and ultimately cell or tissue death as metabolic substrates are rapidly depleted. However, the impact of this impairment may only be evident under periods of increased aerobic metabolic demand.",

For accurate prediction of xenobiotic-induced toxic effects on avian species, it is necessary to understand metabolic capacities in a comprehensive range of bird species. However, there is a lack of information about avian xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XMEs), particularly in wild birds. Uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) is an XME that plays an important role in phase II metabolism in the livers of mammals and birds. This study was performed to determine the characteristics of UGT1E isoform in avian species, those are related to mammals UGT 1A. To understand the characteristics of avian UGT1E isoforms, in vitro metabolic activity and genetic characteristics were investigated. Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of all chicken UGT1E isoforms were measured. On in vitro enzymatic analysis, the white-tailed eagle, great horned owl, and Humboldt penguin showed lower UGT-dependent activity than domestic birds. In synteny analysis, carnivorous birds were shown to have fewer UGT1E isoforms than herbivorous and omnivorous birds, which may explain why they have lower in vitro UGT activity. These observations suggested that raptors and seabirds, in which UGT activity is low, may be at high risk if exposed to elevated levels of xenobiotics in the environment. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that avian UGT1Es have evolved independently from mammalian UGT1As. We identified the important UGT isoforms, such as UGT1E13, and suspected their substrate specificities in avian xenobiotic metabolism by phylogenetic and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. This is the first report regarding the genetic characteristics and interspecies differences of UGT1Es in avian species.",

Larvae of blow flies (Phaenicia sericata) commonly used as therapy for debriding dead tissue, are exposed to high levels of bacterial endotoxins, but their mechanisms of LPS resistance are not entirely understood. Comparative effects of LPS on heart rate (HR) were examined for both Drosophila and blowfly larvae. Acute 10-min direct exposure of in situ heart tubes with saline containing 1, 100, and 500\u202f\u03bcg/ml LPS from two common bacterial stains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) revealed a dose-dependent effect.

S. marcescens increased HR initially in Drosophila followed by a reduction for low and high doses, but no change was observed in larvae of blow flies. Whereas P. aeruginosa at a high dose decreased HR in larvae of Drosophila but increased HR in larvae of blow flies. The goal of this study is to better the understanding in the direct action of LPS on HR. Knowing the acute and direct actions of LPS exposure on HR in different species of larvae may aid in understanding the underlying mechanisms in other animals during septicemia.",

     "abstract": "Environmental impairment resulted from urbanizations can produce damage on freshwater species including strong physiological effects at individual or population level. The multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) is a defence mechanism which has been demonstrated in several aquatic organisms. The key mediators of MXR activity are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins like P-glycoprotein (P-gp). This system protects aquatic organisms against the accumulation of xenobiotics by extruding them from cells in an energy-dependent manner. MXR has been pointed out as relevant in the ecotoxicological context and has been proposed as a biomarker for pollution assessment. Since fish species are common target in freshwater biomonitoring programs, the purpose of the study was to evaluate the MXR mechanism in native Hatcheria macraei (Patagonian catfish) and exotics Salmo trutta (brown trout), Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout) and Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Chinook salmon) freshwater fishes widespread in Argentine Patagonia. We characterized the MXR mechanism using a combination of functional assays and Western blot analysis. Our results in different tissues such as liver, gills, muscle and epidermis indicate that the fishes studied have different species-specific levels of MXR activity, being gills and liver the tissues with greater detoxifying activity. Induction of MXR transport activity was also identified in liver tissue from rainbow trout from urban stream suggesting their suitability in the biomonitoring of aquatic environments subjected to urban contaminants.",

The current study aimed to disclose the mechanisms of aluminum toxicity in D. melanogaster at larval and adult stages and examined the potential protective effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG). Flies were reared on food containing 10\u202fmM AlCl3, 10\u202fmM AKG or both additives. Rearing on an AlCl3-containing diet induced behavioral defects, and decreased fecundity and long-term survival of female flies. The addition of dietary AKG did not ameliorate locomotor and taste behavior defects or the higher sensitivity to oxidative stress, but improved heat stress resistance, egg-laying capability and survival of females treated with AlCl3. Metabolic effects of AlCl3 exposure on flies included an imbalance of metal content, decreased glucose levels, increased free iron and storage triacylglyceride (TAG) levels, mitochondria dysfunction, and the development of oxidative stress. Dietary AKG did not prevent AlCl3 effects on glucose and TAG, but improved metal homeostasis, inhibited the increase in free Fe and restored the functional activity of iron-containing enzymes such as aconitase. In addition, AKG decreased the intensity of oxidative stress seen in AlCl3-reared adult flies, probably due to inhibition of iron mobilization. The results show that AKG is not a full antidote against Al toxicity but is able to relieve multiple metabolic effects of high aluminum. Furthermore, the modulating ability of AKG can clearly be helpful in exploring the molecular mechanisms of Al toxicity.",

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a vital role in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. Herein, H2O2-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) injury model was used to explore the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of ROS-induced oxidative stress and cell dysfunction. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a naturally occurring four-carbon non-protein amino acid, has antioxidant activity and anti-inflammatory action. In the present study, we demonstrated that GABA could scavenge free radicals including DPPH and ABTS, reverse H2O2-induced suppression on HUVEC proliferation, HUVEC apoptosis and ROS formation via p65 signaling. Interestingly, GABA treatment alone did not cause significant changes in p65 phosphorylation, suggesting that GABA will not cause imbalance in NF-\u03baB signaling and ROS formation without oxidative stress. Moreover, GABA also modulated Keap1-Nrf2 and Notch signaling pathways upon H2O2 stimulation, suggesting that GABA may exert its effect via multi mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that GABA inhibits H2O2-induced oxidative stress in HUVECs via inhibiting ROS-induced NF-\u03baB and Caspase 3 pathway activation. GABA may, therefore, have potential as a pharmacological agent in the prevention or treatment of oxidative injury-related cardiovascular disease.",

Man-A, a molecule with numerous electrophilic sites, forms a covalent adduct with most selenocystine (Sec)-containing TrxR enzymes. The evidence also demonstrates that Man-A can form covalent adducts with some non-Sec-containing enzymes. The activities of TrxR enzymes towards various substrates are moderated by Man-A either positively or negatively depending on the enzyme. In general, the reduction of substrates by Sec-containing TrxR is inhibited and NADPH oxidase activity is activated. For non-Sec-containing TrxR the effect of Man-A on the reduction of substrates is variable, but NADPH oxidase activity can be activated even in the absence of covalent modification of TrxR. The effect of PbTx is less pronounced. A smaller subset of enzymes is affected by PbTx. With a single exception, the activities of most of this subset are activated. Although both PbTx variants can react with selenocysteine, a stable covalent adduct is not formed with any of the TrxR enzymes. The key findings from this work are (i) the identification of an alternate mechanism of toxicity for the algal toxin brevetoxin (ii) the demonstration that covalent modification of TrxR is not a prerequisite for the activation of NADPH oxidase activity of TrxR and (iii) the identification of an inhibitor which can discriminate between cytosolic and mitochondrial TrxR.",

There was a significant increase in mortality over time and at 100\u202f\u03bcM, only 50% of the animals survived 96\u202fh compared to >95% for all other experimental groups. There was evidence for increased hatching time with 10\u202f\u03bcM tebuconazole compared to the control group (~7\u202fh longer at 50% total hatch) or a lack of hatch observed with 100\u202f\u03bcM. Oxidative respiration and behavior were evaluated to assess whether the fungicide impaired energy-associated processes. Oxygen consumption rates in embryos (exposed from ~6\u202fhpf) were determined with exposure to 2.5, 25, 50, 100\u202f\u03bcM tebuconazole for 24\u202fh using the XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Embryos treated with 100\u202f\u03bcM showed a ~60% reduction in basal respiration, indicating impaired oxygen consumption and/or changes in resource allocation (e.g. anti-oxidant production, metabolite synthesis). Environmentally-relevant concentrations of tebuconazole did not affect oxidative phosphorylation. As behavior is a sensitive endpoint for toxicity, we measured the dark photokinesis response and conducted a light-dark preference test in 6\u202fdpf larvae following a sub-chronic exposure to 0.1, 1 and 10\u202f\u03bcM tebuconazole beginning with 6\u202fhpf embryos. It was observed in two independent experiments for dark photokinesis that 10\u202f\u03bcM tebuconazole reduced total distance moved (i.e. hypoactivity) in the dark period by ~25\u201335%. In the light-dark preference test, there was an increase for mean time in dark zone (~100% increase in the average time/visits per second) and frequency in dark zone (increase of ~35% in average number of visits) with tebuconazole, suggestive of anxiolytic behavior at environmentally-relevant doses. This study demonstrates that exposure to tebuconazole can affect survival, hatch time, oxidative phosphorylation, and behavioral activity of early-staged zebrafish. While survival, hatch time, and mitochondrial bioenergetics were not different than control fish at environmentally-relevant levels of tebuconazole, behavioral responses were detected at concentrations reported in some aquatic environments.",

     "abstract": "Antioxidant enzymes play essential roles against oxidative stress caused by 2,2\u2032,4,4\u2032-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), which is ubiquitous in marine environment and organisms. However, research on antioxidant responses to BDE-47 in marine bivalves is scarce. In this study, we identified the full-length cDNA of catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the clam Mactra veneriformis. Subsequently, the responses of CAT, GPx, and copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) were investigated in the clams exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10\u202f\u03bcg/L BDE-47 for 7\u202fdays, and then depurated in natural seawater for 3\u202fdays. MvCAT and MvGPx contained conserved sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences shared high similarity with CATs and GPxs in other mollusks. M. veneriformis accumulated BDE-47 in a dose-dependent manner and eliminated BDE-47 poorly. BDE-47 induced a time- and dose-dependent increase of malondialdehyde content. Both the dose and the duration had significant effect on mRNA expressions and activities of the three antioxidants. Cu, Zn-SOD responded to BDE-47 earlier than CAT and GPx. The antioxidant responses could recover after depuration. These results suggested that M. veneriformis could accumulate BDE-47 efficiently. Antioxidant enzymes were triggered to counter the oxidative stress generated by BDE-47. Cu, Zn-SOD acted as the first defense against oxidative stress, while CAT and GPx intervened later. This study is therefore helpful in understanding the antioxidant responses to PBDEs in marine bivalves.",

     "abstract": "Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH), as one emerging brominated flame retardants, is ubiquitous in the environment, including water and aquatic organisms. TBECH was found to exhibit endocrine-disrupting effects in different models, whereas a survey of comprehensive toxic effects of TBECH on zebrafish is limited. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were waterborne exposed continuously to TBECH from embryonic stage (3\u202fh post-fertilization (hpf)) to the time when the respective parameters were evaluated. Exposure to TBECH reduced hatchability of zebrafish embryos at 72 and 96\u202fhpf, diminished heart rate of zebrafish larvae at 48\u202fhpf, and increased malformation in zebrafish larvae at 96\u202fhpf. In addition, exposure to TBECH diminished free swimming distance both in the light and under a photoperiod of 10\u202fmin light/10\u202fmin dark cycles in zebrafish larvae at 6\u202fdays post-fertilization (dpf). Moreover, exposure to TBECH elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, whereas it reduced glutathione (GSH) content, in zebrafish larvae at 6\u202fdpf. Accordingly, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that TBECH exposure increased the mRNA levels of sod1, sod2, cat, and gpx1 in zebrafish larvae at 6\u202fdpf. With respect to the immune aspect, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes, including il-1b, il-6, il-8, and tnfa, in larval zebrafish at 6\u202fdpf were increased by exposure to TBECH, while pretreatment with TBECH inhibited 24\u202fh of exposure to LPS-stimulated elevation in the mRNA levels of the abovementioned four pro-inflammatory genes in zebrafish larvae at 6\u202fdpf. Furthermore, TBECH treatment increased caspase-3 enzyme activities and regulated apoptosis-related genes in larval zebrafish at 6\u202fdpf. Taken together, the data obtained in this study demonstrated that TBECH caused developmental and locomotor behavioral toxicity, immunotoxicity, oxidative stress and proapoptotic effects in early life zebrafish.

The acute exposure inhibited only carboxylesterase activity in both tissues while the subchronic exposure also inhibited cholinesterase activity, decreased the number of hatched-eggs and increased offspring lethality (92%). On the other hand, B-esterases in gonads were more effective biomarkers than B-esterases in the whole organism due their inhibition appeared earlier in time (cholinesterase activity) and their activity remained inhibited for a longer time (carboxylesterase activity) when recovery studies were performed. We concluded that B-esterases and reproductive parameters can be used as effect biomarkers of aquatic contamination with azinphos-methyl. Our studies showed that a 14\u202fdays exposure to an environmental concentration of azinphos-methyl produced severe signs of toxicity in adult organisms, egg masses and juveniles that could cause negative effects at the population level in contaminated environments.",

     "abstract": "Many reef fishes are capable of feeding on chemically-defended benthic prey, such as soft (alcyonarian) corals; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underpin allelochemical biotransformation and detoxification. Butterflyfishes (Chaetodon: Chaetdontidae) are a useful group for comparatively exploring links between biotransformation enzymes and diet, because they commonly feed on chemically defended prey. Moreover, diets of some species vary among geographic locations. This study compares gene expression, protein and enzymatic activity of key detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2, 3, epoxide hydrolase, glutathione transferase and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) in livers of four coral-feeding butterflyfish species between Australia and Hawaii, where these fishes differ in diet composition. For C. kleinii, C. auriga, and C. unimaculatus, we found higher CYP2 and CYP3 levels were linked to more allelochemically rich diets in Australia relative to Hawaii. For C. lunulatus from Hawaii CYP2 and CYP3 levels were 1 to 20-fold higher than C. lunulatus from Australia, possibly due to their predominant prey in Hawaii (Porities spp.) being richer in allelochemicals. UGT, GST and epoxide hydrolase varied between species and location and did not correspond to any specific dietary preference or location. Higher levels of CYP2 and CYP3A isozymes in species that feed on allelochemically-rich prey suggest that these biotransformation enzymes may be involved in detoxification of coral dietary allelochemicals in butterflyfishes.",

In red seabream exposed to 50\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 NP, plasma levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) were significantly lower at 30 and 60\u202fdays, while E2 levels were slightly higher in 10\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121-exposed individuals at day 30.

After exposure to NP, plasma and mRNA levels of vitellogenin (VTG) were significantly higher in both species at 30 and 60\u202fdays, similar to the inducible effects from synthetic estrogen. Plasma cortisol levels were significantly elevated by relatively higher concentrations of NP (10 and 50\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121) at 30 and 60\u202fdays. Finally, 60\u202fdays of exposure of 50\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 NP significantly decreased the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and increased the hepatosomatic index (HSI) in both species.

In this study, adult male zebrafish were exposed to CPF at concentrations of 30, 100 and 300\u202f\u03bcg/L for 21\u202fdays. It was observed that CPF not only induced oxidative stress but also caused gut microbiota dysbiosis in the gut.

For the gut microbiota, at the phylum level, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria showed a significant change after CPF exposure. At the genus level, approximately 25 types of bacteria in the gut changed significantly. In addition, based on a gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, we found that 98 metabolites significantly influenced the zebrafish liver, and these changed metabolites were tightly related to several pathways, including glucose and lipid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, the transcriptional levels of some genes related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism decreased significantly in the livers of CPF-treated zebrafish. These results indicated that CPF exposure could induce hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in adult zebrafish. Taken together, our results suggest that CPF exposure causes hepatic lipid metabolism disorders that are associated with gut oxidative stress and microbiota dysbiosis in adult zebrafish.",

     "abstract": "The kidneys are recognized as a major target of cadmium-induced toxicity. However, all mechanisms that are involved in the early stages of cadmium nephrotoxicity, particularly considering low micromolar concentrations of cadmium ions (Cd2+) are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of peritubular acute exposure to micromolar Cd2+ concentration (2.3\u202f\u03bcmol/L) on the rapid depolarization and the rate of slow repolarization of peritubular membrane potential difference (PD), induced by luminal application of L-alanine in proximal tubular cells of frog kidney.

In conclusion, these results suggest that peritubular acute exposure to low micromolar Cd2+ concentration decreased the rapid depolarization and the rate of slow repolarization of peritubular membrane PD induced by luminal application of L-alanine.

The effects of cadmium on early life stages of fish are not well understood, although they are often disproportionately affected by contaminants. The objectives of this study were to examine effects of chronic exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations on growth, development, cellular stress, and glucose metabolism of channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus. Eggs were wet-fertilized in treatment water at concentrations of 0.4 (control), 2.2 (low), or 8.5 (high) \u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 and monitored through swim-up, black fry stage. Eggs and fry accumulated cadmium dose-dependently. Fertilization rates were unaffected, yet hatch rate was significantly reduced in the high treatment. Survival to black fry and overall size and condition factor were not affected; however, differences in yolk sac size, and presumably energetics of yolk fry, was detected. Physiological pathways were also affected, demonstrated by altered gene expression, most notably in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism. Elevated expression of HK and G6PD, rather than G6P and GADPH, suggests glucose may be shunted towards the pentose-phosphate pathway. Overall, observations indicate cadmium negatively affects development in early life stages of channel catfish, which could lead to shifts in population structure and life history patterns in exposed populations of wild fish.",

     "abstract": "Biological organisms evolved to take advantage of recurring environmental factors which enabled them to assimilate and process metabolic energy for survival. Mitochondria display non-linear oscillations in NADH levels (i.e. wave behavior) that result from the balance between NADH production (aerobic glycolysis) and oxidation for ATP synthesis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of cadmium (Cd) on mitochondrial NADH oscillations in quagga mussels Dreissena bugensis exposed to 50 and 100\u202f\u03bcg/L CdCl2 for 7\u202fdays at 15\u202f\u00b0C. Metallothionein (MT) levels, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) activity and NADH oxidation rate were also determined, as were oscillations in NADH and the formation of dissipative structures (turbidity), in isolated mitochondria suspensions. The results show that exposure to Cd readily induced MT levels at both concentrations tested and that TrxR and NADH oxidase activity was induced at 100\u202f\u03bcg/L Cd only. In control mussels, NADH levels oscillated in mitochondria suspensions with a natural period of 2 to 2.5\u202fmin for up to 40\u202fmin. Exposure to Cd increased the complexity of the frequency profile of NADH oscillations and reduced the amplitudes of the natural signal with a period of 2 to 2.5\u202fmin. The formation of dissipative structures decreased in response to a Cd concentration of 100\u202f\u03bcg/L but increased at a level of 50\u202f\u03bcg/L. The amplitudes at the natural frequency were significantly correlated with NADH oxidase activity (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.91) and with the formation of dissipative structures (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.59). We conclude that Cd could alter the natural frequency in oscillations of NADH in mitochondria, thereby contributing to an increase in NADH oxidation rate and disruption of the spatial organization of mitochondria in suspension. In conclusion, changes in the wave behavior of NADH in mitochondria are proposed as a novel biomarker of toxicity in aquatic organisms.",

This study evaluates biochemical responses in the gills and hepatopancreas of M. rapax in situ from localities exhibiting different types and levels of contamination, against a backdrop of fluctuations in environmental parameters like salinity and temperature common to estuarine regions. The biochemical biomarkers metallothionein (MT)-like protein titers and glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were used to evaluate responses to environmental contamination and seasonal changes in environmental parameters. Crabs were collected during two seasons, the austral winter and summer, at three sites along the coast of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil that present decreasing degrees of environmental contamination: Ilha Diana, Santos (ID)\u202f>\u202fRio Itapanha\u00fa, Bertioga (RI)\u202f>\u202fPicinguaba, Ubatuba (P), a pristine control site. Our findings show that MT were induced in crabs from the contaminated sites (ID and RI) mainly during winter, revealing the activation of detoxification mechanisms; however MT were also induced in P crabs during the summer rainy season. GPX, GST and AChE activities were altered in P crabs during summer and in ID and RI crabs in winter. While enzyme activities in summer crabs may reflect seasonal changes in precipitation and salinity, in winter these altered activities appear to reflect contamination, although an effect of environmental parameters cannot be excluded. These findings reveal a strong seasonal influence on biochemical biomarker responses in Minuca rapax, a relevant factor to consider when interpreting the impact of environmental contamination in estuaries.",

Protein carbonyls increased in liver at 37\u202f\u00b0C compared with control, however, lipid damage (malonaldehyde, MDA) in both serum and liver was unrelated to Ta. After the effects of different Tas on thyroid hormone levels and oxidative damage markers were determined, we further investigate whether thyroid hormones mediated metabolic rate and oxidative damage. Another set of gerbils received 0.0036% L-thyroxin (hyperthyroid), 0.04% Methylimazol (hypothyroid) or water (control). Hypothyroid group showed a 34% reduction in resting metabolic rate (RMR) also 42% and 26% increases in MDA and liver protein carbonyl respectively, whereas hyperthyroid group had higher RMR, liver mass and superoxide dismutase (SOD) compared to control. Serum T3 or T3/T4 levels were correlated positively with RMR, liver mass, and SOD, but negatively with MDA and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). We concluded that high Ta induced hypothyroidism, decreased RMR and increased oxidative damage, whereas low Ta induced hyperthyroidism, increased RMR and unchanged oxidative damage. These data supported our hypothesis that thyroid hormones can be a cue to mediate metabolic rate and different aspects of oxidative and antioxidant activities at different Tas.",

     "abstract": "Megalopygids Megalopyge lanata and Podalia orsilochus are common causative agents of accidents in agricultural workers. These accidents are provoked by dermal contact at their larval stage and are characterized by cutaneous reactions, such as burning pain, edema and erythema, typically mild and self-limited. There is very little information about their venoms and their toxicological implications on human health. Thus, we employed proteomic techniques and biological assays to characterize venoms (bristle extracts) from caterpillars of both species collected from Misiones, Argentina. The electrophoretic profiles of both venoms were substantially different, and they presented proteins related to toxicity, such as serinepeptidases, serpins and lectins. P. orsilochus venom exhibited higher caseinolytic activity than M. lanata venom, agreeing with the fact that only P. orsilochus venom hydrolyzed human fibrin(ogen). In addition, the latter shortened the clotting time triggered by calcium. While the venom of M. lanata induced a mild inflammatory lesion in mouse skin, P. orsilochus venom caused prominent necrosis, inflammatory infiltration and hemorrhage at the site of venom injection. On the other hand, P. orsilochus venom was better recognized by Lonomia obliqua antivenom, although many of its proteins could not be cross-reacted, what may explain the difference in the clinical manifestations between accidents by Podalia and those by Lonomia. Altogether, this study provides relevant information about the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby both caterpillars can induce toxicity on human beings, and paves the way for novel discovery of naturally occurring bioactive compounds.",

The six diets comprised two sources of plant proteins with three levels each, including 300\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 soybean meal (SM30), 300\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 EnzoMeal (EZM30), 400\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 soybean meal (SM40), 400\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 EnzoMeal (EZM40), 500\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 soybean meal (SM50), and 500\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 EnzoMeal (EZM50). The soybean level was shown to significantly affect the final fish weight, weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), survival, feed intake, feed conversion ratio (FCR), and apparent digestibility coefficient (ADC). Further, the plant meal type significantly affected the final weight, weight gain, feed intake, ADC, and body lipid content. The highest final weight was observed in the SM30 group, and the lowest final weight was in the EZM50 group. Fish fed EZM had lower body weight than those fed soybean meal at the same inclusion level. However, once the fish had adapted to the EZM diet the fish weight variation was low. At the 300\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 and 400\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 inclusion levels the fish fed EZM showed significantly higher ADC than those fed soybean. The pepsin activity of fish fed EZM at 300\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 and 400\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 was higher than those fed soybean meal at the same levels. The enterocyte height in the hindgut of fish fed SM40 and SM50 was significantly higher than those fed EZM40 and EZM50, respectively. This study indicates that EZM could be a potential source of plant protein to replace fishmeal in fish feed as it contains high protein and low anti-nutritional factors. However, the major endpoint measurements on fish performance suggest that low feed intake constrains further EZM inclusion beyond 300\u202fg\u202fkg\u22121 in the diet.",

Fish populations might be especially susceptible to FLX due to the presence of conserved cellular receptors of serotonin. Neurotoxic effects on fish biota of polluted water bodies may be expected, but there are no sufficient studies in the current literature to elucidate this hypothesis. Batteries of embryo larval assays with zebrafish were performed to evaluate the potential effects of FLX exposure, including environmentally relevant concentrations. Evaluated parameters included survival, development, behaviour and neuronal biochemical markers. Regarding acute toxicity, a 168\u202fh-LC50 value of 1.18\u202fmg/L was obtained. Moreover, hatching delay and loss of equilibrium were observed, but at a concentration level much higher than FLX measured environmental concentrations (>100\u202f\u03bcg/L). On the other hand, effects on locomotor and acetylcholinesterase activity (\u22650.88 and 6\u202f\u03bcg/L, respectively) were found at levels close to the maximum reported FLX concentration in surface waters.

They could be different in their chemical properties and biological activities. Therefore, we compared antioxidant activity, total phenolic and flavonoid content of different species and varieties of turmeric namely C. longa [variety: Ryudai gold (RD) and Okinawa ukon], C. xanthorrhiza, C. aromatica, C. amada, and C. zedoaria. The antioxidant activity was determined using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity, oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), reducing power and 2-deoxyribose (2-DR) oxidation assay. Our results suggested that RD contained significantly higher concentrations of total phenolic (157.4\u202fmg gallic acid equivalent/g extract) and flavonoids (1089.5\u202fmg rutin equivalent/g extract). RD also showed significantly higher DPPH radical-scavenging activity (IC50: 26.4\u202f\u03bcg/mL), ORAC (14,090\u202f\u03bcmol Trolox equivalent/g extract), reducing power absorbance (0.33) and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity (IC50: 7.4\u202f\u03bcg/mL). Therefore, RD was chosen for the isolation of antioxidant compounds using silica gel column, Toyopearl HW-40F column, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Structural identification of the compounds was conducted using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The purified antioxidant compounds were bisabolone-9-one (1), 4-methyllene-5-hydroxybisabola-2,10-diene-9-one (2), turmeronol B (3), 5-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-hepten-3-one (4), 3-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-hepten-1,5-dione (5), cyclobisdemethoxycurcumin (6), bisdemethoxycurcumin (7), demethoxycurcumin (8) and curcumin (9).

     "abstract": "While it has been known for a while that some snake species are extremely sensitive to acetaminophen, the underlying mechanism for this toxicity has not been reported. To investigate if essential detoxification enzymes are missing in snake species that are responsible for biotransformation of acetaminophen in other vertebrate species, livers were collected from a variety of snake species, together with samples from alligator, snapping turtle, cat, rat, and cattle. Subcellular fractions were analyzed for enzymatic activities of phenol-type sulfotransferase and UDP\u2011glucuronosyltransferase, total glutathione S\u2011transferase, and N\u2011acetyltransferase. The results showed that none of the snake species, together with the cat samples, had any phenol-type glucuronidation activity, and that this activity was much lower in alligator and turtle samples than in the mammalian species. Combined with the lack of N\u2011acetyltransferase activity in snakes and cats, this would explain the accumulation of the aminophenol metabolite, which induces methemoglobinemia and subsequent suffocation of snakes and cats after acetaminophen exposure. While previous investigations have concluded that in cats the gene for the phenol-type glucuronosyltransferase isoform has turned into a pseudogene because of several point mutations, evaluation of genomic information for snake species revealed that they have only 2 genes that may code for glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. Similarity of these genes with mammalian genes is <50%, and suggests that the expressed enzymes may act on other types of substrates than aromatic amines. This indicates that the extreme sensitivity for acetaminophen in snakes is based on a different phylogenetic origin than the sensitivity observed in cats.",

     "abstract": "Asian Gyps vulture species are gradually recovering from the devastating effect of diclofenac being present in contaminated carcasses. This drug was responsible for the death of over 10 million vultures in India, Nepal and Pakistan. To prevent the extinction of vultures, meloxicam was introduced after the ban of veterinary diclofenac. Meloxicam's safety in vultures was attributed to its short elimination half-life in contrast with diclofenac. The reason for the rapid elimination of meloxicam is yet to be explained. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of biotransformation in the elimination of meloxicam. Six Cape griffon vultures (Gyps coprotheres) were treated with 2\u202fmg/kg meloxicam intramuscularly for faecal and plasma quantification of meloxicam concentration over time. In the plasma meloxicam was characterised by a half-life, mean residence time, clearance and volume of distribution at steady state of 0.37\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202fh, 0.90\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12\u202fh, 0.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.00\u202fl/h\u202fkg and 0.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.00\u202fl/kg respectively (presented as geometric mean).

Based on the short meloxicam elimination half-life and low cumulative concentration of total faecal meloxicam over a period in excess of 10 half-lives, this study indicates that Cape griffon vultures are efficient metaboliser of meloxicam, which is suggestive of different set of cytochrome enzymes being involved in the metabolism to that for diclofenac in this species. Identification of orthologous human CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzyme families in vultures will be an important further step in explaining the differences in the metabolic pathway(s) of meloxicam and diclofenac for the species.",

Larval survival decreased in the group treated with high concentration of GBH compared to controls, whereas the low concentration group did not differ from the control group. GBH treatment had no association with oxidative status biomarkers (i.e. catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione and glutathione related enzymes), but increased lipid hydroperoxide levels after 2\u202fh exposure, suggesting increased oxidative damage soon after the exposure. Larvae of different origin also differed in their oxidative status, indicating population-dependent differences in antioxidant defence system. Environmentally relevant concentrations of GBH are not likely to affect larval survival, but high concentrations can reduce survival and increase oxidative damage of non-target herbivores. Also, populations of different origin and pesticide usage history can differ in their tolerance to GBH.",

Resveratrol also activated erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway and enhanced the heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), glutathione S-transferase (GST) mRNA levels. Meanwhile, resveratrol treatment repressed TLR2-Myd88-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to decrease the inflammatory response in H2O2-induced liver injury as evidenced by the lower interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-8 mRNA levels and higher IL-10 mRNA level. Moreover, resveratrol treatment attenuated immunotoxicity in liver of H2O2-treated fish, accompanied by upregulation of hepcidin (HEP), complement 3 (C3) and lysozyme (LZM) mRNA levels. Overall results suggested that the protection of resveratrol on H2O2-induced liver injury, inflammation and immunotoxicity was due to its antioxidant property and its ability to modulate the Nrf2 and TLR2-Myd88-NF-\u03baB signaling pathways.",

In view of its recurring applications in agricultural producing countries, the increase of glyphosate concentration in the environment stresses the need to test the adverse effects on non-target organisms and assess the risk of its use. This paper analyzes the toxicological and oxidative stress and modulatory effects of a glyphosate commercial formulation (glyphosate F) on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We detected ROS production and enhancement of oxidative stress response in glyphosate F-treated nematodes. Particularly, we found an increased ctl-1 catalase gene expression of a catalase specific activity. In addition, we showed that glyphosate F treatment activated the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16, a critical target of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, which modulates the transcription of a broad range of genes involved in stress resistance, reproductive development, dauer formation, and longevity. In summary, the exposure of glyphosate F induces an oxidative imbalance in C. elegans that leads to the DAF-16 activation and consequently to the expression of genes that boost the antioxidant defense system. In this regard, clt-1 gene and catalase activity proved to be excellent biomarkers to develop more sensitive protocols to assess the environmental risk of glyphosate use.",

The mRNA and protein expression of CYP3A29 and PXR in HepLi cells was significantly reduced by LPS and TNF-\u03b1 treatment. CYP3A29 promoter activity was dramatically elevated by PXR over expression, whereas LPS and TNF-\u03b1 treatment inhibited the enhanced CYP3A29 promoter activity that was induced by PXR; presumably through inhibition of PXR promoter activity. Furthermore, the inhibition of CYP3A29 promoter activity by LPS and TNF-\u03b1 treatment was blocked by knockdown of PXR or retinoid X receptor (RXR). These data suggest high similarity in the regulation mechanism of pig CYP3A29 and human CYP3A4. Our research provided a significant evaluation to determine whether pigs are suitable as an experimental animal model.",

Juvenile southern catfish were exposed to waterborne cadmium concentrations (0, 62.5, 125, 250 and 500\u202f\u03bcg/L, respectively) for 8\u202fweeks, and the final body mass, the standard metabolic rate, the state III respiration rate, the activity of cytochrome C oxidase (CCO) of liver mitochondria, and the hepatosomatic index (HSI) were determined. The results showed that the 62.5\u202f\u03bcg/L, 125\u202f\u03bcg/L, and 250\u202f\u03bcg/L experiment groups had a significantly higher standard metabolic rate than that of the control group. Standard metabolic rate in the 500\u202f\u03bcg/L experiment group did not differ from the control group. State III respiration rate of liver mitochondria decreased with an increase in cadmium concentration. The 125\u202f\u03bcg/L, 250\u202f\u03bcg/L, and 500\u202f\u03bcg/L experiment groups had a significantly lower state III respiration rate than that of the control group. The activity of CCO in the 500\u202f\u03bcg/L experiment group was significantly lower than that of the control group. These results suggest that at low cadmium concentrations, the southern catfish could continuously improve the standard metabolism to provide extra energy in response to the cadmium stress. Cadmium exposures caused damage to the structure and function of liver mitochondria and decreased the activity of mitochondria enzymes, which results in a decrease in the energy of the liver metabolism. The adjustment of the metabolism of liver mitochondria in southern catfish was inconsistent with the adjustment of individual standard metabolism.",

Although cadmium (Cd) toxicity has been well characterized in fish inhabiting freshwaters, fewer studies have examined the toxic effects of Cd in estuarine and saltwater environments. Additionally, current environmental regulations do not account for organism physiology in different salinity waters even though metal sensitivity is likely to change in these environments. In this study, we investigated effects of changing salinity on acute Cd toxicity to larval (7\u20139 d old) F. heteroclitus and K. marmoratus. Median 96-h lethal concentrations (LC50) for Cd were calculated for both fish species at six different salinities. As salinity increased, metal toxicity decreased in both fish species up to 18\u202fppt salinity; and F. heteroclitus were more sensitive than K. marmoratus at salinities above 12\u202fppt. To determine which components of saltwater were protective against Cd toxicity, we investigated the influence of CaSO4 (100 and 200\u202fmg/L), CaCl2 (200\u202fmg/L), and MgSO4 (300\u202fmg/L) on Cd toxicity to K. marmoratus. The results demonstrated that both competition with calcium and complexation with chloride reduced the toxic effects of Cd to K. marmoratus. These findings could be used to improve marine/estuarine biotic ligand models for the determination of site-specific water quality criteria for Cd.",

Chemicals are mainly metabolized in the liver through phase I oxidation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) and phase II conjugation by conjugated enzymes, such as UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), sulfotransferase (SULT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), etc. Xenobiotic metabolism differs among bird species, but little detailed information is available. In the present study, the four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), pyrene, was used as a model xenobiotic to clarify the characteristics of xenobiotic metabolism in birds compared with laboratory animals by in vivo and in vitro studies. Plasma, bile, and excreta (urine and feces) were collected after oral administration of pyrene and analyzed to clarify xenobiotic metabolism ability in chickens and quails. Interestingly, pyrenediol-glucuronide sulfate (PYDOGS) and pyrenediol-diglucuronide (PYDOGG) were present in chickens and quails but not in rats. In addition, the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) of pyrene-1-sulfate (PYOS) were higher than those of the parent molecule, pyrene, while the elimination half-life (t1/2) and mean residence time (MRT) were faster than those of the parent pyrene. With regard to sulfation of 1-hydroxypyrene (PYOH), the maximum velocity (Vmax) and Michaelis constant (Km) of rat liver cytosol were greater than those of chicken and quail liver cytosol. Furthermore, Vmax/Km of UGT activity in rat liver microsomes was also greater than those of chicken and quail liver microsomes. Characterization of xenobiotic metabolism revealed species differences between birds and mammals, raising concerns about exposure to various xenobiotics in the environment.",

Apoptosis was observed in the THP-1 derived macrophages treated with 500\u202fnM As+3 for 18\u202fh. Suppression of phagocytosis was induced by 18\u202fh As+3 treatment starting from 100\u202fnM.

The nitric oxide production was also inhibited by As+3 treatments, which was negatively correlated with the production of superoxide. Collectively, the results from the study demonstrated that environmentally-relevant concentrations of As+3 induced cytotoxicity and suppressed the major cellular functions in THP-1 derived macrophages.

An analysis of log-transformed data, expressed per gram of liver (g\u202fliver\u22121), showed that total cytochrome P450 (CYP) concentration, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity exhibited small but significant inverse relationships with fish body weight. In contrast, in vitro intrinsic clearance rates (CLIN VITRO,INT) for three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) increased with increasing body weight.

     "abstract": "Manganese is a neurotoxin causing manganism, a Parkinson-like clinical disorder. Manganese has been shown to interfere with dopaminergic neurotransmission, but the neurotoxic mechanism involved is not fully resolved. In the bivalve mollusc Crassostrea virginica also known as the eastern oyster, beating rates of lateral cilia of the gill are controlled by dopaminergic-serotonergic innervation originating from their cerebral and visceral ganglia. Terminal release of dopamine activates D2-like receptors on these gill cells inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and slowing cilia beating rates. In C. virginica, manganese treatment disrupts this dopaminergic innervation of the gill, preventing the normal cilio-inhibitory response of lateral cells to dopamine. In this study an adenylyl cyclase activator (forskolin) and two different inhibitors (MDL-12,330A and SQ 22,536) were used to determine if manganese had any effects on the adenylyl cyclase step of the dopamine D2 receptor signal transduction pathway. The results showed that neither the adenylyl cyclase activator nor the inhibitors were affected by manganese in the control of lateral ciliary activity. This suggests that in C. virginica the mechanism of manganese toxicity on the dopaminergic control of lateral ciliary activity is targeting an early step in the D2R signal transduction pathway, which may involve interference with D2 receptor activation or alternatively some other downstream signaling activity that does not affect adenylyl cyclase.",

In addition, we analyzed CYP19 and PPAR protein levels using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while cellular testosterone (T) and 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) levels were measured using enzyme immune assay (EIA). Tissue burden of DEHP was measured in the liver using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC\u2013MS). We observed apparent concentration- and time-dependent increases of vtg, er-\u03b1, cyp19a1b transcripts, E2 and T levels after exposure to DEHP. A biphasic pattern of effect was observed for ppar-\u03b1, showing a concentration-dependent increase that peaked at 100\u202f\u03bcg/L and thereafter, an apparent concentration-dependent decrease at 200 and 400\u202f\u03bcg/L at all exposure days. Given that the post-differentiation changes of gonads in C. gariepinus corresponded with the 14-day sampling period, we separated the analyzed data into sexes after histological examination of the gonads, showing that females responded stronger, compared to males, to DEHP exposure at all exposure concentrations. Oocyte atresia, intersex (ovotestis) and karyoplasmic clumping were observed in females while male fish showed distortion and degeneration of seminiferous tubules and condensation of tubular cells in the 400\u202f\u03bcg/L exposure group after 14\u202fdays. Corresponding canonical analysis (CCA) of all analyzed variables revealed a positive relationship between analyzed biological variables with increasing DEHP concentrations. Overall, molecular, biochemical and physiological responses presented in the present study indicate that exposure of C. gariepinus to waterborne DEHP produced endocrine disruptive responses with potential consequences for overt reproduction, development, physiology and general health of fish populations inhabiting phthalate contaminated aquatic environments. These responses represent valuable and effective biomarkers of exposure and effects, that can be adopted for screening the presence of EDCs in Nigeria and other developing countries.",

The expression and activity of SOD, catalase, and GST decreased in each tissue evaluated after WSSV infection. Protein carbonyl concentrations increased in each tissue after WSSV infection, while lipid peroxidation increased in hepatopancreas, but not in muscle. Silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 decreased the WSSV viral load in hepatopancreas and muscle of infected shrimp along with shrimp mortality. Silencing of HIF-1\u03b1 ameliorated the antioxidant response in a tissue-specific manner, which translated to a decrease in oxidative damage.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of standardization of the model and the knowledge of the extent of similarity with human metabolism. Zebrafish screenings are performed at different life stages, typically being carried out in adult fish through in vivo assays, followed by early larval stages and embryos. Studies comparing metabolism at the different zebrafish life stages are also common. As with any non-human model, the zebrafish presents similarities and differences in relation to the profile of generated metabolites compared to that observed in humans. Although more studies are still needed to assess the degree to which zebrafish metabolism can be compared to human metabolism, the facts presented indicate that the zebrafish is an excellent potential model for assessing xenobiotic metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Lipid metabolism involves complex pathways, which are regulated in a similar way across vertebrates. Hormonal and hypolipidemic deregulations cause lipid imbalance from fish to humans, but the underlying mechanisms are far from understood. This study explores the potential of using juvenile brown trout to evaluate the in vivo interferences caused by estrogenic (17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol \u2013 EE2), androgenic (testosterone \u2013 T), and hypolipidemic (clofibrate \u2013 CLF) compounds in lipidic and/or peroxisomal pathways. Studied endpoints were from blood/plasma biochemistry, plasma fatty acid profile, ultrastructure of hepatocytes and abundance of their peroxisomes to mRNA expression in the liver. Both T and CLF caused minimal effects when compared to EE2. Estrogenized fish had significantly higher hepatosomatic indexes, increased triglycerides and very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL) in plasma, compared with solvent control. Morphologically, EE2 fish showed increased lipid droplets in hepatocytes, and EE2 and T reduced volume density of peroxisomes in relation to the hepatic parenchyma. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in plasma, namely n\u22123 PUFA, increased with EE2. EE2 animals had increased mRNA levels of vitellogenin A (VtgA), estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1), PPAR\u03b1Ba and acyl-CoA long chain synthetase 1 (Acsl1), while ER\u03b2-1, acyl-CoA oxidase 1\u20133I (Acox1\u20133I), Acox3, PPAR\u03b3, catalase (Cat), urate oxidase (Uox), fatty acid binding protein 1 (Fabp1) and apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI) were down-regulated. In summary, in vivo EE2 exposure altered lipid metabolism and peroxisome dynamics in brown trout, namely by changing the mRNA levels of several genes. Our model can be used to study possible organism-level impacts, viz. in gonadogenesis.",

The inclusion of biomarker responses in chemical monitoring is a recommended practise that has to overcome some difficulties. One of them is the time frame between sample collection and sample processing in order to ensure the preservation of enzymatic activities. In the present study, three bivalve species of commercial interest (mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, razor shell, Solen marginatus, and cockle, Cerastoderma edule) were processed within <2\u202fh after being retrieved from their natural habitat, and 24\u202fh after being transported in air under cold conditions (6\u20138\u202f\u00b0C) to laboratory facilities. The enzymatic activities were compared in the three species submitted to both conditions revealing no differences in terms of carboxylesterase dependent activities (CEs) using different substrates: p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA), p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB), 1-naphthyl acetate (1-NA), 1-naphthyl butyrate (1-NB) and 2-naphthyl acetate (2-NA). In mussels, three tissues were selected (haemolymph, gills and digestive gland). For comparative purposes, in razor shell and cockle only digestive gland was considered as it is the main metabolic organ. Baseline enzymatic activities for CEs were characterised in the digestive gland of the three bivalves using four out of the five selected CE substrates as well as the kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) and catalytic efficiency. The in vitro sensitivity to the organophosphorus metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon was also calculated. IC50 values (pM-nM range) were lower than those obtained for vertebrate groups which suggest that bivalves have high protection efficiency against this pesticide as well as species dependent particularities.",

     "abstract": "The oxidative stress and genotoxic effect of deltamethrin on the Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis were assessed using several commonly used biomarkers in this study. The results showed that the 48\u202fh and 96\u202fh LC50 values of deltamethrin to E. sinensis were 2.319 and 1.164\u202f\u03bcg/L, respectively, and the safe concentration was 0.293\u202f\u03bcg/L. According to these results, deltamethrin was applied at concentrations of 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and 1/1 96\u202fh LC50 for 8\u202fd in an exposure experiment. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) increased remarkably at 1\u202fd, but decreased at 4\u202fd in concentration group of 1/4, 1/2 and 1/1 LC50, whereas catalase (CAT) activity decreased during the exposure. The total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) at the concentrations of 1/4, 1/8 and 1/16 LC50 increased significantly at 1\u202fd or 2\u202fd respectively, whereas it decreased gradually until the end of the experiment under the concentrations above 1/4 LC50. The oxidative stress products malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in serum increased significantly at each concentration except H2O2 at concentration of 1/16 LC50. Additionally, the micronucleus (MN) frequency of haemocytes increased at the concentrations of 1/4, 1/2 and 1/1 LC50 throughout the exposure, similar trend was observed in the comet ratio and percentage of tail-DNA (%DNA) in haemocytes. These results revealed that deltamethrin had a prominent toxic effect on E. sinensis based on antioxidative response inhibition and genotoxicity that was possibly due to lipid peroxidation (LPO) induced by oxidative products, and the accumulation of peroxide, even under a sublethal concentration.",

     "abstract": "Fish can be simultaneously or sequentially exposed to various kinds of pollutants, resulting in combined effects. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons induce cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 1A (CYP1A) expression, which catalyzes the conversion of the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) into its most active derivative, CPF-oxon. CPF-oxon inhibits CYP1A and other enzymes, including carboxylesterases (CEs) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). We studied the effects of an in vivo exposure to crude oil water accommodated fraction (WAF) followed by an ex vivo exposure of liver tissue to CPF on the expression of Cyp1a, AhR and ARNT mRNA, CYP1A protein and on the activity of biomarker enzymes in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to WAF (62\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 TPH) for 48\u202fh. Then, liver was dissected out, sliced and exposed to 20\u202f\u03bcg\u202fL\u22121 CPF ex vivo for 1\u202fh. Liver tissue was analyzed for mRNA and protein expression and for CEs, AChE, glutathione S-transferase (GST) and CYP1A (EROD) activity. WAF induced Cyp1a mRNA and CYP1A protein expression by 10-fold and 2.5\u20138.3-fold, respectively, with no effect of CPF. WAF induced AhR expression significantly (4-fold) in control but not in CPF treated liver tissue. ARNT mRNA expression was significantly lowered (5-fold) by WAF. CPF significantly reduced liver EROD activity, independently of WAF pre-treatment. CEs activity was significantly inhibited in an additive manner following in vivo exposure to WAF (42%) and ex vivo exposure to CPF (19%). CPF exposure inhibited AChE activity (37%) and increased GST activity (42%).",

     "abstract": "Ionoregulation in the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus has been intensively studied over the last two decades using a variety of techniques. However, there has been limited use of pharmacological inhibitors to identify proteins involved in ion transport for this species. In this study, we used a range of pharmacological inhibitors (EIPA, DAPI, ethoxzolamide, bumetanide, bafilomycin, phenamil, hydrochlorothiazide) to investigate the proteins involved in Na+ transport in freshwater (1\u202fmM Na+) acclimated F. heteroclitus. Our results indicate that Na+ uptake under these conditions is sensitive to both EIPA (NHE-specific inhibitor) and DAPI (putative ASIC-specific inhibitor), but not to any of the other inhibitors. Results for EIPA are consistent with previous studies indicating F. heteroclitus relies solely on NHE2 for Na+ transport across the apical membrane of ionocytes. In contrast, results for DAPI are surprising given previous studies that have indicated the H+-ATPase is basolaterally located in F. heteroclitus and so cannot contribute to Na+ uptake via ASIC. The lack of bafilomycin sensitivity in the current study is consistent with a basolaterally located H+-ATPase. This suggests that DAPI is not an ASIC-specific inhibitor as has been previously assumed, and that it may also inhibit NHE2. Finally, we did not observe Na+ uptake to be sensitive to ethoxzolamide, suggesting that carbonic anhydrase may not be involved in generating the H+ needed to maintain NHE activity in freshwater as has been previously proposed.",

Some species are unique in that they have the longest venom glands of any viper, extending approximately 10% of the body length. Despite their potential medical importance and evolutionary novelty, their venom has received almost no research attention. In this study, venoms from a short-glanded species (C. lichtensteinii) and from a long-glanded species (C. rhombeatus) were compared using a series of proteomic and bioactivity testing techniques to investigate and compare the toxin composition and functioning of the venoms of these two species. Both C. rhombeatus and C. lichtensteinii were similar in overall venom composition and inhibition of blood coagulation through non-clotting proteolytic cleavage of fibrinogen. While the 1D gel profiles were very similar to each other in the toxin types present, 2D gel analyses revealed isoformic differences within each toxin classes. This variation was congruent with differential efficacy of South African Institute for Medical Research snake polyvalent antivenom, with C. lichtensteinii unaffected at the dose tested while C. rhombeatus was moderately but significantly neutralized. Despite the variation within toxin classes, the similarity in overall venom biochemistry suggests that the selection pressure for the evolution of long glands served to increase venom yield in order to subjugate proportionally large anurans as a unique form of niche partitioning, and is not linked to significant changes in venom function. These results not only contribute to the body of venom evolution knowledge but also highlight the limited clinical management outcomes for Causus envenomations.",

Employing this acute exposure model, the impact of MCP on DA degeneration among worms of two age groups (8 and 13\u202fd old) fed control (CO) and high glucose (GF) diet with specific focus on phenotypic alterations, oxidative impairments and associated molecular perturbations employing both wild (N2) and transgenic strains(BZ555 and NL5901) was investigated. In general, 13\u202fd worms exhibited higher susceptibility to MCP intoxication compared to 8\u202fd old worms. Further, MCP-exposure caused an enhanced degree of DA degeneration among glucose fed (GF) worms as evidenced by lower chemotaxis index, reduced long-term memory and increased nonanone repulsion. Biochemical analysis of 13\u202fd GF worms also revealed a significant increase in ROS, protein carbonyls and reduced ADP/ATP ratio. Interestingly, marked increase in degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased in \u03b1-synuclein content was evident among 13\u202fd GF worms exposed to MCP. Significant alterations in the mRNA expression levels of daf-2, age-1, sir 2.1 and aak-2 among 13\u202fd GF worms was evident. Collectively these findings suggest that high intake of glucose diet aggravates MCP associated dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and the impact of increasing age under such a condition. Moreover it provides an experimental paradigm to explore the molecular targets and mechanism/s underlying the possible relationship between insecticide exposure-associated dopaminergic degeneration in humans under hyperglycemic conditions.",

Gill metal concentrations and metallothionein gene expression were lower in PC fish than in PP fish at any experimental time (24, 48 and 72\u202fh). In muscle, no significant changes were observed. These findings indicate that metal accumulated in gills of wild fish chronically exposed to the metal mixture are more easily excreted than those accumulated in the muscle.

Generally, when comparing the effects of individual metals, Cu was found to induce the maximum adverse effects followed by Cd and Zn, respectively. Among the binary metal-mixture combinations, Cu and Cd produced additive effects on the degradation of major proteins and lipid moieties, whereas the co-exposure of Zn with Cd or Cu elicited ameliorative effects, indicating antagonistic (less than additive) interactions between Zn and Cd or Cu in the rainbow trout gill.

Aquatic amphibians are particularly susceptible to this toxicant as it was shown to cause developmental abnormalities and genotoxic effects. In mammalian cells, the accumulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which catalyzes the breakdown of heme into CO, free iron and biliverdin, was reported to protect cells against potentially lethal concentrations of CdCl2. In the present study, CdCl2 treatment of A6 kidney epithelial cells, derived from the frog, Xenopus laevis, induced the accumulation of HO-1, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and HSP30 as well as an increase in the production of aggregated protein and aggresome-like structures. Treatment of cells with inhibitors of HO-1 enzyme activity, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), enhanced CdCl2-induced actin cytoskeletal disorganization and the accumulation of HO-1, HSP70, aggregated protein and aggresome-like structures. Treatment of cells with hemin and baicalein, which were previously shown to provide cytoprotection against various stresses, induced HO-1 accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Also, treatment of cells with hemin and baicalein suppressed CdCl2-induced actin dysregulation and the accumulation of aggregated protein and aggresome-like structures. This cytoprotective effect was inhibited by SnPP. These results suggest that HO-1-mediated protection against CdCl2 toxicity includes the maintenance of actin cytoskeletal and microtubular structure and the suppression of aggregated protein and aggresome-like structures.",

EISSTR6 and EISSTR7 mRNA expression was detected in 17 topmouth culter tissues, and the highest level was observed in the pituitary. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that SS14 significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated pCRE-luc promoter activity in HEK293 cells transiently expressing EISSTR6 and EISSTR7, indicating that the receptors can be activated by SS14. We also identified phosphorylation sites important for the functional activity of EISSTR6 and EISSTR7 by mutating Ser23, 43, 107, 196, 311 and Ser7, 29, 61, 222, 225 residues, respectively, to Ala, which significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of SS14 on the CRE promoter mediated by EISSTR6 and EISSTR7. Furthermore, treatment of juvenile topmouth culters with microcystin-LR or 17\u03b2-estradiol significantly affected EISSTR6 and EISSTR7 transcription in the brain, liver and spleen, suggesting that these receptors may be involved in the pathogenic mechanisms induced by endocrine disruptors. Our findings should contribute to the understanding of the structure-function relationship and evolution of the SSTR family.",

However, whether SMC also affects the reproductive endocrine system of male marine organisms is currently unclear. In this study, Japanese flounder embryos were exposed to 1, 10, and 100\u202f\u03bcg/L SMC for 130\u202fdays. Plasma testosterone (T) and 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) concentrations were significantly decreased in male flounders after SMC exposure. The expression of genes involved in T and E2 synthesis, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, cytochrome P450 11A1, 17\u03b1-hydroxylase, 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and cytochrome P450 19A, was down-regulated in the gonads, which may explain the decrease in plasma sex hormones levels. Moreover, SMC-mediated changes in the transcription of these steroidogenic genes were associated with reduced levels of follicle-stimulating hormone beta subunit (fsh\u03b2), luteinizing hormone beta subunit (lh\u03b2), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) and luteinizing hormone receptor (lhr) mRNA. In addition, down-regulated transcription of fsh\u03b2 and lh\u03b2 in the SMC exposure groups was affected by reduced mRNA levels of seabream gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sbgnrh), g-protein-coupled receptor 54 (gpr54) in the kisspeptin/gpr54 system, as well as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (gad). Overall, our results showed that environmentally relevant concentrations of SMC exerted anti-androgenic effects in male flounders via impacting HPG axis, kiss/gpr54 system and GABA synthesis, providing theoretical support for investigating reproductive toxicity of environmental pollutants that interfere with the neuroendocrine system.",

     "abstract": "Organotin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPT), have been widely used to control marine fouling. Here, we show that organotin stimulation reduces the hormone levels in the plasma of two economically important aquaculture fish. Blood plasma samples were collected from juvenile red seabream and black rockfish exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of TBT and TPT for 14\u202fdays. The levels of two plasma biomarkers, namely the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (VTG) and the sex steroid 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), were measured to determine the endocrine disrupting potential of the organotin compounds. Both organotin compounds were dose-dependently accumulated in the blood of two fish. Exposure to waterborne TBT and TBT significantly decreased the plasma VTG levels in both the juvenile fish in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the treatment with E2, a well-known VTG inducer, significantly increased the plasma VTG levels in both the fish. In addition, the mRNA levels of vtg were also downregulated in the liver tissues of both the fish at 100 and/or 1000\u202fng\u202fL\u22121 of TBT or TPT exposure. The plasma E2 titers were significantly suppressed at 100 and/or 1000\u202fng\u202fL\u22121 of TBT or TPT exposure for 14\u202fdays compared to their titer in the control. Since estrogen directly regulates vtg gene expression and VTG synthesis, our results reveal the endocrine disrupting potential of organotin compounds, and subsequently the endocrine modulation at early stage of fish can trigger further fluctuations in sexual differentiation, maturation, sex ration or egg production. In addition, the results demonstrate their effects on non-target organisms, particularly on animals reared in aquaculture and fisheries.",

We have previously studied the disrupting mechanisms of BPF on the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axis of adult zebrafish. However, the effects of BPF exposure on development and sexual differentiation of zebrafish embryos/larvae remain unclear. To determine the effects of BPF on the critical stage of sex differentiation in zebrafish, zebrafish embryos/larvae were exposed to 1, 10, 100, and 1000\u202f\u03bcg/L BPF from fertilization to 60\u202fdays post-fertilization (dpf). Developmental malformations were induced by exposure to BPF from 2\u202fh post-fertilization (hpf), with a LC50 of 10,030\u202f\u03bcg/L at 96\u202fhpf and 9391\u202f\u03bcg/L at 120\u202fhpf. Long-term exposure during sex differentiation tended to result in a female sex ratio bias. Histological analyses at 60\u202fdpf indicated that the development of ovo-testes and immature ovaries was induced by 100 and 1000\u202f\u03bcg/L BPF. Homogenate testosterone levels decreased and 17\u03b2-estradiol levels increased in zebrafish in a concentration-dependent manner. BPF exposure suppressed gene expression of double sex, Mab3-related transcription factor 1(dmrt1), fushi tarazu factor 1d (ff1d), sry-box containing gene 9a (sox9a) and anti-Mullerian hormone (amh); induced expression of the forkhead box L2 transcription factor (foxl2), leading to increased expression of aromatase (cyp19a1a), which promoted production of estrogens, and further caused phenotypic feminization of zebrafish. These results suggest that developmental exposure to BPF has adverse effects on sexual differentiation, and the results were useful for a BPF risk assessment.",

Confocal microscopy indicated that 7, 12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) -induced nuclear translocation of AhR was deterred by hesperetin treatment. The reduced nuclear translocation could also be observed in Western analysis. Reporter-gene assay further illustrated that the induced XRE transactivation was weakened by the treatment of hesperetin. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay demonstrated that the gene expressions of CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 followed the same pattern of AhR translocation.

We observed that both 10 and 30\u202f\u03bcg/L Pb increased the volume of mucus in the gut. At phylum level, the abundance of \u03b1-Proteobacteria decreased significantly and the abundance of Firmicutes increased significantly in the gut when treated with 30\u202f\u03bcg/L Pb for 7\u202fdays.

A more depth analysis, at the genus level, discovered that 52 gut microbes identified by operational taxonomic unit analysis were changed significantly in 30\u202f\u03bcg/L Pb treated group. Based on GC/MS metabolomics analysis, a total of 41 metabolites were significantly altered in 30\u202f\u03bcg/L Pb treatment group. These changed metabolites were mainly associated with the pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism. In addition, we also confirmed that the transcription of some genes related to glycolysis and lipid metabolism, including Gk, Aco, Acc1, Fas, Apo and Dgat, decreased significantly in the liver of zebrafish when exposed to 30\u202f\u03bcg/L Pb for 7\u202fdays.

In this study, toxicity of acephate (formulation Bracket\u00ae97) was examined in honey bees through feeding treatments with sublethal (pollen residue level: 0.168\u202fmg/L) and median-lethal (LC50: 6.97\u202fmg/L) concentrations. Results indicated that adult bees treated with acephate at residue concentration did not show significant increase in mortality, but esterase activity was significantly suppressed. Similarly, bees treated with binary mixtures of acephate with six formulated pesticides (all at residue dose) consistently showed lower esterase activity and body weight. Clothianidin, \u03bb-cyhalothrin, oxamyl, tetraconazole, and chlorpyrifos may interact with acephate significantly to reduce body weight in treated bees. The dose response data (LC50: 6.97\u202fmg/L) revealed a relatively higher tolerance to acephate in Stoneville bee population (USA) than populations elsewhere, although in general the population is still very sensitive to the organophosphate. In addition to killing 50% of the treated bees acephate (6.97\u202fmg/L) inhibited 79.9%, 20.4%, and 29.4% of esterase, Glutathione S-transferase (GST), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, respectively, in survivors after feeding treatment for 48\u202fh. However, P450 activity was elevated 20% in bees exposed to acephate for 48\u202fh. Even though feeding on sublethal acephate did not kill honey bees directly, chronic toxicity to honey bee was noticeable in body weight loss and esterase suppression, and its potential risk of synergistic interactions with other formulated pesticides should not be ignored.",

Significant decreases were observed in red blood cell (RBC) Count, hemoglobin (Hb) level, hematocrit (Ht), and plasma protein levels after each exposure period. In contrast, notable increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), calcium, and glucose levels were observed in the trichlorfon-treated groups. Additionally, there were significant increases in the plasma levels of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT), glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) following the exposure to trichlorfon. Furthermore, the results showed a relationship between toxic stress and increment in HSP70 and cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) expression over time. Ht, MCV, MCH, and the value of other biochemical parameters were quite lower at 15\u202f\u00b0C than their corresponding values were at 25\u202f\u00b0C, which indicated the decreased physical activity at 15\u202f\u00b0C. The results of the present work indicate that acute exposure to trichlorfon and thermal stimulus could damage erythropoietic tissue.

As early life stages of fish are particularly vulnerable to environmental contaminants, they are ideal models for examining the relationship between impaired mitochondrial bioenergetics (ATP-dependent respiration, basal oxidative respiration) and apical endpoints such as growth. Here, early life stages of the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), an ecologically relevant North American species, were used to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial bioenergetics and growth following perturbation with model mitochondrial toxicants 2,4-dinitrophenol and octylamine. Fathead minnows were exposed to 2,4-dinitrophenol and octylamine at 3 concentrations for 24\u202fh and endpoints related to mitochondrial bioenergetics were measured with the Agilent Seahorse XFe24 Bioanalyzer. In order to link changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics to growth, fathead minnows were exposed to the same chemical contaminants for 7\u201314\u202fdays and growth was measured by measuring total length on a weekly basis. There was a significant correlation between decrease in average length at 14\u202fdays and basal respiration (r\u202f=\u202f0.997, p\u202f=\u202f0.050, n\u202f=\u202f3), as well as maximal respiration (r\u202f=\u202f0.998, p-value\u202f=\u202f0.043, n\u202f=\u202f3) for embryos exposed to 2,4 dinitrophenol.

     "abstract": "Estrogen regulates numerous developmental and physiological processes and effects are mediated mainly by estrogenic receptors (ERs), which function as ligand-regulated transcription factor. ERs can be activated by many different types endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and interfere with behaviour and reproductive potential of living organism. Estrogenic regulation of membrane associated G protein-coupled estrogen receptor, GPER activity has also been reported. Bisphenol A (BPA), a ubiquitous endocrine disruptor is present in many household products, has been linked to many adverse effect on sexual development and reproductive potential of wild life species. The present work is aimed to elucidate how an environmentally pervasive chemical BPA affects in vivo expression of a known estrogen target gene, cyp19a1b in the brain, and a known estrogenic biomarker, vitellogenin (Vg) in the whole body homogenate of 30\u202fdays post fertilization (dpf) swim-up fry of Labeo rohita. We confirm that, like estrogen, the xenoestrogen BPA exposure for 5\u201315\u202fdays induces strong overexpression of cyp19a1b, but not cyp19a1a mRNA in the brain and increase concentration of vitellogenin in swim-up fry. BPA also induces strong overexpression of aromatase B protein and aromatase activity in brain. Experiments using selective modulators of classical ERs and GPER argue that this induction is largely through nuclear ERs, not through GPER. Thus, BPA has the potential to elevate the levels of aromatase and thereby, levels of endogenous estrogen in developing brain. These results indicate that L. rohita swim-up fry can be used to detect environmental endocrine disruptors either using cyp19a1b gene expression or vitellogenin induction.",

     "abstract": "Evolutionarily conserved diurnal circadian mechanisms maintain oscillating patterns of gene expression based on the day-night cycle. Xiphophorus fish have been used to evaluate transcriptional responses after exposure to various light sources and it was determined that each source incites distinct genetic responses in skin tissue. However, basal expression levels of genes that show oscillating expression patterns in day-night cycle, may affect the outcomes of such experiments, since basal gene expression levels at each point in the circadian path may influence the profile of identified light responsive genes. Lack of knowledge regarding diurnal fluctuations in basal gene expression patterns may confound the understanding of genetic responses to external stimuli (e.g., light) since the dynamic nature of gene expression implies animals subjected to stimuli at different times may be at very different stages within the continuum of genetic homeostasis. We assessed basal gene expression changes over a 24-hour period in 200 select Xiphophorus gene targets known to transcriptionally respond to various types of light exposure. We identified 22 genes in skin, 36 genes in brain and 28 genes in liver that exhibit basal oscillation of expression patterns. These genes, including known circadian regulators, produced the expected expression patterns over a 24-hour cycle when compared to circadian regulatory genes identified in other species, especially human and other vertebrate animal models. Our results suggest the regulatory network governing diurnal oscillating gene expression is similar between Xiphophorus and other vertebrates for the three Xiphophorus organs tested. In addition, we were able to categorize light responsive gene sets in Xiphophorus that do, and do not, exhibit circadian based oscillating expression patterns.",

The incidence of newly detected cases increases every year suggesting the necessity of development and application of innovative treatment strategies. Human melanoma develops from melanocytes localized in the epidermis of the skin to malignant tumors because of deregulated effectors influencing several molecular pathways. Despite many advances in describing the molecular changes accompanying melanoma formation, many critical and clinically relevant molecular features of the transformed pigment cells and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. To contribute to a better understanding of the molecular processes of melanoma formation, we use a transgenic medaka melanoma model that is well suited for the investigation of melanoma tumor development because fish and human melanocytes are both localized in the epidermis. The purpose of our study was to gain insights into melanoma development from the first steps of tumor formation up to melanoma progression and to identify gene expression patterns that will be useful for monitoring treatment effects in drug screening approaches. Comparing transcriptomes from juvenile fish at the tumor initiating stage with nevi and advanced melanoma of adults, we identified stage specific expression signatures and pathways that are characteristic for the development of medaka melanoma, and are also found in human malignancies.",

Classical methods of studying metabolism in vivo are well established, but most are tedious and expensive, thus, finding methods of accurately measuring metabolism in living organisms that is quick and non-invasive is of strong interest. In this work, we validate the use of resazurin; a compound that is conformationally changed into fluorescent resorufin upon metabolic reduction by NADH2, as a metabolic assay for adult zebrafish. This assay is based on the principle that increases in resorufin fluorescence intensity (FI) conveys relative changes in metabolic output of the organisms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of resazurin in measuring metabolic changes in zebrafish larvae and adults in relation to number of pooled fish, as well as temperature alteration. Moreover, we provide details on the appropriate and optimized diluents and concentrations of resazurin. Further, by using a novel sample collection technique, we can increase the temporal possibilities that were previously limited, as well as show that samples can be stored and measured at a later time point with no decrease in accuracy. Thus, the validation of this assay in adult zebrafish may increase the versatility and complexity of the types of experiments that can be performed and have many practical applications in the field.",

Fixation, decalcification, embedding, and sectioning of zebrafish were optimized to maximize section quality. A comparison of protocols involving six fixatives showed that 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin at 21\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h yielded excellent results. Sectioning of juveniles and adults requires bone decalcification; EDTA at 0.35\u00a0M produced effective decalcification in 21-day-old juveniles through adults (\u2265~3\u00a0Months). To improve section plane consistency in sets of larvae, we have developed new array casting molds based on the outside contours of larvae derived from 3D microCT images. Tissue discontinuity in sections, a common barrier to creating quality sections of zebrafish, was minimized by processing and embedding the formalin-fixed zebrafish tissues in plasticized forms of paraffin wax, and by periodic hydration of the block surface in ice water between sets of sections. Optimal H&E (Hematoxylin and Eosin) staining was achieved through refinement of standard protocols. High quality slide scans produced from glass histology slides were digitally processed to maximize image quality, and experimental replicates posted as full slides as part of this publication. Modifications to tissue processing are still needed to eliminate the need for block surface hydration. The further addition of slide collections from other model systems and 3D tools for visualizing tissue architecture would greatly increase the utility of the digital atlas.",

Intriguingly, dietary methionine restriction (MR) has been shown to ameliorate this phenotype over time potentially through mechanisms related to changes in myogenic precursor cell (MPC) differentiation status. Recently the role of micro-RNAs (miRs) in regulating the expression of muscle specific transcription factors myoD and myogenin as well as signaling molecules involved in skeletal muscle differentiation has been reported in vitro. We performed an 8\u00a0week feeding trial to determine if MR in vivo could alter miR abundance as well as change metabolic markers. Results show changes in muscle miR abundance for miR-133a at 4\u00a0weeks with no significant difference seen in miR-210 or miR-206. After 8\u00a0weeks of MR feeding fish demonstrated increased clearance of glucose, increased fat accumulation in the liver, and decreased fat accumulation in the muscle. These data demonstrate conservation of MR effects on fish metabolism, and suggest, for the first time, that miR-133a might play a role in tissue response to MR.",

We investigated the possibility that positional memory is associated with variation in transcript abundances along the proximal-distal limb axis. Transcripts were deeply sampled from Ambystoma mexicanum limbs at the time they were administered fore arm vs upper arm amputations, and at 19 post-amputation time points. After amputation and prior to regenerative outgrowth, genes typically expressed by differentiated muscle cells declined more rapidly in upper arms while cell cycle transcripts were expressed more highly. These and other expression patterns suggest upper arms undergo more robust tissue remodeling and cell proliferation responses after amputation, and thus provide an explanation for why the overall time to complete regeneration is similar for proximal and distal amputations. Additionally, we identified candidate positional memory genes that were expressed differently between fore and upper arms that encode a surprising number of epithelial proteins and a variety of cell surface, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix molecules. Also, genes were discovered that exhibited different, bivariate patterns of gene expression between fore and upper arms, implicating dynamic transcriptional regulation for the first time in limb regeneration. Finally, 43 genes expressed differently between fore and upper arm samples showed similar transcriptional patterns during retinoic acid-induced reprogramming of fore arm blastema cells into upper arm cells.

The objective of this study is to determine the toxicity of Alaskan oil, as well as chemically dispersed oil. Oil experiments were performed using the water accommodated fraction of Alaskan oil (WAF) and the chemically enhanced water accommodated fraction of Alaskan oil (CEWAF). The Alaskan WAF is not cytotoxic to sperm whale skin cells though it did induce chromosome damage; S9-mediated metabolism did not affect the cytotoxicity of WAF but did increase the levels of chromosome damage. Alaskan CEWAF is more cytotoxic and genotoxic than the WAF; S9 mediated metabolism increased both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of CEWAF. Analysis of the PAH content of Alaskan WAF and CEWAF revealed a forty-fold increase in the total levels of PAHs in CEWAF compared to WAF. These findings show that chemically dispersed oil leads to higher levels of PAH exposure which are more toxic and likely to lead to longer and more persistent health effects.",

     "abstract": "The decline of female reproductive function is an early phenotype of aging in humans, occurring only midway through the lifespan. Yet the number of women delaying pregnancy continues to rise in industrialized societies due to personal or socioeconomic circumstances, often resulting in subfertility or difficulty conceiving. There are few defined mechanisms associated with this etiology, and equally few effective therapies. To combat this problem, we used a novel emerging model, Nothobranchius guentheri, that recapitulates the age-associated spectrum of changes that adversely affect human fertility. We hypothesized that resveratrol (RSV), which activates SirT1 as an oxidative stress sensor and longevity assurance enzyme, would improve female fecundity in mid-life. RSV, a polyphenol found in grapes and red wine, has been touted as an anti-aging dietary supplement due to its ability to prolong both lifespan and health span. SirT1 is an NAD\u00a0+ dependent histone deacetylase, whose activity is regulated by the nicotinamide to NAD\u00a0+ salvage pathway, especially the rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT. We found that female N. guentheri fed 600\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0RSV/g food into mid-life (~\u00a020\u00a0weeks), beginning at sexual maturity, showed increased embryo production compared to those on Control diet. Furthermore, the RSV-fed fish had significantly increased NAMPT. This suggests that dietary RSV has a positive effect on female fertility, and that it may become an effective therapy to regulate sirtuin activity and combat reproductive senescence.",

Here, the potential impact of lighting differences on skin transcriptomes has been tested in three aquatic animal models commonly utilized in biomedical research, (Xiphophorus maculatus (platyfish), Oryzias latipes (medaka) and Danio rerio (zebrafish). Analysis of replicate comparative RNA-Seq data showed the transcriptional response to commonly utilized 4100\u00a0K or \u201ccool white\u201d fluorescent light (FL) is much greater in platyfish and medaka than in zebrafish. FL induces genes associated with inflammatory and immune responses in both medaka and zebrafish; however, the platyfish exhibit suppression of genes involved with immune/inflammation, as well as genes associated with cell cycle progression. Furthermore, comparative analyses of gene expression data from platyfish UVB exposures, with medaka and zebrafish after exposure to 4100\u00a0K FL, show comparable effects on the same stress pathways. We suggest the response to light is conserved, but that long-term adaptation to species specific environmental niches has resulted in a shifting of the wavelengths required to incite similar \u201cgenetic\u201d responses in skin.

Artificial light has been shown to affect various behavior and physiological processes in vertebrates.

Previous studies showed that one of the commonly used fluorescent light source (FL; 4100\u00a0K or \u201ccool white\u201d) can affect signaling pathways related to maintenance of circadian rhythm, cell cycle progression, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair/recombination in the skin of male Xiphophorus maculatus. These observations raise questions concerning the kinetics of the FL induced gene expression response, and which biological functions become modulated at various times after light exposure. To address these questions, we exposed zebrafish to 4100\u00a0K FL and utilized RNA-Seq to assess gene expression changes in skin at various times (1 to 12\u00a0h) after FL exposure. We found 4100\u00a0K FL incites a robust early (1\u00a0\u2212\u00a02h) transcriptional response, followed by a more protracted late response (i.e., 4\u201312\u00a0h). The early transcriptional response involves genes associated with cell migration/infiltration and cell proliferation as part of an overall increase in immune function and inflammation. The protracted late transcriptional response occurs within gene sets predicted to maintain and perpetuate the inflammatory response, as well as suppression of lipid, xenobiotic, and melatonin metabolism.",

However, the amount of EDC uptake into the animal is often difficult to determine. Using radiolabeled estradiol ([3H]E2), we previously developed a rapid, straightforward assay to measure estradiol uptake from water into zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we extend this approach to measure the uptake of two additional EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE2). As with E2, the uptake of each compound by individual larvae was low (<\u00a06%), and increased with increasing concentration, duration, and developmental stage. We found that E2 and EE2 had similar uptake under equivalent exposure conditions, while BPA had comparatively lower uptake. One application of this assay is to test factors that influence EDC uptake or efflux. It has been suggested that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) inhibit ABC transporters that may normally efflux EDCs and their metabolites, inducing toxicity in aquatic organisms. We measured [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish in the presence or absence of the POP PDBE-100, and cyclosporine A, a known inhibitor of ABC transporters. Neither chemical significantly affected [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish, suggesting that zebrafish maintain estradiol efflux in the presence of PDBE-100, independently of cyclosporine A-responsive transporters. These uptake results will be a valuable reference for EDC exposure studies in developing zebrafish, and provide a rapid assay to screen for chemicals that influence estrogen-like EDC levels in vivo.",

In contrast, adaptation to extreme environments has led many species to alter or even entirely abandon their reliance upon cyclic environmental inputs, principally daily cycles of light and darkness. The extreme darkness, stability and isolation of cave ecosystems has made cave-adapted species particularly attractive systems in which to study the consequences of life without light and the strategies that allow species to survive and even thrive in such environments. In order to further explore these questions, we have assessed the rhythmicity of locomotion in the blind Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, under controlled laboratory conditions. Using high-resolution video tracking assays, we characterized patterns in locomotor activity and spatial tank usage for members of the surface and Pach\u00f3n cave populations. Here we demonstrate that cavefish have a higher overall level of activity and use the space within the trial tank differently than surface fish. Further, Pach\u00f3n cavefish show circadian rhythmicity in both activity and spatial tank usage under a 12:12 light/dark cycle. We provide further evidence that these cavefish retain a weakly light-entrainable, endogenous circadian oscillator with limited capability to sustain rhythms in activity, but not spatial tank usage, in the absence of photic cues.

Statistical interactions between BPA and oxygen concentration were found for arterial RBC velocity at both ages. Because the co-occurrence of both stressors is extremely common, it would be beneficial to understand how BPA and hypoxia interact to affect cardiovascular function during and after exposure.",

All ATZ concentrations caused a decrease in motility, mitochondrial functionality, and membrane integrity, as measured using conventional microscopy or fluorescence microscopy with specific probes. The DNA integrity of sperm was not affected. The levels of expression of genes related to spermatogenesis, antioxidant defenses, and DNA repair were also investigated using RT-qPCR. The ATZ caused transcriptional repression of the spermatogenesis-related genes SRD5A2 and CFTR, the antioxidant defense genes SOD2 and GPX4B, and the DNA repair gene XPC. This is the first study to show that environmentally relevant concentrations of ATZ significantly affect the sperm quality in fish, possibly resulting in reduced fertility rates. In addition, we showed that the repression of genes related to spermatogenesis and cellular defense could be part of the mechanisms involved in the ATZ toxicity in the testes of male fish.",

Fish (~100\u202fg) were exposed to acutely toxic levels of waterborne Zn alone and in combination with waterborne Cd or Cu for 24\u202fh (each at 1\u202f\u00d7\u202f96\u202fh LC50). Gill sections were prepared and analyzed at the VESPERS beamline of the Canadian Light Source. The primary lamellae of the fish gill were found to be the primary area of Zn accumulation. These regions also correspond to the zones of mitochondria rich cells localization in fish gills, supporting the putative roles of these cells in metal uptake. Zn was also found to predominantly co-localize with Ca and S, but not with Fe, indicating the roles of Ca and S in intracellular Zn handling. Zn distribution in the gill was markedly reduced during co-exposure to Cd, but not to Cu, suggesting a competitive interaction between Zn and Cd for uptake. The speciation of Zn in the gill was dominated by Zn-phosphate, Zn-histidine and Zn-cysteine species; however, the interactions of Zn with Cd or Cu resulted in the loss of Zn-cysteine. Overall, our findings provide important novel insights into the interactions of Zn, Cd and Cu in the fish gill, which may ultimately help to explain the mechanisms underlying the acute toxicity of these metals in binary mixture to fish.",

In the present study, specific chemicals were used and biomarkers (e.g. 7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS)) were measured to assess the metabolic capabilities and cytotoxicity of the fish hepatic cell lines Hepa-E1 and RTH-149, and the fish gill cell lines RTgill-W1 and G1B. These cell lines were exposed to \u03b2-naphthoflavone (BNF) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), the pharmaceutical tamoxifen (TMX), and the organic peroxide tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP). Cytotoxicity in gill cell lines was significantly higher than in hepatic cells, with BNF and TMX being the most toxic compounds. CYP1-like associated activity, measured through EROD activity, was only detected in hepatic cells; Hepa-E1 cells showed the highest activity after exposure to both BNF and BaP. Significantly higher levels of CYP3A-like activity were also observed in Hepa-E1 cells exposed to TMX, while gill cell lines presented the lowest levels. Measurements of ROS and antioxidant enzymes indicated that peroxide levels were higher in gill cell lines in general. However, levels of superoxide were significantly higher in RTH-149 cells, where no distinctive increase of superoxide-related antioxidants was observed. The present study demonstrates the importance of selecting adequate cell lines in measuring specific metabolic parameters and provides strong evidence for the fish hepatocarcinoma Hepa-E1 cells to be an excellent alternative in assessing metabolism of xenobiotics, and in expanding the applicability of fish cell lines for in vitro studies.",

Males were exposed to lab water (control) or 4% effluent for 14\u202fdays. Effluent exposure did not affect testis size as measured by the gonadosomatic index, but contributed to morphological changes in the seminiferous tubules. The number of cysts with histopathological changes was elevated in effluent-exposed fish and the number of cysts containing spermatids was significantly reduced. The testis of effluent exposed fish had reduced levels of lactate, elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity, increased levels of reactive oxygen species and reduced levels of phosphorylated P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (pP38 MAPK). Separate studies showed that the addition of lactate to testicular tissue incubated in vitro increased the activation of P38 MAPK. Effluent exposure also increased vacuolization, necrosis, apoptosis, hyperemia, and fat infiltration of the hepatocytes. Collectively, we provide evidence of short term effects of pulp mill effluent on testicular and hepatic physiology and biochemistry in the zebrafish.",

Few studies have investigated biological effects of crude oil on lipid metabolism in this species, despite lipids being a crucial compound for Arctic species to adapt to the high seasonality in food abundance in their habitat. This study examines the effects of dietary crude oil exposure on transcription levels of genes related to lipid metabolism (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors [ppar-\u03b1, ppar-\u03b3], retinoic X receptor [rxr-\u03b2], palmitoyl-CoA oxidase [aox1], cytochrome P4507A1 [cyp7\u03b11]), reproduction (vitellogenin [vtg-\u03b2], gonad aromatase [cyp19a1]) and biotransformation (cytochrome P4501A1 [cyp1a1], aryl hydrocarbon receptor [ahr2]). Exposure effects were also examined through plasma chemistry parameters. Additional fish were exposed to a PPAR-\u03b1 agonist (WY-14,643) to investigate the role of PPAR-\u03b1 in their lipid metabolism. The dose-dependent up-regulation of cyp1a1 reflected the activation of genes related to PAH biotransformation upon crude oil exposure. The crude oil exposure did not significantly alter the mRNA expression of genes involved in lipid homeostasis except for cyp7\u03b11 transcription levels. Plasma levels of cholesterol and alanine transaminase showed significant alterations in fish exposed to crude oil at the end of the experiment. WY exposure induced a down-regulation of ppar-\u03b1, an effect contrary to studies performed on other fish species. In conclusion, this study showed clear effects of dietary crude oil exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations on xenobiotic biotransformation but revealed only weak alterations in the lipid metabolism of polar cod.",

The results showed that higher concentration of 0.5\u202fmg/ml had significant maximum mortality at 120\u202fhour post inoculation.

The time course of CrGPx7 mRNA levels in the presence of Cd, Cu and Zn, showed upregulation in the final stages of the experiments, suggesting a role of GPx7 in late protection from oxidative stress. Our in silico analyses of the crgpx7 promoter region revealed putative consensus sequences similar to mammalian metal-responsive elements (MRE) and xenobiotic-responsive elements (XRE), suggesting that the transcription of these genes directly depends on metals.

In honeybees, AChE exists in two forms having different physiological roles, one existing as a soluble form and the other as membrane-bound. In most studies AChE activity has been analysed without paying considerable attention to different forms of AChE. In this study, we exposed honeybees Apis mellifera carnica for 10\u00a0days to diazinon via oral exposure and analysed the total AChE activities in salt soluble (SS) and detergent soluble (DS) fractions. We assumed that SS fraction would preferentially contain the soluble AChE, but the DS fraction would contain only membrane AChE. On the contrary, our results showed that SS and DS fractions both contain soluble and membrane AChE and the latter has considerably higher activity. Despite this we obtained a differential response of AChE activity in SS and DS fractions when exposed to diazinon. The head/thorax AChE activity in DS fraction decreased, while the head/thorax AChE activity in SS fraction increased at sublethal concentrations. The AChE activity in honeybee hemolymph shown here for the first time is a salt soluble enzyme. Its activity remained unaltered after diazinon treatment. In conclusion, we provide evidence that varying results regarding AChE activity alterations upon stressor exposure are obtained when extracted through different procedures. In further environmental studies with honeybees this differential response of AChE activity should be given considerable attention because this affects the outcome of ecotoxicity study.",

From studies of previous oil spills, other marine oil industries, and analyses of oil compositions, it is evident that metals are frequently encountered. Several metals have been reported in the MC252 oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including the nonessential metals aluminum, arsenic, chromium, nickel, and lead; genotoxic metals, such as these are able to damage DNA and can bioaccumulate in organisms resulting in persistent exposure. In the Gulf of Mexico, whales are the apex species; hence we collected skin biopsies from sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), and Bryde's whales (Balaenoptera edeni).

As the aquatic environments represent the ultimate sink for various contaminants, it is highly probable that they also constitute a reservoir for NMs and hence aquatic animals represent potential targets. In a regulatory perspective, it is necessary to develop tools to rapidly screen the impact of NMs on model organisms, given that the number of NMs on the market will be increasing. In this context High Throughput Screening approaches represent relevant tools for the investigation of NM-mediated toxicity. The objective of this work was to study the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs) in the marine bivalve Mytilus edulis, using a transcriptomic approach. Mussels were exposed in vivo to CuONPs (10\u202f\u03bcg\u00b7L\u22121CuO NPs) for 24\u202fh and analysis of mRNA expression levels of genes implicated in immune response, antioxidant activities, cell metabolism, cell transport and cytoskeleton was investigated by qPCR on hemocytes and gills. Results showed common effects of CuONPs and its ionic counterpart. However, greater effects of CuONPs on GST, SOD, MT, Actin, ATP synthase gene expressions were observed compared to ionic form indicating that toxicity of CuONPs is not solely due to the release of Cu2+. Even though M. edulis genome is not fully characterized, this study provides additional knowledge on the signaling pathways implicated in CuONP-mediated toxicity and demonstrates the reliability of using a qPCR approach to go further in the cellular aspects implicated in response to NPs in marine bivalves.",

Mean total clearance (CLT) values determined by non-compartmental analysis of plasma time-course data were 21.8, 27.0 and 19.5\u202fmL/h/kg for the low, medium and high dose groups, respectively.

Branchial elimination rates were much lower than expected, suggesting that IMI is highly bound in blood. Renal clearance rates were greater than measured rates of branchial clearance (60% of CLT in the medium dose group), possibly indicating a role for renal membrane transporters. There was no evidence for hepatic biotransformation of IMI. Collectively, these findings suggest that IMI would accumulate in trout in continuous waterborne exposures.",

Secretion from parotoid macroglands of bufonid toads is a rich source of bioactive compounds with the cytotoxic, cardiotoxic and hemolytic activity.

In the present work, we analysed the cardio-, myo-, and neurotropic activity of extract and the selected proteins from Bufo bufo parotoids in in vitro physiological bioassays carried out on two standard model organisms: beetles and frogs. Our results demonstrate a strong cardioactivity of B. bufo gland extract. The toad poison stimulates (by 16%) the contractility of the insect heart and displays the cardioinhibitory effect on the frog heartbeat frequency (a 27% decrease), coupled with an irreversible cardiac arrest. The gland extract also exhibits significant myotropic properties (a 10% decrease in the muscle contraction force), whereas its neuroactivity remains low (a 4% decrease in the nerve conduction velocity). Among identified peptides present in the B. bufo parotoid extract are serine proteases, muscle creatine kinase, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein, etc. Some proteins contribute to the cardioinhibitory effect. Certain compounds display the paralytic (myo- and neurotropic) properties. As the toad gland extract exhibits a strong cardiotoxic activity, we conclude that the poison is a potent agent capable of slaying a predator. Our results also provide the guides for the use of toad poison-peptides in therapeutics and new drug development.",

     "abstract": "Numerous studies have elucidated the health benefits of organosulfur compounds, known as isothiocyanates (ITCs), derived from cruciferous vegetables. As electrophiles, ITCs have the ability to directly bind and modify thiol-containing compounds such as glutathione and cellular protein, including tubulin. While the biochemical effects of ITCs have been well characterized, less information is available regarding their effects on the accumulation of stress-inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), heat shock proteins (HSPs) and the possible formation of aggregated protein due to thiol modification. The present study has examined the effect of the ITCs, benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), on the accumulation of HO-1, HSP70 and HSP30 in Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that both BITC and PEITC induced the accumulation of HO-1 and HSP70 whereas HSP30 levels were enhanced only in cells treated with BITC. Immunocytochemistry determined that ITC treatment induced F-actin disorganization and membrane ruffling and enhanced accumulation of HO-1 in the cytoplasm. Additionally, BITC induced enhanced levels of ubiquitinated protein, aggregated protein, and the collapse and fragmentation of microtubules. In comparison, treatment of cells with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, induced the accumulation of all three stress proteins, aggregated protein and aggresome-like structures. Finally, cells pretreated with BITC inhibited the formation of MG132-induced aggresome-like structures in the perinuclear region. This latter finding suggests that BITC-induced microtubule fragmentation may impede the movement of aggregated protein via microtubules and their subsequent coalescence into aggresome-like structures in the perinuclear region.",

GST, \u03b1- and \u03b2-esterase activities were affected in Rock exposed at the highest CFEO concentration, this concentration also modified \u03b2-esterases activity of WSant. DPPA and CFEO sublethal doses induced inhibition of AChE activity on untreated larvae homogenate from 12 to 20% and 18 to 26%, respectively. For untreated adult homogenate, the inhibition activity raised up to 14 to 27% for DPPA and 26 to 34% for CFEO. Elevated levels of detoxifying enzymes, found when CFEO was evaluated, showed a larval sensitivity not observed by the pure compound suggesting that DPPA, contrary to CFEO, was not recognized, transformed or eliminated by the evaluated detoxifying enzymes.",

To address this objective, fathead minnow larvae were exposed to fulvestrant (ICI 182,780) during the window of sexual differentiation between 0 to 30 days post-hatch (dph). The four treatment groups in this study included: filtered water controls (never exposed), solvent controls (ethanol 0.01%), and nominally low (0.10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and high (10.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L) doses of fulvestrant. Following 30 d exposure to their respective treatment, larvae were transferred to filtered water aquaria and assessed for alterations in endocrine-responsive gene expression (i.e., RT-qPCR), body size and survival. The remaining fish depurated in filtered water until reaching sexual maturity (180\u00a0dph) for assessment of persistent effects on sex characteristics, reproductive performance and sex ratio. Following the 30-d early life exposure, larvae showed upregulations of the endocrine-responsive genes ar, er\u03b2 and vtg in response to both low and high doses of fulvestrant, but showed no differences in survival or body mass. Upon reaching sexual maturity under depuration conditions, male minnows previously exposed to fulvestrant as larvae showed reductions in gonad mass along with the feminization of secondary sex characteristics with no observed effects in females. Exposure to fulvestrant had no effects on gonadal histology, reproductive performance or final sex ratio as adults. Results from this study demonstrate that aqueous exposure to fulvestrant is estrogenic in fathead minnow larvae and is capable of feminizing male fish as adults following early life exposure.",

ASA reduced the levels of prostaglandin E2, but had no effect on the concentration of 11-ketotestosterone and vitellogenin.Overall, ASA decrease prostaglandin E2 concentrations, but well-established endpoints for endocrine disruption in zebrafish are generally not affected by aquatic exposure neither during development nor adulthood.

Recent research suggests that early life exposure to PAHs can affect health outcomes later in life. Some of these latent responses may be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. The role of DNA methylation in regulating responses to PAHs in birds is currently unknown. Here, we assess the effect of in ovo exposure to the model PAH, benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), on aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) mediated cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) gene expression and promoter methylation in chicken embryos. Fertilized chicken eggs were injected with BkF (0\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) prior to incubation. BkF exposure was associated with an increase in CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 mRNA levels at mid-incubation (embryonic day 10), which dropped to baseline levels towards the end of the incubation period (embryonic day 19). The transient induction in CYP1A expression was accompanied by small but significant increases in CYP1A promoter methylation, which persisted until after shortly after hatching. Methylation within the CYP1A promoter was correlated with levels of CYP1A5, but not CYP1A4 mRNA. Characterization of the role of DNA methylation in the AHR response pathway may increase our understanding of the effects of early life exposure to PAHs in birds.",

Since lipophilic PAHs solubilize in micelles composed of lipids, bile salts and fatty acids, dietary lipid composition can alter intestinal transepithelial PAH transfer. We studied the uptake of two PAHs, viz. benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) and phenanthrene (PHE), in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine. We also investigated the effects of two fatty acids, viz. fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and vegetable oil-derived oleic acid (18:1n-9) on intestinal uptake. Radiolabeled PAHs were solubilized in micelles composed of tritiated EPA and oleic acid, respectively, and administrated to intestinal segments mounted in Ussing chambers.In the absence of micelles, PHE accumulation was two times higher than BaP in the mucosal and serosal layers of proximal and distal intestine. Administration of PHE in micelles composed of oleic acid resulted in a 50% lower accumulation of PHE in the mucosal layers of the proximal intestine compared to EPA-composed micelles. Accumulation of EPA and oleic acid in the proximal intestinal mucosa correlated negatively with the transepithelial transfer of these fatty acids across the proximal intestinal epithelium. Transepithelial PHE transfer across the proximal intestine was reduced by 30% in co-exposure with EPA-composed micelles compared to 80% with oleic acid micelles. BaP was not transferred across the intestine.We conclude that the lipid composition of an aquafeed is an important determinant of PAH bioavailability. Therefore, lipid composition should be an important consideration in choosing vegetable oils as alternatives for fish oil in aquafeeds.",

Furthermore, scarce information is available on how marine organisms respond to the presence of pollutants after exposure to heat stress conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to understand how the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis responds to Hg pollution after pre-exposure to warming conditions. Mussels were exposed to control (17\u00a0\u00b0C) and warming (21\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions during 14\u00a0days, followed by Hg contamination during 28\u00a0days under different temperature regimes (17 and 21\u00a0\u00b0C). The results obtained demonstrated significantly higher Hg concentrations in mussels under 17\u00a0\u00b0C during the entire experiment than in organisms exposed to 21\u00a0\u00b0C during the same period, which resulted in higher oxidative stress in mussels under control temperature. Significantly higher Hg concentrations were also observed in mussels pre-exposed to 21\u00a0\u00b0C followed by a 17\u00a0\u00b0C exposure comparing with organisms maintained the entire experiment at 21\u00a0\u00b0C. These results may be explained by higher metabolic capacity in organisms exposed to 17\u00a0\u00b0C after pre-exposure to 21\u00a0\u00b0C that although induced antioxidant defences were not enough to prevent oxidative stress. No significant differences in terms of Hg concentration were found between mussels exposed to 17\u00a0\u00b0C during the entire experiment and organisms pre-exposed to 21\u00a0\u00b0C followed by a 17\u00a0\u00b0C exposure, leading to similar oxidative stress levels in mussels exposed to both conditions. Therefore, our findings demonstrated that pre-exposure to warming conditions did not change mussels' accumulation and tolerance to Hg in comparison to Hg contaminated mussels maintained at control temperature. Furthermore, the present study indicate that organisms maintained under warming conditions for long periods may prevent the accumulation of pollutants by decreasing their metabolism which will limit cellular injuries.Mussels under warming conditions presented reduced metabolic capacity, resulting in lower Hg accumulation, which in turn prevented higher damages and, consequently, physiological impairments.",

To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of metabolic resistance to insecticides, a chlorpyrifos-resistant (CR) strain of N. lugens was selected and its possible resistance mechanism was investigated. Synergistic tests using carboxylesterases (CarEs) inhibitor triphenyl phosphate (TPP) decreased the resistance of N. lugens to chlorpyrifos, and CarE activities could be induced by low concentrations of chlorpyrifos. Subsequently, a gene putatively encoding CarE, namely NlCarE, predominant in the midgut and ovary was isolated and characterized. The expression levels of NlCarE were detected and compared between the CR and a susceptible (SS) strain of N. lugens. Consistent with the increased CarE activity, this gene was overexpressed in the CR strain compared to the SS strain. The transcript levels of NlCarE were up-regulated by chlorpyrifos exposure, showing dose- and time-dependent expression patterns. Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of NlCarE followed by insecticide application significantly increased the susceptibility of N. lugens to chlorpyrifos. These results demonstrate that NlCarE plays an important role in chlorpyrifos detoxification and its overexpression may be involved in chlorpyrifos resistance in N. lugens.",

Size and anatomical constraints (i.e. small and complex) led us to develop and optimize a cyto-biochemical method to measure Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase activity in earthworms. The principal site of enzyme activity was found to be the post clitellar intestinal tract; immunohistochemistry then identified plasma membrane Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase (PMCA ATPase) in the apical area of the intestinal epithelium. Earthworms exposed for 28\u00a0days to OECD soil contaminated with 1, 2, and 15\u00a0mg/Kg Cr(VI) demonstrated about 70% inhibition of Ca2\u00a0+-ATPase activity at the low Cr (VI) concentration (the half of the Italian law limit for residential areas), rising to approximately 84% inhibition at the highest concentration. Reduced enzyme activity was accompanied by decreased enzyme content and reduced lysosomal membrane stability (LMS), which is a well established early warning biomarker of stress.

Four weeks after the beginning of experiments, cadmium accumulation in earthworm bodies was significantly lower at 6\u00a0\u00b0C than at room temperature. The numbers of restored cells and fluorophore contents were hardly affected by temperature or cadmium.

For this aim, plant-based (natural pesticides, azadirachtin (AZA)) and synthetic pesticides (deltamethrin (DLM)) were exposed on the fish at different concentrations (0.0005 and 0.00025\u00a0ppm of DLM; 0.24 and 0.12\u00a0ppm of AZA) for 21 days.According to the results of the study, the activity of SOD, CAT and GPx decreased, but malondialdehyde (MDA) level and activity of 8-OHdG increased in the gill and liver of rainbow trout (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally sod, cat and gpx were down regulated; HSP70 and CYP1A were up regulated for transcriptional observation. The downwards regulation of antioxidant (sod, cat and gpx) and the upregulation of HSP70 and CYP1A was obvious with doses of AZA or DLM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The findings of this study suggest that biopesticide can cause biochemical and physiological effects in the fish gill and liver by causing enzyme inhibition, an increase in 8-OHdG levels and changes in both transcriptional parameters (sod, cat, gpx, HSP70 and CYP1A). We found that excessive doses of plant-based pesticide are nearly as toxic as chemical ones for aquatic organisms. Moreover, 8-OHdG, HSP70 and CYP1A used as a biomarker to determinate toxicity mechanism of biopesticide in aquatic environment.",

To further investigate cadmium (Cd) toxicity on the H-P-I axis and to identify its potential regulatory genes in fish, the adult female rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to subchronic (5\u00a0weeks) levels of waterborne Cd in the present study. This kind of treatment caused dose-dependent decline in fish growth, with significance in the high dose group (100\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Correspondingly, low dose (5\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg/L) waterborne Cd disrupted the endocrine system of H-P-I axis just at the secretion level, while high dose Cd disrupted both the secretion and synthesis of cortisol and its downstream signals in rare minnows, revealed by the significantly upregulation and positive correlation of corticosteroidogenic genes including MC2R, StAR, CYP11A1, and CYP11B1 in the kidney (including the interrenal tissue) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the significant alteration of Glcci1, Hsp90AA and Hsp90AB in the hepatopancreas, gill and intestine as well (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The expression of Glcci1 was significantly decreased in hepatopancreas, gill and intestine of tested fish following treatment, and its positive correlation with GR (Glucocorticoid receptor) suggested its potential regulation on the cortisol and/or H-P-I axis in fish. The expression of FKBP5 in the intestine was positively and significantly correlated with that of Hsp90AA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the Hsp90AB transcript in the hepatopancreas was positively correlated with that of Hsp90AA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which indicated that Hsp90AA and Hsp90AB were more likely to serve as cofactors of GR and FKBP5 in response to Cd exposure.",

This phenotype promotes a high degree of protection against xenobiotics. The present study provides a better understanding of the MXR activity in the podal disk cells of Bunodosoma cangicum exposed to copper, and further establishes the relationship between protein activity (measured by accumulation of rhodamine-B) and bioaccumulation of copper in these cells. Sea anemone cells were exposed for 24\u00a0h to copper (0, 7.8 and 15.6\u00a0\u03bcg/L) in presence and absence of MXR blocker (verapamil 50\u00a0\u03bcM). Results indicate that copper exposure increases intracellular metal content when ABC proteins were blocked, causing an increase in cellular death. The present study also verified the relationship between MXR activity, ATP depletion, and general metabolic activity (by MTT). MXR activity decreased in treatment groups exposed to copper concentrations of 15.6\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 10\u00a0mM energy depleting potassium cyanide. Metabolic activity increased in cells exposed to 7.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cu/L, but 15.6\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cu/L was similar to 0 and 7.8\u00a0\u03bcg/L. The presence of copper decreased the ABC proteins expression. The present study improves the knowledge of MXR in anemone cells and shows that this activity is closely associated with copper extrusion. Also, the copper exposure is able to modify the metabolic state and to lead to cytotoxicity when cells cannot defend themselves.",

     "abstract": "In spring, frogs from temperate regions are faced with arousal-induced oxidative stress and exposure to various xenobiotics from the environment. The question is whether pollutants can significantly modify the antioxidative defense system (AOS) response of hibernators during recovery from hibernation. If this assumption is true, we would then expect different patterns of seasonal variations in the AOS between individuals exposed to different levels of pollution. To examine this assumption, we determined the relationship between seasonal variations of accumulated metals and AOS parameters in the skin and muscle of two frog species from the Pelophylax esculentus complex (P. ridibundus and P. esculentus) inhabiting two localities (the Danube-Tisza-Danube canal and the Ponjavica River) with different levels of pollution during pre- and post-hibernation periods, respectively autumn and spring. Our results showed that even though there were differences in the concentrations of accumulated metals and AOS parameters between localities and species, the frogs displayed almost the same patterns of AOS variations during seasons, with a higher AOS response observed in spring. The parameters SH groups, GSH, GR and SOD had been contributed most rather than others. Our findings indicate that oxidative stress during the post-hibernation period was mainly caused by the organisms' recovery from hibernation, as the result of natural selection acting on the AOS, and that the accumulated metals did not significantly modify the AOS response. The present study provides new insight into the biological and physiological cellular responses of frogs to arousal stress.",

The aim of this study was to indicate the effects of typical PPCPs on the marsh frog Pelophylax ridibundus. We treated male frogs with waterborne ibuprofen (IBU, 250\u00a0ng\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01), triclosan (TCS, 500\u00a0ng\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01), or estrone (E1, 100\u00a0ng\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01) for 14\u00a0days. Common vulnerability of the frogs was detected from dramatic decrease of Zn, total and metalated metallothionein (MT) concentrations, Zn/Cu ratio, the elevation of activity of glutathione-S-transferase, cathepsin D and DNA instability in the liver, the depletion of cholinesterase in the brain and cortisol in the blood plasma in all exposures. Nevertheless, lipofuscin concentration in the liver was always decreased. The groups were best distinguished by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity determined by ELISA. The exposure to IBU caused lesser damage, but elevated the levels of oxyradicals and glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and lysosomal membrane instability. Exposures to TCS and E1 provoked the endocrine disturbance (increased levels of vitellogenin and thyrotropin in blood plasma), decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and increased level of pyruvate in the liver. TCS caused the increase of GSSG by 7.3 times and lactate levels. Only E1 lead to decrease of deiodinase activity in the liver, activation of CYP450 and caspase-3 and efflux of cathepsin D from lysosomes. Spectrophotometric and ELISA assays of MTs and CYP450 gave distinct results in E1-group. Broad disruption of the hormonal pathways caused by E1 could be of concern for the health status of frogs in their habitats.",

     "abstract": "A paradigm of venom research is adaptive evolution of toxins as part of a predator-prey chemical arms race. This study examined differential co-factor dependence, variations relative to dietary preference, and the impact upon relative neutralisation by antivenom of the procoagulant toxins in the venoms of a clade of Australian snakes. All genera were characterised by venoms rich in factor Xa which act upon endogenous prothrombin. Examination of toxin sequences revealed an extraordinary level of conservation, which indicates that adaptive evolution is not a feature of this toxin type. Consistent with this, the venoms did not display differences on the plasma of different taxa. Examination of the prothrombin target revealed endogenous blood proteins are under extreme negative selection pressure for diversification, this in turn puts a strong negative selection pressure upon the toxins as sequence diversification could result in a drift away from the target. Thus this study reveals that adaptive evolution is not a consistent feature in toxin evolution in cases where the target is under negative selection pressure for diversification. Consistent with this high level of toxin conservation, the antivenom showed extremely high-levels of cross-reactivity. There was however a strong statistical correlation between relative degree of phospholipid-dependence and clotting time, with the least dependent venoms producing faster clotting times than the other venoms even in the presence of phospholipid. The results of this study are not only of interest to evolutionary and ecological disciplines, but also have implications for clinical toxinology.",

There are multiple venomous species of them in Argentina, but their overall venom composition is poorly known. Lately, several cases of envenomation have been reported in the Misiones province, Northeastern Argentina. Thus, this work aimed to compare the protein composition, and the enzymatic properties of bristle extracts from caterpillars belonging to the families Megalopygidae (Podalia ca. fuscescens) and Saturniidae (Leucanella memusae and Lonomia obliqua) - the most common causative agents of accidents in Misiones -, and additionally to test their cross-reactivity with the L. obliqua antivenom produced in Brazil. Saturniidae venoms exhibited striking similarity in both their electrophoretic protein profile, and antigenic cross-reactivity. All venoms degraded azocasein \u2013 with the highest proteolytic activity observed in the P. ca. fuscescens bristle extract \u2013, and hyaluronic acid, but the latter at low levels. Lonomia obliqua venom exhibited the highest level of phospholipase A2 activity. Bristle extracts from P. ca. fuscescens and L. obliqua both degraded human fibrin(ogen) and shortened the clotting time triggered by calcium, while L. memusae venom inhibited plasma coagulation. Proteins related to the coagulation disturbance were identified by mass spectrometry in all samples. Altogether, our findings show for the first time a comparative biotoxinological analysis of three genera of caterpillars with medical relevance. Moreover, this study provides relevant information about the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby these caterpillar bristle extracts can induce toxicity on human beings, and gives insight into future directions for research on them.",

Fish performance, biochemical variables, and oxidative stress enzymes were significantly affected by propolis supplementation, BPA exposure, and their interaction. Propolis supplementation significantly improved fish growth and feed intake, which were significantly retarded by BPA exposure. Additionally, total protein, albumin, globulin, and acetylcholine esterase (AChE) decreased significantly. Meanwhile aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatinine, and uric acid increased significantly with exposure to BPA. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities increased significantly due to BPA exposure, whereas significant reductions in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) were also recorded compared to the control fish. It is noticed that EEP co-administration ameliorated these parameters. The present results evoked that propolis administration improves fish growth and alleviated BPA-induced toxicity.",

These impairments often affect hormone functions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRRIs) are increasingly studied with regards to their endocrine disrupting effects on teleost physiological processes, including reproduction. To examine whether FLX effects on the endocrine regulation of reproductive physiology in goldfish are sex-specific, we exposed sexually recrudescent female goldfish to two waterborne concentrations of FLX (0.54\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 54\u00a0\u03bcg/L) using an experimental design previously used for sexually mature male goldfish. To evaluate possible endocrine disrupting effects, we quantified the gonadosomatic index, circulating hormone concentrations (luteinizing hormone, LH; growth hormone, GH; 17-\u03b2 estradiol, E2; and testosterone, T), and the expression of isotocin and vasotocin in the telencephalon, gonadotropin subunits and GH in the pituitary, and gonadotropin receptors, GH receptors, and aromatase in the ovary. Female goldfish exposed to 0.54\u00a0\u03bcg/L FLX exhibited a significant decrease in circulating E2, and conversely, a significant increase in circulating LH and ovarian aromatase mRNA levels, suggesting disruption of E2-mediated feedback on LH release. These results, when compared with those previously observed in males, reveal that waterborne exposure to environmentally relevant levels of FLX sex-specifically disrupts the reproductive endocrine axis in goldfish, characterized by a decrease in E2 in females, and conversely, estrogen-like effects in males. These data emphasize the importance of studying the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals on both sexes.",

Based on GC/MS metabolomics analysis, 101 metabolites were observably significantly altered in the 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L IMZ-treatment group. These changed metabolites were mainly associated with the pathway of glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, and lipid metabolism.

All analyzed parameters in male flies were not significantly affected by atrazine exposure. However female flies exposed to atrazine at 10\u00a0\u03bcM presented an increase in immobility time and a reduction in exploratory activity in the open field test, which was offset by an increase in the number of grooming episodes. Also, female flies exposed to 100\u00a0\u03bcM of atrazine presented an increase in immobility time. Gene expression of DOPA decarboxylase and dopamine (DA) receptors were also increased only in females. The behavioural effects of atrazine exposure observed in female flies were due to a disturbance in the dopaminergic system.",

In this study, we identified an Asiatic honeybee (A. cerana) venom serine protease inhibitor (AcVSPI) that was shown to act as a microbial serine protease inhibitor and plasmin inhibitor. AcVSPI was found to consist of a trypsin inhibitor-like domain that displays ten cysteine residues. Interestingly, the AcVSPI peptide sequence exhibited high similarity to the putative low-molecular-weight serine protease inhibitor Api m 6, which suggests that AcVSPI is an allergen Api m 6-like peptide. Recombinant AcVSPI was expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells, and it demonstrated inhibitory activity against trypsin, but not chymotrypsin. Additionally, AcVSPI has inhibitory effects against plasmin and microbial serine proteases; however, it does not have any detectable inhibitory effects on thrombin or elastase. Consistent with these inhibitory effects, AcVSPI inhibited the plasmin-mediated degradation of fibrin to fibrin degradation products. AcVSPI also bound to bacterial and fungal surfaces and exhibited anti-microbial activity against fungi as well as gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

     "abstract": "Metal pollutants have been considered one of the main factors underlying the depletion of biodiversity in natural populations unbalancing aquatic environments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exposure to inorganic Hg on myocardial contractility and the electrocardiogram (ECG) of two ecologically distinct Neotropical fish species, namely: matrinx\u00e3 (Brycon amazonicus) and trahira (Hoplias malabaricus). Matrinx\u00e3s were exposed to a sublethal concentration of 0.1\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Hg in water for 96\u00a0h. Trahiras were exposed to dietary Hg doses (0.45\u00a0mg of Hg, each 4\u00a0days, for 30\u00a0days) using juvenile B. amazonicus as the prey vehicle. Hg exposures decreased myocardial isometric twitch force development, harmed contraction/relaxation dynamics and cardiac pumping capacity (CPC), and reduced the relative contribution of the calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to excitation contraction (EC) coupling in both fish species. Analysis of the ECG revealed that Hg impaired electrical conduction across the heart, inducing first degree atrioventricular block and lengthening the plateau phase of action potential duration. In trahira trophic doses of Hg induced a marked bradycardia, increasing the duration of the ventricular action potential and delaying atrial and ventricular depolarization. These findings indicate that both acute and long-term Hg exposure, by different routes is cardiotoxic to matrinx\u00e3 and trahira. Hg potently impaired intracellular calcium kinetics in the cardiomyocytes, myocardium contractility, and electrical conduction across the heart, all of which can be implicated in decreased cardiac output and putative heart failure.",

Released into the marine environment, some of these drugs can have negative impact on non-targeted crustaceans in the vicinity of farming facilities. In this study, we examined the molecular effect of the insecticide teflubenzuron on a shrimp species inhabiting the littoral zone, the rockpool shrimp (Palaemon elegans). Rockpool shrimp was exposed for 98\u00a0days to a dose representing 2% of a regular teflubenzuron medication applied to Atlantic salmon. Accumulation of teflubenzuron was studied in whole body samples, except abdominal segments 5 and 6, which were used for gene expression analysis. Insight into sublethal mode of action was sought by examining the transcriptional responses of 38 genes encoding proteins linked to molting and exoskeleton change, stress and detoxification. The accumulated levels of teflubenzuron in exposed animals varied between 1.7 and 33.0\u00a0ng/g. Significant transcriptional effects of exposure were seen for markers linked to molting and exoskeleton change (chh, ctbs, gap65), stress and apoptosis (hsp40, hsp70, casp3), as well for detoxification (cyp6a18). In conclusion, this study shows that teflubenzuron can bioaccumulate in shrimps living in the littoral zone and at sublethal concentrations affects molecular mechanisms in non-hepatopancreatic tissue.",

Incubation of PC12 cells with 1\u00a0\u03bcM PERM for 72\u00a0h, leads to over expression of Nurr1 gene. This effect occurs with both corn oil and extra virgin olive oil (EVO) used to solubilize the toxicant.

RT-PCR of Nurr1 showed that its up-regulation was significantly reduced in the presence of antioxidants, especially by addition of ERW.

In teleost fish crude oil exposure, with the associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's), reduces exercise performance and this has been hypothesized to be due to compromised cardiovascular function. In this study, we test this hypothesis by simultaneously measuring cardiovascular performance, oxygen consumption, and swim performance in a pelagic teleost, the cobia (Rachycentron canadum). Metabolic rate increased over 300% in both groups during the swim trial but as the fish approached the critical swim speed (Ucrit) MO2 was 12% lower in the oil exposed fish. Further, stroke volume was initially 35% lower while heart rate was 15% higher in the oil exposed compared to control fish. Our findings suggested, while aspects of cardiovascular and metabolic function are altered by oil exposure, additional studies are needed to further understand the homeostatic mechanisms that may sustain cardiovascular function at higher exercise intensities in cobia.",

Among aquatic invertebrate models in ecotoxicology, the copepods are considered as reference species in marine, estuarine and freshwater ecosystems. In this context, we identified a VTG cDNA in Eurytemora affinis. The Ea-VTG2 cDNA is 5416\u00a0bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 5310\u00a0bp that encodes a putative protein of 1769 amino acids residues. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the hypothesis of a VTG duplication event before the emergence of the copepod species. The analysis of the Ea-VTG2 expression by qPCR in males and females according to their reproductive stages allowed transcript basal levels to be determined. The expression pattern revealed a gradual increase of transcript levels during maturation in females. Important inter-sex differences were observed with a VTG level in males ranging from about 1900- to 6800-fold lower than in females depending on their stage. Moreover, the protein was only detected in ovigerous females. The inducibility of Ea-VTG2 by chemicals was studied in males exposed to either a model of endocrine disruptor in vertebrates i.e. 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) or a crustacean hormone i.e. Methyl Farnesoate (MF), and in males sampled from a multi-contaminated estuary. No induction was highlighted. The VTG should not be considered as an appropriate biomarker in E. affinis as previously suggested for other crustaceans.",

This study was initiated to provide a better understanding of carboxylesterase-mediated resistance mechanism in a tephritid pest fly. Here, we narrow this research gap by demonstrating a well-conserved esterase B1 gene, BdB1, mediates malathion resistance development via gene upregulation with the use of a laboratory selected malathion-resistant strain (MR) of B. dorsalis. No sequence mutation of BdB1 was detected between MR and the susceptible strain (MS) of B. dorsalis. BdB1 is predominantly expressed in the midgut, a key insect tissue for detoxification. As compared with transcripts in MS, BdB1 was significantly more abundant in multiple tissues in the MR. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of BdB1 significantly increased malathion susceptibility. Furthermore, heterologous expression along with cytotoxicity assay revealed BdB1 could probably have the function of malathion detoxification.",

     "abstract": "Invasive sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations in the Great Lakes are controlled by applying the piscicide, 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), to infested streams with larval sea lamprey (ammocoetes). While treatment mortality is >\u00a090%, surviving lamprey, called residuals, can undermine control efforts. A key determinant of TFM effectiveness is water pH, which can fluctuate daily and seasonally in surface waters. The objectives of this research were to evaluate the influence of pH on the uptake, elimination, and accumulation of TFM by larval sea lamprey using radio-labeled TFM (14C-TFM), when exposed to a nominal concentration of 4.6\u00a0mg\u00a0TFM\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 or 7.6\u00a0mg\u00a0TFM\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, 3\u00a0h or 1\u00a0h, respectively. TFM uptake rates were approximately 5.5-fold greater at low pH (6.86) compared to the high pH (8.78), most likely due to the unionized, lipophilic form of TFM existing in greater amounts at a lower pH. In contrast, elimination rates following the injection of 85\u00a0nmol\u00a0TFM\u00a0g\u2212\u00a01 body mass were 1.7\u20131.8 fold greater at pH\u00a08.96 than at pH\u00a06.43 during 2\u20134\u00a0h of depuration in TFM-free water. Greater initial excretion rates at pH\u00a08.96 were presumably due to predicted increases in outward concentration gradients of un-ionized TFM. The present findings suggest that TFM is mainly taken-up in its un-ionized form, more lipophilic form, but there is also significant uptake of the ionized form of TFM via an unknown mechanism. Moreover, we provide an explanation to how small increases in pH can undermine lampricide treatment success increasing residual lamprey populations.",

So far, no toxicity of Jaburetox to mammals has been shown. Previous reports have identified biochemical targets of this toxic peptide in insect models, although its mechanism of action is not completely understood. In this work, we aimed to characterize the effects of Jaburetox in hemolymphatic insect cells. For this purpose, the model insect and Chagas' disease vector Rhodnius prolixus was used. In vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that Jaburetox interacts with a subset of hemocytes and it can be found in various subcellular compartments. In insects injected with Jaburetox there was an increase in the gene expression of the enzymes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP), chitin synthase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nevertheless, the expression of NOS protein, the enzyme activities of UAP and acid phosphatase (a possible link between UAP and NOS) as well as the phosphorylation state of proteins remained unchanged upon the in vivo Jaburetox treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) imaging using fluorescent probes showed that Jaburetox augmented NO production in the hemocyte aggregates when compared to controls. Even though Jaburetox activated the hemocytes, as demonstrated by wheat germ agglutinin binding assays, the peptide did not lead to an increase of their phagocytic behavior. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of toxic effects of Jaburetox, a peptide with biotechnological applications and a prospective tool for rational insect control.",

We have investigated cadmium accumulation in the feces, head and integument of Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) larvae exposed to chronic dietary intake of cadmium. The aim of the experiment was to establish modalities of metal accumulation, primarily cadmium, as well as changes in fitness traits in two insect populations receiving 50 or 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Cd/g dry food. The egg-masses originated from two localities: a protected nature reserve (unpolluted population) and an area near a busy highway (polluted population) in Serbia. At both added dietary levels cadmium concentration was highest in feces. Small alterations in metal concentrations after both cadmium treatments were detected in the integument. It was established that irrespective of population origin, the modality of decline of larval mass and relative growth rate (RGR) was similar. Concentrations of Cu and Zn in the integument were approximately the same regardless of dietary cadmium intake. However, cadmium accumulation in the examined tissues, as well as variability of fitness traits depended on population origin and cadmium concentration. In larvae from both populations not given contaminated food the head was the organ with the greatest accumulation of trace elements. Our results reveal how invasive phytophagous insects cope with high metal concentrations in their food by body mass (RGR) reduction and energy allocation towards processes that enable accumulation of cadmium and other trace elements in different tissues.",

Physical activity, temperature, gastrointestinal parasitic worm abundance, relative spleen mass, plasma thyroid hormone levels and liver concentrations of POPs were determined; field metabolic rate (FMR) was used as a measure of DEE. For females, FMR was best explained by the percent of time spent in nest-site attendance and exposure to temperatures below their lower critical limit (65% of variation); 32% was also explained by relative spleen mass. In males, FMR was best explained by the number of hours spent in nest site attendance and either relative spleen mass or liver concentrations of tetra-brominated diphenyl ethers (tetra-BDEs) (55% of variation). Relative spleen mass, as an important factor relating to FMR, was best explained by models with a combination of parasite abundance (Diplostomum for females and Eucoleus for males) in a negative relationship, and liver POP concentrations (p,p\u2032-DDE for females and tetra-BDEs for males) in a positive relationship (34%, 55% of variation for females and males, respectively).

There is, however, scarce information on the type and role that different MXR transporters may have in embryos, which represent the most sensitive stages of bivalves to environmental stress. In this study regulation of MXR-related transporters was investigated in early developmental stages of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis). In vitro fertilization experiments using gametes from naturally-spawning broodstocks were performed to follow embryo development from fertilized eggs (30\u00a0min post fertilization, pf) to fully developed D-shape veligers (48\u00a0h\u00a0pf). Quantitative PCR analyses indicated that ABCB and ABCC transcripts encoding the MXR-related transporters P-glycoproteins (P-gp) and Multidrug resistance proteins (Mrp), respectively, were expressed soon after 30\u00a0min\u00a0pf, with ABCC being more expressed than ABCB. Copy numbers of both transcripts were increased in trochophorae and D-veligers. MXR efflux activity assessed using the fluorescent substrate rhodamine 123 and selective P-gp or Mrp inhibitors showed that the P-gp mediated efflux was detected only in D-veligers, while a significant Mrp mediated efflux was detected soon after 30\u00a0min\u00a0pf and remained almost unchanged in trochophorae and D-veligers. MXR modulation by propranolol and carbamazepine showed that the pharmaceuticals may act as transcriptional regulators and substrates. Results reported lead to hypothesize that while P-gp aids in xenobiotic efflux performing a prominent protective role, Mrp could be a dual-functioning transporter performing both protective and physiological functions in mussel development.",

     "abstract": "The zebrafish has become a commonly used vertebrate model for toxicity assessment, of particular relevance to the study of toxic effects on the visual system because of the structural similarities shared by zebrafish and human retinae. In this article we present a colour preference-based technique that, by assessing the functionality of photoreceptors, can be used to evaluate the effects of toxicity on behaviour. A digital camera was used to record the locomotor behaviour of individual zebrafish swimming in a water tank consisting of two compartments separated by an opaque perforated wall through which the fish could pass. The colour of the lighting in each compartment could be altered independently (producing distinct but connected environments of white, red or blue) to allow association of the zebrafish's swimming behaviour with its colour preference. The functionality of the photoreceptors was evaluated based on the ability of the zebrafish to sense the different colours and to swim between the compartments. The zebrafish tracking was carried out using our algorithm developed with MATLAB. We found that zebrafish preferred blue illumination to white, and white illumination to red. Acute treatment with acrylamide (2\u00a0mM for 36\u00a0h) resulted in a marked reduction in locomotion and a concomitant loss of colour-preferential swimming behaviour. Histopathological examination of acrylamide-treated zebrafish eyes showed that acrylamide exposure had caused retinal damage. The colour preference tracking technique has applications in the assessment of neurodegenerative disorders, as a method for preclinical appraisal of drug efficacy and for behavioural evaluation of toxicity.",

     "abstract": "The extensive use of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) in many applications has raised concerns over their toxicity on environment and human health. Herein, the embryotoxicity of CuO NPs was assessed in the black sea urchin Arbacia lixula, an intertidal species commonly present in the Mediterranean. Fertilized eggs were exposed to 0.7, 10 and 20\u00a0ppb of CuO NPs, until pluteus stage. Interferences with the normal neurotransmission pathways were observed in sea urchin embryos. In detail, evidence of cholinergic and serotoninergic systems affection was revealed by dose-dependent decreased levels of choline and N-acetyl serotonin, respectively, measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics, applied for the first time to our knowledge on sea urchin embryos. The metabolic profile also highlighted a significant CuO NP dose-dependent increase of glycine, a component of matrix proteins involved in the biomineralization process, suggesting perturbed skeletogenesis accordingly to skeletal defects in spicule patterning observed previously in the same sea urchin embryos. However, the expression of skeletogenic genes, i.e. SM30 and msp130, did not differ among groups, and therefore altered primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) migration was hypothesized. Other unknown metabolites were detected from the NMR spectra, and their concentrations found to be reflective of the CuO NP exposure levels. Overall, these findings demonstrate the toxic potential of CuO NPs to interfere with neurotransmission and skeletogenesis of sea urchin embryos. The integrated use of embryotoxicity tests and metabolomics represents a highly sensitive and effective tool for assessing the impact of NPs on aquatic biota.",

     "abstract": "Metal regulation is essential for terrestrial gastropods to survive. In helicid snails, two metal-selective metallothionein (MT) isoforms with different functions are expressed. A cadmium-selective isoform (CdMT) plays a major role in Cd2\u00a0+ detoxification and stress response, whereas a copper-selective MT (CuMT) is involved in Cu homeostasis and hemocyanin synthesis. A third, non-metal-selective isoform, called Cd/CuMT, was first characterized in Cantareus aspersus. The aim of this study was to quantify the transcriptional activity of all three MT genes in unexposed and metal-exposed (Cd, Cu) embryonic Roman snails. In addition, the complete Cd/CuMT mRNA of the Roman snail (Helix pomatia) was characterized, and its expression quantified in unexposed and Cd-treated adult individuals. In embryos of Helix pomatia, the Cd/CuMT gene was induced upon Cu exposure. Its transcription levels were many times higher than that of the other two MT genes, and also exceeded by far the Cd/CuMT mRNA concentrations of adult snails. In the hepatopancreas of adult Roman snails, no Cd/CuMT could be detected at the protein level, irrespective of whether the snails had been exposed to Cd or not. This contrasts with the situation in the near relative, Cantareus aspersus. It appeared that the 3\u2032-UTR of the Cd/CuMT mRNA differed largely between Cantareus aspersus and Helix pomatia, being larger in the latter species, with a number of putative binding sites for proteins and miRNAs known to inhibit mRNA translation. We suggest this as a possible mechanism responsible for the lack of Cd/CuMT protein expression in adult Roman snails.",

Due to the difficulty in obtaining stranded specimens of this endangered species, an indirect approach, by skin biopsies was used for the evaluation of the whale shark ecotoxicological status. The levels of organochlorine compounds (PCBs, DDTs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) plastic additives, and related biomarkers responses (CYP1A) were investigated for the first time in the whale shark. Twelve whale shark skin biopsy samples were collected in January 2014 in La Paz Bay (BCS, Mexico) and a preliminary investigation on microplastic concentration and polymer composition was also carried out in seawater samples from the same area. The average abundance pattern for the target contaminants was PCBs\u00a0>\u00a0DDTs\u00a0>\u00a0PBDEs\u00a0>\u00a0HCB.

In this work, the effects of waterborne exposure of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) to PVP/PEI coated Ag NPs (~\u00a05\u00a0nm) on reproduction (fecundity) were investigated. Moreover, the development of the embryos after parental exposure was compared with the development of embryos after direct waterborne exposure to the NPs. For this, two experiments were run: 1) embryos from unexposed parents were treated for 5\u00a0days with Ag NPs (10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Ag\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01\u201310\u00a0mg\u00a0Ag\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) and development was monitored, and 2) selected breeding zebrafish were exposed for 3\u00a0weeks to 100\u00a0ng\u00a0Ag\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 (environmentally relevant concentration) or to 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0Ag\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Ag NPs, fecundity was scored and development of resulting embryos was monitored up to 5\u00a0days.

Exposure of adults, even at the environmentally relevant silver concentration, caused a significant reduction of fecundity by the second week of treatment and resulting embryos showed a higher prevalence of malformations than control embryos.

Brine shrimp larvae of 24\u00a0h showed low sensitivity to the exposure to PVP/PEI-coated Ag NPs (5\u00a0nm), with EC50 values at 24\u00a0h of 19.63\u00a0mg\u00a0Ag\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, but they significantly accumulated silver after 24\u00a0h of exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Ag NPs. Thus, to assess bioaccumulation and effects of silver transferred by the diet in zebrafish, brine shrimp larvae were exposed to 100\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Ag NPs as an environmentally relevant concentration or to 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 as a potentially effective concentration and used to feed zebrafish for 21\u00a0days. Autometallography revealed a dose- and time-dependent metal accumulation in the intestine and in the liver of zebrafish. Three-day feeding with brine shrimps exposed to 100\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Ag NPs was enough to impair fish health as reflected by the significant reduction of lysosomal membrane stability and the presence of vacuolization and necrosis in the liver. However, dietary exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of Ag NPs for 3\u00a0days did not significantly alter gene transcription levels, neither in the liver nor in the intestine.

These not only render the early life stages more vulnerable to pathogens, but may also affect the adult immune competence. Knowledge of these sensitive periods in fish would provide an important prognostic/diagnostic tool for aquatic risk assessment of immunotoxicants. The marine medaka Oryzias melastigma is an emerging seawater fish model for immunotoxicology. Here, the presence and onset of four potentially sensitive periods during the development of innate and adaptive cellular immune defence were revealed in O. melastigma: 1.) initiation of phagocyte differentiation, 2.) migration and expansion of lymphoid progenitor cells, 3.) colonization of immune organs through lymphocyte progenitors and 4.) establishment of immune competence in the thymus. By using an established bacterial resistance assay for O. melastigma, larval immune competence (from newly hatched 1\u00a0dph to 14\u00a0dph) was found concomitantly increased with advanced thymus development and the presence of mature T-lymphocytes. A comparison between the marine O. melastigma and the freshwater counterpart Oryzias latipes disclosed a disparity in the T-lymphocyte maturation pattern, resulting in differences in the length of T-lymphocyte maturation. The results shed light on a potential difference between seawater and freshwater medaka in their sensitivity to environmental immunotoxicants. Further, medaka immune system development was compared and contrasted to economically important fish. The present study has provided a strong scientific basis for advanced investigation of critical windows for immune system development in fish.",

The acute toxicity (24\u00a0h-LC50) of MeP in nauplii was tested and its chronic effect (9\u00a0days) evaluated by measuring survival and growth under two sublethal concentrations (0.0085 and 0.017\u00a0mg/L). Also, the effect on several key enzymes involved in: antioxidant defences (catalase (CAT) and gluthathion-S-transferase (GST)), neural activity (cholinesterase (ChE)) and xenobiotic biotransformation (carboxylesterase (CbE), was assessed after 48\u00a0h under sublethal exposure. The results of acute exposure indicate that MeP is harmful to A. franciscana (24\u00a0h-LC50\u00a0=\u00a036.7\u00a0mg/L). MeP causes a decrease in CAT activity after 48\u00a0h exposure to both concentration tested, that points out at the oxidative stress effect of MeP in A. franciscana. However, no significant effect on ChE, CbE and GST activities was found.In addition, MeP does not affect survival and growth in chronic exposure at the sublethal concentrations tested.

We used a simple non-invasive assay to evaluate the impact of estrogens and EDCs on sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) scales. These were exposed to estradiol (E2), two phytoestrogens and six anthropogenic estrogenic/anti-estrogenic EDCs and activities of enzymes related to mineralized tissue turnover (TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and ALP, alkaline phosphatase) were measured. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR detected the expression of both membrane and nuclear estrogen receptors in the scales of both species, confirming scales as a target for E2 and EDCs through different mechanisms. Changes in TRAP or ALP activities after 30\u00a0minute and 24\u00a0h exposure were detected in sea bass and tilapia scales treated with E2 and three EDCs, although compound-, time- and dose-specific responses were observed for the two species. These results support again that the mineralized tissue turnover of fish is regulated by estrogens and reveals that the scales are a mineralized estrogen-responsive tissue that may be affected by some EDCs. The significance of these effects for whole animal physiology needs to be further explored. The in vitro fish scale bioassay is a promising non-invasive screening tool for E2 and EDCs effects, although the low sensitivity of TRAP/ALP quantification limits their utility and indicates that alternative endpoints are required.",

However, the potential mechanism of the regulation is barely understood. In the present study, aiming to explore how BPA affects the mRNA expression of cyp17a1 and cyp11a1 in testes and ovaries of G. rarus, we firstly cloned 340-bp fragment of 5\u2032 flanking region of cyp11a1 and then detected the methylation level of CpG loci involved in 5\u2032 flanking of cyp11a1 and cyp17a1 and their mRNA expression levels. Results showed that exposure to BPA significantly increased serum estradiol (E2) and 11-ketotesterone (11-KT) concentrations. Ovarian mRNA expression of cyp17a1 and cyp11a1 were significantly decreased after BPA exposure 7- for and 14-days. However, transcriptions of testicular cyp17a1 and cyp11a1 were significantly increased and decreased respectively after BPA treatment for 14\u00a0days. The DNA methylation levels of cyp17a1 were decreased in ovaries on day 7 and increased in ovaries and decreased in testes respectively on day 14. The methylation levels of cyp11a1 were increased in ovaries on day 7 and both ovaries and testes on day 14. There were a significant correlation between DNA methylation at specific CpG loci and cyp17a1 and cyp11a1 genes transcription levels. In conclusion, the CpG loci methylation in 5\u2032 flanking region appears to involve in the regulation of mRNA expression of cyp17a1 and cyp11a1 mediated by BPA.",

This study assessed Al-induced effects on enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, lipid peroxidation, and on expression of oxidative stress-related genes at low pH using Japanese Medaka (Oryzias latipes). Larval fish were exposed to dissolved Al concentrations of 0, 1.7, 6.2 and 16.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 for 4\u00a0days at pH\u00a05.3 in soft water. Al caused a significant reduction in activity of glutathione peroxidase at 6.2 and 16.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, and of glutathione reductase at 16.7\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 in whole body homogenates. No changes were observed in the expression of the glutathione peroxidase gene, and expression levels of the glutathione reductase gene were too low to be quantitated. Even though there was an overall decrease in the activity of catalase and in the concentration of glutathione, differences were not significant compared to the control. Changes in lipid peroxidation were not found. This study showed that exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of Al at low pH impairs antioxidant defense mechanisms of Medaka.",

     "abstract": "Senecio brasilienis (Spreng) Less., is a species native from Brazil, popularly known as \u201cMaria mole\u201d, and known to induce hepatotoxicity due to its high content of Pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Despite its toxicity, this plant is widely used in Brazilian folk medicine. Considering the antagonizing effects described for S. brasiliensis, we describe here molecular markers involved in the toxicity of hydroalcoholic extract from leaves of S. brasiliensis (HESB) in Drosophila melanogaster. Phytochemical analysis of HESB revealed the presence of phenolic acids and flavonoids. A significant antioxidant potential against ABTS+ and DPPH radical was found in parallel. Ingestion of extract did not alter the survival and locomotor activity of adult flies. However when ingested along the larval developmental phase, the eclosion rate of flies was interrupted at higher concentration of extract. To comprehend this phenomenon several analysis were conducted in larvae. HESB stimulated activity of antioxidant enzymes SOD and GST, and increased GSH/GSSG ratio and ROS production. Additionally, HESB caused a significant decrease of cell viability. The mRNA expression of Nrf2, TrxR, CAT, Drice and Dilp6 were also significantly up-regulated. HESB caused significant decrease on the phosphorylation of MAPKs and AKT. In parallel, PARP cleavage and caspases 3/7 activity were stimulated. In addition, glucose, glycogen and triglycerides levels were decreased. Taken together our study depicts a disruption in the eclosion of D. melanogaster possibly attributed to the inhibition of kinases implied in developmental process, energetic demand and induction of apoptotic cell death process.",

Using an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework, this review examines the similarities and differences between the mammalian and teleost fish SSRI target, the serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4), and the downstream impacts of elevated extracellular serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine), the consequence of SERT inhibition, on organ systems and physiological processes within teleost fish.

For that purpose, S. hasta were exposed to four Fe concentrations (0 (control), 0.36, 0.72 and 1.07\u00a0\u03bcM Fe) for 42\u00a0days. On days 21 and 42, morphological parameters, hepatic lipid deposition and Fe contents, and activities and mRNA levels of enzymes and genes related to lipid metabolism, including lipogenic enzymes (6PGD, G6PD, ME, ICDH, FAS and ACC) and lipolytic enzymes (CPTI, HSL), were analyzed. With the increase of Fe concentration, hepatic Fe content tended to increase but HSI and lipid content tended to decrease. On day 21, Fe exposure down-regulated the lipogenic activities of 6PGD, G6PD, ICDH and FAS as well as the mRNA levels of G6PD, ACCa, FAS, SREBP-1 and PPAR\u03b3, but up-regulated CPT I, HSLa and PPAR\u03b1 mRNA levels. On day 42, Fe exposure down-regulated the lipogenic activities of 6PGD, G6PD, ICDH and FAS as well as the mRNA levels of 6PGD, ACCa, FAS and SREBP-1, but up-regulated CPT I, HSLa, PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 mRNA levels. Using primary S. hasta hepatocytes, specific pathway inhibitors (GW6471 for PPAR\u03b1 and fatostatin for SREBP-1) and activator (troglitazone for PPAR\u03b3) were used to explore the signaling pathways of Fe reducing lipid deposition. The GW6471 attenuated the Fe-induced down-regulation of mRNA levels of 6PGD, G6PD, ME, FAS and ACCa, and attenuated the Fe-induced up-regulation of mRNA levels of CPT I, HSLa and PPAR\u03b1. Compared with single Fe-incubated group, the mRNA levels of G6PD, ME, FAS, ACCa, ACCb and PPAR\u03b3 were up-regulated while the CPT I mRNA levels were down-regulated after troglitazone pre-treatment; fatostatin pre-treatment down-regulated the mRNA levels of 6PGD, ME, FAS, ACCa, ACCb and SREBP-1, and increased the CPT I and HSLa mRNA levels. Based on these results above, our study indicated that Fe exposure reduced hepatic lipid deposition by down-regulating lipogenesis and up-regulating lipolysis, and PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 and SREBP-1 pathways mediated the Fe-induced reduction of hepatic lipid deposition in S. hasta.",

     "abstract": "Amphibians can experience large temperature fluctuations in their habitats, especially during the larval stage, when tadpoles are restricted to small and ephemeral ponds. Changes in water temperature can alter development, metabolism and behaviour of cold-blooded animals but also the toxicokinetics of chemicals in the environment. In Brazil, pesticides application is intensified during the rainy season, which is the period of reproduction for many amphibian species. We evaluated here the influence of temperature (28, 32, and 36\u00a0\u00b0C) on the toxicity of the herbicide sulfentrazone (Boral\u00aeSC) in tadpoles of Physalaemus nattereri and Rhinella schneideri, by analysis of oxidative stress biomarkers. Exposure of tadpoles to sulfentrazone altered the antioxidant enzymes activities and induced lipid peroxidation with temperature-associated responses. Catalase, superoxide dismutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were impaired by combined effect of temperature and sulfentrazone in both species. G6PDH was increased in most groups exposed to 36\u00a0\u00b0C. Biotransformation enzyme glutathione-S-transferase had more evident alterations in P. nattereri at higher temperatures and changes in tGSH contents presented different patterns between the species. Lipid peroxidation was particularly induced in tadpoles of P. nattereri. Integrated biomarker response (IBR) index indicated a synergic effect of temperature and sulfentrazone for tadpoles of P. nattereri, while the IBR was mainly influenced by temperature in R. schneideri. Our study showed that temperature modulates biochemical responses in tadpoles exposed to sulfentrazone with a species-specific pattern. These findings imply that the effects of abiotic factors should be taken into account to evaluate the real risks of exposure of amphibians to commonly used pesticides.",

As such, there is a need for novel molecules with bone anabolic properties. The aim of this work was to establish a rapid, reliable and reproducible method to screen for molecules with osteogenic activities, using the zebrafish operculum to assess bone formation. Exposure parameters were optimized through morphological analysis of the developing operculum of larvae exposed to calcitriol, a molecule with known pro-osteogenic properties. An exposure of 3\u00a0days initiated at 3\u00a0days post-fertilization was sufficient to stimulate operculum formation, while not affecting survival or development of the larvae. Dose-dependent pro- and anti-osteogenic effects of calcitriol and cobalt chloride, respectively, demonstrated the sensitivity of the method and the suitability of the operculum system. A double transgenic reporter line expressing fluorescent markers for early and mature osteoblasts was used to gain insights into the effects of calcitriol and cobalt at the cellular level, with osteoblast maturation shown to be stimulated and inhibited, respectively, in the operculum of exposed fish. The zebrafish operculum represents a consistent, robust and rapid screening system for the discovery of novel molecules with osteogenic, anti-osteoporotic or osteotoxic activity.",

In an escalating prey-predator arms race, venoms evolve rapidly to guarantee predatory or defensive success. Variation in venom composition is ubiquitous among snakes. Here, we tested variation in venom activity on substrates relevant to blood coagulation among Pseudonaja (brown snake) species, Australian elapids responsible for the majority of medically important human envenomations in Australia. A functional approach was employed to elucidate interspecific variation in venom activity in all nine currently recognised species of Pseudonaja. Fluorometric enzymatic activity assays were performed to test variation in whole venom procoagulant activity among species. Analyses confirmed the previously documented ontogenetic shift from non-coagulopathic venom in juveniles to coagulopathic venom as adults, except for the case of P. modesta, which retains non-coagulopathic venom as an adult. These shifts in venom activity correlate with documented ontogenetic shifts in diet among brown snakes from specialisation on reptilian prey as juveniles (and throughout the life cycle of P. modesta), to a more generalised diet in adults that includes mammals. The results of this study bring to light findings relevant to both clinical and evolutionary toxinology.",

The assembled contigs were 66,070 unigenes in olive flounder embryos and 76,498 unigenes in spotted seabass embryos. In the differential gene expression (DEG) profiles, olive flounder embryos showed different up- and down-regulated patterns than spotted seabass embryos in response to fresh IHCO (FIHCO) and weathered IHCO (WIHCO). In this work, we categorized DEG profiles into six pathways: ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and cardiac muscle contraction, validating the expression patterns of 13 DEGs using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The expression of the CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 genes in spotted seabass embryos was higher than in olive flounder embryos, whereas genes related to cell processing, development, and the immune system showed the opposite trend. Orthologous gene cluster analysis showed that olive flounder embryos were sensitive (fold change of genes with cutoff P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) to both FIHCO and WIHCO, but spotted seabass embryos exhibited higher sensitivity to WIHCO than FIHCO, indicating that species-specific differences are likely to be reflected in population levels after oil spills. Overall, our study provides new insight on the different embryonic susceptibilities of two marine fish species to FIHCO and WIHCO and a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms via RNA-seq and DEGs.",

Although the mechanisms of their action are unknown, both agents might affect neuromuscular junctions. Venom application significantly increased the expression of both P. apterus Akh genes (Pyrap-Akh 5.4 times and Peram-Cah-II 3.6 times), as well as the level of AKHs in the central nervous system (2.5 times) and haemolymph (3.0 times). In the haemolymph, increased AKH levels might have led to the mobilization of stored lipids, which increased 1.9 times, while the level of free carbohydrates remained unchanged. Total metabolism, monitored by carbon dioxide production, significantly declined in paralysed P. apterus individuals (1.4 times and 1.9 times, 24 and 48\u00a0h after the treatment, respectively), probably because of a malfunction of the muscular system.

Each oil possessed a distinct chemical composition. Edema defect was highest in embryos exposed to PCO and MFO-380 that both have a greater fraction of three-ring PAHs (33% and 22%, respectively) compared to BLO and SVO. Observed caudal fin defects were higher in embryos exposed to SVO and MFO-380, which are both dominated by naphthalenes (81% and 52%, respectively).

Barbel juveniles were exposed in the laboratory to two river sediments reflecting an upstream/downstream gradient of increasing contamination and collected from one of the most anthropized tributaries of the River Po. After 7\u00a0months of exposure, hepatic transcriptional changes that were diagnostic of sediment exposure were assessed. We investigated a set of 24 genes involved in xenobiotic biotransformation (cyp1a, gst\u03b1, ugt), antioxidant defense (gpx, sod, cat, hsp70), trace metal exposure (mt-I, mt-II), DNA repair (xpa, xpc), apoptosis (bax, casp3), growth (igf2), and steroid (er\u03b1, er\u03b21, er\u03b22, ar, vtg) and thyroid (dio1, dio2, tr\u03b1, tr\u03b2, nis) hormone signaling pathways.

Transcript up-regulation of three receptor genes (er\u03b22, ar, tr\u03b2), likely representing compensatory responses to antagonistic/toxic effects, was also observed, confirming the exposure to disruptors of the reproductive and thyroidal axes. In contrast to expectations, a few genes showed no response (e.g., casp3) or even downregulation (vtg), further suggesting that the timing of exposure/assessment, potential compensatory effects or post-transcriptional modifications interact to modify the gene expression profiles, particularly during exposure to mixtures of contaminants.",

Yeast suspensions were used to examine the toxic effects of contaminants on the cyclic behaviour of metabolite changes during anaerobic glycolysis. The cyclic behaviour NADH levels in yeast cell suspensions starved for 2 to 5\u00a0h was studied after the addition of 10\u00a0mM glucose for 5\u00a0min followed by 10\u00a0mM KCN to block aerobic glycolysis. The effects of three toxic elements (CuSO4, silver nanoparticles-nAg, and GdCl3), known for their potential to alter glycolsysis, on NADH levels over time were examined during the 3-h starvation step. The data were analyzed using spectral analysis (Fourier transformation) to characterize the cyclic behaviour of NADH levels during anaerobic glycolysis. Increasing the starvation time by 3\u00a0h increased the amplitude of changes in NADH levels with characteristic periods of 3 to 8\u00a0min. Longer starvation times decreased the amplitude of oscillations during these periods, with the appearance of NADH changes at higher frequencies. Moreover, the amplitude changes in NADH were proportional to the starvation time. Exposure to the above chemicals during the 3-h starvation time led to the formation of higher frequencies with concentration-dependent amplitude changes. In comparison with nAg and Gd3\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+ was the most toxic (decreased viability the most) and produce changes at higher frequencies as well. It is noteworthy that each element produced a characteristic change in the frequency profiles, which suggests different mechanisms of action in which the severity of toxicity shifted NADH changes at higher frequencies. In conclusion, the appearance of synchronized oscillations in dense yeast populations following synchronization stress could be induced by starvation and exposure to chemicals. However, synchronicity could be abolished when cells desynchronize as a result of loss of cell viability, which contributes to heterogeneity in yeast populations, translating into NADH changes at higher frequencies. This is the first report on the influence of environmental contaminants on the cyclic or wave-like behaviour of biochemical changes in cells.",

To examine whether MMI affects glucolipid metabolism in vitro and in vivo, fruit flies were fed diets containing 30\u00a0mM MMI for two weeks and Drosophila S2 cells were incubated with 300\u00a0\u03bcM MMI for 48\u00a0h. Measurements of metabolites showed that triglyceride content dramatically decreased (30.56% in vivo and 18.13% in vitro), and glycogen content significantly increased (10.7% in vivo and 126.8% in vitro). Quantitative analyses indicated that mRNA expression levels of Dmfmo1, s6k, dilp2, acc and dilp5 genes involved in metabolic homeostasis were remarkably down-regulated in vivo and in vitro. Meanwhile, the addition of MMI could significantly reduce the lipid droplet content in S2 cells by approximately 25% compared to control subjects. These data may provide a biological basis for the study of MMI on disease symptoms and complications, and discovery of therapeutic treatments.",

     "abstract": "Environmental risk assessment of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is an emergent field since nanotechnology industry is rapidly growing due to the interesting physicochemical properties of nanomaterials. Metal-based nanomaterials are among the most rapidly commercialized materials and their toxicity towards aquatic animals has been investigated at different levels of the biological organization. The objective of this synthesis review is to give an overview of the signaling molecules that have a key role in metal-based NM mediated cytotoxicity in both marine and freshwater organisms. Since toxicity of metal-based NMs could be (partly) due to metal dissolution, this review only highlights studies that showed a specific nano-effect. From this bibliographic study, three mechanisms (detoxification, immunomodulation and genotoxicity) have been selected as they represent the major cell defense mechanisms and the most studied ones following ENM exposure. This better understanding of NM-mediated cytotoxicity may provide a sound basis for designing environmentally safer nanomaterials.",

Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) monooxygenase are phase I enzyme involved in detoxification of environmental pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, little information on CYP450 family genes in ciliate is available. In the present study, acute toxicity of PAH, benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and PAH-like model compound, beta-naphthoflavone (\u03b2-NF), was investigated; full-length cDNA sequences and genomic structure of five CYP450 genes (CYP5680A1, CYP5681A1, CYP5681B1, CYP5682A1, and CYP5683A1) were analyzed; and finally their activities and transcriptional changes were measured after exposure to PAHs for 48\u00a0h. According to the results, B[a]P exposure showed a negative effect on E. crassus survival, whereas \u03b2-NF exposure showed no significant effect. The 8\u00a0h-LC50 value of B[a]P was determined to be 2.449\u00a0\u03bcM (95%-C.L., 7.726\u20133.619\u00a0\u03bcM). Five genes belonging to the CYP450 family had conserved domains and clustered with those of ciliate group, as revealed in phylogenetic analysis. CYP activity did not change after exposure to B[a]P, whereas it was slightly, but significantly, induced after exposure to \u03b2-NF. The mRNA expression of five CYP450 genes was significantly modulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner after exposure to both the chemicals. Our findings suggest that CYP450 genes in E. crassus may be involved in detoxification of B[a]P and \u03b2-NF. This study would give a better understanding about the mode of action of B[a]P and \u03b2-NF in marine ciliates at the molecular level.",

Although ample studies have investigated sponges for their bioactive metabolites with promising prospects in drug discovery, the potentiating effects of sponge extracts on antibiotics still remains to be expounded. The present study aimed to investigate the antibacterial capacity of seven tropical sponges collected from Mauritian waters and their modulatory effect in association with three conventional antibiotics namely chloramphenicol, ampicillin and tetracycline. Disc diffusion assay was used to determine the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) of the sponge total crude extracts (CE), hexane (HF), ethyl acetate (EAF) and aqueous (AF) fractions against nine standard bacterial isolates whereas broth microdilution method was used to determine their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) and antibiotic potentiating activity of the most active sponge extract. MIC values of the sponge extracts ranged from 0.039 to 1.25\u00a0mg/mL. Extracts from Neopetrosia exigua rich in beta-sitosterol and cholesterol displayed the widest activity spectrum against the 9 tested bacterial isolates whilst the best antibacterial profile was observed by its EAF particularly against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus with MIC and MBC values of 0.039\u00a0mg/mL and 0.078\u00a0mg/mL, respectively. The greatest antibiotic potentiating effect was obtained with the EAF of N. exigua (MIC/2) and ampicillin combination against S. aureus. These findings suggest that the antibacterial properties of the tested marine sponge extracts may provide an alternative and complementary strategy to manage bacterial infections.",

In the absence of free fatty acids (FFA) trans-membrane uptake of BaP and PHE was 2\u20137 times lower than the fraction associated to or in the membrane. In the presence of FFA, trans-membrane BaP uptake had decreased by 80 and 40% at the highest EPA and oleic acid concentration, respectively, whereas PHE uptake was virtually unaffected. In the presence of BaP, but not PHE, trans-membrane EPA uptake in BBMV had decreased.This study obtained evidence for PAH-dependent interactions with FFA uptake. We conclude that intestinal BaP uptake is reduced by luminal FFA contents whereas PHE uptake is not. A large fraction of the administrated BaP and PHE remains associated with the cellular membrane of enterocytes and may interfere with uptake of nutrients.",

Although there has been considerable research concerning the lethality of neonicotinoids, their sub-lethal and developmental effects are still being explored, especially with regard to non-mammalian species. The goal of this research was to investigate the effects of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid on the morphological and physiological development of northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). Bobwhite eggs (n\u00a0=\u00a0390) were injected with imidacloprid concentrations of 0 (sham), 10, 50, 100, and 150\u00a0mg/kg of egg mass, which was administered at day 0 (pre-incubation), 3, 6, 9, or 12 of growth. Embryos were dissected, weighed, staged, and examined for any overt structural deformities after 19\u00a0days of incubation. The mass of the embryonic heart, liver, lungs and kidneys was also recorded. The majority of treatments produced no discernible differences in embryo morphology; however, in some instances, embryos were subject to increased frequency of anatomical deformity and altered organ masses. Some impacts were more pronounced in specific dosing periods, implying that there may be critical windows of development when embryos are more susceptible to neonicotinoid exposure. This investigation suggests that imidacloprid has the potential to impact bobwhite quail embryonic development and chick survival.",

C. gigas were exposed to waterborne 10 and 30\u00a0\u03bcM curcumin, a known inducer of the mammalian Nrf2. Curcumin disappeared from the seawater after 10\u00a0h, and accumulated in the gills (10\u00a0h) and digestive gland (10\u201396\u00a0h). A clear induction of glutathione (GSH)-related antioxidant defenses was observed at 96\u00a0h in the gills of curcumin exposed animals (10 and 30\u00a0\u03bcM), including GSH levels, and the activity of glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). This response was completely absent in the digestive gland, in line with the idea that bivalve gills act as a major site for antioxidant protection under acute exposure. The relative mRNA levels coding glutamate-cysteine ligase, GR, GPx2 and GSTpi were clearly induced by curcumin treatment (30\u00a0\u03bcM, 24\u00a0h). Curcumin pre-treatment for 96\u00a0h increased oyster resistance to cumene hydroperoxide, but neither Nrf2 nor Keap1 genes were modulated by curcumin. However, the conserved sequences belonging to typical Nrf2 and Keap1 domains, and the notorious induction of antioxidant defense-related genes known to be controlled by Nrf2 in mammals, indicates a functional Nrf2/Keap1 pathway in bivalves, and curcumin seems to be a new tool to investigate the antioxidant response in bivalves.",

     "abstract": "Several recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms that confer insecticide resistance on insect pests. However, little is known about multiple resistance in red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) at molecular level. The multiple resistance is characterized as resistance to different classes of insecticides that have different target sites, and is mediated by several enzymatic systems. In this study, we investigated the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in multiple resistance of T. castaneum to bifenthrin (pyrethroid [Pyr]) and pirimiphos-methyl (organophosphate [Org]). We used artificial selection, biochemical and in silico approaches including structural computational biology. After five generations of artificial selection in the presence of bifenthrin (F5Pyr) or pirimiphos-methyl (F5Org), we found high levels of multiple resistance. The hierarchical enzymatic cluster revealed a pool of esterases (E), lipases (LIPs) and laccase2 (LAC2) potentially contributing to the resistance in different ways throughout development, after one or more generations in the presence of insecticides. The enzyme-insecticide interaction network indicated that E2, E3, LIP3, and LAC2 are enzymes potentially required for multiple resistance phenotype. Kinetic analysis of esterases from F5Pyr and F5Org showed that pirimiphos-methyl and specially bifenthrin promote enzyme inhibition, indicating that esterases mediate resistance by sequestering bifenthrin and pirimiphos-methyl. Our computational data were in accordance with kinetic results, indicating that bifenthrin has higher affinity at the active site of esterase than pirimiphos-methyl. We also report the capability of these insecticides to modify the development in T. castaneum. Our study provide insights into the biochemical mechanisms employed by T. castaneum to acquire multiple resistance.",

Potassium nitrate administration resulted in increased superoxide dismutase activity and in the abundance of a range of proteins associated with mitochondrial function (e.g. mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, putative mitochondrial Mn superoxide dismutase), metabolism (e.g. triosephosphate isomerase, glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase) and nitrate metabolism (e.g. aliphatic nitrilase, glutathione S-transferase).

The DrG cell line consists of epithelial-like cells with a diameter of 18\u201322\u00a0\u03bcm. The cell line was characterized by mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. Acute toxicity tests were conducted on D. rerio by exposing them to nicotine for 96\u00a0h under static conditions. In vitro cytotoxicity of nicotine was assessed in DrG cell line using multiple endpoints such as 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), Neutral Red assay, Alamar Blue assay and Coomassie Blue protein assay. Linear correlations between each in vitro cytotoxicity assay and the in vivo mortality data were highly significant. Nicotine induced intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in DrG cell line in a concentration dependent manner. DrG cell line and zebrafish exposed to nicotine significantly increased the elevation of lipid peroxidation (LPO) while depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidise(GPx1a) was observed. In nicotine treated fish and cells a negative correlation between reduced glutathione and LPO was observed. In addition, the production of ROS and the resulting oxidative stress resulted in increased expression of apoptosis related genes p53 and cas3.Collectively, our result suggests that nicotine has the potential to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, oxidative stress and apoptosis in DrG cell line and zebrafish.",

     "abstract": "Atrazine is an agricultural herbicide used throughout the Midwestern United States that frequently contaminates potable water supplies resulting in human exposure. Using the zebrafish model system, an embryonic atrazine exposure was previously reported to decrease spawning rates with an increase in progesterone and ovarian follicular atresia in adult females. In addition, alterations in genes associated with distinct molecular pathways of the endocrine system were observed in brain and gonad tissue of the adult females and males. Current hypotheses for mechanistic changes in the developmental origins of health and disease include genetic (e.g., copy number alterations) or epigenetic (e.g., DNA methylation) mechanisms. As such, in the current study we investigated whether an atrazine exposure would generate copy number alterations (CNAs) in the zebrafish genome. A zebrafish fibroblast cell line was used to limit detection to CNAs caused by the chemical exposure. First, cells were exposed to a range of atrazine concentrations and a crystal violet assay was completed, showing confluency decreased by ~\u00a060% at 46.3\u00a0\u03bcM. Cells were then exposed to 0, 0.463, 4.63, or 46.3\u00a0\u03bcM atrazine and array comparative genomic hybridization completed. Results showed 34, 21, and 44 CNAs in the 0.463, 4.63, and 46.3\u00a0\u03bcM treatments, respectively. Furthermore, CNAs were associated with previously reported gene expression alterations in adult male and female zebrafish. This study demonstrates that atrazine exposure can generate CNAs that are linked to gene expression alterations observed in adult zebrafish exposed to atrazine during embryogenesis providing a mechanism of the developmental origins of atrazine endocrine disruption.",

     "abstract": "Urea-based herbicides are applied in agriculture to control broadleaf and grassy weeds, acting to either inhibit photosynthesis at photosystem II (phenylureas) or to inhibit acetolactate synthase acetohydroxyacid synthase (sulfonylureas). While there are different chemical formulas for urea-based herbicides, the phenylureas are a widely used class in North America and have been detected in aquatic environments due to agricultural run-off. Here, we summarize the current state of the literature, synthesizing data on phenylureas and their biological effects in two non-target animals, fish and amphibians, with a primary focus on diuron and linuron. In fish, although the acutely lethal effects of diuron in early life stages appear to be >\u00a01\u00a0mg/L, recent studies measuring sub-lethal behavioural and developmental endpoints suggest that diuron causes adverse effects at lower concentrations (i.e. <\u00a00.1\u00a0mg/L). Considerably less toxicity data exist for amphibians, and this is a knowledge gap in the literature. In terms of sub-lethal effects and mode of action (MOA), linuron is well documented to have anti-androgenic effects in vertebrates, including fish. However, there are other MOAs that are not adequately assessed in toxicology studies. In order to identify additional potential MOAs, we conducted in silico analyses for linuron and diuron that were based upon transcriptome studies and chemical structure-function relationships (i.e. ToxCast\u2122, Prediction of Activity Spectra of Substances). Based upon these analyses, we suggest that steroid biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism and pregnane X receptor activation are common targets, and offer some new endpoints for future investigations of phenylurea herbicides in non-target animals.",

Previously, we used a cell line stably expressing uptake transporter for microcystin-LR, OATP1B3 (HEK293-OATP1B3 cells). In this study, to determine whether overexpression of carboxylesterase (CES), which degrades ester-group and amide-group, attenuates the cytotoxicity of microcystin-LR, we generated the HEK293-OATP1B3/CES2 double-transfected cells. HEK293-OATP1B3/CES2 cells showed high hydrolysis activity of p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA), which is an authentic substrate for esterase. CES activity in HEK293-OATP1B3/CES2 cells was approximately 3-fold higher than that in the HEK293-OATP1B3 cells. HEK293-OATP1B3/CES2 cells (IC50: 25.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7\u00a0nM) showed approximately 2.1-fold resistance to microcystin-LR than HEK293-OATP1B3 cells (IC50: 12.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0nM). Moreover, the CES inhibition assay and microcystin-agarose pull down assay showed the possibility of the interaction between CES2 and microcystin-LR. Our results indicated that the overexpression of CES2 attenuates the cytotoxicity of microcystin-LR via interaction with microcystin-LR.",

To perform a survival curve, 7\u00a0dpf larvae were exposed to 10\u00a0\u03bcM CuSO4, combined to different concentrations of caffeine (100\u00a0\u03bcM, 500\u00a0\u03bcM and 1\u00a0mM) for up to 24\u00a0h. The treatment with copper showed lower survival rates only when combined with 500\u00a0\u03bcM and 1\u00a0mM of caffeine. We selected 4 and 24\u00a0h as treatment time-points. The behavior evaluation was done by analyzing the traveled distance, the number of entries in the center, and the length of permanence in the center and the periphery of the well. The exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcM CuSO4 plus 500\u00a0\u03bcM caffeine at 4 and 24\u00a0h changed the behavioral parameters. To study the inflammatory effects of caffeine, we assessed the PGE2 levels by using UHPLC-MS/MS, and TNF, COX-2, IL-6 and IL-10 gene expression by RT-qPCR. The expression of adenosine receptors was also evaluated with RT-qPCR. When combined to copper, caffeine altered inflammatory markers depending on the time of exposure. Adenosine receptors expression was significantly increased, especially after 4\u00a0h exposure to copper and caffeine together or separately. Our results demonstrated that caffeine enhances the inflammation induced by copper by decreasing animal survival, altering inflammatory markers and promoting behavioral changes in zebrafish larvae. We also conclude that alterations in adenosine receptors are related to those effects.",

The objectives were to determine the effects of DLD on GABAergic and dopaminergic systems in developing zebrafish. Both chorionated and dechorionated embryos (~\u00a024\u00a0h post-hatch) were exposed to a single concentration of DLD (0.347\u20133470\u00a0\u03bcM) for 48\u00a0h. Following exposure, a subset of larvae was placed into clean water for 6\u00a0days (i.e. depuration phase). Chorionated embryos showed <\u00a015% mortality while dechorionated embryos showed higher mortality (>\u00a030%), suggesting that the chorion protected the embryos. Over a 6\u00a0day depuration phase, there was a dose dependent effect observed in both the \u201cdechorionated and chorionated embryo\u201d treatments for larval mortality (>\u00a060%). At the end of depuration, there was no detectable change in neuro-morphological endpoints that included the ratio of notochord length to body length (%) and the ratio of head area to body area (%). However, DLD did induce cardiac edema, skeletal deformities, and tremors. GABA-related transcripts were not affected in abundance by DLD. Conversely, the relative mRNA levels of dopamine transporter (dat1) and dopamine receptor drd2a mRNA were decreased in dechorionated, but not chorionated, embryos. These data suggest that DLD can alter the expression of transcripts related to dopaminergic signaling. Lastly, GABAA receptor subunits gabrB1 and gabrB2, as well as dopamine receptors drd1 and drd2a, were inherently higher in abundance in dechorionated embryos compared to chorionated embryos. This is an important consideration when incorporating transcriptomics into embryo testing as expression levels can change with removal of the chorion prior to exposure.",

The cells were incubated for 3\u00a0h with 0.1\u20135\u00a0\u03bcM Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in combination with 2.5\u00a0mM Ca2+ and 10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM pro-oxidant agent tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP). The sensitivity of lamprey RBCs to studied compounds was evaluated by the kinetics of their death. Both toxicants induced dose- and time dependent phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization (annexin V-FITC labeling) and loss of membrane integrity (propidium iodide uptake). Highest doses of ionomycin (1\u20132\u00a0\u03bcM) increased the number of PS-exposed erythrocytes to 7\u20139% within 3\u00a0h, while 100\u00a0\u03bcM tBHP produced up to 50% of annexin V-FITC-positive cells.

None of examined death-associated events were observed in ionomycin-treated erythrocytes except activation of caspase-9. Incubation with ionomycin did not alter intracellular K+ and Na+ content, while exposure to tBHP resulted in 80% loss of K+ and 2.8-fold accumulation of Na+. Thus, lamprey erythrocytes appear to be more susceptible to oxidative damage. Ca2+ overload does not activate the cytosolic death pathways in these cells.",

Although triazole fungicides are widely found in the aquatic environment, little is known about their acute toxicity on fish. In this study we assessed the effects of short-term exposure to Topas on some parameters of homeostasis of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as the levels of markers of oxidative stress and parameters of the antioxidant defense system of goldfish (Carassius auratus L.). Gills appeared to be the main target organ of Topas toxicity, showing the greatest number of parameters affected. Gills of Topas-treated fish showed a higher content of low (L-SH) and high (H-SH) molecular mass thiols and higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) as well as reduced carbonyl protein content (CP), as compared with those in the control group. In the liver, goldfish exposure to 15\u201325\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u22121 Topas resulted in a higher L-SH and H-SH content, but lower CP levels and activity of GST. In kidney, Topas exposure resulted in higher activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and G6PDH, but lower L-SH content and activity of GST. The results of this study indicate that acute goldfish exposure to the triazole fungicide Topas increased efficiency of the antioxidant system in fish gills, liver, and kidney. This could indicate the development of low intensity oxidative stress which up-regulates defense mechanisms responsible for protection of goldfish against deleterious ROS effects.",

     "abstract": "Oil pollution is considered being disastrous to marine organisms and ecosystems. As molting is critical in the developmental process of arthropods in general and copepods, in particular, the impact will be adverse if the target of spilled oil is on molting. Thus, we investigated the harmful effects of water accommodated fractions (WAFs) of crude oil with an emphasis on inhibition of chitin metabolic pathways related genes and developmental retardation in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Also, we analysed the ontology and domain of chitin metabolic pathway genes and mRNA expression patterns of developmental stage-specific genes. Further, the developmental retardation followed by transcriptional modulations in nuclear receptor genes (NR) and chitin metabolic pathway-related genes were observed in the WAFs-exposed T. japonicus. As a result, the developmental time was found significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) delayed in response to 40% WAFs in comparison with that of control. Moreover, the NR gene, HR3 and chitinases (CHT9 and CHT10) were up-regulated in N4\u20135 stages, while chitin synthase genes (CHS-1, CHS-2-1, and CHS-2-2) down-regulated in response to WAFs. In brief, a high concentration of WAFs repressed nuclear receptor genes but elicited activation of some of the transcription factors at low concentration of WAFs, resulting in suppression of chitin synthesis.Thus, we suggest that WAF can lead molting retardation of naupliar stages in T. japonicus through down-regulations of chitin metabolism. These findings will provide a better understanding of the mode of action of chitin biosynthesis associated with molting mechanism in WAF-exposed T. japonicus.",

     "abstract": "In order to clarify the suitability of the lateral line of zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model for the screening of ototoxic (neurotoxic) effects, existing neuromast assays were adapted, improved and validated with a series of chemicals known or unknown for their ototoxic potential (caffeine copper sulfate, dichlorvos, 2.4-dinitrotoluene, neomycin, 4-nonylphenol, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid). Present methods were improved by (1) the introduction of a 4-step scoring system, (2) the selection of neuromasts from both the anterior and posterior lateral line systems, (3) a combined DASPEI/DAPI staining applied after both a continuous and pulse exposure scenario, and (4) an additional screening for nuclear fragmentation. Acute toxicities of the model substances were determined by means of the fish embryo test as specified in OECD TG 236, and EC10 concentrations were used as the highest test concentration in the neuromast assay. The enhanced neuromast assay identified known ototoxic substances such as neomycin and copper sulfate as ototoxic at sensitivities similar to those of established methods, with pulse exposure leading to stronger effects than continuous exposure. Except for caffeine, all substances tested (dichlorvos, 2.4-dinitrotoluene, 4-nonylphenol, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) produced significant toxic effects in neuromasts at EC10 concentrations. Depending on the test substances and their location along the lateral line, specific neuromasts differed in sensitivity. Generally, neuromasts proved more sensitive in the pulse exposure scenario. Whereas for neomycin and copper sulfate neuromasts located along the anterior lateral line were more sensitive, posterior lateral line neuromasts proved more sensitive for the other test substances. Nuclear fragmentation could not only be associated with all test substances, but, albeit at lower frequencies, also with negative controls, and could, therefore, not be assigned specifically to chemical damage. The study thus documented that for a comprehensive evaluation of lateral line damage both neuromasts from the anterior and the posterior lateral line have to be considered. Given the apparently rapid regeneration of hair cells, pulse exposure seems more appropriate for the identification of lateral line neurotoxicity than continuous exposure.",

     "abstract": "Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are incorporated into numerous industrial, clinical, food, and consumer products and a significant body of evidence is now available on their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Environmental ENM concentrations are difficult to quantify, but production and release estimates suggest wastewater treatment plant effluent levels ranging from 10\u2212\u00a04 to >\u00a0101\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 for the most common formulations by production volume. Bioavailability and ENM toxicity are heavily influenced by water quality parameters and the physicochemical properties and resulting colloidal behaviour of the particular ENM formulation. ENMs generally induce only mild acute toxicity to most adult fish and crustaceans under environmentally relevant exposure scenarios; however, sensitivity may be considerably higher for certain species and life stages. In adult animals, aquatic ENM exposure often irritates respiratory and digestive epithelia and causes oxidative stress, which can be associated with cardiovascular dysfunction and the activation of immune responses. Direct interactions between ENMs (or their dissolution products) and proteins can also lead to ionoregulatory stress and/or developmental toxicity. Chronic and developmental toxicity have been noted for several common ENMs (e.g. TiO2, Ag), however more data is necessary to accurately characterize long term ecological risks. The bioavailability of ENMs should be limited in saline waters but toxicity has been observed in marine animals, highlighting a need for more study on possible impacts in estuarine and coastal systems. Nano-enabled advancements in industrial processes like water treatment and remediation could provide significant net benefits to the environment and will likely temper the relatively modest impacts of incidental ENM release and exposure.",

We observed transcriptional up-regulation of these genes during post-embryonic developmental stages including sex-specific up-regulation in adults. In addition, concentration- and time-dependent mRNA transcripts in response to xenobiotics (BPA, BDE-47, and WAFs) were seen.

The results obtained revealed that the exposure to GO induced negative effects on the regenerative capacity of D. neapolitana, with organisms exposed to higher concentrations regenerating less segments and taking longer periods to completely regenerate. GO also seemed to alter energy-related responses, especially glycogen content, with higher values in polychaetes exposed to GO which may result from a decreased metabolism (measured by electron transport system activity), when exposed to GO.

Adult females of the estuarine crab Neohelice granulata were exposed to formulated atrazine during the 3-month pre-reproductive period. Three atrazine concentrations (0.03, 0.3 and 3\u00a0mg/L) were assayed, together with a water dilution control. At the end of the exposure period, several variables concerning the energetic status of animals were measured, such as weight gain, glycemia, and energy reserves in both muscle and hepatopancreas. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) was also determined, as well as the proportion and relative area of each oocyte type in histological sections. Besides, the total content of vitellogenin proteins (Vg) in both ovary and hepatopancreas was measured. A significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decrease of glycogen content was observed in muscle, while a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) lower area of both previtellogenic and vitellogenic oocytes was verified in the ovary by effect of atrazine, in correspondence with a Vg content significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) diminished in the ovary and augmented in the hepatopancreas. Besides, a higher proportion of previtellogenic oocytes were seen by effect of atrazine. Taken together, these results indicate a clear reduction and delay in the ovarian growth of the studied species, during the period at which the ovary normally grows up prior to spawning. On the other hand, a decrease of Vg content was observed at 0.3 and 3\u00a0mg/L of atrazine after 24-h in vitro assays carried out with ovarian explants, providing additional evidence about the inhibitory role of this herbicide on the ovarian growth.

Messenger RNA transcriptional levels of EcR and USP were developmental stage-specific in early post-embryonic stages (N3-4). However, an evoked expression of USP was observed throughout copepodid stage and in adult females. WAFs (40 and 80%) were acted as an ecdysone agonist in P. nana, and elicited the mRNA transcription levels in adults. Developmental stage-specific transcriptional activation of EcR and USP in response to WAFs was observed. USP gene was down-regulated in the nauplius in response to WAF, whereas up-regulation of USP was observed in the adults. This study represents the first data of molecular elucidation of EcR and USP genes and their regulatory elements from P. nana and the developmental stage specific expression in response to WAFs, which can be used as potential biomarkers for environmental stressors with ecotoxicological evaluations in copepods.",

Attempts have been made to use induction of bivalve yolk protein as biomarker for estrogenic exposure. However, several biomarker validation criteria have not yet been investigated e.g. an in-depth understanding of the induction mechanism and background variability is needed and reliable detection assays are yet to be developed.To obtain background knowledge about yolk protein levels freshwater bivalves (Unio tumidus) were collected in an uncontaminated Danish lake over the course of a year (33 collection dates). The hemolymph yolk protein concentration of 569 individuals was determined by a species specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and male and female gonadal development cycles were established. The average yolk protein levels of males and females collected at each sampling date overlapped in some periods; the male and female range was 66,946 - 169,692 ng/mL and 88,731 - 681,667 ng/mL, respectively. Because male and female hemolymph yolk protein levels overlap, great care should be taken if yolk protein induction in bivalve hemolymph is considered as endocrine biomarker.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria, an integral component of cellular energy metabolism and other key functions, are extremely vulnerable to damage by environmental stressors. Although methods to measure mitochondrial function in vitro exist, sensitive, medium- to high-throughput assays that assess respiration within physiologically-relevant whole organisms are needed to identify drugs and/or chemicals that disrupt mitochondrial function, particularly at sensitive early developmental stages. Consequently, we have developed and optimized an assay to measure mitochondrial bioenergetics in zebrafish larvae using the XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer. To prevent larval movement from confounding oxygen consumption measurements, we relied on MS-222-based anesthetization. We obtained stable measurement values in the absence of effects on average oxygen consumption rate and subsequently optimized the use of pharmacological agents for metabolic partitioning. To confirm assay reproducibility we demonstrated that triclosan, a positive control, significantly decreased spare respiratory capacity. We then exposed zebrafish from 5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to 6\u00a0days post-fertilization (dpf) to three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \u2013 benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), phenanthrene (Phe), and fluoranthene (FL) \u2013 and measured various fundamental parameters of mitochondrial respiratory chain function, including maximal respiration, spare respiratory capacity, mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial respiration. Exposure to all three PAHs decreased spare respiratory capacity and maximal respiration. Additionally, Phe exposure increased non-mitochondrial respiration and FL exposure decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased non-mitochondrial respiration. Overall, this whole organism-based assay provides a platform for examining mitochondrial dysfunction in vivo at critical developmental stages. It has important implications in biomedical sciences, toxicology and ecophysiology, particularly to examine the effects of environmental chemicals and/or drugs on mitochondrial bioenergetics.",

In this work, we studied the effects of linalool on excitability of central neurons of land snail Caucasotachea atrolabiata and tried to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The lower concentration of linalool (0.1\u00a0mM) showed suppressive action on spontaneous activity and pentylenetetrazole-induced epileptiform activity. These effects were associated with elevation of the action potential threshold and reduction of action potential rising phase, supporting the inhibitory action of linalool on Na+ channels. At this concentration it also prolonged the post stimulus inhibitory period that can take part in its antiepileptic effect and apparently results from increased action potential duration and indirect augmentation of Ca2\u00a0+-activated K+ currents. At higher concentration, however, linalool (0.4\u00a0mM) increased the neuronal excitability and induced epileptiform activity. The modulatory effects on action potential waveform during preconvulsive period suggest that the recent effect is mainly dependent on the suppression of outward potassium currents underlying repolarization phase and afterhyperpolarization. The linalool-induced epileptiform activity was abolished by Ca2+ channel blockers, nifedipine and nickel chloride, and selective inhibitor of protein kinase C, chelerythrine, suggesting that Ca2+ inward currents and protein kinase C (PKC) activity are required for linalool-induced epileptiform activity.Our results support the antiepileptic activity of linalool at lower dose, but it shows epileptogenic activity when applied directly on snail neurons at higher dose. Linalool may also be a potential therapeutic agent for activating PKC.",

     "abstract": "Mercury is a widespread toxicant in aquatic environment that can cause deleterious effects on fish. Although a number of mercury-regulated genes have been investigated in adult fish, the transcriptional responses of fish larvae to acute mercury exposure are not well understood. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to examine the transcriptional changes in developing zebrafish larvae under a low concentration of mercuric chloride exposure from 24 to 120\u00a0hpf. Our initial results showed that a total of 142.59 million raw reads were obtained from sequencing libraries and about 86% of the processed reads were mapped to the reference genome of zebrafish. Differential expression analysis identified 391 up- and 87 down-regulated genes. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that most of the differential expressed genes are closely related to the regulation of cellular process, metabolic process, multicellular organismal process, biological regulation, pigmentation, and response to stimulus. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that antigen processing and presentation was the most significantly enriched pathway. Moreover, we characterized a novel and sensitive mercury-induced ABCB (ATP- binding cassette B subfamily) transporter gene - abcb5. This gene is localized on zebrafish chromosome 16 and contains a 4014\u00a0bp open-reading frame. The deduced polypeptide is composed of 1337 amino acids and possesses most of functional domains and critical residues defined in human and mouse ABCB5/Abcb5. Functional analysis in vitro demonstrated that overexpression of zebrafish abcb5 gene can significantly decrease the cytotoxicity of mercury in LLC-PK1 cells, implying it is a potential efflux transporter of mercury. Thus, these findings provide useful insights to help further understand the transcriptional response and detoxification ability of zebrafish larvae following acute exposure to mercury.",

The objectives of the current study were to (1) determine whether total Hg (THg) in the muscle was predictive of MeHg concentrations in the brain of wild female yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected from four lakes in Kejimkujik National Park, a known biological mercury (Hg) hotspot in Nova Scotia, Canada and (2) to determine whether transcripts involved in the oxidative stress response were altered in abundance in fish collected across five lakes representing a MeHg gradient. In female yellow perch, MeHg in whole brain (0.38 to 2.00\u00a0\u03bcg/g wet weight) was positively associated with THg in muscle (0.18 to 2.13\u00a0\u03bcg/g wet weight) (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), suggesting that muscle THg may be useful for predicting MeHg concentrations in the brain. Catalase (cat) mRNA levels were significantly lower in brains of perch collected from lakes with high Hg when compared to those individuals from lakes with relatively lower Hg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Other transcripts (cytochrome c oxidase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-s-transferase, heat shock protein 70, protein disulfide isomerase, and superoxide dismutase) did not show differential expression in the brain over the gradient. These findings suggest that MeHg may be inversely associated with catalase mRNA abundance in the central nervous system of wild fishes.",

In this mini-review, we synthesize the current state of knowledge of scleractinian coral GEBs and highlight gaps in our understanding that identify directions for future work. We also address the underlying sources of variation that have sometimes led to contrasting results between studies, such as differences in experimental set-up and approach, intrinsic variation in the expression profiles of different experimental organisms (such as between different colonies or their algal symbionts), diel cycles, varying thermal history, and different expression thresholds. Despite advances in our understanding there is still no universally accepted biomarker of thermal stress, the molecular response of corals to heat stress is still unclear, and biomarker research in Symbiodinium still lags behind that of the host.

Because most aquatic ecosystems receive some amount of sunlight, co-exposure to xenobiotic chemicals and solar radiation is likely to occur in the environment, and photo-induced toxicity may be an important factor impacting aquatic ecosystems. However, photo-induced toxicity is not likely to be relevant in all aquatic systems or exposure scenarios due to variation in important ecological factors as well as physiological adaptations of the species that reside there.

In recent years, more and more attention has been focused on the adverse effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on non-target organisms. In this study, inhibition effects of imidaclothiz and recovery capacity of molecular biomarkers (GST, CE, CAT, SOD and POD activity, and DNA damage) in earthworms were detected for the first time. Earthworms were exposed to imidaclothiz (0.3 and 1.0\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) for 28\u00a0days, and then transferred to the clean artificial soil for 28\u00a0days. Regarding enzyme activities, GST, CE, CAT and POD were inhibited following exposure to imidaclothiz at one or more sample times, while SOD was not affected. After transferring to the clean artificial soil, POD continued to be significantly inhibited till sample time 35\u00a0days at 0.3\u00a0mg/kg\u2212\u00a01. For GST, CE, CAT and SOD, activities of them were significantly increased compared to those of the control during the recovery period. The olive tail moments (OTM) in comet assay, as an indication of DNA damage, were significantly increased compared to the control after treatment and then decreased during the recovery period. These results suggested that imidaclothiz induced oxidative damage on earthworms which caused damage to vital macromolecules including DNA. However, the recovery changes of all tested biomarkers following the transfer to clean soil suggested the tested earthworm recovery from imidaclothiz exposure.",

Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) are a common model organism for toxicological studies. The goal of the current research was to characterize developmental expression and regulation of FMOs in Japanese medaka embryos to better understand the role of FMOs in this model species. Five putative medaka fmos were characterized from the medaka genome through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database by protein motifs and alignments, then identified as fmo4, fmo5A, fmo5B, fmo5C and fmo5D for the current study. Fmo gene expression was analyzed at 1\u00a0dpf, 3\u00a0dpf, 6\u00a0dpf and 9\u00a0dpf and distinct developmental patterns of expression were observed. Fmo4 and fmo5D increased 3-fold during mid organogenesis (6\u00a0dpf), while fmo5B and fmo5C decreased significantly in early organogenesis (3\u00a0dpf) and fmo5A was unaltered. Promoter analysis was performed for transcription factor binding sites and indicated regulation by developmental factors and a role for the unfolded protein response in fmo modulation. Fmo regulation by the UPR was assessed with treatments of 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, and 4\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Tunicamycin (Tm), and 2\u00a0mM and 4\u00a0mM dithiothreitol (DTT), well-known inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress, for 24\u00a0h from 5\u20136\u00a0dpf. High concentrations to Tm induced fmo4 and fmo5A up to two-fold, while DTT significantly decreased expression of fmo5A, fmo5B, and fmo5C.

Prolonged chronic exposures of freshwater mussels to EE2 remain un-evaluated. An extended duration testing paradigm was used to examine reproductive and biochemical (carbohydrate, lipid, protein) effects of EE2 on the unionid mussel, Elliptio complanata, throughout its reproductive cycle. Mussels were exposed to a control and EE2 concentrations (5 and 50\u00a0ng/L) in six discrete and sequential 28 d tests, and in one discrete and simultaneous 180 d test, from February through August. Foot protrusion and siphoning behavior were recorded daily, along with conglutinate releases and larval (glochidia) mortality. Gonad, hemolymph, and gonad fluid samples were taken for biochemical and vitellogenin-like protein (Vtg) analysis post-exposure. Female mussels released eggs and conglutinates during the months of April to June, indicating sexual maturation during this time. Conglutinates released in the 5\u00a0ng/L treatment in 28 d exposures contained fewer glochidia and more eggs, and increased concentrations of Vtg in hemolymph were observed from April to August in the 5\u00a0ng/L treatment during the 180 d exposure. Results indicate that the 180 d test approach, concurrent with the sequence of 28 d tests, enabled a more robust evaluation of mussel behavior and physiology than would have been possible with a single short-term (28 d) test.",

     "abstract": "In vertebrate systems, many endocrine disruptors (EDs) can also interfere with energy and lipid metabolism, thus acting as metabolic disruptors. At the cellular level, these effects are mainly mediated by interactions with nuclear receptors/transcription factors, leading to the modulation of genes involved in lipid homeostasis, as well as by rapid, receptor-independent pathways.Several potential metabolic disruptors are found in aquatic environments. In fish, different EDs have been shown to affect hepatic lipid homeostasis both in vivo and in vitro. However, little information is available in aquatic invertebrates due to our poor knowledge of the regulatory pathways of lipid metabolism.In this work, primary cell cultures from the digestive gland of the bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis were utilized to investigate the effects of model EDs (bisphenol A (BPA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS)) on lipid homeostasis. Both compounds (at 24 and 3\u00a0h of exposure) increased intracellular lipid and tryglyceride-TAG content, with strongest effects of PFOS at 10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M. Acyl-CoA oxidase activity was unaffected, whereas some changes in the activity of glycolytic, antioxidant/biotransformation enzymes were observed; however, no clear relationship was found with lipid accumulation. Evaluation of mitochondrial membrane potential \u0394\u03c8m and determination of extracellular TAG content indicate that PFOS interferes with mitochondrial function and lipid secretion, whereas BPA mainly affects lipid secretion. Experiments with specific inhibitors showed that activation of PI-3 kinase and extracellularly regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK MAPK) plays a key role in mediating lipid accumulation. Mussel digestive gland cells represent a simple in vitro model for screening the metabolic effects of EDs in marine invertebrates.",

Hypoxia acclimation increased per se red blood cells count and hematocrit, suggesting adaptations under hypoxia, while the reoxygenation process was also related to increased hematocrit and hemoglobin per se. Fish exposed to Mn under normoxia for 20\u00a0days showed decreased red blood cells count and hematocrit, while reoxygenation subsequent to hypoxia increased red blood cells count. Hypoxia acclimation also prevented Mn-induced oxidative damage, observed by increased reactive species generation and higher protein carbonyl levels in both liver and kidney under normoxia. Mn-exposed fish under hypoxia and after reoxygenation showed decreased plasma transaminases in relation to the normoxia group. Moreover, acclimation to hypoxia increased reduced glutathione levels, catalase activity and Na+/K+-ATPase activity in liver and kidney during Mn exposure, remaining increased even after reoxygenation. These findings show that previous acclimation to hypoxia generates physiological adjustments, which drive coordinated responses that ameliorate the antioxidant status even after reoxygenation. Such responses represent a physiological regulation of this teleost fish against oxygen restriction and/or Mn toxicity in order to preserve the stability of a particular tissue or system.",

     "abstract": "Aluminium is a major pollutant due to its constant disposal in aquatic environments through anthropogenic activities. The physiological effects of this metal in fish are still scarce in the literature. This study investigated the in vivo and in vitro effects of aluminium sulfate on the activity of enzymes from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus): brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), muscle cholinesterases (AChE-like and BChE-like activities), pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin and amylase. Fish were in vivo exposed during 14\u00a0days when the following experimental groups were assayed: control group (CG), exposure to Al2(SO4)3 at 1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 (G1) and 3\u00a0\u03bcg\u00b7mL\u22121 (G3) (concentrations compatible with the use of aluminium sulfate as coagulant in water treatment). In vitro exposure was performed using animals of CG treatment. Both in vivo and in vitro exposure increased cholinesterase activity in relation to controls. The highest cholinesterase activity was observed for muscle BChE-like enzyme in G3. In contrast, the digestive enzymes showed decreased activity in both in vivo and in vitro exposures. The highest inhibitory effect was observed for pepsin activity. The inhibition of serine proteases was also quantitatively analyzed in zymograms using pixel optical densitometry as area under the peaks (AUP) and integrated density (ID). These results suggest that the inhibition of digestive enzymes in combination with activation of cholinesterases in O. niloticus is a set of biochemical effects that evidence the presence of aluminium in the aquatic environment. Moreover, these enzymatic alterations may support further studies on physiological changes in this species with implications for its neurological and digestive metabolisms.",

     "abstract": "Methylmercury (MeHg) is a persistent environmental pollutant that occurs in the food chain, at occupational sites, and via medical procedures. Exposure in humans and animal models results in renal, neuro, and reproductive toxicities. In this study, we demonstrate that chronic exposure to MeHg (10\u00a0\u03bcM) causes epigenetic landscape modifications of histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) marks in Caenorhabditis elegans using chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The modifications correspond to the locations of 1467 genes with enhanced and 508 genes with reduced signals. Among enhanced genes are those encoding glutathione-S-transferases, lipocalin-related protein and a cuticular collagen. ChIP-seq enhancement of these genes was confirmed with increased mRNA expression levels revealed by qRT-PCR. Furthermore, we observed enhancement of H3K4me3 marks in these genes in animals exposed to MeHg in utero and assayed at L4 stage. In utero exposure enhanced marks without alterations in mRNA expression except for the lpr-5 gene. Finally, knockdown of lipocalin-related protein gene lpr-5, which is involved in intercellular signaling, and cuticular collagen gene dpy-7, structural component of the cuticle, by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased lethality of animals after MeHg exposure. Our results provide new data on the epigenetic landscape changes elicited by MeHg exposure, as well as describe a unique model for studying in utero effects of heavy metals. Together, these findings may help to understand the toxicological effects of MeHg at the molecular level.",

BiP, an ER heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family member, binds to unfolded protein, inhibits their aggregation and re-folds them in an ATP-dependent manner. While cadmium, an environmental contaminant, was shown to induce the accumulation of HSP70 in vertebrate cells, less information is available regarding the effect of this metal on BiP accumulation or function. In this study, cadmium chloride treatment of Xenopus laevis A6 kidney epithelial cells induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in BiP, HSP70 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) accumulation. Exposure of cells to a relatively low cadmium concentration at a mild heat shock temperature of 30\u00a0\u00b0C greatly enhanced BiP and HSP70 accumulation compared to cadmium at 22\u00a0\u00b0C. Treatment of cells with the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, buthionine sulfoximine, enhanced cadmium-induced BiP and HSP70 accumulation. Immunocytochemistry revealed that cadmium-induced BiP accumulation occurred in a punctate pattern in the perinuclear region. In some cells treated with cadmium chloride or the proteasomal inhibitor, MG132, large BiP complexes were observed that co-localized with aggregated protein or aggresome-like structures. These BiP/aggresome-like structures were also observed in cells treated simultaneously with cadmium at 30\u00a0\u00b0C or in the presence of buthionine sulfoximine. In amphibians, the association of BiP with unfolded protein and its possible role in aggresome function may be vital in the maintenance of cellular proteostasis.",

Consecutive and alternating EMB/DM treatments resulted in a 10-fold increase and 3-fold decrease of CYP1A protein levels in the intestine and gills, respectively. Notably, CYP1A activity levels decreased in most of the analyzed tissues. FMO protein and activity levels markedly increased in the kidney and the intestine. GST was up-regulated in all tissues, either as protein or enzyme activity. When comparing consecutive EMB/DM treatments against previous studies of EMB treatment alone, CYP1A activity levels were similarly diminished, except in muscle. Likewise, FMO activity levels were increased in most of the analyzed tissues, particularly in the muscle, kidney, and intestine. The increases observed for GST were essentially unchanged between consecutive EMB/DM and EMB only treatments. These results indicate that consecutive EMB/DM treatments in rainbow trout induce the expression and activity of FMO and GST enzymes and decrease CYP1A activity. These altered activities of detoxification enzymes could generate imbalances in metabolic processes, synthesis, degradation of hormones and complications associated with drug interactions. It is especially important when analyzing possible effects of consecutive antiparasitic treatments on withholding periods and salmon farming yields.",

To gain a better understanding of the potential antioxidant roles the BVR enzymes may play during development, the spatiotemporal expression and transcriptional regulation of zebrafish hmox1a, bvra and bvrb were characterized under basal conditions and in response to pro-oxidant exposure. All three genes displayed spatiotemporal expression patterns consistent with classic hematopoietic progenitors during development. Transient knockdown of Nrf2a did not attenuate the ability to detect bvra or bvrb by ISH, or alter spatial expression patterns in response to cadmium exposure. While hmox1a:mCherry fluorescence was documented within the intermediate cell mass, a transient location of primitive erythrocyte differentiation, expression was not fully attenuated in Nrf2a morphants, but real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a significant reduction in hmox1a expression. Furthermore, Gata-1 knockdown did not attenuate hmox1a:mCherry fluorescence. However, while there was a complete loss of detection of bvrb expression by ISH at 24\u00a0hpf, bvra expression was greatly attenuated but still detectable in Gata-1 morphants. In contrast, 96 hpf Gata-1 morphants displayed increased bvra and bvrb expression within hematopoietic tissues. Finally, temporal expression patterns of enzymes involved in the generation and maintenance of NADPH were consistent with known changes in the cellular redox state during early zebrafish development. Together, these data suggest that Gata-1 and Nrf2a play differential roles in regulating the heme degradation enzymes during an early developmental period of heightened cellular stress.",

One of the first well-documented intraspecies venom variations comes from the Mohave rattlesnake (Crotalus scutulatus scutulatus). Initially, three types of venoms were described; type A venom is the most toxic as a result of ~\u00a045% Mojave toxin in the venom composition, type B lacks the Mojave toxin but contains over 50% of snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs). Also, type A\u00a0+\u00a0B venom contains a combination of Mojave toxin and SVMP. The use of an anti-disintegrin antibody in a simple Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) can be used to identify the difference between the venoms of the type A, B, and A\u00a0+\u00a0B Mohave rattlesnakes.

The proteins with neurotoxic effect were partially purified using low-pressure liquid chromatography techniques. Gel filtration (Sephadex G-50M) was used as the first step and the active fraction in crabs was passed through a QAE Sephadex A-25 column. Finally, the active fraction was run onto a Fractogel EMD SO3\u2212 column. No further purification step could be carried out due to the loss of neurotoxic activity. The Fractogel EMD SO3\u2212 fraction was analyzed electrophysiologically using the voltage-clamp technique in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing membrane proteins from rat brain through mRNA injection. The crude venom and a fraction were observed to affect crustaceans and showed at least two types of bioactivity in oocytes expressing brain proteins.

     "abstract": "The increase of temperature in marine coastal ecosystems due to atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions is becoming an increasing threat for biodiversity worldwide, and may affect organisms' biochemical performance, often resulting in biogeographical shifts of species distribution. At the same time, the introduction of non-native species into aquatic systems also threatens biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Oysters are among the most valuable socio economic group of bivalve species in global fishery landings, and also provide numerous ecosystem services. However, the introduction of non-native oyster species, namely Crassostrea gigas for aquaculture purposes may threaten native oyster species, mainly by out competing their native congeners. It is therefore of upmost importance to understand physiological and biochemical responses of native and introduced oyster species in a scenario of global temperature rise, in order to provide knowledge that may allow for better species management. Hence, we compared biochemical alterations of the introduced C. gigas and the native Crassostrea brasiliana, the most important oyster species in Brazil, in response to different thermal regimes for 28\u00a0days (24, 28 and 32\u00a0\u00b0C). For this, metabolism (ETS), energy content (GLY), antioxidant system (SOD, CAT and GSH/GSSG) and cellular damage (LPO) were assessed in adult and juvenile specimens of both species. Juvenile C. gigas were the most affected by increased temperatures, presenting higher mortality, more pronounced antioxidant response (SOD), whereas adults were more tolerant than juveniles, showing no mortality, no significant changes in antioxidant enzymes activity neither energy expenditure. Native C. brasiliana juveniles presented lower mortality and less pronounced biochemical alterations were noted at higher temperature comparing to non-native C. gigas juveniles. Adult C. brasiliana were the least responsive to tested temperatures. Results obtained in this study bring interesting new insights on different oyster species life stages' physiological and biochemical tolerance towards thermal stress. The native species C. brasiliana showed ability to maintain biochemical performance at higher temperatures, with less pronounced biochemical changes than the non-native species. The introduced (C. gigas) showed to be more sensitive, presenting biochemical alterations to cope with the increase of temperature. Despite the lower observed fitness of the introduced species to temperatures closer to those naturally experienced by the native species, the ability of C. gigas to cope with higher temperatures should still raise concerns towards the native species C. brasiliana management and protection.",

     "abstract": "Zinc is an essential metal that serves as a cofactor in a variety of cellular processes, including meiotic maturation. Cellular control of zinc uptake, availability and efflux is closely linked to meiotic progression in rodent and primate reproduction where large fluctuations in zinc levels are critical at several steps in the oocyte-to-embryo transition. Despite these well-documented roles of zinc fluxes during meiosis, only a few of the genes encoding key zinc receptors, membrane-spanning transporters, and downstream signaling pathway factors have been identified to date. Furthermore, little is known about analogous roles for zinc fluxes in the context of a whole organism. Here, we evaluate whether zinc availability regulates germline development and oocyte viability in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, an experimentally flexible model organism. We find that similar to mammals, mild zinc limitation in C. elegans profoundly impacts the reproductive axis: the brood size is significantly reduced under conditions of zinc limitation where other physiological functions are not perturbed. Zinc limitation in this organism has a more pronounced impact on oocytes than sperm and this leads to the decrease in viable embryo production. Moreover, acute zinc limitation of isolated zygotes prevents extrusion of the second polar body during meiosis and leads to aneuploid embryos. Thus, the zinc-dependent steps in C. elegans gametogenesis roughly parallel those described in meiotic-to-mitotic transitions in mammals.",

The genetic tractability, short generation time, and hermaphroditic reproduction of the nematode C. elegans offer distinct advantages for the study of impaired gametogenesis as a result of zinc deficiency. However the phenotypic reproductive effects arising from zinc restriction have not been established in this model. We therefore examined the effect of zinc deficiency on C. elegans reproduction by exposing worms to the zinc chelator N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine (TPEN). Treatment began at the early larval stage and continued until reproductive senescence. TPEN treatment reduced the total number of progeny produced by C. elegans hermaphrodites compared with control subjects, with the largest difference in output observed 48\u00a0h after larval stage 4. At this time-point, zinc deficient worms displayed fewer embryos in the uterus and disorganized oocyte development when observed under DIC microscopy. DAPI staining revealed impaired oogenesis and chromosome dynamics with an expanded region of pachytene stage oocytes extending into the proximal arm of the gonad. This phenotype was not seen in control or zinc-rescue subjects. This study demonstrates that reproduction in C. elegans is sensitive to environmental perturbations in zinc, indicating that this is a good model for future studies in zinc-mediated subfertility. Aberrant oocyte development and disruption of the pachytene-diplotene transition indicate that oogenesis in particular is affected by zinc deficiency in this model.",

No significant difference was detected in growth, biochemical parameters and gene expression among the three densities until at the final sampling (day 120). At the end of this trial, fish reared in HD group showed lower specific growth rate (SGR) and mean weight than those reared in LD and MD groups. Similarly, oxidative stress and metabolism analyses represented that antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH)) and metabolic enzymes (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)) clearly reduced in the liver of turbot reared in HD group. The gene expression data showed that glutathione S-transferase (GST), cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A), heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) and metallothionein (MT) mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated, and lysozyme (LYS) and hepcidin (HAMP) mRNA levels were significantly down-regulated in HD group on day 120.

     "abstract": "ABCG2 (BCRP \u2013 breast cancer resistance protein) belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. It plays an important role in the disposition and elimination of xeno- and endobiotics and/or their metabolites in mammals. Likewise, the protective role of ABC transporters, including Abcg2, has been reported for aquatic organisms. In our previous study we have cloned the full gene sequence of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) Abcg2a and showed its high expression in liver and primary hepatocytes. Based on those insights, the main goal of this study was to perform a detailed functional characterization of trout Abcg2a using insect ovary cells (Spodoptera frugiperda, Sf9) as a heterologous expression system. Membrane vesicles preparations from Sf9 cells were used for the ATPase assay determinations and basic biochemical properties of fish Abcg2a versus human ABCG2 have been compared. A series of 39 physiologically and/or environmentally relevant substances was then tested on interaction with trout Abcg2a and human ABCG2. Correlation analysis reveals highly similar pattern of activation and inhibition. Significant activation of trout Abcg2a ATPase was observed for prazosin, doxorubicine, sildenafil, furosemid, propranolol, fenofibrate and pheophorbide. Pesticides showed either a weak activation (malathione) or strong (endosulfan) to weak (chlorpyrifos, fenoxycarb, DDE) inhibition of trout Abcg2a ATPase while the highest activation was obtained for benzo(a)pyrene, curcumine and testosterone. In conclusion, data from this study offer the first characterization of fish Abcg2a, reveal potent interactors among physiologically or environmentally relevant substances and point to similarities regarding strengths and interactor preferences between human ABCG2 and fish Abcg2a.",

     "abstract": "Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms have been implicated in several key steps during early development, but the consequences of xenobiotic-induced PKC activation during early embryogenesis are still unknown. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) concentrations (0\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg/L) at different time points after fertilization. Results showed that 200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0PMA/L caused development of yolk bags, cardiac edema, slow blood flow, pulsating blood flow, slow pulse, elongated heart, lack of tail fins, curved tail, and coagulation. PMA exposure decreased survival rate of the embryos starting within the first 24\u00a0h and becoming more pronounced after prolonged exposure (96\u00a0h). PMA increased the number of apoptotic cells in the brain region as demonstrated by acridine orange staining and caused up-regulation of caspase 9 (casp9) and p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (puma) mRNA in whole embryos. PMA caused oxidative stress in the embryos as demonstrated by decreased mRNA expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase 2. Inhibition of Pkc with GF109203X improved overall survival rate, reduced apoptosis in the brain and decreased expression of casp9 and puma in the PMA-exposed embryos. However, Pkc inhibition neither prevented development of deformities nor reversed oxidative stress in the PMA-exposed embryos. These data suggest that direct over-activation of Pkc during early embryogenesis of zebrafish is associated with apoptosis and decreased survival rate of the embryos.",

Both gill Na+/K+-ATPase and H+-ATPase activities were undisturbed, while both kidney ATPase activities were up-regulated when challenged with the high Cu levels. Up-regulated kidney ATPase activities likely acted as compensatory strategy to enhance Na+ reabsorption.

To elucidate the ability of hedgehogs to metabolize xenobiotics, the animals were exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, pyrene. The in vivo exposure study indicated that pyrene was biotransformed to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, such as pyrene-1-glucuronide, pyrene-1-sulfate, and pyrenediol-sulfate, and excreted in the urine. Pyrene-1-glucuronide was the main metabolite, and limited sulfate conjugate excretion was observed. The main products excreted in feces were 1-hydroxypyrene and pyrene. Based on the results of the in vivo exposure study, in vitro enzymatic kinetic experiments were performed using various substrates and compared to rats and pigs. The enzyme efficiencies of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and warfarin 4\u2032-, 6-, and 8-hydroxylation activity in hedgehogs were lower than those of rats. Furthermore, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity in hedgehogs also had a lower Km value than that in pigs. Interestingly, the enzyme efficiencies of sulfation activity toward 1-hydroxypyrene and \u03b2-estradiol in hedgehogs were significantly lower than those in pigs. These observations suggested that phenol and estrogen sulfotransferases may have limited roles in xenobiotic metabolism in hedgehogs.",

Taking this into account, the aim of the present work was to characterize in depth the mechanisms underlying the toxic action of AgNPs using fish cell lines, determining specifically the contribution of alterations in cellular structures and oxidative stress time course to the cytotoxicity of AgNPs. Since liver plays a key role in detoxification, the hepatoma cell line PLHC-1 was used. Exposure to AgNPs (NM-300K, obtained from the Joint Research Centre Repository) caused alterations at the lysosomal and mitochondrial levels at lower concentrations than those that disrupted plasma membrane (evaluated by means of neutral red, alamarBlue, and 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, acetoxymethyl ester assays respectively). AgNO3, used as a control Ag+ ion source, produced similar cytotoxic effects but at lower concentrations than AgNPs. Both silver forms caused oxidative disruption but the initial response was delayed in AgNPs until 6\u00a0h of exposure. Transmission electron microscopy analysis also evidenced the disruption of mitochondrial structures in cells exposed to cytotoxic concentrations of both forms of silver. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, AgNPs were detected inside the nucleoli and mitochondria, thereby pointing to long-term effects. The present work evidences the mutual interaction between the induction of oxidative stress and the alterations of cellular structures, particularly mitochondria, as cytotoxicity mechanisms not exclusively associated to NPs.",

Therefore, the present study assessed the toxicity induced in the polychaete Diopatra neapolitana after a long-term (28\u00a0days) exposure to different As concentrations (0.0, 0.05, 0.25 and 1.25\u00a0mg/L).

Biochemical analysis included the measurement of different biomarkers such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), lipid peroxidation (LPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were assessed in order to evaluate oxidative stress. Physiological analyzes included the observation of polychaetes regenerative capacity and the quantification of organisms total protein (PROT) and glycogen (GLY) content. The results obtained allowed to confirm the suitability of these biomarkers to identify the toxicity caused by As and moreover revealed that D. neapolitana is a good bioindicator of As pollution.",

The lower and higher acclimation treatments resulted in embryos' enhanced resistance to this metal. Phospholipid remodeling activity, evident through arachidonic acid radioactivity incorporation increase in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SPH) fractions, was registered in embryos acclimated to the intermediate exposure condition. Concomitantly, a decrease in phosphatidic acid fraction (PA) was registered in the higher acclimation condition. PC/PE radioactivity ratio increased both for medium and high acclimation conditions from 0.493 in control embryos to 1.378 and 1.032 respectively. Phospholipid changes could be relevant for changes in membrane features associated with low level exposures to copper, preparing the embryo for a higher resistance to this metal. The increased resistance to copper could also be associated with both an increase in metallothioneins concentration, as registered with HPLC in all the acclimation conditions, and an increase in the copper bound to the third fraction of metallothioneins separated by this method. Our results point out that even very low level exposure to copper results in phospholipid metabolism changes that could be relevant for the acclimation phenomena.",

The following phylogenetic analysis divided the ers of heterobranchs and ceanogastropods in two branches.

Those paralogs from black rockfish (Sebastes schlegelii; RfGST\u03c9, RfGST\u03c1, and RfGST\u03b8, respectively) were molecularly, biochemically, and functionally characterized to determine their antioxidant extent and protective aptitudes upon pathogenic stress. RfGST\u03c9, RfGST\u03c1, and RfGST\u03b8, contained open reading frames of 717\u00a0bp, 678\u00a0bp, and 720\u00a0bp respectively, which encoded respective proteins of 239, 226, and 240 amino acids in length. In silico analysis revealed that all RfGSTs possessed characteristic N-terminal domains bearing glutathione (GSH)-binding sites, and C-terminal domains containing substrate-binding sites. Recombinant RfGST\u03c9 (rRfGST\u03c9) catalyzed the conjugation of GSH to dehydroascorbate (DHA), while rRfGST\u03b8 and rRfGST\u03c1 catalyzed to the model GST substrate 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Kinetic analysis revealed variation in Km and Vmax values for each rRfGST, indicating their different conjugation rates. The optimum conditions (pH and temperature) and inhibition assays of each protein demonstrated different optimal ranges showing their wide range of activity as an assembly. RfGST\u03c9 and RfGST\u03b8 paralogs demonstrated their antioxidant potential towards H2O2 and heavy metals (Cd, Zn, and Cu) in vitro, while RfGST\u03c1 had an antioxidant potential only towards heavy metals (Zn and Cu). Though all the paralogs were ubiquitously expressed in different magnitudes, RfGST\u03c9 was highly expressed in blood, whereas RfGST\u03c1 and RfGST\u03b8 were highly expressed in liver. The mRNA expression of RfGST\u03c9 and RfGST\u03b8, upon Streptococcus iniae and poly I:C stimulation, revealed a significantly up-regulated expression, whereas RfGST\u03c1 mRNA expression was significantly down-regulated. Collectively, our findings suggest that RfGST\u03c9, RfGST\u03c1, and RfGST\u03b8 paralogs are potent in detoxifying xenobiotic toxics, capable of protecting cells from oxidative stress generated by both H2O2 and heavy metals, and finally, yet importantly, stimulated under pathogenic stress signals.",

To examine the mechanism of hypercalcemia by NaF treatments, therefore, direct effects of NaF on osteoblasts and osteoclasts in goldfish were investigated by an original assay system using teleost scale which has osteoblasts, osteoclasts and bone matrix.

To investigate the osteoclastic activation, the mRNA expression of osteoclastogenesis related factors were examined. The receptor activator of the nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) which is known as a factor for osteoclastogenesis, increased in the NaF-treated scales after 6\u00a0h of incubation. The ratio of RANKL/osteoprotegerin (osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor) significantly increased after 6\u00a0h of incubation. Resulting from the increase of RANKL mRNA level, the expression of transcription-regulating factors was significantly increased. Furthermore, the expression of functional genes, cathepsin K and matrix metalloproteinase-9 mRNA, was significantly increased.

To establish whether the observed changes in gene expression could be explained by the modulation of selected nuclear receptors by FLX, we employed panel of reporter gene assays in agonistic and antagonistic modes. Apart from minor activation of ER\u03b1 after exposure to high concentrations (5\u00a0\u03bcM), FLX did not activate or inhibit the nuclear receptors tested. Further study is required to determine whether the observed downregulation of ovarian aromatase expression and liver estrogen-regulated genes also occurs at environmentally relevant FLX concentrations over longer exposure periods.",

     "abstract": "Due to the nature of their habitat, which contains a high level of pollutants, estuarine crabs are at great risk of exposure to contaminants such as cadmium. Thus, in this study, the effects of cadmium on lipid metabolism were investigated in estuarine crab Chiromantes dehaani. Adult female estuarine crabs were randomly exposed to 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1\u00a0mg/L of CdCl2 for 7, 14 and 21\u00a0days, after which the lipid contents of the hepatopancreas and ovary were measured. Also, the substance contents and the activities of the enzyme in lipid digestion, lipid synthesis and lipid transport metabolism were analyzed. The results showed that the lipid contents in the hepatopancreas and ovary of the exposed crabs decreased after prolonged exposure to cadmium compared to the control. The lipase activity decreased while the activities of fatty acid synthase and acetyl coenzyme A in the hepatopancreas increased on day 7 but decreased on days 14 and 21. Moreover, the change in non-esterified fatty acid level was similar to fatty acid synthase. The level of low-density lipoprotein increased in the exposed crabs compared to the control group while the level of high-density lipoprotein and the activity of lipoprotein lipase decreased at a higher concentration of cadmium and longer exposure time. These observations suggest that cadmium decreases the lipid content by weakening the ability of digestion, transportation and synthase of lipid, thus affecting hepatopancreas and ovary indices.",

     "abstract": "Nanoparticles released into the environment could pose a risk to resident organisms that feed on suspended particles in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of silver nanoparticles (nanoAg) of different sizes in freshwater mussels using a multi-elemental (metallomic) approach in order to determine signature effects of nanoparticulate and ionic Ag. Mussels were exposed to three concentrations (0.8, 4 and 20\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of 20-nm and 80-nm nanoAg and AgNO3 for 48\u00a0h at 15\u00a0\u00b0C. After the exposure period, mussels were placed in clean, aerated water for a depuration step and analyzed for the following total elements in gill, digestive gland and gonad tissues: Al, Ag, As, Ba, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Pb, Na, Ni, Se, Sr, Th, U, V and Zn. Metallothioneins (MT; digestive gland only) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were also determined in gills, digestive glands and gonads. The 20-nm-diameter nanoAg was detected in all three tissues at 20\u00a0\u03bcg/L, while the 80-nm nanoAg was detected more strongly in the digestive gland. Ionic Ag was found at higher levels in gills than in other tissues. Correlation analysis revealed that gonad Ag levels were significantly correlated with Al (r\u00a0=\u00a00.28), V (r\u00a0=\u00a00.28), Cr (r\u00a0=\u00a00.31), Co (r\u00a0=\u00a00.32), Se (r\u00a0=\u00a00.34) and MT levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.28). Indeed, the MT levels in the digestive gland were significantly increased by 20-nm nanoAg (20\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and 80-nm nanoAg (4\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and AgNO3 (<\u00a00.8\u00a0\u03bcg/L). LPO was observed in gills, digestive glands and even gonads for all Ag forms. Discriminant function analysis revealed that all forms of Ag differed from each other and from unexposed mussels, where ionic Ag was more closely related to the 80-nm-diameter nanoAg. Factorial analysis revealed that Ba, Ca, Co, Mn, Sr, U and Zn had consistently high factorial weights in all tissues; that explained 80% of the total variance. Moreover, the following elements showed strong correlations (r\u00a0>\u00a00.7) with each other: Sr, Ba, Zn, Ca, Mg Cr, Mn and U. Comparisons of these elements with other elements showing low or no correlations (e.g., transition elements) revealed that these elements had significantly lower standard reduction potential and electronegativity, suggesting that stronger reducing elements were most influenced by the oxidizing effects of nanoAg and ionic Ag in tissues. Indeed, tissues with oxidative stress (LPO) had decreased levels for most of these reducing elements. We conclude that exposure to Ag nanoparticles produces a characteristic change in the elemental composition of gills, digestive gland and gonad tissues in freshwater mussels. Elements most responsive to oxidative stress were more influenced by both nanoAg and ionic Ag. Sr and Ba were readily decreased by Ag and appeared to respond more sensitively to nanoAg than to ionic Ag. The metallomic approach could contribute in the understanding of fundamental mode of action of nanoparticles in mussels.",

The study was conducted in the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) from the Gulf of Gda\u0144sk. mRNA abundance was measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in liver RNA of fish sampled from three coastal stations and from one offshore station in the inner Gulf. The contribution of the mRNA-based biomarkers to the assessment of the environment was determined in conjunction with a selection of commonly applied biochemical markers: 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), metallothioneins (MT), fluorescent aromatic compounds (FACs), all measured in the same individual fish. The mRNA biomarkers contributed to the separation between the sampling sites, but no correlations between CYP1A mRNA and EROD nor between MT mRNA and MT proteins were found, which should be attributed to the different levels these biomarkers correspond to and to the differences in factors that may affect them. One case of strong correlation between CYP1A mRNA and FACs was encountered. The overall results of this study suggest that biomarkers measured at the mRNA abundance level constitute a valuable addition to biomonitoring studies by providing additional information and contributing to the differentiation of results.",

     "abstract": "Several environmental stressors have been identified as key and/or emerging drivers of habitat change that could significantly influence marine near-shore ecosystems. These include increasing discharges of pharmaceutical contaminants into the aquatic coastal systems. Pharmaceutical drugs are often detected in aquatic environments but still information on their toxicity impacts on inhabiting species is scarce, especially when acting in combination. Furthermore, almost no information is available on the impacts of pharmaceuticals in polychaetes, often the most abundant taxon in benthic communities and commonly used as indicator species of environmental conditions. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the biochemical alterations induced in the polychaete Hediste diversicolor, from a low contaminated area at the Ria de Aveiro lagoon (Portugal), by the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (0.0 - control, 0.3, 3.0, 6.0 and 9.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and the stimulant caffeine (0.0 - control, 0.5, 3.0, and 18.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L), acting alone and in combination (0.3 CBZ\u00a0+\u00a00.5 CAF and 6.0 CBZ\u00a0+\u00a03.0 CAF). Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities was determined in Hediste diversicolor from each condition. Lipid peroxidation (LPO), glutathione reduced and oxidized (GSH and GSSG), glycogen and electron transport system (ETS) were also measured. The results obtained clearly revealed that both drugs induced oxidative stress in H. diversicolor, shown by the increase on LPO levels and decrease on total glutathione and GSH/GSSG ratio with the increase of exposure concentrations. Furthermore, the present findings demonstrated that polychaetes biotransformation capacity as well as antioxidant defense mechanisms were not sufficiently efficient to fight against the excess of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to LPO when organisms were exposed to both drugs. Our results also demonstrated that polychaetes tended to decrease the activity of ETS when exposed to drugs, avoiding energy expenditure which may prevent them from greater damages. The present study further revealed that the impacts induced by the combination of both drugs were similar to those obtained at the highest drugs concentrations acting alone.",

Moderately strong AHR agonists, for example benzo[a]pyrene and \u03b2-naphthoflavone, are capable of causing similar cardiotoxic effects, particularly when coupled with cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) inhibitors (e.g., fluoranthene (FL). Additionally, some weaker AHR agonists (carbaryl, 2-methylindole, 3-methylindole, and phenanthrene) are known to also cause cardiotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos when coupled with FL; however, the cardiotoxic effects were not mediated specifically by AHR stimulation. This study was performed to determine if binary exposure to weak AHR agonists and FL were also capable of causing cardiotoxicity in Atlantic killifish Fundulus heteroclitus embryos. Binary exposures were performed in both na\u00efve and PAH-adapted killifish embryos to examine resistance to weak agonists and FL binary exposures. Weak agonists used in this study included the following: carbaryl, phenanthrene, 2-methylindole, 3-methylindole, indigo, and indirubin. Carbaryl, indigo, and indirubin induced the highest CYP1 activity levels in na\u00efve killifish embryos, but no significant CYP1 induction was observed in the PAH-adapted killifish.Embryos were coexposed to subteratogenic levels of each agonist and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/L FL to assess if binary administration could cause cardiotoxicity. Indigo and indirubin coupled with FL caused cardiac teratogenesis in na\u00efve killifish, but coexposures did not produce cardiac chamber abnormalities in the PAH-adapted population. Knockdown of AHR2 in na\u00efve killifish embryos did not prevent cardiac teratogenesis. The data suggest a unique mechanism of cardiotoxicity that is not driven by AHR2 activation.",

After that possible ZEN effects on enzyme activities in kidney, spleen, liver and muscle tissue were investigated to get an organism-wide aspect of ZEN effects. Most organs appeared to (over)compensate ZEN effects during the exposure to this mycotoxin, which caused metabolic costs. Oxygen consumption increased in fish treated with the two higher ZEN concentrations via the diet. The differences between the treatments persisted also after the recovery phase of two weeks. Thus, the present study provided evidence of effects of ZEN on carbohydrate metabolism, lipid peroxidation in organs and metabolic oxygen demand. This is the first evidence for increased metabolic costs in a fish species due to exposure to the mycotoxin ZEN.",

     "abstract": "Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is well conserved from invertebrates to vertebrates, and it mediates the toxic effects of exogenous ligands, including dioxins. Recent studies reported that AHRs activated by endogenous ligands play critical roles in mammalian physiological homeostasis. Avian species possess at least two AHR isoforms (AHR1 and AHR2), which exhibit species- and isoform-specific transactivation potencies to exogenous ligands, whereas mammals possess a single AHR. To delineate the profiles and roles of endogenous ligands for avian AHR isoforms, we investigated in vitro transactivation potencies of avian AHRs (AHR1 and AHR2 from the jungle crow, Corvus macrorhynchos; common cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; and black-footed albatross, Phoebastria nigripes) treated with the endogenous tryptophan metabolites 6-formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole (FICZ), l-kynurenine (l-Kyn), kynurenic acid (KYNA), and indoxyl sulfate (IS). Furthermore, we analyzed the binding mode of these ligands to each avian AHR isoform by in silico docking simulations. The EC50 of FICZ (0.009\u20130.032\u00a0nM) was similar regardless of the species or isoform of AHR. The estimated in silico binding mode of FICZ to AHRs was well conserved in both isoforms. The transactivation potencies of avian AHRs to other tryptophan metabolites were 105\u2013107 fold lower than those for FICZ, and EC50 values varied in a species- and isoform-specific manner. This was consistent with poor conservation of the binding mode of l-Kyn, KYNA, and IS predicted in in silico docking simulations. Our results suggest that in avian species, FICZ is the most potent endogenous AHR ligand, and that AHR1 and AHR2 are physiologically functional.",

First, adult female yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were exposed to dietary MeHg (0, 0.5, 5, 50\u00a0ppm) for 16\u00a0weeks throughout the gonadal development period. In different brain regions and liver, GABA-benzodiazepine (BZ), dopamine (D2), estrogen (ERs) and androgen receptors (ARs), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) were measured. Saturation curves revealed a MeHg-dependent increase of the maximum binding (Bmax) of D2 receptor in the hypothalamus versus controls (284\u2013606%), concomitant with a decrease in receptor affinity (up to 984% lower). The activity of MAO was enhanced in different brain regions of exposed fish (240\u2013383% in the hypothalamus). MeHg concentrations were negatively correlated with the number of ERs in all brain regions except for the hypothalamus.

There was no evidence of impacts on receptors, but the activities of GS, GAD and MAO (except in yellow perch) were inhibited by both MeHgCl and HgCl2 in a species-dependent manner.

Present investigation deals with estimation of cellular aggregation, generation of ROS and activities of antioxidant enzymes, lysozyme and acetylcholinesterase in the cells of E. carteri under the environmentally realistic concentrations of washing soda. Prolonged treatment of washing soda inhibited the degree of cellular aggregation. Experimental exposure of 8 and 16\u00a0mg/l of sodium carbonate for 48\u00a0h elevated the physiological level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in the agranulocytes, semigranulocytes and granulocytes of E. carteri, whereas, treatment of 192\u00a0h inhibited the ROS generation in three cellular morphotypes. Activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase were recorded to be inhibited under prolonged exposure of washing soda. Washing soda mediated inhibition of ROS generation and depletion in the activities of antioxidant enzymes were indicative to an undesirable shift in cytotoxic status and antioxidative defense in E. carteri. Inhibition in the activity of lysozyme under the treatment of sodium carbonate was suggestive to a severe impairment of the innate immunological efficiency of E. carteri distributed in the washing soda contaminated habitat. Washing soda mediated inhibition in the activity of acetylcholinesterase indicated its neurotoxicity in E. carteri. Washing soda, a reported environmental contaminant, affected adversely the immunophysiological status of E. carteri with reference to cellular aggregation, oxidative stress, antioxidative defense, lysozyme and acetylcholinesterase activity.",

Hence, NADPH is involved in the growth and proliferation processes. In addition, it has been shown that changes in nutritional conditions produced changes in NADPH levels and growth rate. Maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene of natural origin, is able to stimulate NADPH production, through regulation of the two oxidative phase dehydrogenases of the pentose phosphate pathway. Our main objective was to study the effects of MA on the kinetic behaviour and on the molecular expression of two NADPH-generating systems, NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-IDH) and malic enzyme (ME), in the liver and white muscle of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). Four groups of 12\u00a0g of a mean body mass were fed for 210\u00a0days in a fish farm, with diets containing 0 (control), and 0.1\u00a0g of MA per kg of diet. Two groups were fed ad libitum (C-AL and MA-AL) and another's two, with restricted diet of 1% of fish weight (C-R and MA-R). Results showed that MA significantly increased the main kinetic parameter of the NADPH-forming enzymes (NADP-IDH and ME). In this sense, specific activity, maximum velocity, catalytic efficiency and activity ratio values were higher in MA conditions than control groups. Moreover, these changes were observed in both feeding regimen, AL and R. Meanwhile, the Michaelis constant changed mainly in groups fed with the MA and restricted diet, these changes are related to the best substrate affinity by enzyme. Moreover, in the Western-blot result, we found that MA increased both protein levels studied, this behaviour being consistent with the regulation of the number of enzyme molecules. All results, indicate that MA, independently of the fed regimen, could potentially be a nutritional additive for fish as it improved the metabolic state of fish, as consequence of increased activity and expression of NADP-IDH and ME enzymes.",

The 5-HT outflow induced by NaHS, an H2S donor, and Na2S3, a polysulfide, was measured by using a HPLC equipped with an electrochemical detector. NaHS (0.3\u20133\u00a0mM) caused a concentration-dependent increase in 5-HT outflow, which was significantly inhibited by the removal of extracellular Ca2\u00a0+. 5-HT outflow induced by NaHS (0.3\u00a0mM) was also significantly inhibited by voltage-dependent L- and N-type Ca2\u00a0+ channel blockers and a selective TRPA1 channel blocker. Cinnamaldehyde, a TRPA1 agonist, mimicked the secretory response to H2S. 5-HT outflow induced by Na2S3 (10\u00a0\u03bcM) was also inhibited by the TRPA1 channel blocker. Furthermore, the expression of TRPA1 was localized to 5-HT-containing chemoreceptor cells in the aortic wall.

Rainbow trout and common carp were dosed orally with feed containing the pesticide methoxychlor (MXC) for 14\u00a0days. In parallel, in vitro incubations using suspensions of freshly isolated or cryopreserved primary hepatocytes obtained from both species were performed. In vivo and in vitro samples were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography with authentic standards supported by HPLC-MS. Comparable metabolite patterns from a qualitative perspective were observed in liver in vivo and in hepatocyte suspensions in vitro. Species specific differences of MXC metabolite patterns observed between rainbow trout and common carp in vivo were well reflected by experiments with hepatocytes in vitro. Finally, cryopreserved hepatocytes produced comparable metabolite patterns to freshly isolated cells. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro hepatocyte assay could be used to identify metabolite patterns of pesticides in farmed fish and could thus serve as a valuable tool to support in vivo studies as required for pesticides approval according to the EU regulation 1107.",

     "abstract": "The organochlorine pesticide endosulfan (ES) is used in several countries as a wide spectrum insecticide on crops with high commercial value. Due to its high toxicity to non-target animals, its persistence in the environment and its ability to act as an endocrine disrupting compound in fish, ES use is currently banned or restricted in many other countries. Previous studies on the cichlid fish Cichlasoma dimerus have shown that waterborne exposure to ES can lead to both decreased pituitary FSH content and histological alterations of testes. As gonadotropin-stimulated sex steroids release from gonads was inhibited by ES in vitro, the aim of the present study was to elucidate possible mechanisms of disruption of ES on gonadal steroidogenesis in C. dimerus, as well as compare the action of the active ingredient (AI) with that of currently used commercial formulations (CF). Testis and ovary fragments were incubated with ES (AI or CF) and/or steroidogenesis activators or precursors. Testosterone and estradiol levels were measured in the incubation media. By itself, ES did not affect hormone levels. Co-incubation with LH and the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin caused a decrease of the stimulated sex steroids release. When co-incubated with precursors dehydroandrostenedione and 17\u03b1hydroxyprogesterone, ES did not affect the increase caused by their addition alone. No differences were observed between the AI and CFs, suggesting that the effect on steroidogenesis disruption is mainly caused by the AI. Results indicate that action of ES takes place downstream of LH-receptor activation and upstream of the studied steroidogenic enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Copper, an essential microelement, is known to be toxic to aquatic life at concentrations higher than that could be tolerated. Copper-induced oxidative stress has been documented in vitro, yet the in vivo effects of metal-induced oxidative stress have not been extensively studied in the lower invertebrates. The objective of the present study has been to find the effect of ROS-mediated toxicity of environmentally relevant concentrations of copper at organismal and cellular levels in Hydra magnipapillata. Exposure to copper at sublethal concentrations (0.06 and 0.1\u00a0mg/L) for 24 or 48\u00a0h resulted in generation of significant levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). We infer that the free radicals here originate predominantly at the lysosomes but partly at the mitochondria also as visualized by H2-DHCFDA staining. Quantitative real-time PCR of RNA extracted from copper-exposed polyps revealed dose-dependent up-regulation of all antioxidant response genes (CAT, SOD, GPx, GST, GR, G6PD). Concurrent increase of Hsp70 and FoxO genes suggests the ability of polyps to respond to stress, which at 48\u00a0h was not the same as at 24\u00a0h. Interestingly, the transcript levels of all genes were down-regulated at 48\u00a0h as compared to 24\u00a0h incubation period. Comet assay indicated copper as a powerful genotoxicant, and the DNA damage was dose- as well as duration-dependent. Western blotting of proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3) confirmed ROS-mediated mitochondrial cell death in copper-exposed animals. These changes correlated well with changes in morphology, regeneration and aspects of reproduction. Taken together, the results indicate increased production of intracellular ROS in Hydra on copper exposure.",

Currently, the most common way to avoid marine biofouling involves the use of biocidal products in surface coatings. However, the need for environmentally friendly antibiofouling compounds has increased rapidly with the recent global prohibition of harmful antifoulants, such as tributyltin (TBT). In particular, periphytic diatoms have been shown to contribute significantly to biofilms, which play an important role in biofouling. Therefore, inhibiting the proliferation of fouling diatoms is a very important step in the prevention of marine biofouling. In this study, we developed a new, rapid, accurate, and convenient growth inhibition assay using the XTT colorimetric method to prevent the growth of the fouling periphytic diatom, Nitzschia amabilis Hidek. Suzuki (replaced synonym, Nitzschia laevis Hustedt). The feasibility of this method was verified by determining the growth inhibition activities of two standard photosynthetic inhibitors, DCMU and CuSO4. However, neither inhibitor had any cytotoxic activities at the range of concentrations tested. Moreover, this method was applied by screening and purification of herbicidic but non-cytotoxic compounds from cyanobacteria extracts. Our results demonstrate the utility of this newly established growth inhibition assay for the identification of marine anti-biofouling compounds.",

This study focuses on the xenobiotic metabolism of ZFE at different life-stages using the pharmaceutical compound clofibric acid as study compound. Liquid chromatography with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF-MS) is used to detect and to identify the transformation products (TPs). In screening experiments, a total of 18 TPs was detected and structure proposals were elaborated for 17 TPs, formed by phase I and phase II metabolism. Biotransformation of clofibric acid by the ZFE involves conjugation with sulfate or glucuronic acid, and, reported here for the first time, with carnitine, taurine, and aminomethanesulfonic acid. Further yet unknown cyclization products were identified using non-target screening that may represent a new detoxification pathway. Sulfate containing TPs occurred already after 3\u00a0h of exposure (7\u00a0hpf), and from 48\u00a0h of exposure (52\u00a0hpf) onwards, all TPs were detected. The detection of these TPs indicates the activity of phase I and phase II enzymes already at early life-stages. Additionally, the excretion of one TP into the exposure medium was observed. The results of this study outline the high metabolic potential of the ZFE with respect to the transformation of xenobiotics. Similarities but also differences to other test systems were observed. Biotransformation of test chemicals in toxicity testing with ZFE may therefore need further consideration.",

TXN members are involved in a wide range of biochemical and biological functions including redox regulation, refolding of disulfide containing proteins, and regulation of transcription factors. In the present study, a thioredoxin domain-containing protein 12 was identified and characterized from black rockfish, Sebastes schlegelii (RfTXNDC12). The full length of RfTXNDC12 consists of a 522-bp coding region encoding a 173-amino acid protein. It has a 29-amino acid signal peptide and a single TXN active site with a consensus atypical WCGAC active motif. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the active site is conserved among vertebrates. RfTXNDC12 shares highest identity with its Epinephelus coioides homolog. Transcriptional analysis revealed its ubiquitous expression in a wide range of tissues with the highest expression in the ovary. Immune challenges conducted with Streptococcus iniae and poly I:C caused upregulation of RfTXNDC12 transcript levels in gills and peripheral blood cells (PBCs), while lipopolysaccharide injection caused downregulation of RfTXNDC12 in gills and upregulation in PBCs. Similar to TXN, RfTXNDC12 exhibited insulin disulfide reducing activity. Interestingly, the recombinant protein showed significant protection of LNCaP cells against apoptosis induced by H2O2-mediated oxidative stress in a concentration dependent manner. Collectively, the present data indicate that RfTXNDC12 is a TXN superfamily member, which could function as a potential antioxidant enzyme and be involved in a defense mechanism against immune challenges.",

The purpose of the present research was to observe the effect of tributyltin (TBT), a risk factor for vascular disorders, on porcine Aortic Vascular Precursor Cells (pAVPCs) in term of cytotoxicity, gene expression profile, functionality and differentiation potential. We have demonstrated that pAVPCs morphology deeply changed following TBT treatment. After 48\u00a0h a cytotoxic effect has been detected and Annexin binding assay demonstrated that TBT induced apoptosis.The transcriptional profile of characteristic pericyte markers has been altered: TBT 10\u00a0nM substantially induced alpha-SMA, while, TBT 500\u00a0nM determined a significant reduction of all pericyte markers. IL-6 protein detected in the medium of pAVPCs treated with TBT at both doses studied and with a dose response. TBT has interfered with normal pAVPC functionality preventing their ability to support a capillary-like network. In addition TBT has determined an increase of pAVPC adipogenic differentiation.In conclusion in the present paper we have demonstrated that TBT alters the vascular stem cells in terms of structure, functionality and differentiating capability, therefore effects of TBT in blood should be deeply explored to understand the potential vascular risk associated with the alteration of vascular stem cell physiology.",

     "abstract": "Embryos of oviparous fish, in contrast to (ovo) viviparous species, develop in the aquatic environment, and therefore need solute transport systems at their body surfaces for maintaining internal homeostasis and defending against potentially harmful substances. We hypothesized that solute transporters undergo changes in tissue distribution from the embryo to the larval stage. We therefore studied the mRNA profiles of eight ABC transporters (abcb1a, abcb1b, abcc1, abcc2, abcc3, abcc4, abcc5, abcg2) and three solute carriers (oatp1d, putative oatp2 putative, mate1) in different body regions (head, yolk sac epithelium, abdominal viscera, skin/muscles) of developing rainbow trout. Additionally, we investigated mRNA levels of phase I (cyp1a, cyp3a) and phase II (gstp, putative ugt1, putative ugt2) biotransformation enzymes. The study covered the developmental period from the eleuthero-embryo stage to the first-feeding larval stage (1\u201320\u00a0days post-hatch, dph). At 1\u00a0dph, transcripts of abcc2, abcc4, abcg2, cyp3a, gstp, putative mate1, and putative oatp2 occurred primarily in the yolk sac epithelium, whereas at later stages expression of these genes was predominantly observed in the abdominal viscera. The functional activity of ABC transporters in fish early life stages was assessed by rhodamine B accumulation assays. Finally, we investigated the potential impact of xenobiotics (clotrimazole, clofibric acid) on the ABC and biotransformation systems of trout early life stages. While clofibric acid had no effect, clotrimazole lead to an increased rhodamine B accumulation. The results provide evidence that the transition from the eleuthero-embryo to the larval stage is accompanied by a major alteration in tissue expression of ABC transporters.",

The use of vertebrates as preclinical research models is limited by their long generation times, low numbers of progeny and ethical concerns. In contrast, invertebrates such as insects breed rapidly, produce many offspring and are more ethically acceptable, allowing them to be used for high-throughput screening. Here, we established Tribolium castaneum as a model to screen for the effect of drugs on complex fitness parameters and the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes. We tested diets supplemented with the psychoactive drug valproic acid (VPA), which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor, or the antioxidant curcumin, which is a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor. We found that VPA delayed development, reduced longevity, and increased female body weight compared to a control diet. Fertility and fecundity declined and the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes was induced in the untreated F1 generation. In contrast, curcumin did not affect development or body weight, but it increased longevity, caused a significant reduction in fertility, and induced the expression of epigenetic regulatory genes mostly in the treated F0 generation. VPA and curcumin administered to vertebrate models have similar effects to those we observed in T. castaneum, confirming that this beetle is potentially useful as an alternative model to screen for the epigenetic effect of drugs. T. castaneum also provides a valuable early warning system for transgenerational epigenetic risk factors that are difficult to detect in mammals.",

Partial replacement of fish ingredients by vegetable ingredients in aquafeeds has led to increased levels of PAHs in marine farmed fish. We therefore investigated, intestinal uptake, tissue distribution and PAH metabolism after a single dose of 14C-benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) or 14C-phenanthrene (PHE) given to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) acclimatized to a fish oil or vegetable oil based diet. Both BaP and PHE were absorbed along the intestine. Fish oil based feed increased BaP concentration in the pyloric caeca and that of PHE in the proximal intestine. In contrast, vegetable oil increased BaP concentrations in the distal intestine. Extraction of whole body autoradiograms removed PHE-associated radiolabeling almost completely from the intestinal mucosa, but not BaP-associated radiolabeling, indicating the presence of BaP metabolites bound to cellular macromolecules. This observation correlates with the increased cyp1a expression in the proximal intestine, distal intestine and liver in the BaP exposed group. Furthermore, BaP-induced cyp1a expression was higher in the distal intestine of salmon fed fish oil compared to the vegetable oil fed group. PHE had no significant effect on cyp1a expression in any of these tissues.We conclude that dietary lipid composition affects intestinal PAH uptake. Fish oil based feed increased intestinal PAH concentrations probably due to an enhanced solubility in micelles composed of fish oil fatty acids. Increased BaP accumulation in the distal intestine of vegetable oil fed fish seems to be associated with a reduced Cyp1a-mediated BaP metabolism.",

This study compared the neuromuscular depressant activity of the venoms of N. kaouthia from Malaysia (NK-M), Thailand (NK-T) and Vietnam (NK-V), and the neutralization of neurotoxicity by a monospecific antivenom. On chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation, all venoms abolished the indirect twitches, with NK-T venom being the most potent (shortest t90, time to 90% twitch inhibition), followed by NK-V and NK-M. Acetylcholine and carbachol failed to reverse the blockade, indicating irreversible/pseudo-irreversible post-synaptic neuromuscular blockade. KCl restored the twitches variably (NK-M preparation being the least responsive), consistent with different degree of muscle damage. The findings support that NK-T venom has the most abundant curarimimetic alpha-neurotoxins, while NK-M venom contains more tissue-damaging cytotoxins. Pre-incubation of tissue with N. kaouthia monovalent antivenom (NKMAV) prevented venom-induced twitch depression, with the NK-T preparation needing the largest antivenom dose. NKMAV added after the onset of neuromuscular depression could only halt the inhibitory progression but failed to restore full contraction. The findings highlight the urgency of early antivenom administration to sequester as much circulating neurotoxins as possible, thereby hastening toxin elimination from the circulation. In envenomed mice, NKMAV administered upon the first neurological sign neutralized the neurotoxic effect, with the slowest full recovery noticed in the NK-T group. This is consistent with the high abundance of neurotoxins in the NK-T venom, implying that a larger amount or repeated dosing of NKMAV may be required in NK-T envenomation.",

The purified Lv was a phospholipoglycoprotein with apparent molecular weight of ~\u00a0445\u00a0kDa, and separated into three polypeptides corresponding to ~\u00a0117, ~\u00a0102, and ~\u00a023.8\u00a0kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Using the purified Lv and anti-Lv antibody, a sandwich ELISA with a detection limit of 4.3\u00a0ng/mL and a detection range from 7.8 to 250\u00a0ng/mL was developed. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were both below 10%. Moreover, the Lv standard curve was nearly identical to the Vtg standard curve, and paralleled serial whole-body homogenate dilutions of male zebrafish exposed to 17\u03b2-estradiol, demonstrating that the Lv-based ELISA could be used for quantification of zebrafish Vtg. Zebrafish Lv showed high stability during purification process, heat treatment, \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C storage, and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Additionally, the standard curve of Lv stored at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0months exhibited higher robustness than that of Vtg stored under the same conditions.

In the present study, the effects of a glyphosate-based herbicide (Roundup [Original]) were investigated regarding oxidative stress, the antioxidant defence system and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in Drosophila melanogaster. Flies (of both genders) that were 1 to 3\u00a0days old were exposed to different glyphosate concentrations (0.0\u00a0mg/L\u00a0=\u00a0control, 1.0\u00a0mg/L, 2.0\u00a0mg/L, 5.0\u00a0mg/L and 10.0\u00a0mg/L) in the diet for 24\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h. After the exposure periods, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were quantified. In addition, the mRNA expression of antioxidant genes (i.e., keap1, sod, sod2, cat, irc, gclc, gclm, gss, trxt, trxr-1 and trxr-2) was evaluated via RT-PCR. Additionally, AChE activity was evaluated only after the 96\u00a0h exposure period. The results indicated that Roundup exposure leads to a reduction in ROS levels in flies exposed for 96\u00a0h. ACAP levels and gene expression of the antioxidant defence system exhibited an increase from 24\u00a0h, while LPO did not show any significant alterations in both exposure periods. AChE activity was not affected following Roundup exposure. Our data suggest that Roundup exposure causes an early activation of the antioxidant defence system in D. melanogaster, and this can prevent subsequent damage caused by ROS.",

The mudflat fiddler crab Uca rapax is a typical estuarine crab, abundant in both pristine and contaminated areas along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. This study evaluates osmotic and ionic regulatory ability and gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity in different salinities (<\u00a00.5, 25 and 60\u2030 S) and oxygen consumption rates at different temperatures (15, 25 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C) in U. rapax collected from localities along the coast of S\u00e3o Paulo State showing different histories of metal contamination (most contaminated Ilha Diana, Santos\u00a0>\u00a0Rio Itapanha\u00fa, Bertioga\u00a0>\u00a0Picinguaba, Ubatuba [pristine reference site]). Our findings show that the contamination of U. rapax by metals in situ leads to bioaccumulation and induces biochemical and physiological changes compared to crabs from the pristine locality. U. rapax from the contaminated sites exhibit stronger hyper- and hypo-osmotic regulatory abilities and show greater gill Na+/K+-ATPase activities than crabs from the pristine site, revealing that the underlying biochemical machinery can maintain systemic physiological processes functioning well. However, oxygen consumption, particularly at elevated temperatures, decreases in crabs showing high bioaccumulation titers but increases in crabs with low/moderate bioaccumulation levels. These data show that U. rapax chronically contaminated in situ exhibits compensatory biochemical and physiological adjustments, and reveal the importance of studies on organisms exposed to metals in situ, particularly estuarine invertebrates subject to frequent changes in natural environmental parameters like salinity and temperature.",

The level of 11\u03b2-HSD2, which is required for the conversion of cortisol to cortisone, was increased in the kidney, intestine, brain, and hepatopancreas, whereas the expression of 11\u03b2-HSD1, which encodes the reverse conversion enzyme, was increased in the gill, kidney and almost unchanged in other tissues. The enzyme activity concentration of 11\u03b2-HSD2 was increased in the kidney as well. The level of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) decreased in the intestine, gill and muscle, and the key GR regulator FK506 binding protein5 (FKBP5) was up-regulated in the GR-decreased tissues, whereas the level of nuclear receptor co-repressor 1 (NCoR1), another GR regulator remained almost unchanged. Thus, GR, FKBP5 and 11\u03b2-HSD2 may be involved in Cd-induced cortisol disruption.",

     "abstract": "Metal contamination at low levels is an important issue because it usually produces health and environmental effects, either positive or deleterious. Contamination of surface waters with copper (Cu) is a worldwide event, usually originated by mining, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and residential activities. Water quality criteria for Cu are variable among countries but allowed limits are generally in the \u03bcg/L range, which can disrupt several functions in the early life-stages of fish species. Behavioral and biochemical alterations after Cu exposure have also been described at concentrations close to the allowed limits. Aiming to search for the effects of Cu in the range of the allowed limits, larvae and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (nominally: 0, 5, 9, 20 and 60\u00a0\u03bcg/L; measured: 0.4, 5.7, 7.2 16.6 and 42.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively) for 96\u00a0h. Larvae swimming and body length, and adult behavior and biochemical biomarkers (activity of glutathione-related enzymes in gills, muscle, and brain) were assessed after Cu exposure. Several effects were observed in fish exposed to 9\u00a0\u03bcg/L nominal Cu, including increased larvae swimming distance and velocity, abolishment of adult inhibitory avoidance memory, and decreased glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity in gills of adult fish. At the highest Cu concentration tested (nominally: 60\u00a0\u03bcg/L), body length of larvae, spatial memory of adults, and gill GST activity were decreased. Social behavior (aggressiveness and conspecific interaction), and glutathione reductase (GR) activity were not affected in adult zebrafish. Exposure to Cu, at concentrations close to the water quality criteria for this metal in fresh water, was able to alter larvae swimming performance and to induce detrimental effects on the behavior of adult zebrafish, thus indicating the need for further studies to reevaluate the currently allowed limits for Cu in fresh water.",

The median lethal concentration (LC50) of TCS (393.1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) and TCC (388.1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) was also determined in the same species. In TCS- and TCC-exposed B. koreanus, growth retardation and reduced fecundity were observed and were shown to have a potentially deleterious effect on the life cycle of B. koreanus. In addition, time-dependent increases in ROS content (%) and GST enzymatic activity were shown in response to TCS and TCC exposure. Additionally, transcript levels of detoxification proteins (e.g., CYPs), antioxidant proteins (e.g., GST-sigma, Cu/ZnSOD, CAT), and heat shock proteins (Hsps) were modulated in response to TCS and TCC exposure over a 24\u00a0h period. Our results indicate that TCS and TCC induce oxidative stress and transcriptional regulation of detoxification, antioxidant, and heat shock proteins, resulting in changes in lifespan and fecundity.",

Cell death, induced by toxic levels of copper, was previously observed in in vitro studies. However, there is no consensus about the cell death pathway induced by Cu and it is still not known whether this occurs as a result of the direct action of the metal or by indirect effects. In the present work, we intend to identify the influence of different Cu concentrations in the induction of apoptosis and to explore the potential signaling pathways, using two different in vitro cell culture models (Caco-2 and Hep-G2). Cells were exposed, during 6, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h, to Cu concentrations corresponding to IC50 and 1/8 of IC50, according to the viability assays. Then, considering the different apoptosis pathways, the expression of caspases 3, 8 and 9, apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) and p53 genes was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR. The results suggested that different Cu concentrations could trigger different apoptotic pathways, at different times of exposure. In both cell lines, apoptosis seems to be initiated by caspase independent pathway and intrinsic pathway, followed by extrinsic pathway. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that Cu induces the activation of apoptosis through caspase dependent and independent pathways, also suggesting that apoptosis activation mechanism is dependent on the concentration, time of exposure to Cu and cell type.",

More and more often painkillers are detected in surface waters since their prescription has increased worldwide within the last years. Here we examined the effects of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac and hypoxia on three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We exposed sticklebacks to an environmentally relevant concentration of diclofenac (1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) for 14\u00a0days, to 24\u00a0h of hypoxia (2.0\u00a0mg O2/L), and a combination of both. Hypoxia and diclofenac both can be associated with oxidative stress in fish, but it is unclear whether they would act synergistically. Expression analysis of genes related to antioxidant response, hypoxia response, and chemical metabolism in gills showed that diclofenac alone had little effect, while the combination of hypoxia and diclofenac affected transcript levels most, indicating synergistic effects of these stressors. Of the antioxidant enzymes, only superoxide dismutase activity remained unchanged by treatments, while glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was the most affected antioxidant response on both the transcript and activity levels. Our results suggest that diclofenac may lead to suppressed catalase (CAT) activity but increased GPx activity, probably as compensatory mechanism to remove increasing H2O2 in the gills, and that this response is not affected by hypoxia. The activities of lactate dehydrogenase, CAT, and GPx also showed temporal variability during treatments, which can be attributable to tissue-specific circadian rhythms. Our study shows how responses to NSAIDs and hypoxia can interact in fish, suggesting that getting more insight into temporal variation and about the different levels of regulation of environmental responses is necessary in future studies.",

Weight gain of fish exposure to high and low ammonia abruptly increased at day 3. There were no significant changes in fish physiological indexes and immune responses at different times during 28-day exposure to low ammonia. Fish physiological indexes and immune responses in the treatment of high ammonia were lower than those of fish in the treatment of low ammonia. When fish were exposed to high ammonia, the ammonia concentration in the brain increased by 19-fold on day 1. By comparison, liver ammonia concentration reached its highest level much earlier at hour 12. In spite of a significant increase in brain and liver glutamine concentration, there was no significant change in glutamate level throughout the 28-day period. The total superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities in the brain gradually decreased from hour 0 to day 28. Liver SOD, GPX and GR activities reached the highest levels at hour 12, and then gradually decreased. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance brain and liver content gradually increased throughout the 28-day period. Lysozyme, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities in the liver reached exceptionally low levels after day 14. This study indicated that glutamine accumulation in the brain was not the major cause of ammonia poisoning, the toxic reactive oxygen species is not fully counter acted by the antioxidant enzymes and immunosuppression is a process of gradual accumulation of immunosuppressive factors.",

     "abstract": "A major development in fishery science has been the Fulton's condition factor (CF) as a reliable physiological index of fish growth and health status (Fulton 1902). As a general rule, CF-value greater than 1 (>\u00a01) should be regarded as an indicator for good growth and health. Therefore, exposure of fish to contaminants in the environment will be expected to produce a reduction in scope for growth, since energy for growth will be allocated to overcome stressful conditions. In the present study, we hypothesized that tilapia species from Ogun River (Nigeria) are experiencing severe contaminant-induced obesogen effects leading to high CF (\u2265\u00a02) in fish with pathological alterations. The environmental obesogen hypothesis has related the interaction between environmental pollutants and PPAR isoform activation In this respect, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and biotransformation responses in relation to contaminant burden were investigated in a total of 1074 specimens of Tilapias species (Tilapia guineensis, Sarotherodon galileaus and Oreochromis niloticus) collected from three areas with different degrees of anthropogenic contamination and from a putative control site along the Ogun River. Liver mRNA expression of cytochrome cyp1 isoforms (cyp1a, 1b and 1c) and PPAR isoforms (ppar-\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) were analyzed using validated real-time PCR. Fish were also analyzed for CF and muscle contaminant burden (aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls). A significant increase in mRNA expression of cyp1- and ppar isoforms was observed in fish from polluted areas, and these results paralleled data on PCBs and PAHs tissue concentrations. Further, cyp1 isoforms showed clear sex-related differences, with higher mRNA expression in male fish than in females. Principal component analysis revealed a relationship between cyp1 isoforms, ppar-\u03b1, \u03b2, PCBs and PAHs and these interactions may suggest a crosstalk between AhR- and PPARs mediated pathways on metabolic and energetic processes. The PCA biplot also highlighted a positive relationship between ppar-\u03b3, body weight, total length and PAHs. The CF for fish from all the sites was \u2265\u00a02 indicating that this parameter may not be a reliable index for evaluating fish growth and health condition, especially in wild fish population exposed to complex cocktails of environmental pollutants.",

The female T3 level increased in 1\u00a0\u03bcg/l nonylphenol concentration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The plasma T4 of males showed significant elevation in fishes exposed to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/l nonylphenol (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but no change for females in any of treatment groups relative to controls (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). No significant effect of nonylphenol exposure was observed on male plasma TSH levels (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), whereas, in females, nonylphenol at all concentrations significantly reduced TSH levels. A bell-shaped response was observed in male and female plasma GH levels. Moreover, various histopathological lesions were observed in gill and intestine tissues of fishes exposed to different nonylphenol concentrations. These results demonstrate the high sensitivity of this endangered species to even environmentally relevant concentrations of nonylphenol.

We previously developed a mechanistic computational model of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal (HPG) axis in female fathead minnows exposed to a model aromatase inhibitor, fadrozole (FAD), to predict dose\u2013response and time-course behaviors for apical reproductive endpoints. Initial efforts to develop a computational model describing adaptive responses to endocrine stress providing good fits to empirical plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) data in exposed fish were only partially successful, which suggests that additional regulatory biology processes need to be considered. In this study, we addressed short-comings of the previous model by incorporating additional details concerning CYP19A (aromatase) protein synthesis. Predictions based on the revised model were evaluated using plasma E2 concentrations and ovarian cytochrome P450 (CYP) 19\u00a0A aromatase mRNA data from two fathead minnow time-course experiments with FAD, as well as from a third 4-day study. The extended model provides better fits to measured E2 time-course concentrations, and the model accurately predicts CYP19A mRNA fold changes and plasma E2 dose\u2013response from the 4-d concentration\u2013response study. This study suggests that aromatase protein synthesis is an important process in the biological system to model the effects of FAD exposure.",

Pharmaceuticals are typically found in the environment at concentrations well below therapeutic levels in humans; however, their mechanisms of action may be largely unknown in non-target organisms, such as teleost species. Thus, chronic exposure to these types of compounds warrants further investigation. The goal of this study was to examine the potential for diazepam, a model benzodiazepine drug, to bioconcentrate in tissues of channel catfish and to examine its ability to interact with the endocrine system through modulation of steroid hormones and/or steroidogenic genes. To investigate the bioconcentration potential of diazepam, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) were exposed to 1\u00a0ng/mL diazepam for seven days, followed by clean water for another seven days, using an abbreviated OECD 305 Fish Bioconcentration Test study design. This concentration of diazepam is well below environmentally relevant concentrations of diazepam (ng/L). To evaluate steroidogenic effects, fish were exposed to 1\u00a0ng/mL diazepam for seven days only. Steroid hormone concentrations were analyzed for various tissues, as well as expression of selected steroidogenic genes. Calculated bioconcentration factors for diazepam were well below regulatory threshold values in all tissues analyzed. No changes in steroid hormone concentration were detected in any tissue analyzed; however, the steroidogenic gene cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc) was significantly down-regulated at day 5 and 3\u03b2-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (3\u03b2-HSD) was significantly down-regulated at day 7 in the gonad. These results indicate that although diazepam does not significantly bioconcentrate, low-level chronic exposure to diazepam may have the potential to interact with endocrine function by altering gene expression.",

     "abstract": "The QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measure of the duration of the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. In fish as in human, the QT interval is positively correlated with the RR interval of the ECG, a measure of the cardiac cycle length. Urotensin II (UII) is a neuropeptide that has been highly conserved from fish to human, and UII and its receptor (UT) are expressed in cardiovascular tissues including the heart. Although UII exerts potent cardiovascular actions, its possible effects on the QT interval have never been investigated. The goal of the present study was to provide insight into the potential effect of UII on the QT interval in an established in vivo trout model. To this end, the effects of UII on dorsal aortic blood pressure (PDA), RR, QT intervals and corrected QT (QTc) for RR interval, were investigated after intra-arterial (IA) injection of 5, 50 and 100\u00a0pmol UII. The effects of UII were compared to those of two structurally UII-related peptides (URPs), URP1 and URP2, and to those of arginine vasotocin (AVT), homolog of the mammalian arginine vasopressin. IA injection of vehicle or 5\u00a0pmol UII had no effect on the various parameters. At the 50-pmol dose, UII evoked its usual increase in PDA with a peak value observed 15\u00a0min after the injection (+\u00a022% from baseline, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This hypertensive effect of UII was accompanied by a significant increase in the RR interval (+\u00a018%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), i.e. a bradycardia, and these effects remained constant until the end of the recording. The highest dose of UII evoked similar hypertensive and bradycardic effects. Of interest, the QT interval did not change during the bradycardic action of UII (50 and 100\u00a0pmol) but the QTc interval significantly decreased. In trout pre-treated with urantide, a peptidic antagonist of UT, the hypertensive and bradycardic actions of 50\u00a0pmol UII were reduced 3-fold and no change occurred in the QT and QTc intervals. In trout pre-treated with blockers of the autonomic nervous system, the hypertensive effect of UII was maintained but no change appeared in RR, QT and QTc intervals. IA injections of 50\u00a0pmol URPs were without action on the preceding parameters. IA administration of 50\u00a0pmol AVT provoked quite similar increase in PDA, and elevation of the RR interval to those evoked by IA injection of UII but, in contrast to UII, AVT injection induced a highly significant and sustained prolongation of the QT interval compared to baseline (+\u00a07%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) without change in QTc. Our results are indicative of a lack of QT interval change during UII-evoked bradycardia but not after AVT-induced bradycardia and suggest for the first time that some compensatory mechanism specific for the UII peptide is working to stabilize the QT interval. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism involved in this action of UII. The potential for UII to prevent detrimental prolongation of cardiac ventricular repolarization might be questioned.",

     "abstract": "Numerous studies on molluscs have been carried out to clarify the physiological roles of haemolymph serum proteins and haemocytes. However, little is known about the presence and functional role of the serum metabolites. In this study, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) was used to assess whether changes of the metabolic profile of Mytilus galloprovincialis haemolymph may reflect alterations of the physiological status of the organisms due to environmental stressors, namely copper and temperature. Mussel haemolymph was taken from the posterior adductor muscle after a 4-day exposure to ambient (16\u00a0\u00b0C) or high temperature (24\u00a0\u00b0C) and in the absence or presence (5\u00a0\u03bcg/L, 20\u00a0\u03bcg/L, or 40\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of sublethal copper (Cu2+). The total glutathione (GSH) concentration in the haemolymph of both control and treated mussels was minimal, indicating the absence of significant contaminations by muscle intracellular metabolites due to the sampling procedure. In the 1H-NMR spectrum of haemolymph, 27 metabolites were identified unambiguously. The separate and combined effects of exposure to copper and temperature on the haemolymph metabolic profile were assessed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ranking-PCA multivariate analysis. Changes of the metabolomic profile due to copper exposure at 16\u00a0\u00b0C became detectable at a dose of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/L copper. Alanine, lysine, serine, glutamine, glycogen, glucose and protein aliphatics played a major role in the classification of the metabolic changes according to the level of copper exposition. High temperature (24\u00a0\u00b0C) and high copper levels caused a coherent increase of a common set of metabolites (mostly glucose, serine, and lysine), indicating that the metabolic impairment due to high temperature is enforced by the presence of copper. Overall, the results demonstrate that, as for human blood plasma, the analysis of haemolymph metabolites represents a promising tool for the diagnosis of pollutant-induced stress syndrome in marine mussels.",

Adverse effects associated with pollution on angiogenesis are mediated by hypoxia inducing factor-1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In this investigation, gene expression of two distinct HIFs-1, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, and VEGF was investigated at the mRNA transcript levels after exposure of Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) to cadmium. VEGF, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 expressions in treated Persian sturgeon were greater than controls. Significant increases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were also observed in cortisol and glucose levels compared to the control group especially in the fish exposed to higher cadmium concentration (800\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were increased in the cadmium-exposed fish, although the observed increases were not significant between the control and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/L cadmium treatment at some sampling time points. Gill tissues also showed histopathological changes in the cadmium treatments. Overall, results indicated that cadmium resulted in some alterations in biochemical parameters, mRNA transcript level expression of two important angiogenesis related genes as well as histological alterations in Persian sturgeon.",

The present study aimed to refine the Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis test system for developmental reproductive toxicity by characterising molecular and histological features of sexual development, and to explore effects of exposure to the progestagen levonorgestrel (LNG). Larvae were exposed to LNG (0, 3, 30, 300\u00a0ng/L) over the first three weeks of development, encompassing the beginning of gonadal differentiation. mRNA levels of amh (anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone), amhr2 (amh receptor 2), ipgr (intracellular progesterone receptor), mpgr beta (membrane progesterone receptor beta), and cyp19a1 (cytochrome p450 19a1) were quantified in larvae and juveniles (4\u00a0weeks post-metamorphosis). Relative cyp19a1 and amh expression was used as a molecular marker for phenotypic sex of larvae. Gonadal and M\u00fcllerian duct development were characterised histologically in juveniles. Compared to controls, LNG exposure increased the expression of amh and ipgr in male larvae. In juveniles, mpgr beta expression was increased in both sexes and amhr2 expression was decreased in males, implying persistent effects of developmental progestagen exposure on amh and pgr expression signalling. No effects of LNG on the gonadal or M\u00fcllerian duct development were found, implying that the exposure window was not critical with regard to these endpoints. In juveniles, folliculogenesis had initiated and the M\u00fcllerian ducts were larger in females than in males. This new knowledge on sexual development in X. tropicalis is useful in the development of early life-stage endpoints for developmental reproductive toxicity.",

In both experiments, the mRNA expression levels of hypothalamic pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (pacap), pituitary growth hormone (gh), liver insulin-like growth factors (igf1 and igf2a), and liver and muscle growth hormone receptors (ghr1 and ghr2) and IGF receptors (igf1ra and igf2r) were evaluated by means of qPCR.

In the muscle, ghr1 displayed a significant rhythm in both groups and ghr2 in ML fed fish (acrophases at ZT 5:29, 7:14 and 9:23\u00a0h). The time of both GH administration and feeding influenced the response to GH injection: ML fed fish injected with GH at ZT 15\u00a0h showed a significant increase in liver igf1, igf2a and ghr2; and muscle ghr2 expression. This is the first report that describes the existence of daily rhythms in the somatotropic axis of tilapia and its time-dependent responses of GH administration.

Investigation of susceptibility to oxidative stress was carried out using three types of cell lines including jellyfish (Aequorea coerulescens) GFP (jfGFP)-, or eel GFP (eelGFP)-expressing HEK293 cells, and control vector-transfected HEK293 cells. Binding of eelGFP to bilirubin was confirmed by the observation of green fluorescence in HEK293-eelGFP cells. The growth rate was compared with the three types of cells in the presence or absence of phenol red which possessed antioxidant activity. The growth rates of HEK293-CV and HEK293-jfGFP under phenol red-free conditions were reduced to 52 and 31% of those under phenol red. Under the phenol red-free condition, HEK293-eelGFP had a growth rate of approximately 70% of the phenol red-containing condition. The eelGFP-expressing cells were approximately 2-fold resistant to oxidative stress such as H2O2 exposure. The fluorescence intensity partially decreased or disappeared after exposure to H2O2, and heterogeneous intensity of fluorescence was also observed in isolated eel skeletal muscle cells. These results suggested eelGFP, but not jfGFP, coupled with bilirubin provided the antioxidant activity to the cells as compared to non-bound free bilirubin.",

     "abstract": "The polyhydroxylated derivatives of 6-keto,7-dehydrocholesterol (ecdysone, ecdysteroids, Ecd) are natural compounds widely distributed in plants. They exhibit strong anabolic, vitamin D-like, pharmacological effects in vertebrate animals and in the human body. In the larval stages of insects, injections of pure Ecd cause serious pathophysiological, \u201chyperecdysonic\u201d syndromes associated with neuromuscular paralysis, premature cuticular apolysis and complete inhibition of ecdysis. Ecds do not penetrate insect cuticle. For this reason, all previous attempts to induce ecdysone responses by topical applications of Ecd failed. In this work, we tried to induce the topical effects of Ecd by preparation of more lipophilic complexes, with 2 or 4 molecules of 20-hydroxyecdysone (E20) attached to a relatively large nucleus of the porphyrin. The resulting porphyrin-E20 complexes (ecdysogens) have been subjected to standardised assays for ecdysone activity in the ligatured larvae (\u201cdauerlarvae\u201d) of the greater waxmoth (Galleria mellonella). Similarly like the free E20 alone, porphyrin-E20 complexes had no effect when applied on the body surface or administered in the larval diet. When injected, however, they exhibited delayed effects, but the adverse (\u201chyperecdysonic\u201d) pathophysiological syndromes were reduced or abolished. It is concluded, therefore, that the replacement of pathophysiological, precocious or \u201chyperecdysonic\u201d moults by the larval-pupal transformation, was due to successive metabolic liberation of the biologically active, free E20 from the porphyrin-E20 complex. The biological status of Ecd does not agree with their definition as the prothoracic gland (PG) hormone of insects, nor with the assumptions about a growth hormone of plants. A possibility that the most important status of Ecd may depend on the pharmacological properties of a sterolic D6 vitamin has been discussed.",

     "abstract": "Small-bodied freshwater fish are commonly used in regulatory testing for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) but most lack a sensitive and quantifiable androgen-specific biomarker. Brook stickleback (Culaea inconstans) are a North American freshwater fish whose males produce an androgen-regulated glycoprotein in the kidney called spiggin. Although spiggin induction in females has been used as an androgen-specific biomarker of exposure in other stickleback species it has not been characterized in brook stickleback. Therefore, our objective was to develop a bioassay using brook stickleback to measure estrogenic and androgenic responses and establish the sensitivity of traditional and novel biomarkers of exposure. We first developed and optimized a qPCR assay to measure spiggin and vitellogenin transcript levels in kidney and liver tissue, respectively. Basal levels were differentially expressed in mature wild-caught male and female brook stickleback. To determine their sensitivity to EDCs, fish were exposed to nominal concentrations of 1, 10 and 100\u00a0ng/L of 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone (MT) or 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2) for 21\u00a0days (sampled at 7 and 21\u00a0days) under semi-static renewal conditions. MT and EE2 exposure induced spiggin and vitellogenin transcripts in female kidneys and male livers, respectively. Exposure to EE2 also increased hepatosomatic index in both sexes and decreased gonadosomatic index in females. Histopathological alterations were observed in the kidney of EE2-exposed fish and an increase in kidney epithelium cell height occurred in MT-exposed females. Given the sensitivity of these endpoints, the brook stickleback is a promising new freshwater fish model for EDC evaluation and a potential bioindicator for EDCs in North American freshwater environments.",

The specific activities ranged from 10.8\u201329.8 and 50\u2013220\u00a0units/mg protein for GST and AChE, respectively; and from 24.7\u2013129 and 22.6\u201377.3\u00a0units/mg protein for CaE as estimated by P-nitrophenyl and \u03b1-naphthyl acetates, respectively.

AChE is the predominant detoxifying enzyme that might imply its major role in the detoxification of insecticide(s). The isoenzyme pattern demonstrated two major slow-moving isoforms in all EPN strains examined. Purification of two AChE isoforms, AChEAII and AChEBI, from H. bacteriophora EM2 strain is performed by ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose.

The enzymatic activities of purified AChEs are completely inhibited by Hg+\u00a02 and Ni+\u00a02 and greatly enhanced by Mn+\u00a02. The substrate specificity, the relative efficiency of substrates hydrolysis, substrate inhibition and inhibition by BW284C51, but not by iso-OMPA, clearly indicated that they are true AChEs; their properties are compared with those recorded for insects as target hosts for H. bacteriophora EM2.",

     "abstract": "Chemical pollution by pesticides has been identified as a possible contributing factor to the massive mortality outbreaks observed in Crassostrea gigas for several years. A previous study demonstrated the vertical transmission of DNA damage by subjecting oyster genitors to the herbicide diuron at environmental concentrations during gametogenesis. This trans-generational effect occurs through damage to genitor-exposed gametes, as measured by the comet-assay. The presence of DNA damage in gametes could be linked to the formation of DNA damage in other germ cells. In order to explore this question, the levels and cell distribution of the oxidized base lesion 8-oxodGuo were studied in the gonads of exposed genitors. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV and electrochemical detection analysis showed an increase in 8-oxodGuo levels in both male and female gonads after exposure to diuron. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the presence of 8-oxodGuo at all stages of male germ cells, from early to mature stages. Conversely, the oxidized base was only present in early germ cell stages in female gonads. These results indicate that male and female genitors underwent oxidative stress following exposure to diuron, resulting in DNA oxidation in both early germ cells and gametes, such as spermatozoa, which could explain the transmission of diuron-induced DNA damage to offspring. Furthermore, immunostaining of early germ cells seems indicates that damages caused by exposure to diuron on germ line not only affect the current sexual cycle but also could affect future gametogenesis.",

Apoptosis-like cell death was further confirmed using the LDH release assay and Annexin V/PI double staining-based flow cytometry analysis. However, only activation of caspase-4 was observed. It is possible that some caspase-independent pathways were activated by the NV treatment. Since no reference or antivenom is available, the effects of several commonly used antidotes on the cytotoxicity of NV were examined on more sensitive CNE-2 cells to determine the appropriate emergency measures for envenomation by C. helvola. The phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitor para-bromophenacyl bromide (pBPB) showed no protective effect, while Mg2\u00a0+ potentiated cytotoxicity. Voltage-gated L-type Ca2\u00a0+ channel blockers (verapamil, nifedipine and felodipine) and Na\u2013Ca2\u00a0+ exchanger inhibitor KB-R7943 also showed no effect. Assays using Ca2\u00a0+-free culture media or the intracellular Ca2\u00a0+ chelator BAPTA also could not inhibit the cytotoxicity.

However, the molecular mechanisms of eGSTs-mediated insecticide resistance remain largely unknown in the Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), one of the most notorious pests in the world. Here, we investigated the roles of eight GST genes which belonged to epsilon class (BdGSTe1, BdGSTe2, BdGSTe3, BdGSTe4, BdGSTe5, BdGSTe6, BdGSTe7 and BdGSTe9) in conferring malathion resistance in B. dorsalis. Adult developmental stage-, sex- and tissue-specific expression patterns of the eight eGST genes were analyzed via quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The results showed that BdGSTe2, BdGSTe3, BdGSTe4 and BdGSTe9 were abundant in the midgut, fat body and Malpighian tubules. Notably, BdGSTe2, BdGSTe4 and BdGSTe9 were significantly overexpressed in a malathion-resistant (MR) strain of B. dorsalis compared to the malathion-susceptible (MS) strain. Functional expression and cytotoxicity assays showed significantly higher malathion detoxification capabilities in BdGSTe2-, BdGSTe3-, BdGSTe4- and BdGSTe9-expressing Sf9 cells compared to the parental and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Sf9 cells. Moreover, malathion susceptibility in MS adults was increased 30%, 14%, and 33% when BdGSTe2, BdGSTe3 and BdGSTe4 mRNA levels were repressed by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown, respectively. Taken together, overexpression of the isoforms of eGSTs, including BdGSTe2, BdGSTe4, and particularly, BdGSTe9 plays an important role in the malathion resistant development in B. dorsalis.",

     "abstract": "Fish are more sensitive to introduced disturbances from synthetic endocrine disrupting compounds during early life phases compared with mature stages. 17\u03b1-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), which is the active compound in human oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies, is today ever present in the effluents from sewage treatment plants. EE2 targets and interacts with the endogenous biological systems of exposed vertebrates resulting in to large extents unknown short- and long-term effects. We investigated how EE2 exposure affects expression profiles of a large number of target genes during early life of roach (Rutilus rutilus). We exposed fertilized roach eggs collected from a lake in Southern Sweden to EE2 for 12\u00a0weeks together with 1\u00a0+-year-old roach in aquaria. We measured the gene expression of the estrogen receptor (esr)1/2a/2b, androgen receptor (ar), vitellogenin, cytochrome P450 (cyp)19a1a/1b in fertilized eggs; newly hatched larvae; 12-week-old fry; and juvenile wild roach (1\u00a0+-year-old). Results shows that an EE2 concentration as low as 0.5\u00a0ng/L significantly affects gene expression during early development. Gene expression responses vary both among life stages and molecular receptors. We also show that the gene profile of the estrogen feedback cycle to a large extent depends on the relationship between the three esr genes and the two cyp19a1 genes, which are all up-regulated with age. Results indicate that a disruption of the natural activity of the dominant esr gene could lead to detrimental biological effects if EE2 exposure occurs during development, even if this exposure occurred for only a short period.",

In order to understand how p53 drugs might act on fish, the effects of PFT-\u03b1 on rainbow trout gill epithelial cell line, RTgill-W1, were studied. PFT-\u03b1 was not cytotoxic to RTgill-W1 in cultures with or without fetal bovine serum (FBS), but at 5.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, PFT-\u03b1 completely arrested proliferation. When FBS was present, PFT-\u03b1 increased the number of polyploid cells over 12\u00a0days. Those results suggest that like in mammals, p53 appears to regulate ploidy in fish. However, several effects were seen that have not been observed with mammalian cells. PFT-\u03b1 caused a transient rise in the mitotic index and a disruption in cytoskeletal microtubules. These results suggest that in fish cells PFT-\u03b1 affects microtubules either directly through an off-target action on tubulin or indirectly through an on-target action on p53-regulated transcription.",

We exposed killifish for 96\u00a0h to Cu in normoxia (total 23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9\u00a0\u03bcg Cu\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), or either no Cu (2.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg O2 L\u2212\u00a01) or with Cu in hypoxia (23.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8\u00a0\u03bcg Cu L\u2212\u00a01; 2.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0mg O2 L\u2212\u00a01), and compared them to normoxic controls with no added Cu (0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcg Cu L\u2212\u00a01; 9.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.00\u00a0mg O2 L\u2212\u00a01) at a hardness of 140\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 as CaCO3 equivalents. Gills showed significant Cu accumulation with both excess waterborne Cu in normoxia and in hypoxia. This was accompanied by increases in gill catalase (CAT) activity but with no significant changes in either protein carbonyls or lipid peroxidation (TBARS). Hypoxia alone decreased gill protein carbonyls. Liver showed no change in Cu load, but a significant decline in CAT activity occurred with Cu in normoxia. Liver showed an increase in TBARS with Cu in normoxia. Cu when combined with hypoxia caused a significant decline in cytochrome c oxidase (COX) and citrate synthase (CS) activity in gill and liver. Thus, low waterborne levels of Cu and moderate hypoxia both affected gill and liver phenotypes. However, killifish are tolerant of Cu and hypoxia, and there was no evidence of a synergistic response to exposure to the two stressors combined compared to each stressor alone.",

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are still an underexploited and inexhaustible source of significant pharmaceutical thrust. In the present study, Caenorhabditis elegans was employed to identify and characterize the indigenous LAB isolated from different traditional food against malathion-induced toxicity. The results demonstrated that malathion at its LD50 concentration decreased various C. elegans physiological parameters such as survival, feeding, and locomotion. Among the screened isolates, L. casei exhibited an excellent protective efficacy against malathion-induced toxicity by increasing the level of AChE and thereby rescued all physiological parameters of C. elegans. In addition, short-term exposure and food choice assay divulged that L. casei could serve as a better food to protect C. elegans from noxious environment. The expression analysis unveiled that L. casei gavage upregulated the phase-II detoxification enzymes coding genes metallothioneins (mtl-1 and mtl-2) and glutathione-S-transferase (gst-8) and thereby eliminated malathion from the host system. Furthermore, the upregulation of ace-3 along with down-regulation of cyp35a in the nematodes supplemented with L. casei could be attributed to attenuate the malathion-induced physiological defects in C. elegans. Thus, the present study reports that an indigenous LAB-L. casei could serve as a promising protective agent against the harmful effects of pesticide.",

Chronic oxidative stress induces deleterious modifications to DNA, lipids and proteins that are used as effective biomarkers to study pollutant-mediated oxidative stress. No previous report existed on the application of oxidative damage and antioxidant defense biomarkers in Caiman latirostris blood, while few studies reported in other crocodilians were done in organs or muscles of dead animals. The aim of this study was to characterize a new set of oxidative stress biomarkers in C. latirostris blood, through the modification of conventional techniques: 1) damage to lipids by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), 2) damage to DNA by comet assay modified with the enzymes FPG and Endo III, and 3) antioxidant defenses: catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione; in order to apply them in future biomonitoring studies. We successfully adapted standard procedures for CAT, SOD, GSH and TBARS determination in C. latirostris blood. Calibration curves for FPG and Endo III showed that the three dilutions tested were appropriate to conduct the modified comet assay for the detection of oxidized bases in C. latirostris erythrocytes. One hour of incubation allowed a complete repair of the damage generated. The incorporation of these biomarkers in biomonitoring studies of caiman populations exposed to xenobiotics is highly important considering that this species has recovered from a serious endangered state through the implementation of sustainable use programs in Argentina, and represents nowadays a relevant economic resource for many human communities.",

Therefore, aquatic organisms can be exposed to psychotropic drugs that may be potentially dangerous, raising the question of whether these drugs are attractive or aversive to fish. To answer this question, adult zebrafish were tested in a chamber that allows the fish to escape or seek a lane of contaminated water. These attraction and aversion paradigms were evaluated by exposing the zebrafish to the presence of acute contamination with these compounds. The zebrafish were attracted by certain concentrations of diazepam, fluoxetine, risperidone and buspirone, which were most likely detected by olfaction, because this behavior was absent in anosmic fish. These findings suggest that despite their deleterious effects, certain psychoactive drugs attract fish.",

Using the freeze-tolerant earthworm Dendrobaena octaedra as model species, we exposed worms to freezing and exposure to sublethal copper in a factorial design and investigated the transcription of candidate genes for metal and cold stress. We hypothesised that both freezing and copper would induce transcription of genes coding for heat shock proteins (hsp10 and hsp70), metallothioneins (mt1 and mt2), and glutathione-S-transferase (gst), and that the combined effects of these two stressors would be additive. The gene transcripts hsp10, hsp70, and gst were significantly upregulated by freezing, but only hsp10 was upregulated by copper. We found that copper at the time of sampling had no effect on transcription of two metallothionein genes whereas transcription was strongly upregulated by freezing. Moreover, there was a significant interaction causing more than additive transcription rates of mt1 in the copper/freezing treatment suggesting that freeze-induced cellular dehydration increases the concentration of free copper ions in the cytosol. This metallothionein response to freezing is likely adaptive and possibly provides protection against freeze-induced elevated metal concentrations in the cytosol and excess ROS levels due to hypoxia during freezing.",

     "abstract": "The fate and ecological impact of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in aquatic environments has gained increasingly concern recently. However, limited information is provided about the toxicity mechanism of NSAIDs to aquatic invertebrates. In the present study, we investigated the expression of CYP360A, CYP314, and GST genes involved in the detoxification process and the responses of their associated enzymes activity, as well as whole-organism changes in Daphnia magna exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of ibuprofen (IBU). Results showed that the total amount of eggs produced per female, total number of brood per female, and body length were significantly decreased under IBU exposure, suggesting the effects of chronic IBU exposure on growth and reproduction of D. magna cannot be ignored. In gene expression level, the CYP360A gene, homologue to CYP3A in mammalian, showed inhibition at low concentration of IBU (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) and induction at high concentration of IBU (50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01). GST gene also exhibited a similar performance to CYP3A. CYP314 displayed inhibition for short time exposure (6\u00a0h) and induced with prolonged exposure time (48\u00a0h) at low concentration of IBU (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01). Erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) and aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND) related to cytochrome oxidase P450 (CYPs) were inhibited for short time exposure (6\u00a0h) to IBU and then activated with prolonged exposure time (48\u00a0h) at low concentration of IBU (0.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01), while EROD showed a dose-dependent pattern under IBU exposure. As for antioxidative system, induction of glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) was observed in short-term exposure to IBU. Meanwhile, methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) content increased with the increasing IBU concentration and the delayed exposure time, displaying obvious dose- and time-dependent pattern. In summary, IBU significantly altered some physiological and biochemical parameters and genes expressions associated with detoxification metabolism in D. magna, the integrated approach combining the response in molecule levels with the performance of the whole organism can help elucidate the toxic effects of IBU and provide more insight into the exact mechanism of toxicity in aquatic organisms.",

We investigated metabolic detoxification pathways in three species of butterflyfishes: the hard coral specialist feeder, Chaetodon multicinctus, and two generalist feeders, Chaetodon auriga and Chaetodon kleinii. Each species was fed tissue homogenate of the hard coral Porites lobata or the feeding deterrent compound homarine (found in the coral extract), and the expression and catalytic activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-like and CYP2-like enzymes were examined after one-week of treatment. The P. lobata homogenate significantly induced content and catalytic activity of CYP2-like and CYP3A-like forms, by 2\u20133 fold and by 3\u20139 fold, respectively, in C. multicinctus. Homarine caused a significant decrease of CYP2-like and CYP3A-like proteins at the high dose in C. kleinii and 60\u201380% mortality in that species. Homarine also induced CYP3A-like content by 3-fold and catalytic activity by 2-fold in C. auriga, while causing non-monotonic increases in CYP2-like and CYP3A-like catalytic activity in C. multicinctus. Our results indicate that dietary exposure to coral homogenates and the feeding deterrent constituent within these homogenates caused species-specific modulation of detoxification enzymes consistent with the prey selection strategies of generalist and specialist butterflyfishes.",

A critical element in maintaining sex steroid levels is the enzyme aromatase (cytochrome P450 19A1) which converts androgens to oestrogens. In turn oestrogen signalling is targeted by numerous chemicals, from pharmaceuticals to agricultural chemicals, both frequent sources of contamination in waste waters and consequently rivers. Although many models are now available to address disruption of oestrogen signalling, there are currently no published protocols allowing discrimination between alterations in testosterone metabolism and in oestrogenic signalling. It was with this limitation in mind that we optimised this protocol. We show using a 48\u00a0h protocol that pre-feeding fry of the choriogenin h-gfp (chgh-gfp) medaka line are sensitive to 0.05\u00a0nM EE2 (15\u00a0ng/L), within the range of the lowest published observable physiological effect concentrations for medaka. In addition, co-treatment with testosterone can reveal potential effects of test substances on aromatase enzymatic activity. As the measurements are visualised in real-time without affecting embryo viability, repeated measures are possible. We demonstrate the ability of this model to detect oestrogen receptor agonists, aromatisable androgens, P450 aromatase activity modulators and selective oestrogen response modulators.

MeuTXK\u03b13 is a functionally unknown scorpion toxin-like peptide. Here we describe new transcripts of this gene arising from alternative polyadenylation and its biological function as well as a mutant with a single-point substitution at site 30. Native-like MeuTXK\u03b13 and its mutant were produced in Escherichia coli and their toxic function against Drosophila Shaker K+ channel and its mammalian counterparts (rKv1.1\u2013rKv1.3) were assayed by two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The results show that MeuTXK\u03b13 is a weak toxin with a wide-spectrum of activity on both Drosophila and mammalian K+ channels. The substitution of a proline at site 30 by an asparagine, an evolutionarily conserved functional residue in the scorpion \u03b1-KTx family, led to an increased activity on rKv1.2 and rKv1.3 but a decreased activity on the Shaker channel without changing the potency on rKv1.1, suggesting a key role of this site in species selectivity of scorpion toxins. MeuTXK\u03b13 was also active on a variety of bacteria with lethal concentrations ranging from 4.66 to 52.01\u00a0\u03bcM and the mutant even had stronger activity on some of these bacterial species. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on a bi-functional short-chain peptide in the lesser Asian scorpion venom.

After in vivo exposure, tissue Cu accumulation (hemolymph, gill and digestive gland); hemolymph ionic (Na+, K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) and osmotic concentrations; tissue (gill and digestive gland) ionic concentration, enzyme (Na+,K+-ATPase and carbonic anhydrase) activity, and oxygen consumption; and whole-body oxygen consumption were analyzed. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was evaluated in mitochondria isolated from gills and digestive gland and exposed (1\u00a0h) in vitro to different concentrations of dissolved Cu (0.8, 7.7 and 78.7\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01). In vivo exposure induced Cu accumulation in hemolymph, gills and digestive gland; increased Mg2+ and decreased Ca2+ concentration in hemolymph; decreased Mg2+ concentration, increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity and reduced carbonic anhydrase activity in gills; decreased Mg2+ concentration, increased Ca2+ concentration and increased Na+,K+-ATPase activity in digestive gland; and reduced gill, digestive gland and whole-body oxygen consumption. Succinate dehydrogenase activity was inhibited after in vitro exposure to 78.7\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 Cu. These findings indicate that Cu is an ionoregulatory toxicant in the marine clam M. mactroides. However, toxicity is related to disturbances in regulation of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) without effect on regulation of major monovalent cations (Na+ and K+), as opposed to that observed in osmoregulating invertebrates exposed to Cu. However, other mechanism(s) of toxicity cannot be ruled out. Future studies must be performed to evaluate the consequence of the Cu-induced respiratory disturbances observed in M. mactroides.",

     "abstract": "In this study, Cyprinus carpio was exposed to 0.25\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 copper as either copper sulfate (CuSO4) or copper oxide nanoparticles (nano-Cu), and 25\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 copper as nano-Cu for 14\u00a0days. CuSO4 and high concentration of nano-Cu led to a significant increase in plasma total copper levels. Plasma free copper levels increased significantly in all copper-exposed treatments. Except for low concentration of nano-Cu after 7 and 14\u00a0days, copper exposure generally led to a significant decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin levels. Plasma iron levels increased significantly in CuSO4 (all times) and nano-Cu (7th and 14th days) treatments. A significant elevation in plasma total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was observed after 3\u00a0days in the fish exposed to low concentration nano-Cu, and after 14\u00a0days in all copper-exposed treatments. Transferrin saturation (TSA) ratio showed significant increase in CuSO4 (3rd and 7th days) and the high concentration nano-Cu (7th day) treatments. Decrease in plasma chloride (7th and 14th days) and sodium (14th days) was observed in CuSO4 treatment. In conclusion, the results suggest that ionic copper is mainly absorbed via fish gill, whereas, nano-copper are more likely absorbed via gut. Also, data suggest that ionic copper has more adverse effects on the examined plasma biochemical characteristics compared to the equivalent nano-copper concentration, which may be due to the lower copper absorption by fish in the nano-copper suspension.",

The effects of short (5\u00a0days) and long (25\u00a0days) treatments on several reproductive and gonad immune parameters and the reversibility of the disruptive effects after the recovery period were examined. Our data showed that Tmx acted as an estrogenic endocrine disruptor as revealed by the increase in the hepatic transcription of the vitellogenin gene in males, the serum levels of 17\u03b2-estradiol and the gonad expression levels of the estrogen receptor \u03b1 and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor genes, and the recruitment of leukocytes into the gonad, a well known estrogenic-dependent process in gilthead seabream males. On the other hand, Tmx also increased sperm concentration and motility as well as the serum levels of androgens and the expression levels of genes that codify for androgenic enzymes, while decreasing the expression levels of the gene that code for gonadal aromatase. When applied simultaneously, Tmx and EE2 could act in synergy or counteract, each other, depending on the parameter measured. The disruptive effect of EE2 and/or Tmx was not reversible after a 25\u00a0day recovery period.",

It showed a molecular mass of 6542\u00a0Da, similarly to Kunitz-type serine peptidase inhibitors. The amidolytic activity of plasmin (0.5\u00a0nM) on synthetic substrate S-2251 was inhibited by 91% following the incubation with TP1 (1\u00a0nM). Aprotinin (2\u00a0nM) used as the positive control of inhibition, reduced the plasmin amidolytic activity by 71%. Plasmin fibrinolytic activity (0.05\u00a0nM) was inhibited by 67% following incubation with TP1 (0.1\u00a0nM). The degradation of fibrinogen chains induced by plasmin, trypsin or elastase was inhibited by TP1 at a 1:2, 1:4 and 1:20 enzyme:inhibitor ratio, respectively. On the other hand, the proteolytic activity of crude Mtt venom on fibrinogen chains, previously attributed to metallopeptidases, was not abolished by TP1. The tPA-clot lysis assay showed that TP1 (0.2\u00a0nM) acts like aprotinin (0.4\u00a0nM) inducing a delay in lysis time and lysis rate which may be associated with the inhibition of plasmin generated from the endogenous plasminogen activation. TP1 is the first serine protease plasmin-like inhibitor isolated from Mtt snake venom which has been characterized in relation to its mechanism of action, formation of a plasmin:TP1 complex and therapeutic potential as anti-fibrinolytic agent, a biological characteristic of great interest in the field of biomedical research. They could be used to regulate the fibrinolytic system in pathologies such as metastatic cancer, parasitic infections, hemophilia and other hemorrhagic syndromes, in which an intense fibrinolytic activity is observed.",

Recent studies report its toxicity towards aquatic species, but the overall amount of data concerning its effects is still scarce. Global changes, likely alterations in abiotic conditions, including salinity, can modulate the interactions of contaminants with biota, conditioning the toxicological responses elicited also by pharmaceuticals. The present article describes the oxidative toxic effects posed by paracetamol on the clam species Ruditapes philippinarum under different salinity conditions. The results demonstrated the establishment of an oxidative-based effect, with significant alteration of several parameters, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG). Water salinity influenced the response of clams exposed to different paracetamol concentrations, showing the importance of studying physiological traits under realistic test conditions, which are likely to vary in great extent as a result of climate change.",

Whether in vivo exposure to FICZ can result in toxic effects has not been examined and the main objective of this study was to determine if FICZ is embryotoxic in birds. We examined toxicity and CYP1 mRNA induction of FICZ in embryos from chicken (Gallus domesticus) and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) exposed to FICZ (2\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) by yolk and air sac injections. FICZ caused liver toxicity, embryo mortality, and CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 induction in both species with similar potency. This is in stark contrast to the very large difference in sensitivity of these species to halogenated AHR agonists. We also exposed chicken embryos to a low dose of FICZ (4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) in combination with a CYP inhibitor, ketoconazole (KCZ). The mixture of FICZ and KCZ was lethal while FICZ alone had no effect at 4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01. Furthermore, mixed exposure to FICZ and KCZ caused stronger and more long-lasting hepatic CYP1A4 induction than exposure to each compound alone. These findings indicate reduced biotransformation of FICZ by co-treatment with KCZ as a cause for the enhanced effects although additive AHR activation is also possible. To conclude, FICZ is toxic to bird embryos and it seems reasonable that the toxicity by FICZ involves AHR activation. However, the molecular targets and biological events leading to hepatic damage and mortality are unknown.",

     "abstract": "The circulating lipids of birds play essential roles for egg production and as an energy source for flight and thermogenesis. How lipid-lowering pharmaceuticals geared to prevent heart disease in humans and that are routinely released in the environment affect their metabolism is unknown. This study assesses the impact of the popular drug gemfibrozil (GEM) on the plasma phospholipids (PL), neutral lipids (NL), and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) of bobwhite quails (Colinus virginianus). Results show that bird lipoproteins are rapidly altered by GEM, even at environmentally-relevant doses. After 4\u00a0days of exposure, pharmacological amounts cause an 83% increase in circulating PL levels, a major decrease in average lipoprotein size measured as a 56% drop in the NL/PL ratio, and important changes in the fatty acid composition of PL and NEFA (increases in fatty acid unsaturation). The levels of PL carrying all individual fatty acids except arachidonate are strongly stimulated. The large decrease in bird lipoprotein size may reflect the effects seen in humans: lowering of LDL that can cause atherosclerosis and stimulation of HDL that promote cholesterol disposal. Lower (environmental) doses of GEM cause a reduction of %palmitate in all the plasma lipid fractions of quails, but particularly in the core triacylglycerol of lipoproteins (NL). No changes in mRNA levels of bird peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) could be demonstrated. The disrupting effects of GEM on circulating lipids reported here suggest that the pervasive presence of this drug in the environment could jeopardize reproduction and migratory behaviours in wild birds.",

Many studies on fish have focused on the reproductive toxicity effects of BPA. However, few has involved the effects of BPA on lipid metabolism. To evaluate the effects of BPA on lipid metabolism, we determine the hepato-somatic index, triglyceride contents in the liver and serum, the activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FASN), carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT1), and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) enzymes and the mRNA expression of acaca, acacb, fasn, gpat1 and cpt1\u03b1 in Gobiocypris rarus after exposure to BPA for 28\u00a0days. BPA induced increasing tendency of triglyceride contents in male fish, possibly due to up-regulated lipid synthesis. Although in this process, fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation was up-regulated, it might be compensated by increasing lipogenesis. Our result also revealed that the GPAT enzyme might play a key role in lipid metabolism disturbance by BPA in females. Besides, the effect of BPA on the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation pathway might be gender-dependent in G. rarus. Further studies are needed to investigate BPA's effects on the signaling pathway of lipid metabolism.",

To examine this, we analyzed the amino acid sequences, hemolytic and cytotoxic activities, and affinities to phospholipids of the five major CTXs purified from the venom of Indian cobra, Naja naja. CTX2, CTX7, and CTX8 belonged to S-type, and CTX9 and CTX10 to P-type. Comparisons of CTX7 with CTX8 and CTX9 with CTX10 revealed similar primary structures and hemolytic and cytolytic activities. CTX2, whose primary structure was rather different from the others, showed several times weaker hemolytic and cytolytic biological activities than the others. The comparison of CTX2 with CTX7 suggested the importance of Lys30 in loop II for the strong hemolytic and cytolytic activities of S-type CTXs. Cloning of 12 CTX cDNAs from the Naja naja venom cDNA library revealed that 18 out of 23 substitutions found in CTX cDNAs were nonsynonymous. This clearly indicated the accelerated evolution of CTX genes. Multiple sequence alignment of 51 kinds of CTX cDNAs and calculations of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicated that the codons coding the three loops' regions, which may interact with the hydrophobic tails of phospholipids, have undergone an accelerated evolution. In contrast, the codons coding for amino acid residues considered to participate in the recognition and binding of the hydrophilic head groups of phospholipids, eight Cys residues, and those likely stabilizing \u03b2 core structure, were all conserved.",

Trios (1 male: 2 female; n\u00a0=\u00a05) of fish were exposed for 21\u00a0days to: (i) control (no added Cu or Cd), (ii) waterborne Cu (75\u00a0\u03bcg/L), (iii) waterborne Cd (5\u00a0\u03bcg/L), and (iv) Cu and Cd mixture (75 and 5\u00a0\u03bcg/L, respectively). Reproductive output (cumulative egg production) was significantly reduced by Cu but not by Cd. Interestingly however, no spawning occurred in fish exposed to the mixture of waterborne Cu and Cd. In general, both Cu and Cd accumulation in target tissues (gill, liver, gonad and carcass) increased significantly in fish exposed to Cu and Cd mixture, and no interaction between Cu and Cd accumulation was observed in any tissues, except in the liver where Cu accumulation was significantly reduced by Cd. The expression of female hepatic estrogen receptor genes (ER-\u03b1 and ER-\u03b2) was most significantly elevated in fish exposed to Cu and Cd mixture, whereas vitellogenin gene expression was reduced maximally in the same exposure. Similarly, the hepatic expression of the metallothionein gene was most significantly upregulated in fish exposed to Cu and Cd mixture. Moreover, the circulating estradiol level in females was significantly decreased only during the co-exposure of waterborne Cu and Cd. Overall, the present study indicates that the interaction of chronic waterborne Cu and Cd exposure may elicit greater than additive effect on reproductive output in fish.",

Studies were made during normal development, from 0\u00a0day post fertilization (dpf) to hatching, and also exposing the fertilized eggs to ethanol or a DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine (5-azaC). We observed that during development, all these genes followed distinct expression patterns, generally high mRNA copies in early phases (0\u20131\u00a0dpf) and significantly low mRNA copies prior to or after hatching. Ethanol (100\u2013500\u00a0mM, 0\u20132\u00a0dpf) was unable to alter any of these mRNAs in 2\u00a0dpf; additional four day (2\u20136\u00a0dpf) maintenance of these embryos in ethanol-free environment, on 6\u00a0dpf, was also unable to establish any significant difference in these mRNA levels in comparison with the corresponding controls. However, continuous exposure of fertilized eggs in 300\u00a0mM ethanol, 0\u20136\u00a0dpf, showed significantly high mRNA copies only in MBPs (mbd1b, mbd3a, mbd3b, mecp2). 5-azaC (2\u00a0mM) on 2\u00a0dpf was able to enhance only mbd3b mRNA. Removal of 5-azaC and maintenance of these embryos in clean medium, 2\u20136\u00a0dpf, showed significantly enhanced mbd3b and mecp2 mRNAs compared to corresponding controls on 6\u00a0dpf.

     "abstract": "Exposures to co-planar PCBs and dioxins have been associated with diabetes in epidemiologic studies. Individuals may be predisposed to diseases such as diabetes as a result of exposure to environmental contaminants during early life, resulting in dysmorphic pancreatic islets or metabolically fragile \u03b2-cells. We tested the hypothesis that embryonic exposure to a model Ahr-ligand, PCB-126 would cause structural and/or functional alterations to the developing primary pancreatic islet in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). To assess \u03b2-cell development, transgenic zebrafish embryos (Tg(ins:GFP) and Tg(ins:mcherry) were exposed to nominal concentrations of 2 or 5\u00a0nM PCB-126 or DMSO from 24\u201348\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf), and imaged via time-lapse microscopy from 80\u2013102\u00a0hpf. We identified defects including hypomorphic islets, altered islet migration, islet fragmentation, and formation of ectopic \u03b2-cells. As we recently showed the transcription factor Nrf2a is protective in PCB-126 embryotoxicity, we then assessed the transcriptional function of the islets in wildtype and nrf2afh318/fh318 mutant embryos. We measured gene expression of preproinsulin a, somatostatin2, pdx1, ghrelin, and glucagon. Expression of preproinsulin a increased with PCB treatment in wildtype embryos, while expression of all measured pancreas genes was altered by the nrf2a mutant genotype, suggesting misregulation of the glucose homeostasis axis in those embryos, independent of PCB treatment. This study shows that embryonic exposure to PCB-126 can result in deviant development of the pancreatic islet and suggests that Nrf2a plays a role in regulating glucose homeostasis during development.",

Perforated patch clamp recordings in 27\u00a0h embryonic cells revealed Ca2+-activated currents with the characteristics of those described for mammalian TRPM4. Similarly, TRPM4-like expression and functionality was observed in brain and liver cells from adult fish. These findings suggest that a TRPM4-like channel is available for Ca2+ regulation during early development of the zebrafish.",

There is no one causative agent of mycobacteriosis, as several strains and species of Mycobacterium have been identified in zebrafish. With increased usage and investment in wild-type and mutant zebrafish strains, considerable value is placed on preserving zebrafish health. One control measure used to prevent mycobacterial spread within and between zebrafish facilities is egg disinfection. Here we investigate the effectiveness of three disinfectants [chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and povidone\u2013iodine (PVPI)] commonly included in egg disinfection protocols for laboratory fish as well as aquaculture fish and compare the knockdown effect of these treatments on Mycobacterium spp. in vitro. Despite current usage, comparison of these disinfection regimes' abilities to prevent mycobacterial growth has not been tested. We found that the germicidal effect of different disinfectants varies by Mycobacterium spp. Hydrogen peroxide was the least effective disinfectant, followed by unbuffered chlorine bleach, which is commonly used to disinfect embryos in zebrafish facilities. Disinfection with 25\u00a0ppm PVPI for 5\u00a0min was very effective, and may be an improved alternative to chlorine bleach for embryo disinfection. Results from this study can be utilized by laboratory fish facilities in order to prevent the spread of mycobacteriosis in research fish.",

     "abstract": "Telomerase expression has long been linked to promotion of tumor growth and cell proliferation in mammals. Interestingly, telomerase activity (TA) has been detected in skeletal muscle for a variety of fish species. Despite this being a unique feature in fish, very few studies have investigated the potential role of TA in muscle. The present study was set to prove the concepts that muscle telomerase in fish is related to body growth, and more specifically, to muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis in vivo. Moreover, muscle TA can be influenced by biotic factors and modulated by environmental stress. Using three fish species, mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus), orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma), the present work reports for the first time that fish muscle TA was sensitive to the environmental stresses of starvation, foodborne exposure to benzo[a]pyrene, and hypoxia. In marine medaka, muscle TA was coupled with fish growth during early life stages. Upon sexual maturation, muscle TA was confounded by sex (female\u00a0>\u00a0male). Muscle TA was significantly correlated with telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) protein expression (Pearson correlation r\u00a0=\u00a00.892; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), which was coupled with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) cell proliferation, but not associated with apoptosis (omBax/omBcl2 ratio) in muscle tissue. The results reported here have bridged the knowledge gap between the existence and function of telomerase in fish muscle. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of muscle TA in fish warrant further exploration for comparison with telomerase regulation in mammals.",

     "abstract": "Recent cross-generational studies in teleost fish have raised the awareness that high levels of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) could affect skeletal integrity in the directly exposed F0 and their F1\u2013F2. However, no further details were provided about the causes for abnormalities on the molecular and cellular level and the persistence of such sub-organismal impairments at the transgenerational scale (beyond F2). Adult Oryzias latipes were exposed to 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L BaP for 21\u00a0days. The F1\u2013F3 were examined for skeletal deformities, histopathological alterations of vertebral bodies and differential expression of key genes of bone metabolism. Significant increase of dorsal\u2013ventral vertebral compression was evident in ancestrally exposed larvae. Histopathological analysis revealed abnormal loss of notochord sheath, a lack of notochord epithelial integrity, reduced bone tissue and decreased osteoblast abundance. A significant downregulation of ATF4 and/or osterix and a high biological variability of COL10, coupled with a significant deregulation of SOX9a/b in the F1\u2013F3 suggest that ancestral BaP exposure most likely perturbed chordoblasts, chondroblast and osteoblast differentiation, resulting in defective notochord sheath repair and rendering the vertebral column more vulnerable to compression. The present findings provide novel molecular and cellular insights into BaP-induced transgenerational bone impairment in the unexposed F3. From the ecological risk assessment perspective, BaP needs to be regarded as a transgenerational skeletal toxicant, which exerts a far-reaching impact on fish survival and fitness. Given that basic mechanisms of cartilage/bone formation are conserved between medaka and mammals, the results may also shed light on the potential transgenerational effect of BaP on the genesis of skeletal diseases in humans.",

Dysfunction or lack of osteoclasts leads to increased bone mass and osteopetrosis phenotypes in mouse and human. Here we report a severe osteopetrosis-like phenotype in transgenic medaka fish, in which membrane bound EGFP (mEGFP) was expressed in osteoclasts under control of the cathepsin K promoter (ctsk:mEGFP). In contrast to reporter lines with GFP expression in the cytoplasm of osteoclasts, adult fish of the mEGFP line developed bone defects indicative for an osteoclast dysfunction. Activity of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was down-regulated and excess bone was observed in most parts of the skeleton. The osteopetrotic phenotype was particularly obvious at the neural and haemal arches that failed to increase their volume in growing fish. Excess bone caused severe constriction of the spinal cord and the ventral aorta. The continuation of tooth development and the failure to shed teeth resulted in severe hyperdontia. Interestingly, at the vertebral column vertebral body arches displayed a severe osteopetrosis, while vertebral centra had no or only a mild osteopetrotic phenotype. This confirms previous reports from cichlids that, different from the arches, allometric growth of fish vertebral centra initially does not depend on the action of osteoclasts. Independent developmental mechanism that shapes arches and vertebral centra can also lend support to the hypothesis that vertebral centra and arches function as independent developmental modules. Together, this medaka osteopetrosis model confirms the importance of proper osteoclast function during normal skeletal development in teleost fish that requires bone modeling and remodeling.",

     "abstract": "In both Xiphophorus fishes and humans, males are reported to have a higher incidence of melanoma than females. To better understand sex-specific differences in the molecular genetic response to UVB, we performed RNA-Seq experiments in skin of female and male Xiphophorus maculatus Jp 163 B following UVB doses of 8 or 16\u00a0kJ/m2 exposure. Male X. maculatus differentially express a significantly larger number of transcripts following exposure to 16\u00a0kJ/m2 UVB (1293 genes) compared to 8\u00a0kJ/m2 UVB (324 genes). Female skin showed differential gene expression in a larger number of transcripts following 8\u00a0kJ/m2 UVB (765) than did males; however, both females and males showed similar numbers of differentially expressed genes at 16\u00a0kJ/m2 UVB (1167 and1293, respectively).Although most modulated transcripts after UVB exposure represented the same dominant pathways in both females and males (e.g., DNA repair, circadian rhythm, and fatty acid biosynthesis), we identified genes in several pathways that exhibited opposite modulation in female vs. male skin (e.g., synaptic development, cell differentiation, wound healing, and glucose metabolism). The oppositely modulated genes appear related through uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) that is involved with the regulation of fatty acid oxidation and serves to balance glucose and lipid metabolism. Overall, these results identify gender-specific differences in UVB-induced genetic profiles in the skin of females and males and show female and male X. maculatus respond to UVB differently through pathways involved in reactive oxygen species, wound healing, and energy homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "The phenotypic and genetic similarities between Xiphophorus and human melanoma render Xiphophorus a useful animal model for studying the genetic basis of melanoma etiology. In the Xiphophorus model, melanoma has been shown to be inducible by ultraviolet light (UVB) exposure among interspecies hybrids, but not in parental line fish similarly treated. This leads to questions of what genes are responsive to UVB exposure in the skin of the interspecies hybrids, as well as how parental alleles in hybrids may be differentially regulated and the potential roles they may play in induced melanomagenesis. To address these questions, we produced X. maculatus Jp 163 B\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0X. couchianus (Sp-Couch) F1 hybrid fish, exposed both hybrid and parental fish to UVB, and performed gene expression profiling of the skin using RNA-Seq methodology. We characterized a group of unique UVB-responsive genes in Sp-Couch hybrid including dct, pmela, tyr, tyrp1a, slc2a11b, rab38a, rab27, tspan10, slc45a2, oca2, slc24a5, ptn and mitfa. These genes are associated with melanin production and melanocyte proliferation. They were also up-regulated in Sp-Couch hybrid, indicating that their UVB response is hybridization initiated. In the hybrid, several melanin production and pigmentation related genes, including slc45a2, tspan10, dct, slc2a11b and ptn showed either X. couchianus or X. maculatus allele specific expression. The finding that these genes exhibit allele specific expression regulatory mechanisms in Sp-Couch hybrids, but do not exhibit a corresponding UVB response in either one of the parental fishes, may suggest UVB targets and imply mechanisms regarding the susceptibility of Sp-Couch to induced melanomagenesis.",

Known light responsive genes involved in maintaining circadian cycling (e.g., clock, cry2a, cry1b, per1b, per2, per3, and arntl1a) exhibited expected shifts in transcriptional expression upon FL exposure. Exposure to FL also resulted in down-regulated transcription of many genes involved with cell cycle progression (e.g., cdc20, cdc45, cdca7b, plk1, cdk1, ccnb-3, and cdca7a) and chromosome segregation (e.g., cenpe, cenpf, cenpi, cenpk, cenpo, cenpp, and cenpu; cep70; knstrm, kntc, mcm2, mcm5; smc2). In addition, several DNA replication and recombination repair genes (e.g., pola1, pole, rec52, rad54l, rpa1, and parpbp) exhibit reduced expression in FL exposed X. maculatus skin. Some genes down modulated by FL are known to be associated with DNA repair and human diseases (e.g., atm2, brip1, fanc1, fancl, and xrcc4). The overall suppression of genes involved with mitotic progression in the skin of adult fish is consistent with entry into the light phase of the circadian cycle. Current efforts are aimed at determining specific wavelengths that may lead to differential expression among the many genes affected by fluorescent light exposure.",

Recently, varied genetic responses to UVB exposure have been documented in the skin of female and male Xiphophorus, as have differences in UVB response in the skin of different parental species and for interspecies hybrids produced from crossing them. Additionally, it has been shown that exposure to \u201ccool white\u201d fluorescent light induces a shift in the genetic profiles of Xiphophorus skin that is nearly as robust as the UVB response, but involves a fundamentally different set of genes. Given these results and the use of Xiphophorus interspecies hybrids as an experimental model for UVB inducible melanoma, it is of interest to characterize genes that may be transcriptionally modulated in a wavelength specific manner.The global molecular genetic response of skin upon exposure of the intact animal to specific wavelengths of light has not been investigated. Herein, we report results of RNA-Seq experiments from the skin of male Xiphophorus maculatus Jp 163 B following exposure to varied 50\u00a0nm wavelengths of light ranging from 300\u2013600\u00a0nm.

Observed functional sets of genes modulated within these two transcriptionally active light regions suggest different mechanisms of gene modulation.",

Based on the melanocyte specificity of the transcriptional upregulation, a pigment cell-specific promoter region was postulated for xmrk, the activity of which is controlled in healthy purebred fish by the molecularly still unidentified regulator locus R. However, as yet the xmrk promoter region is still poorly characterized. In order to contribute to a better understanding of xmrk expression regulation, we performed a functional analysis of the entire putative gene regulatory region of the oncogene using conventional plasmid-based reporter systems as well as a newly established method employing BAC-derived luciferase reporter constructs in melanoma and non-melanoma cell lines. Using the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter as control, we could demonstrate that our in vitro system is able to reliably monitor regulation of transcription through cell type-specific regulatory sequences. We found that sequences within 200\u00a0kb flanking the xmrk oncogene do not lead to any specific transcriptional activation in melanoma compared to control cells. Hence, xmrk reporter constructs fail to faithfully reproduce the endogenous transcriptional regulation of the oncogene. Our data therefore strongly indicate that the melanocyte-specific transcription of xmrk is not the consequence of pigment cell-specific cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region. This hints at additional regulatory mechanisms involved in transcriptional control of the oncogene, thereby suggesting a key role for epigenetic mechanisms in oncogenic xmrk overexpression and thereby in tumor development in Xiphophorus.",

However, it takes considerable effort to rear amphibians to juvenile and adult stages for regeneration studies, and the relatively large sizes that frogs and salamanders achieve during development make them difficult to use in chemical screens. Here, we introduce a new tail regeneration model using late stage Mexican axolotl embryos. We show that axolotl embryos completely regenerate amputated tails in 7\u00a0days before they exhaust their yolk supply and begin to feed. Further, we show that axolotl embryos can be efficiently reared in microtiter plates to achieve moderate throughput screening of soluble chemicals to investigate toxicity and identify molecules that alter regenerative outcome. As proof of principle, we identified integration 1 / wingless (Wnt), transforming growth factor beta (Tgf-\u03b2), and fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) pathway antagonists that completely block tail regeneration and additional chemicals that significantly affected tail outgrowth. Furthermore, we used microarray analysis to show that inhibition of Wnt signaling broadly affects transcription of genes associated with Wnt, Fgf, Tgf-\u03b2, epidermal growth factor (Egf), Notch, nerve growth factor (Ngf), homeotic gene (Hox), rat sarcoma/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/Mapk), myelocytomatosis viral oncogene (Myc), tumor protein 53 (p53), and retinoic acid (RA) pathways.

Selenium, an element that binds to cadmium inhibiting its toxicity, had a moderately positive correlation with cadmium (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41). Mercury, a toxic metal that positively correlates with cadmium in cetacean tissue, had a weakly positive relationship (r\u00a0=\u00a00.20).

When the analysis was based on the intracellular concentration of Cr, the data showed that the response of both species was similar. The one exception was the cytotoxicity of intracellular Cr ions from soluble Cr(VI), which caused more cytotoxicity in sea turtle cells (LC50\u00a0=\u00a0271\u00a0\u03bcM) than that of human cells (LC50\u00a0=\u00a0471\u00a0\u03bcM), but its clastogenicity was similar between the two species.

Compared to unexposed controls, treated fish were more susceptible to a specific pathogen, Edwardsiella ictaluri, yet displayed no survival differences when subjected to a polymicrobial water challenge of soil or feces. Treated fish were more susceptible to osmotic stress from NaCl, but not to the toxin nitrate. Treated fish failed to gain weight as well as controls over one month when fed a matched diet. Because of small sample sizes, pathogen susceptibility and weight gain differences were not statistically significant. This study provides supporting evidence in an experimental laboratory system that an antibiotic can have significant and persistent negative host effects, and provides for future study into the mechanisms of these effects.",

Medaka furin-like proprotein convertase (mflPC), a unique form of medaka FurinA (mFurinA) (GenBank accession no. AB092685.1) was cloned from the ovary cDNA library. Compared to human furin (GenBank accession no. NM_002569.3 ) and mFurinA in the structural motif of mflPC, only the catalytic domain and the N-terminal region of the P domain are highly conserved, but more C-terminal domains are truncated. Based on our research, there three forms of furin, mFurinA, mflPC and mFurinB that exist in medaka. These three genes are expressed in the developing embryos and ubiquitously in adult tissues.To investigate the function of mFurinA and mflPC, as a first step, mFurinA KO lines were established. The mFurinA KO larvae with abnormal phenotypes exhibit edema, abnormal body fluid accumulation in the pericardial and yolk sacs, enlarged hearts, clogged blood vessels, structurally weak eyes, and a very short life. The data suggests that abnormal processing of TGF-\u03b2 may be one of the causes of these disorders. FurinA KO medaka is a good model for the study of human diseases such as Fraser Syndrome and Marfan syndrome. The creation of human genomic disorder models using recently advanced genome editing procedures informs us of the function of key molecules and their role in causing equivalent human disorders and will be useful as a tool to identify the mechanisms involved.",

     "abstract": "We aimed to investigate the impact of the epigenome in inducting fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) phenotypes in Japanese rice fish embryogenesis. One of the significant events in epigenome is DNA methylation which is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. We analyzed DNMT enzyme mRNA expressions in Japanese rice fish development starting from fertilized eggs to hatching and also in embryos exposed for first 48\u00a0h of development either to ethanol (300\u00a0mM) or to 5-azacytidine (5-azaC; 2\u00a0mM), an inhibitor of DNMT enzyme activity. As observed in FASD phenotypes, 5-azaC exposure was able to induce microcephaly and craniofacial cartilage deformities in Japanese rice fish. Moreover, we have observed that expression of DNMTs (dnmt1, dnmt3aa, and dnmt3bb.1) are developmentally regulated; high mRNA copies were found in early stages (1\u20132\u00a0day-post-fertilization, dpf), followed by gradual reduction until hatched. In ethanol-treated embryos, compared to controls, dnmt1 mRNA is in reduced level in 2\u00a0dpf and in enhanced level in 6\u00a0dpf embryos. While dnmt3aa and 3bb.1 remained unaltered. In contrast, embryos exposed to 5-azaC have an enhanced level of dnmt1 and dnmt3bb.1 mRNAs both in 2 and 6\u00a0dpf embryos while dnmt3aa is enhanced only in 6\u00a0dpf embryos. Moreover, endocannabinoid receptor 1a (cnr1a) mRNA which was found to be reduced by ethanol remained unaltered and cnr1b and cnr2 mRNAs, which were remained unaltered by ethanol, were increased significantly by 5-azaC in 6\u00a0dpf embryos. This study indicates that the craniofacial defects observed in FASD phenotypes are the results of dysregulations in DNMT expressions.",

Environmental contaminants might disrupt the stress axis and consequently affect the stress response in fish. To investigate the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide on the stress response of fish and its potential mechanisms, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of a 40% MCP-based pesticide for 21\u00a0d, after which time fish were subjected to a 3-min air-exposure stressor. Concentrations of the whole-body cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay and abundances of transcripts of proteins involved in the HPI axis were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of MCP pesticide decreased whole-body cortisol levels of female zebrafish in response to an acute stressor, but without any effect on the cortisol response in males. 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L MCP pesticide reduced POMC and GR expression in the brain, MC2R and P45011\u03b2 expression in the head kidney, but enhanced 20\u03b2-HSD2 expression in the head kidney, suggesting that MCP damaged the HPI axis involving acting at pituitary regulatory levels, inhibiting cortisol synthesis and stimulating cortisol catabolism, or disturbing the negative feedback regulation. Additionally, MCP depressed liver GR transcription but did not affect phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tyrosine aminotransferase expression in zebrafish, suggesting a role for this pesticide in reducing target tissue responsiveness to cortisol. Considered together, the reduced ability to elevate cortisol levels in response to an acute stress may be an endocrine dysfunction occurring in zebrafish subchronically exposed to MCP pesticide.",

Heavy metals chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) were elevated in both fish species compared to recommended values of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), 1999 for edible fishes. Reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CATA) activities in all tissues (brachial, neural, renal and hepatic) were altered. Cellular lipid and protein compromisation in both fishes induced by heavy metals was determined by lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PC) assays. Micronucleus (MN) test of erythrocytes and comet assay of liver cells confirmed genotoxicity. Histopathology of the liver, kidney and brain of affected fishes was distorted significantly with its reference fishes thereby affecting the quality and quantity of these fish stocks. This raises a serious concern as these fishes are consumed by the local population which would ultimately affect human health.",

The L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (L-type VDCCs) transport Ca2\u00a0+ across the membrane. Calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) bind free cytosolic Ca2\u00a0+ and prevent excitotoxicity caused by sudden increase in cytoplasmic Ca2\u00a0+. The present study was aimed to understand the regulation of expression of neuronal CaBPs, namely, calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) following blockade of L-type VDCCs in the CNS of Carassius auratus. Verapamil (VRP), a potent L-type VDCC blocker, selectively blocks Ca2\u00a0+ entry at the plasma membrane level. VRP present in the aquatic environment at a very low residual concentration has shown ecotoxicological effects on aquatic animals. Following acute exposure for 96\u00a0h, median lethal concentration (LC50) for VRP was found to be 1.22\u00a0mg/L for goldfish. At various doses of VRP, the behavioral alterations were observed in the form of respiratory difficulty and loss of body balance confirming the cardiovascular toxicity caused by VRP at higher doses. In addition to affecting the cardiovascular system, VRP also showed effects on the nervous system in the form of altered expression of PV. When compared with controls, the pattern of CR expression did not show any variations, while PV expression showed significant alterations in few neuronal populations such as the pretectal nucleus, inferior lobes, and the rostral corpus cerebellum. Our result suggests possible regulatory effect of calcium channel blockers on the expression of PV.",

To this end we cloned KCNH6 channel of the crucian carp (Carassius carassius) that produces the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr), the main repolarising current of the fish heart. KCNH6 (ccErg2) was the main isoform of the Kv11 potassium channel family with relative transcript levels of 98.9% and 99.6% in crucian carp atrium and ventricle, respectively. KCNH2 (ccErg1), an orthologue to human cardiac Erg (Herg) channel, was only slightly expressed in the crucian carp heart. The native atrial IKr and the cloned ccErg2 were inhibited by similar concentrations of verapamil, terfenadine and KB-R7943 (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05), while the atrial IKr was about an order of magnitude more sensitive to E-4031 than ccErg2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) suggesting that some accessory \u03b2-subunits may be involved. Sensitivity of the crucian carp atrial IKr to E-4031, terfenadine and KB-R7943 was similar to what has been reported for the Herg channel. In contrast, the sensitivity of the crucian carp IKr to verapamil was approximately 30 times higher than the previously reported values for the Herg current. In conclusion, the cardiac IKr is produced by non-orthologous gene products in fish (Erg2) and mammalian hearts (Erg1) and some marked differences exist in drug sensitivity between fish and mammalian Erg1/2 which need to be taken into account when using fish heart as a model for human heart.",

     "abstract": "The commonly used mood altering drug fluoxetine (Prozac) in humans has a low occurrence in reports of harmful effects from overdose; however, individuals with altered metabolism of the drug and accidental overdose have led to critical conditions and even death. We addressed direct actions of high concentrations on synaptic transmission at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), neural properties, and cardiac function unrelated to fluoxetine's action as a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. There appears to be action in blocking action potentials in crayfish axons, enhanced occurrences of spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion events in the presynaptic terminals at NMJs of both Drosophila and crayfish. In rodent neurons, cytoplasmic Ca2\u00a0+ rises by fluoxetine and is thapsigargin dependent. The Drosophila larval heart showed a dose dependent effect in cardiac arrest. Acute paralytic behavior in crayfish occurred at a systemic concentration of 2\u00a0mM. A high percentage of death as well as slowed development occurred in Drosophila larvae consuming food containing 100\u00a0\u03bcM fluoxetine. The release of Ca2\u00a0+ from the endoplasmic reticulum in neurons and the cardiac tissue as well as blockage of voltage-gated Na+ channels in neurons could explain the effects on the whole animal as well as the isolated tissues. The use of various animal models in demonstrating the potential mechanisms for the toxic effects with high doses of fluoxetine maybe beneficial for acute treatments in humans. Future studies in determining how fluoxetine is internalized in cells and if there are subtle effects of these mentioned mechanisms presented with chronic therapeutic doses are of general interest.",

Moreover, no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of BPA analogues on red blood cells. The purpose of the present study was to compare the impact of BPA and its selected analogues such as bisphenol F (BPF), bisphenol S (BPS) and bisphenol AF (BPAF) on hemolytic and morphological changes and hemoglobin oxidation (methemoglobin formation) of human erythrocytes. The erythrocytes were incubated with different bisphenols concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for 1, 4 and 24\u00a0h. The compounds examined caused hemolysis in human erythrocytes with BPAF exhibiting the strongest effect. All bisphenols examined caused methemoglobin formation with BPA inducing the strongest oxidative potential. Flow cytometry analysis showed that all bisphenols (excluding BPS) induced significant changes in erythrocytes size. Changes in red blood cells shape were conducted using phase contrast microscopy. It was noticed that BPA and BPAF induced echinocytosis, BPF caused stomatocytosis, while BPS did not provoke significant changes in shape of red blood cells. Generally, the results showed that BPS, which is the main substituent of bisphenol A in polymers and thermal paper production, exhibited significantly lower disturbance of erythrocyte functions than BPA.",

An in vivo 7\u00a0day waterborne exposure was performed with nano-TiO2 (1\u00a0mg/L) and 2,3,7,8-TCDD (46\u00a0pg/L), singly and in combination.

Ahrr, er\u03b22, abcc1 and abcg2 resulted down-regulated with respect to controls in all experimental groups. Co-exposure to nano-TiO2 and 2,3,7,8-TCDD caused a further significant down regulation of ahrr, er\u03b22, Abcb1 and Abcc2 compared to single chemical exposure (nano-TiO2 or 2,3,7,8-TCDD alone). No effects were observed for 2,3,7,8-TCDD and nano-TiO2 alone in abcb1 gene, while abcc2 was down-regulated by nano-TiO2 alone. Cyp1a, gst and elmod2 genes were up-regulated by 2,3,7,8-TCDD and to a similar extent after co-exposure. Overall the results indicate that nano-TiO2 is unlikely to interfere with 2,3,7,8-TCDD-dependent biotransformation gene expression in the liver of European sea bass, although the effects of co-exposure observed in ABC transport mRNAs might suggest an impact on xenobiotic metabolite disposition and transport in European sea bass liver.",

Results show that HEA triggered ammonia accumulation and induced oxidative stress in all tissues. Unlike other organs, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation in liver were restored to control levels. This recovery was associated with a concomitant augmentation in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), components of glutathione redox cycle (glutathione peroxidase GPX, glutathione reductase, reduced glutathione), ascorbate peroxidase activity and reduced ascorbate content. On the contrary, in brain during prolonged exposure many of these anti-oxidant enzymes were either unaffected or inhibited, which resulted in persistent over-accumulation of H2O2 and MDA. Branchial and renal tissue both involved in osmo-regulation, revealed an entirely dissimilar compensatory response; the former rely mainly on the ascorbate dependent defensive system while the glutathione catalytic pathway was activated in the latter. In muscle, GPX activity first rose (3.5\u00a0days) followed by a subsequent drop, counterbalanced by simultaneous increment of CAT. HEA resulted in a relatively mild oxidative stress in the muscle and kidney, probably explaining the modest anti-oxidative responses.

In this paper, the growth inhibition and gene transcript levels of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)) and the stress-response gene involved in the prevention of oxidative stress (Hsp70) of earthworms (Eisenia fetida) exposed to TBBPA, HBCD and BDE 209 were measured to identify the toxicity effects of selected BFRs on earthworms. The growth of earthworms treated by TBBPA at 200 and 400\u00a0mg/kg dw were inhibited at rate of 13.7% and 22.0% respectively, while there was no significant growth inhibition by HBCD and BDE 209. A significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) up-regulation of SOD expression level was observed in earthworms exposed to TBBPA at 50\u00a0mg/kg dw (1.77-fold) and to HBCD at 400\u00a0mg/kg dw (2.06-fold). The transcript level of Hsp70 gene was significantly up-regulated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) when earthworms exposed to TBBPA at concentration of 50\u2013200\u00a0mg/kg (2.16\u20132.19-fold) and HBCD at 400\u00a0mg/kg (2.61-fold). No significant variation of CAT gene expression in all the BFRs treatments was observed, neither does all the target gene expression level exposed to BDE 209. Assessed by growth inhibition and the changes at mRNA levels of encoding genes in earthworms, TBBPA showed the greatest toxicity, followed by HBCD and BDE 209, consistent with trends in molecular properties. The results help to understand the molecular mechanism of antioxidant defense.",

     "publication date": "09-2015",
     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine if the cardiovascular response to hypoxia was altered by the presence of bisphenol A (BPA) in Danio rerio embryos. It was expected that BPA exposure would affect cardiovascular parameters during hypoxia more than normoxia due to an interaction between BPA and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway. We demonstrate that BPA exposure has a minimal effect during normoxia but can severely affect the cardiovascular system during a hypoxic event. Cardiovascular response was measured in vivo using video microscopy and digital motion analysis. RBC density increased 35% in hypoxia alone but decreased 48% with addition of 0.25\u00a0mg/L BPA. Tissue vascularization (% coverage) was unaffected by hypoxia alone but decreased 37% with addition of 0.25\u00a0mg/L BPA. The diameter and RBC velocity of arteries were more sensitive than veins to BPA exposure during both normoxia and hypoxia. Arterial RBC velocity decreased 42% during normoxia and 52% during hypoxia with 1\u00a0mg/L BPA. This decrease in velocity may in part be due to the 86% decrease in heart rate (\u0192H) observed during co-exposure to hypoxia and 5\u00a0mg/L BPA. While stroke volume (SV) was unaffected by treatment, cardiac output (Q) decreased by 69% with co-exposure. \u0192H and Q were not affected by BPA exposure during normoxia. Development ultimately slowed by 146% and mortality rates were 95% during hypoxia when exposed to 5\u00a0mg/L BPA. Our results show for the first time that BPA exposure alters the cardiovascular system during hypoxia more so than normoxia.",

In particular, copper is interesting since it plays important roles as co-factor of numerous proteins but its toxicity is well established, also because it can readily generate free radicals or oxidize cellular components through their redox activity. Its availability is tightly regulated within cells: it is immediately transferred to metallothionein (MT) that in turn provides efficient and specific mechanisms for its intracellular storage and transport. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acute effect of sublethal copper concentrations in Venerupis philippinarum, by studying the kinetics of copper, zinc (for its interactions at the sites of intake or elimination with the accumulation of other essential and not essential trace metals) and metallothionein accumulation under laboratory conditions. The time-course of metal accumulation/elimination is similar in digestive gland and gills and importantly it is dose-dependent. Both copper and zinc increase slowly within cells, reaching a maximum concentration at the end of the exposure period. During the detoxification period, the metal levels in digestive gland and gills rapidly decrease, with different kinetics in the two tissues. Positive correlations between metallothionein accumulation and copper or zinc concentrations have been verified in both treated groups. The obtained data demonstrated the involvement of MTs in detoxification strategies after a recovery period in clean seawater.",

This study investigated the accumulation and effects of dietary metals in a macroinvertebrate. The green seaweed, Ulva lactuca and the red seaweed, Agardhiella subulata were each concurrently exposed to two concentrations (100 or 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of five metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Zn). Additionally, U. lactuca was exposed to 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L of the metal mixture as well as 10 or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of each metal individually for 48\u00a0h. The seaweeds were then used as food for the sea hare, Aplysia californica for two to three weeks depending on the exposure concentration. Body mass of A. californica was measured weekly, and at the end of the exposure duration, metal concentrations were quantified in dissected organs (mouth, esophagus, crop, gizzard, ovotestis, heart, hepatopancreas, gill, and the carcass). Metal distribution and accumulation in the organs of A. californica varied with the metal. A. californica fed the metal-exposed diets had significantly reduced body weight by the end of the exposure periods, as compared to controls; however, differences were observed in the extent of growth reductions, dependent on exposure concentration, duration, and exposure regime (metal mixture versus individual metal-exposed diet). Metal mixture diets decreased A. californica growth more so than comparable individual metal diets, despite more metal accumulating in the individual metal diets. Additionally, Zn- and Cu-contaminated algal diets decreased control-normalized growth of A. californica significantly more than comparable Cd-, Pb-, or Ni-contaminated diets. The seaweed diets in this study contained environmentally relevant tissue metal burdens. Therefore, these results have implications for metals in marine systems.",

     "abstract": "Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have been used as a model organism to explore the genetic basis for responsiveness to addictive drugs like cocaine. However, very little is known about how the physiological response to cocaine is mediated in zebrafish. In the present study electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded from adult zebrafish treated with cocaine. Treatment with cocaine resulted in a bell-shaped dose response curve with a maximal change in heart rate seen using 5\u00a0mg/L cocaine. Higher doses resulted in a higher percentage of fish showing bradycardia. The cocaine-induced tachycardia was blocked by co-treatment with propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic antagonist, but potentiated by co-treatment with phentolamine, an \u03b1-adrenergic antagonist. Co-treatment with atropine, a classic cholinergic antagonist, had no effect on cocaine-induced tachycardia. Cocaine treatment of adult fish changed the ECG of treated fish, inducing a dose-dependent increase in QT interval after adjusting for heart rate (QTc), while not affecting the PR or QRS intervals. The acute effects of cocaine on heart rate were examined in 5-day old embryos to see if zebrafish might serve as a suitable model organism to study possible links of embryonic physiological response to subsequent adult behavioral response to the drug. Cocaine treatment of 5-day old zebrafish embryos also resulted in a bell-shaped dose response curve, with maximal tachycardia achieved with 10\u00a0mg/L. The response in embryonic fish was thus comparable to that in adults and raises the possibility that the effects of embryonic exposure to cocaine on the developing cardiovascular system can be effectively modeled in zebrafish.",

In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.8\u00a0mM arsenic, 0.1\u00a0mM atrazine or mixture of both for 96\u00a0h, and various indices which are indicative of teratogenicity (egg coagulation, growth retardation, edema formation, hatching success, scoliosis), genotoxicity (DNA tail moments) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities) were determined. The negative control were exposed to 0.5% DMSO while the positive control group were exposed to 4\u00a0mg/L 3,4 dichloroaniline. Egg coagulation was highest in the positive control (85%), followed by the group that was exposed to mixture of arsenic and atrazine (30%) and least in the arsenic-exposed group (20%). The incidences of edema (59%) and growth retardation (35.2%) were more frequent in the group that was exposed to contaminant mixture and least in atrazine-exposed group where incidences of both edema and growth retardation were 15%. The incidence of scoliosis ranged between 20% in arsenic-exposed group and 10% in atrazine-exposed group. Hatching success was generally high in all the groups ranging between 95% in atrazine-exposed group and 88% in the group that was exposed to mixture of arsenic and atrazine. There was no evidence of teratogenic effect in the negative control group. DNA tail moments and lipid peroxidation levels increased significantly while GSH levels and catalase activity decreased significantly in contaminant-exposed groups, especially the mixture compared to the negative control. There was no significant change in GPx activity in the exposed groups compared to the negative control. The results of this study demonstrate that both arsenic and atrazine are potentially teratogenic and genotoxic, and can cause oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos, and these effects are potentiated by toxic interactions between the two contaminants.",

However, the potential toxicity of PFOS to crustaceans is little known. The present study investigated the effects of PFOS on the immune responses and expression of immune-related genes in the Chinese mitten-handed crab Eriocheir sinensis. Crabs were exposed to 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 10\u00a0mg/L of PFOS, and sampled on 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21\u00a0days respectively. The total hemocyte count and lysozyme activity in PFOS-treated crab were significantly lower than in the control. The exposure to 10\u00a0mg/L of PFOS led to a marked inhibition in phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase activities. At other PFOS levels, phenoloxidase and superoxide dismutase showed an initial increase and a subsequent decrease over time. The alkaline and acid phosphatase activities were stimulated in 10\u00a0mg/L PFOS until 21\u00a0days. The mRNA expression of immune related genes including hepatopancreas-specific C-type lectin and prophenoloxidase activating factors were up-regulated after the exposure to the concentrations of 1 and 10\u00a0mg/L of PFOS, while the expression of lysozyme gene was up-regulated only in the crab exposed to 0.1\u00a0mg/L PFOS. The results demonstrate that the high dose of PFOS leads to immune toxicity and the hepatopancreas is a major target organ for PFOS accumulation and immunotoxicity. Hemocyte counts, phenoloxidase and acid phosphatase are useful biomarkers for the risk assessment of PFOS toxicity to crustaceans.",

In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring antioxidant enzymes activities and transcription, and quantification of total glutathione. Apical effects on the development of zebrafish embryos were also measured. With the exception of AChE inhibition and enhanced gene expression, limited effects of CPF on oxidative stress and apical endpoints were found at this developmental stage. Addition of VC had little effect on oxidative stress or AChE, but increased pericardial area and heartbeat rate through an unknown mechanism. TBOOH diminished AChE gene expression and activity, and caused oxidative stress when administered alone. However, in combination with CPF, only reductions in AChE activity were observed with no significant changes in oxidative stress suggesting the adverse apical endpoints in the embryos may have been due to AChE inhibition by CPF rather than oxidative stress. These results give additional evidence to support the role of prooxidants in AChE activity and expression.",

To assess the chronic toxicity of the drug a battery of biomarkers related with health status and oxidative stress was applied. In order to quantify CBZ in the clam's tissues and in water samples ELISA was used.The present study showed three types of responses on the clams after a chronic exposure to CBZ. For control condition and the lower concentrations (0.03 and 0.30\u00a0\u03bcg/L) a \u201csimilar\u201d metabolic state was observed and the most efficient antioxidant status leading to the elimination of reactive oxygen species formed during the metabolism of CBZ. The concentration of 3.00\u00a0\u03bcg/L seemed to be a \u201cthreshold\u201d concentration, beyond which the concentration levels of CBZ began to exert a toxic effect, compromising the activity of biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes, with notorious effects at the highest CBZ concentration (9.00\u00a0\u03bcg/L). CBZ also seemed to alter the energy-related responses, especially the glycogen and electron system responses, revealing a slowdown in metabolism at the higher exposure concentrations (3.00 and 9.00\u00a0\u03bcg/L). Overall, the present study demonstrated that the higher CBZ concentrations can lead to the impairment of antioxidant enzymes compromising the neutralization of reactive oxygen species, and thus the ability to cope with oxidative stress.",

Mussels were exposed to each forms of zinc for 96\u00a0h then placed in air to determine survival time. A sub-group of mussels before and after 7\u00a0days of exposure to air were kept aside for the determination of the following biomarkers: arachidonate-dependent cyclooxygenase (COX) and peroxidase (inflammation and oxidative stress), lipid metabolism (total lipids, esterases activity, HO-glycerol, acetyl CoA and phospholipase A2) and lipid damage (lipid peroxidation [LPO]). The results showed that air-time survival was decreased from a mean value of 18.5\u00a0days to a mean value of 12\u00a0days in mussels exposed to 2.5\u00a0mg/L of nanoZnO although it was not lethal based on shell opening at concentrations below 50\u00a0mg/L after 96\u00a0h. In mussels exposed to zinc only, the median lethal concentration was estimated at 16\u00a0mg/L (10\u201325 95% CI).

The increased DNA fragmentation and down-regulation of caspase-3 activity in relation to the redox state of glutathione and/or lactate/pyruvate were shown at all exposures.

     "abstract": "Killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) are euryhaline teleosts that are widely used in environmental and toxicological studies, and they are tolerant to arsenic, in part due to very low assimilation of arsenic from the environment. The mechanism of arsenic uptake by the intestine, a major route of arsenic uptake in humans is unknown. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine if aquaglyceroporins (AQPs), which transport water and other small molecules including arsenite across cell membranes, are expressed in the killifish intestine, and whether AQP expression is affected by osmotic stress. Through RT-PCR and sequence analysis of PCR amplicons, we demonstrated that the intestine expresses kfAQP3a and kfAQP3b, two previously identified variants, and also identified a novel variant of killifish AQP3 (kfAQP3c) in the intestine. The variants likely represent alternate splice forms. A BLAST search of the F. heteroclitus reference genome revealed that the AQP3 gene resides on a single locus, while an alignment of the AQP3 sequence among 384 individuals from eight population ranging from Rhode Island to North Carolina revealed that its coding sequence was remarkably conserved with no fixed polymorphism residing in the region that distinguishes these variants. We further demonstrate that the novel variant transports arsenite into HEK293T cells. Whereas kfAQP3a, which does not transport arsenite, was expressed in both freshwater (FW) and saltwater (SW) acclimated fish, kfAQP3b, an arsenic transporter, was expressed only in FW acclimated fish, and kfAQP3c was expressed only in SW acclimated fish. Thus, we have identified a novel, putative splice variant of kfAQP3, kfAQP3c, which transports arsenic and is expressed only in SW acclimated fish.",

Fish responding to the decrease in light intensity by ascending in the water column and moving with or against the flow were considered as having a high propensity to migrate (migrant). Glass eels still sheltering at the end of the 24\u00a0h catching period were considered as having a low propensity to migrate and were called non-migrant. Migrant and non-migrant glass eels were then individually tagged and exposed to isotopically enriched 201MeHg (50\u00a0ng\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) for 11\u00a0days. The effect of contamination was studied on muscle fibre structure, and the expression level of genes involved in mitochondrial activity and antioxidative defence systems. To investigate the effect of MeHg on glass eel behaviour, migrant and non-migrant glass eels were sorted again and the bioaccumulation of 201MeHg and its demethylation product (201Hg(II)) were determined for each individual. MeHg exposure increased activity in non-migrant glass eels but not migratory behaviour. Contamination affected mitochondrial structure and metabolism and suggests a higher oxidative stress and activation of antioxidative defence systems in non-migrant glass eels. Overall, our results suggest that exposure to MeHg might induce an increase in energy expenditure and a higher vulnerability to predation in non-migrant glass eels in the wild.",

     "abstract": "Metal pollution, due to various anthropogenic sources, may pose a threat to marine ecosystems. Metals can be introduced into food chains via bioaccumulation in primary producers, and may potentially lead to toxic effects. Macroalgae are used as food by a wide variety of organisms, and are therefore extremely important in aquatic systems. This study investigated the accumulation and effects of metals in two macroalgae species. The green seaweed, Ulva lactuca and the red seaweed, Agardhiella subulata were each concurrently exposed to five metals (Cu, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Zn) and U. lactuca was also exposed to each metal individually for 48\u00a0h. Metal accumulation in the seaweed was measured, and various photosynthetic parameters were assessed, using imaging pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry. Increased metal accumulation occurred in both seaweed species after 48\u00a0h exposure to metal mixtures and each metal individually. The distribution of metals in both seaweed species changed with increasing metal exposure concentrations, resulting in higher proportions of Cu and Zn in the metal-exposed groups, as compared to respective controls. Further, U. lactuca accumulated higher concentrations of metals when exposed to each metal individually rather than in metal mixtures, suggesting interactions among metals for uptake and/or bioaccumulation. Significant impairment of photosynthetic parameters in U. lactuca was observed after exposure to 100 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L metal mixtures, as well as 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of either Cd or Cu. These results demonstrate metal bioaccumulation and toxic effects in important primary producers, and may have implications for higher trophic levels.",

     "abstract": "Different chemical substances, which enter the environment due to anthropogenic influences, can affect the endocrine system and influence development and physiology of aquatic animals. One of these endocrine disrupting chemicals is the synthetic estrogen, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), which is a main component of various oral contraceptives and demonstrably affects many different aquatic vertebrates at extremely low concentrations by feminization phenomena. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a four week exposure to three different concentrations of EE2 (0.3\u00a0ng/L, 29.6\u00a0ng/L and 2960\u00a0ng/L) affects the catabolism of hemoglobin of the amphibian Xenopus laevis. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time that beside an increase of the hepatic vitellogenin gene expression, exposure to EE2 also decreases the gene expression of the hepatic heme oxygenase 1 and 2 (HO1, HO2), degrading heme of different heme proteins to biliverdin, as well as of the biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA), which converts biliverdin to bilirubin. The results further suggest that EE2 already at the environmentally relevant concentration of (29.6\u00a0ng/L) can disrupt hemoglobin catabolism, indicated by decreased gene expression of HO2, which becomes evident at the highest EE2 concentration that led to a severe increase of biliverdin in plasma.",

     "abstract": "White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) are among the most sensitive species of fishes to Cu, Cd, and Zn, but there is no information about sensitivity of lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). To begin to elucidate molecular mechanism(s) of sensitivity of sturgeons to metals a cDNA encoding metallothionein (MT) was amplified from livers of white sturgeon (WS-MT) and lake sturgeon (LS-MT), and expression in response to Cu, Cd, or Zn was characterized in liver explants from each species. The primary structure of WS-MT and LS-MT contained 20 cysteine residues, which is the same as MTs of teleost fishes. However, the primary structure of WS-MT and LS-MT contained 63 amino acids, which is longer than any MT identified in teleost fishes. Abundance of transcripts of WS-MT in explants exposed to 0.3, 3, 30, or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of Cu was 1.7-, 1.7-, 2.1-, and 2.6-fold less than in controls, respectively. In contrast, abundances of transcripts of WS-MT were 3.3- and 2.4-fold greater in explants exposed to 30\u00a0\u03bcg/L of Cd and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L of Zn, respectively. Abundance of transcripts of LS-MT was not significantly different at any concentration of Cu, Cd, or Zn. MT is hypothesized to represent a critical mechanism for detoxification of metals. Therefore, results of this study suggest that sensitivity of sturgeons to exposure to Cu, Cd, or Zn might be a result of the relatively lesser maximal response of MT to metals. The study also suggestslake sturgeon might be more sensitive than white sturgeon to metals.",

The compounds may possibly influence other calcified tissues. Thus, the present study noted the calcified spicules in sea urchins and examined the effect of both PAHs and OHPAHs on spicule formation during the embryogenesis of sea urchins. After fertilization, benz[a]anthracene (BaA) and 4-hydroxybenz[a]anthracene (4-OHBaA) were added to seawater at concentrations of 10\u2212\u00a08 and 10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M and kept at 18\u00a0\u00b0C. The influence of the compound was given at the time of the pluteus larva. At this stage, the length of the spicule was significantly suppressed by 4-OHBaA (10\u2212\u00a08 and 10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M). BaA (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M) decreased the length of the spicule significantly, while the length did not change with BaA (10\u2212\u00a08\u00a0M). The expression of mRNAs (spicule matrix protein and transcription factors) in the 4-OHBaA (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M)-treated embryos was more strongly inhibited than were those in the BaA (10\u2212\u00a07\u00a0M)-treated embryos.

In one experiment, zebrafish were subjected to two bouts of forced swimming 3\u00a0h apart to test whether prior atrazine exposure affects the ability of the fish to respond appropriately to a repeated stressor. The results demonstrated that controls not exposed to atrazine and zebrafish exposed to atrazine or the atrazine degradates at nominal concentrations of up to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L consistently exhibited increased whole body cortisol content in response to the swimming challenge.

We examined the physiological consequences of Pyrap-AKH application on Tribolium castaneum adults (AKH-normal and AKH-deficient prepared by the RNAi technique) treated by two insecticides, pirimiphos-methyl and deltamethrin. Co-application of pirimiphos-methyl and/or deltamethrin with AKH significantly increased beetle mortality compared with application of the insecticides alone. This co-treatment was accompanied by substantial stimulation of general metabolism, as monitored by carbon dioxide production. Further, the insecticide treatment alone affected some basic markers of oxidative stress: it lowered total antioxidative capacity as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase in the beetle body; in addition, it enhanced the activity of catalase and glutathione-S-transferase. However, these discrepancies in oxidative stress markers were eliminated/reduced by co-application with Pyrap-AKH. We suggest that the elevation of metabolism, which is probably accompanied with faster turnover of toxins, might be responsible for the higher mortality that results after AKH and insecticide co-application. Changes in oxidative stress markers are probably not included in the mechanisms responsible for increased mortality.",

Cadmium is one of the toxic metals in the aquatic environment. However, the endocrine effects of cadmium on the molting of freshwater crabs and the underlying mechanisms are unknown.

Our results showed that eyestalk ablation increased the ecdysteroid content as well as the activities of chitinase and NAG, which were inhibited by cadmium in a concentration-dependent manner; histological examinations demonstrated that eyestalk ablation produced storage particles in the epidermal tissues, which was also reduced by cadmium in a concentration-dependent manner. Our data suggest that cadmium disrupts endocrine function through inhibiting the secretion of ecdysteroids by the Y-organ and altering with the regulation of chitinase and NAG activity in the epidermis. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the molting inhibition effect of cadmium on the crabs.",

Bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels, are widely used as sentinel organisms in biomonitoring studies for assessing the impact of anthropogenic contaminants. The gills, mainly involved in nutrient uptake, digestion, gas exchange and neuronal signaling, are the first organ to be affected by pollutants present in the external environment, and therefore were selected as the target organ for this study. Mussels from an aquaculture farm were caged at a highly polluted petrochemical area and a reference site along the Augusta coastline (eastern Sicily, Italy) for one month. A battery of biomarkers indicative of neuronal perturbations was applied on gills in order to investigate on the serotonergic (i.e. serotonin, 5-HT, and its receptor, 5-HT3R), cholinergic (i.e. acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase, AChE, and choline acetyltransferase, ChAT), and dopaminergic systems (i.e. tyrosine and tyrosine hydroxylase, TH). Overall, impairment in the normal ciliary motility was found in mussels caged at the polluted site. Alterations in serotoninergic and cholinergic systems were revealed, with enhancement of dopaminergic neurotransmission resulting in a cilio-inhibitory effect. However, the over-expression in 5-HT3R and ChAT at cellular level may indicate an adaptive response of mussels to recover a regular physiological activity in gills. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses 1H NMR and immunohistochemical assays. Their concurrent use demonstrated to be sensitive and effective for assessing environmental influences on the health status of aquatic organisms, and thus suitable to be applied in ecotoxicological studies.",

The percentage of haemocytes with amoeboid morphology and containing phagocytised yeast cells were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced after exposure to 0.1 (31.7\u00a0\u03bcg/l) and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM (158\u00a0\u03bcg/l), respectively. An antagonistic interaction in inducing cytoskeletal alterations was observed when ZnP and TBT were co-present in the exposure medium. ZnP affected only the actin component. As caused by TBT, ZnP induced apoptosis and inhibited both oxidative phosphorylation and lysosomal activities. In contrast to the case of TBT, a decrement in Ca2+-ATPase activity and a decrease in cytosolic Ca2+ were detected after incubation at the highest concentration (1\u00a0\u03bcM, i.e., 317.7\u00a0\u03bcg/l) used. In comparison with other antifouling compounds, ZnP shows as much toxicity as TBT to cultured haemocytes at extremely low concentrations interfering with fundamental cell activities.",

The present study for the first time delineates stress alleviating and lifespan prolonging action of specioside (SPC), isolated from Stereospermum suaveolens in the free living, multicellular nematode model Caenorhabditis elegans. A strong correlation between lifespan extension and stress modulation in adult worms was established in a dose dependent manner. The dietary intake of this phytomolecule elevated juglone induced oxidative and heat induced thermal stress tolerance in C. elegans. On evaluation, it was found that 25\u00a0\u03bcM dose of SPC significantly extended lifespan by 15.47% (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0001) with reduction in stress level. Furthermore, SPC enhanced mean survival in mev-1 mutant suggesting its oxidative stress reducing potential. Furthermore, SPC augmented stress modulatory enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) level in C. elegans. Altogether, these findings broaden current perspectives concerning stress alleviating potentials of SPC and have implications in development of therapeutics for curing age related disorders.",

     "abstract": "The primary method of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) control in the Great Lakes is the treatment of streams and rivers with the pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM), which targets larval sea lamprey. However, less is known about the effects of TFM on other stages of the sea lamprey's complex life cycle. The goal of this study was to determine how TFM affected internal energy stores, metabolites, and ion balance in larval, juvenile (parasitic) and adult sea lamprey. The larvae were more tolerant to TFM than the adults, with a 2-fold higher 12\u00a0h TFM LC50 and a 1.5-fold higher LC99.9. Acute (3\u00a0h) exposure of the larvae, parasites and adults to their respective 12\u00a0h TFM LC99.9 led to marked reductions in glycogen and phosphocreatine in the adult brain, with lesser or no effect in the larvae and parasites. Increased lactate in the brain, at less than the expected stoichiometry, suggested that it was exported to the blood. Kidney glycogen declined after TFM exposure, suggesting that this organ plays an important role in glucose homeostasis. TFM-induced disturbances to ion balance were minimal. In conclusion, TFM perturbs energy metabolism in all major stages of the sea lamprey life cycle in a similar fashion, but the adults appear to be the most sensitive. Thus, the adult stage could be a viable and effective target for TFM treatment, particularly when used in combination with other existing and emerging strategies of sea lamprey control.",

Despite their widespread occurrence, literature data on the accumulation and effects of these compounds in aquatic ecosystems are sparsely available. The goal of this study was to gain insights into the biomagnification and effects of 1,2,3,5,7-pentachloronaphthalene (PeCN52) in an experimental food chain consisting of benthic worms and juvenile rainbow trout. Worms were contaminated with PeCN52 by passive dosing from polydimethylsiloxane silicone. The contaminated worms were then used to feed the juvenile rainbow trout at 0.12, 0.25 or 0.50\u00a0\u03bcg/g\u00a0fish\u00a0wet weight/day, and the resulting internal whole-body concentrations of the individual fish were linked to biological responses. A possible involvement of the cellular detoxification system was explored by measuring PeCN52-induced expression of the phase I biotransformation enzyme gene cyp1a1 and the ABC transporter gene abcb1a.At the end of the 28-day study, biomagnification factors were similar for all dietary intake levels with values between 0.5 and 0.7\u00a0kg\u00a0lipidfish/kg lipidworm. The average uptake efficiency of 60% indicated that a high amount of PeCN52 was transferred from the worms to the fish. Internal concentrations of up to 175\u00a0mg/kg fish lipid in the highest treatment level did not result in effects on survival, behavior, or growth of the juvenile trout, but were associated with the induction of phase I metabolism which was evident from the significant up-regulation of cyp1a1 expression in the liver. In contrast, no changes were seen in abcb1a transcript levels.",

This species is popularly known as \u201cfire coral\u201d, since contact with it causes severe pain, skin eruptions and blisters. Intravenous administration of of M. complanata aqueous extract induces violent convulsions and death in mice within 1 min (LD50\u00a0=\u00a04.62\u00a0\u00b5g\u00a0protein/g of body weight). Doses less than the LD50 produced histopathological damage in kidneys and lungs. Such histopathological damage was completely eliminated after incubation of the extract in heat denaturing conditions. Unexpectedly, the denatured extract conserved its lethal effect. These findings demonstrated that the extract contained hemolytic and phospholipase activities that might be responsible for the histopathological damage, and additionally it contained other unidentified thermostable toxins with lethal effects in mice. Chromatographic analysis of the extract led to the isolation of a 61\u00a0kDa vasoconstrictor protein. Furthermore, several non-peptidic vasoconstrictor fractions were separated. Particularly interesting was the fraction MC1-IIA obtained as a result of three-step chromatography processes (ion exchange, gel filtration and reverse phase). Like the original crude extract, this fraction induced vasoconstriction and delayed hemolysis and lethal effects in mice. A subsequent chromatographic analysis of MC1-IIA showed that this fraction contained at least four non-peptidic compounds. MS and NMR spectroscopic data analyses indicated that these metabolites were poly-oxygenated alkylbenzenes. The present study constitutes the first report of the presence of non-peptidic lethal toxins in an organism of the class Hydrozoa, and evidences the great structural diversity of the toxins produced by the Millepora species.",

LBPs (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6\u00a0mg/ml) was added to PCLSs culture system before (pre-treatment), after (post-treatment) and both before and after (pre- and post-treatment) the exposure of PCLSs to 12\u00a0mM CCl4. The supernatants and PCLSs were collected for biochemical analyses. Results showed that LBPs inhibited the elevations of the marker enzymes (GOT, GPT, LDH and AKP) and MDA induced by CCl4 in all LBPs treatments and it also enhanced the suppressed antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GSH-Px, GST) and GSH, in the pre-treatment and pre- and post-treatment. In vivo, fish were fed diets containing LBPs at 0.1, 0.5 and 1% for 60\u00a0d before an intraperitoneal injection of 30% CCl4 in olive oil at a volume of 0.05\u00a0ml/10\u00a0g body weight. At 72\u00a0h post-injection, blood and liver samples were taken for biochemical analyses. Results showed that LBPs at 0.5 and 1% significantly reduced the levels of GOT, GPT and LDH in the serum; the decreases of the antioxidant enzymes and the increase of MDA in the liver tissue were inhibited markedly. Moreover, LBPs even at lower concentration exerted a potent DPPH scavenging activity. Overall results prove the hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects of LBPs and support the use of LBPs as a hepatoprotective agent in fish.",

We determined the following endpoints: survival rate during exposure and recovery, swimming performance, heart rate, thoracic limb movement determined by image analysis, haemoglobin level by ELISA assay, catalase and nitric oxide species (NOx) by spectrophotometric methods. The results showed 80% survival of daphnids exposed to 50\u00a0mg/L of ECT after 24\u00a0h and 10% after 90\u00a0h, however lower concentrations of ECT were well tolerated. A concentration-dependent reduction of swimming velocity was noted at 24 and 48\u00a0h of the exposure. ECT (at 2.5 and 4\u00a0mg/L) induced an increase of heart rate and thoracic limb movement (at 2.5, 4 and 20\u00a0mg/L) after 24\u00a0h. After 10\u00a0h of the exposure to ECT daphnids showed a concentration-dependent increase of haemoglobin level synthesized and accumulated in the epipodite epithelia. After 24\u00a0h we noted a concentration-dependent decrease of haemoglobin level and its lowest value was found after 48\u00a0h of the exposure. ECT at a concentration of 20 and 25\u00a0mg/L slightly stimulated catalase activity after 24\u00a0h. NOx level was also increased after 10\u00a0h of the exposure to 20 and 25\u00a0mg/L of ECT reaching maximal activity after 24\u00a0h.

The temporal dynamics of the responses was assessed by measurements at 3, 7 and 14\u00a0days of exposure.C. apertus exposed to Carbaryl activates a number of enzymatic antioxidant responses, represented by the early induction of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, followed by a delayed induction of superoxide dismutase. Concomitantly, a derangement of the total oxyradical scavenging of the tissues was observed, suggesting an overall impairment of the tissue capability to neutralize ROS probably resulting from the overall negative balance between enzymatic antioxidant defense capability and oxidative stress intensity. This negative balance exposed the animals to the risk of oxidative stress damages including genotoxic damage. Compared to acetylcholinesterase inhibition, the antioxidant responses developed to Carbaryl exposure at the low concentration utilized showed a greater percentage variation in exposed organisms.The results pointed out the high sensitivity of the antioxidant and oxidative stress related responses to Carbaryl exposure at an environmental realistic concentration, demonstrating their usefulness in environmental monitoring and risk assessment.

These same areas may also experience changes in salinity due to freshwater discharge and tidal influence. Biota that inhabit near-shore coastal environments may be susceptible to both stressors. Although copper is a noted concern in marine environments, effects of copper and varying salinity on symbiotic cnidarians are only scarcely studied. The sea anemone, Exaiptasia pallida, was used to investigate effects of copper on physiological impairment (i.e. activities of anti-oxidant enzymes) at two different salinities (20 and 25\u00a0ppt). E. pallida was exposed to a control and three elevated copper concentrations for up to 21\u00a0d, and copper accumulation and activity of the enzymes: catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and carbonic anhydrase were measured in the anemones. Photosynthetic parameters in E. pallida's symbiotic dinoflagellate algae were also quantified. Over the course of the exposure, E. pallida accumulated copper in a concentration-dependent manner. Higher tissue copper concentrations were observed in anemones exposed to the lower salinity water (20\u00a0ppt), and physiological impairment was observed as a consequence of both increased copper exposure and decreased salinity; however, changes in salinity caused a greater response than copper exposure, at the levels tested. In general, antioxidant enzyme activity increased as a consequence of decreased salinity and/or increased copper exposure. These results clearly demonstrated the influence of two local stressors, at environmentally realistic concentrations, on a sensitive cnidarian, and highlight the importance of characterizing combined exposure scenarios.",

     "abstract": "In freshwater fish, exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of waterborne copper (Cu) results in inhibitions of ammonia excretion (Jamm) and Na+ uptake (JNain), yet the mechanisms by which these occur are not fully understood. In the present study, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fry exposed to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/l Cu for 24\u00a0h displayed a sustained 40% decrease in Jamm and a transient 60% decrease in JNain. Previously, these effects have been attributed to inhibitions of gill Na+/K+-ATPase and/or carbonic anhydrase (CA) activities by Cu. Trout fry did not display significant reductions in the branchial activities of these enzymes or H+-ATPase over 24\u00a0h Cu exposure. Recently, Rhesus (Rh) glycoproteins, bi-directional NH3 gas channels, have been implicated in the mechanism of Cu toxicity. Juvenile trout were exposed to nominal 0, 50, and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/l Cu for 3\u20136\u00a0h under control conditions (ammonia-free water) followed by 6\u00a0h exposure to high environmental ammonia (HEA; 1.5\u00a0mmol/l NH4HCO3). HEA led to significant ammonia uptake in control fish (0\u00a0\u03bcg/l Cu), and exposure to 50 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/l Cu resulted in significant reductions of ammonia uptake during HEA exposure. This is the first evidence that Cu inhibits both the excretion and uptake of ammonia, implicating bi-directional Rh glycoproteins as a target for Cu toxicity. We propose a model whereby Rh blockade by Cu causes the sustained inhibition of Jamm and transient inhibition of JNain, with H+-ATPase potentially aiding in JNain recovery. More work is needed to elucidate the role of Rh proteins in sub-lethal Cu toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is currently the most widely-used brominated flame retardant (BFR) and has been proven to have a very high toxicity to aquatic organisms including bivalves. In this study, a laboratory experiment was conducted to obtain a better understanding of the role of algae food on the bioaccumulation of TBBPA and its effects on the suspension-feeding bivalve, the scallop, Chlamys farreri. Scallops were exposed to TBBPA via algae food alone or food\u00a0+\u00a0water for 10\u00a0days. Results showed that TBBPA was accumulated rapidly by scallops, reaching an approximate steady state in soft tissues within 3\u00a0days. The primary route of TBBPA accumulation was via the water, while dietary uptake was relatively minor. TBBPA exposure led to significant inhibition on microsomal cytochrome P450 and cytochrome b5 levels in gills and digestive gland, whereas GST activity and GSH level increased significantly, which indicated that TBBPA could be a suitable substrate to directly participate in phase II metabolism. TBBPA clearly induced the activity of SOD, suggesting the oxidant stress induced by TBBPA. This study suggests that dietary uptake was not the predominant uptake route for TBBPA in bivalves and also provides a preliminary basis for studying the detoxification and antioxidant responses of marine bivalves upon exposure to TBBPA.",

     "abstract": "Ultraviolet B (UV-B) radiation presents an environmental hazard to aquatic organisms. To understand the molecular responses of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus to UV-B radiation, we measured the acute toxicity response to 96\u00a0h of UV-B radiation, and we also assessed the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, glutathione (GSH) content, and antioxidant enzyme (GST, GR, GPx, and SOD) activities after 24\u00a0h of exposure to UV-B with LD50 and half LD50 values. Also, expression patterns of p53 and hsp gene families with phosphorylation of p38 MAPK were investigated in UV-B-exposed copepods. We found that the ROS level, GSH content, and antioxidant enzyme activity levels were increased with the transcriptional upregulation of antioxidant-related genes, indicating that UV-B induces oxidative stress by generating ROS and stimulating antioxidant enzymatic activity as a defense mechanism. Additionally, we found that p53 expression was significantly increased after UV-B irradiation due to increases in the phosphorylation of the stress-responsive p38 MAPK, indicating that UV-B may be responsible for inducing DNA damage in T. japonicus. Of the hsp family genes, transcriptional levels of hsp20, hsp20.7, hsp70, and hsp90 were elevated in response to a low dose of UV-B radiation (9\u00a0kJ\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02), suggesting that these hsp genes may be involved in cellular protection against UV-B radiation. In this paper, we performed a pathway-oriented mechanistic analysis in response to UV-B radiation, and this analysis provides a better understanding of the effects of UV-B in the intertidal benthic copepod T. japonicus.",

We studied the short and long-term effects of early-life lead exposure on antioxidant defense and phagocytosis activity in a small passerine bird, the great tit (Parus major) by manipulating dietary lead levels of the nestlings. We had three experimental groups, exposed to environmentally relevant lead concentrations; high (4\u00a0\u03bcg/g body mass), low (1\u00a0\u03bcg/g body mass) and control (0\u00a0\u03bcg/g body mass) group. As a comparison, a great tit population breeding in the vicinity of a metal smelter was included to the experimental set-up. We measured glutathione, the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione, and the antioxidant enzymes: glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, catalase and superoxide dismutase together with protein carbonylation and phagocytosis activity to study the effects of lead on the oxidative status and immune function of birds. We found differences in enzyme activities between the study groups, but in most cases the smelter group differed from the other groups. Despite the differences observed in antioxidant enzymes, our results indicate only minor short-term effects of lead exposure on oxidative status, since either glutathione ratio or protein carbonylation were not affected by lead. Phagocytosis activity was not linked to higher lead concentrations either. Interestingly, protein carbonylation was positively associated with enzyme activities and glutathione level. Our results did not show major long-term effects of lead on the oxidative status of great tits.",

These toxicants can be accumulated in aquatic animals and transferred along the food chain and thus pose adverse effects on aquatic environment and public health. Zebrafish Abcb4 is reported to mediate the cellular efflux of ecotoxicologically relevant compounds including galaxolide, tonalide and phenanthrene; however, it remains unclear whether Abcb4 functions in the detoxification of MC-LR. Here, we demonstrated the role of zebrafish Abcb4 in cellular efflux of MC-LR. Transcripts of zebrafish abcb4 were detected in all of adult tissues examined. MC-LR was able to induce the expression of abcb4 gene and overexpression of Abcb4 significantly decreased the cytotoxicity and accumulation of MC-LR in LLC-PK1 cells and developing embryos. In contrast, overexpression of an Abcb4-G1177D mutant abolished its transporter function but not substrate binding activity, and sensitized LLC-PK1 cells and developing embryos to this cyanobacterial toxin. Moreover, ATPase activity in developing embryos can be induced by MC-LR. Thus, zebrafish Abcb4 plays crucial roles in cellular efflux of MC-LR and is a potential molecular marker for the monitoring of cyanobacteria contamination in the aquatic environment.",

Both are structural analogs of the neurotransmitter, glutamate, and bind postsynaptic glutamate receptors. In this study, the effect of ingestion of these toxins on the response of a singly-innervated, identified, glutamatergic postsynaptic cell in a living, undissected Drosophila is observed by intracellular recording. Previously we have reported that ingested BMAA behaves as an NMDA agonist that produces an abnormal NMDA response in the postsynaptic cell. It is shown here that BOAA also behaves as an NMDA agonist, and produces an effect very similar to that of BMAA on the postsynaptic response. In response to a single stimulus, the amplitude of the NMDA component is decreased, while the time to peak and duration of the NMDA component are greatly increased. No discernable effect on the AMPA component of the response was observed. Furthermore, both BMAA and BOAA cause an NMDAR-specific desensitization in response to repetitive stimulation at the physiological frequency for the postsynaptic cell (5\u00a0Hz). The possibility that this phenomenon may represent a response to excessive Ca2\u00a0+ entry through NMDAR channels is discussed. This desensitization phenomenon, as well as the abnormal NMDAR gating characteristics induced by BMAA, appears to be rescued during higher frequency stimulation (e.g. 10, 20\u00a0Hz).",

Estrogenic potential of this substance was demonstrated by VTG up-regulation as well. Metoprolol was either less effective than diclofenac or metabolized using different pathways.

IgY concentrations in the plasma were determined 1\u00a0d (rainbow trout) or 5\u00a0d after last feeding (both species). Irrespective of the enhancer used, ELISA revealed IgY absorption after feeding in carp, whereas IgY concentration in rainbow trout remained below the detection threshold. Intraperitoneal injections revealed IgY in plasma of both species. In vitro Ussing chamber experiments with posterior intestine tissue of carp and trout were carried out to determine whether species-specific differences in IgY translocation were due to acidic stomach passage or species-specific differences in transepithelial IgY passage. Significantly higher IgY translocation was measured in carp at high application dosage compared to all other groups, indicating that species-specific differences in IgY uptake after oral administration are not only related to peptic IgY degradation in the stomach, but also likely a result of differences in IgY transcytosis in the posterior intestine.",

It was homogeneous on SDS-PAGE, with a molecular mass estimated to 35\u00a0kDa and presents a pI of 5.6.

This proteinase displayed a fibrinogenolytic and hemorrhagic activities. The proteolytic and hemorrhagic activities of CcMP-II were inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. However, these activities were not affected by aprotinine and PMSF, suggesting that CcMP-II is a zinc-dependent hemorrhagic metalloproteinase with an \u03b1-fibrinogenase activity. The hemorrhagic metalloproteinase CcMP-II was also able to hydrolyze extracellular matrix components, such as type IV collagen and laminin.

Food supplementation with hexavalent chromium (Na2CrO4) at high concentrations delayed larval development and decreased the percentage of larvae that pupated which indicated a relatively low toxicity. The supplement decreased glucose levels in fly hemolymph, but at concentrations of 5\u201325\u00a0\u03bcM increased fly carbohydrate reserves: hemolymph trehalose and whole body trehalose and glycogen. The data on parameters of carbohydrate metabolism show that chromate possesses some insulin-mimetic properties. The changes in metabolism of carbohydrates under chromate exposure were also accompanied by an increase in total lipid levels and in the portion of triacylglycerides among all lipids. Chromate addition to fly food did not affect male or female body mass, but reduced food consumption by females at all concentrations used, whereas in males only 500\u00a0\u03bcM chromate decreased food consumption. The data show that: (1) Cr6\u00a0+ has many of the same effects as Cr3\u00a0+ suggesting that it might be just as effective to treat diabetic states, likely as a result of intracellular reduction of Cr6\u00a0+ ions, and (2) the Drosophila model can be used to develop new approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms of chromium as an insulin-mimetic. Although it is usually believed that hexavalent chromium possesses higher toxicity than the trivalent ion, due to its easier penetration into the cell, application of hexavalent chromium may substantially decrease the chromium doses needed to get the desired effects.",

Cd levels were significantly elevated in the gill and kidney following injection however levels in the kidney continued to accumulate while levels in the gill either did not change or decreased with time. Cd caused a generalized stress condition as indicated by an increase in blood glucose, lactate and cortisol levels as well as an oxidative stress indicated by increases in lipid peroxidation and protein carbonyl content. Furthermore, tilapia exhibited impairment in their osmoregulatory status based on the fall in plasma sodium levels. Concerning ion regulatory disruption, the kidney was the most affected organ since there was a generalized increase in renal Na+/K+-ATPase activity after 1\u00a0day of exposure to Cd followed by a significant decrease in day 7. This study provides some insights into the mechanisms of Cd toxicity at physiological and biochemical levels and complements previously reported findings on O. niloticus.

     "abstract": "A lectin secreted from Andrias davidianus skin (ADL) was purified by affinity chromatography on porcine stomach mucin (type III) (PSM)-crosslinked albumin, followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and HPLC on TSK gel G3000PWXL. The purified lectin was found to be a dimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. SDS-PAGE showed that the ADL protein had a molecular mass of 17\u00a0kDa. ADL produced an 8.5\u00a0kDa band when examined using SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. ADL agglutinated native and trypsinized human B erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by glycoproteins, such as PSM and asialo-PSM, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The activity was stable between 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Significant ADL activity was observed between pH\u00a04\u20135. The lectin reaction did not depend on the presence of the divalent cation Ca2\u00a0+ or Mg2\u00a0+. The N-terminal ADL sequence was determined to be VGYTVGATPM. The lectin exhibited antibacterial activity, involving growth and respiration inhibition in Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Shewanella sp. Furthermore, ADL showed inhibition activity against the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These findings suggest that ADL plays an important role in the innate immunity of A. davidianus on the body surface.",

We investigated the modulatory potential of T. japonicus-AChE (TJ-AChE) for biocide response by cloning, sequencing, and characterizing the full-length genomic DNA of the TJ-AChE1 and TJ-AChE2 genes. The deduced TJ-AChE proteins were highly conserved across species and were distinctively separated into two subtypes, AChE1 and AChE2. Each TJ-AChE protein was closely phylogenetically clustered with invertebrate AChE1 and AChE2 proteins. Transcriptional level of TJ-AChE1 was higher than TJ-AChE2 in all developmental stages. TJ-AChE1 mRNA decreased in response to five biocides (alachlor, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, endosulfan, lindane,) but not in the molinate-exposed group. TJ-AChE2 decreased significantly only in response to chlorpyrifos and lindane. TJ-AChE enzymatic activity was significantly inhibited when exposed to alachlor, chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, or lindane for 24\u00a0h.

Endosulfan exposure caused a significant increase in plasma estradiol-17\u03b2 (E2) and decreased plasma testosterone (T) but not 11 ketotestosterone (11-KT). Tihan decreased significantly plasma E2 and 11-KT, but not T. Endosulfan doses altered gonad histology and induced high proportions (18\u201330% of males) of ovotestis in males and follicular atretic oocytes in females, indicating occurrence of feminization in fish. Tihan also altered gonad histology but only one case of ovotestis was observed at the highest dose. Presence of foam cells in lobular lumen, fibrosis, necrosis, and immature cells released in lobular lumen were found in male gonads and melano-macrophage centers (MMCs), necrosis, fibrosis and vacuolation were observed in female gonads. Fish livers also suffered injuries such as MMCs, necrosis, fibrosis, vacuolation, dilatation of sinusoids, and nuclear pleomorphism. Chronic Tihan and Thionex exposures decreased fertilization rate, hatching rate, ova and larval weight, as well as larval resistance to osmotic choc. They also delayed hatching and increased abnormalities in the F1 generation, all these indicators suggesting transgenerational effects of these compounds.",

The effect that such conditions may have on fathead minnow development has yet to be explicitly described. Here we compared rates of embryonic development in fathead minnow embryos reared under standard light and temperature conditions with a range of possible methods. All methods yielded excellent control survival. We demonstrated that fathead minnow embryos incubated in a range of small volumes in multi-well plates (500\u00a0\u03bcL to 2\u00a0mL per embryo) did not substantially vary in developmental rate, but flexed less frequently as embryos, hatched smaller, later and with larger yolk-sacs, and initiated feeding later than embryos reared in an excess of solution (20\u00a0mL per embryo) with or without supplemental aeration. Faster hatch and growth were promoted with an orbital shaker, but growth benefits were not sustained into the larval stage. Developmental differences persisted in larvae reared to 20\u00a0days post-fertilization when monitoring ceased, but growth differences did not magnify and in some measurements partially resolved. To our knowledge we are the first to report effects of incubation in multi-well plates in any fish taxa. As our data revealed that the eleutheroembryonic stage for fathead minnow may be prolonged in multi-well plates, this may allow the use of longer toxicity tests using fathead minnow embryos without conflicting with existing animal welfare legislation in many countries.",

Zebrafish embryos were exposed to 0.25\u00a0mg/L CPF, and embryo samples were collected until 24\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf). To gain a better understanding of the response of zebrafish embryos to CPF exposure, two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D PAGE) coupled with mass spectrometry was employed to carry out a comparative proteomic analysis. Total proteins were extracted from the control and treated samples, separated by 2D PAGE, and visualized by silver staining. A total of 59 protein spots showed reproducible changes compared with the control. Of these 59 spots, 19 were selected and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF/TOF) analysis; 9 differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified, including 3 up-regulated proteins and 6 down-regulated proteins. The increased expression of 3 proteins associated with detoxification and stress response suggested that the activation of protective proteins was required in zebrafish embryos exposed to CPF. On the other hand, the decreased expression of 6 proteins is mainly involved in cytoskeleton structure, protein translation, signal transduction and lipoprotein metabolism. These data may help us understand the functions and the molecular mechanisms of these proteins in zebrafish embryos' response to CPF exposure.",

     "abstract": "QT interval of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measure of the duration of the ventricular depolarization and repolarization. In humans, prolongation of the QT interval is a known clinical risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias including \u2018Torsades de Pointes\u2019 and possible sudden cardiac death. After oral administration, fluoxetine (FLX), as well as other selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors can affect cardiac autonomic control, including the QT interval. However, the action of centrally administered FLX on the QT interval has never been explored. Consequently, using the unanesthetized trout as an animal model, we sought to compare the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of FLX (5, 15 or 25\u00a0\u00b5g) on the QT interval of the ECG with the effects observed following ICV injection of 5-HT (0.05, 0.5 or 5\u00a0nmol). The QT interval was corrected for the R\u2013R interval. The highest doses of centrally administered FLX and 5-HT induced a prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval reaching a maximum value of 5\u201310\u00a0min after injection (+8% and +6% respectively, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The intra-arterial (IA) injections of 5-HT and FLX were without significant effect on the QTc. The IA injection of blockers of the autonomic nervous system indicated that the sympathetic nervous system modulated the QTc interval. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that for the first time in any animal species, cardiac electrophysiology is sensitive to central 5-HT and that FLX within the brain may disrupt the autonomic control of ventricular repolarization.",

In rats exposed to BPA by maternal gavage, alteration in the developmental programming, higher obesity rates and reproductive anomalies were induced. Starting with this evidence, the aim of this study was to provide important insights on the effects induced by a BPA enriched diet, on the reproductive physiology and metabolism of juvenile fish, simulating the scenario occurring when wild fish fed on prey contaminated with environmental BPA. Seabream was chosen as model, as it is one of the primary commercial species valued by consumers and these results could provide important findings on adverse effects that could be passed on to humans by eating contaminated fish. A novel method for measuring BPA in the food and water by affinity chromatography was developed. Analysis of signals involved in reproduction uncovered altered levels of vtg and Zp, clearly indicating the estrogenic effect of BPA. Similarly, BPA up-regulated catd and era gene expression. A noteworthy outcome from this study was the full length cloning of two vtg encoding proteins, namely vtgA and vtgB, which are differently modulated by BPA. Cyp1a1 and EROD activity were significantly downregulated, confirming the ability of estrogenic compounds to inhibit the detoxification process. GST activity was unaffected by BPA contamination, while CAT activity was down regulated. These results collectively confirm the estrogenic effect of BPA and provide additional characterization of novel vtg genes in Sparus aurata.",

There is limited information about the toxic potential of SMZ at the cellular and molecular levels, especially in aquatic and/or non-target organisms.

In addition, the plasma testosterone levels were analysed using radioimmunoassay (RIA) and testis was examined for evidence of gross pathology and histopathology. Our data showed that pre-pubertal exposure to DBP produced alterations in testicular architecture as evident by poorly developed or mis-shaped testis, and altered spermatogenesis due to tubular degeneration and atrophy of seminiferous tubules especially in the high DBP dose (200 and 400\u00a0mg/kg) treated groups. In addition, DBP altered several key enzymes involved in testicular steroidogenesis pathways in an apparent dose-dependent manner. For example, biphasic effects of DBP were observed for P450scc and 3\u03b2-hsd mRNA, that were generally increasing at low dose 10\u00a0mg/kg, and thereafter, an apparent dose-dependent decrease between 50 and 400\u00a0mg/kg. The steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein was at the lowest detectable limits and therefore not quantifiable. These effects did not parallel the non-significant changes observed for plasma testosterone levels. The present data is consistent with previous reports showing that DBP modulates Leydig cell steroidogenesis in several species, with a potential negative effect on reproduction in those avian species that are vulnerable to endocrine disrupting chemicals.",

Bivalves were exposed in microcosms for 28\u00a0days to individual selenium spiked sediments, 0, 5 and 20\u00a0\u03bcg/g dry mass. T. deltoidalis accumulated selenium from spiked sediment but not in proportion to the sediment selenium concentrations. The majority of recovered subcellular selenium was associated with the nuclei and cellular debris fraction, probably as protein bound selenium associated with plasma and selenium bound directly to cell walls. Selenium exposed organisms had increased biologically detoxified selenium burdens which were associated with both granule and metallothionein like protein fractions, indicating selenium detoxification. Half of the biologically active selenium was associated with the mitochondrial fraction with up to 4 fold increases in selenium in exposed organisms. Selenium exposed T. deltoidalis had significantly reduced GSH:GSSG ratios indicating a build-up of oxidised glutathione. Total antioxidant capacity of selenium exposed T. deltoidalis was significantly reduced which corresponded with increased lipid peroxidation, lysosomal destabilisation and micronuclei frequency.

However, the effect of heavy metals on zooplankton at the molecular level remains still unclear. In this study, we measured the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and the antioxidant enzyme activities for 96\u00a0h after exposure to five heavy metals: arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), silver (Ag), and zinc (Zn) in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus japonicus. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes were highly elevated in metal-exposed copepods, indicating that heavy metals can induce oxidative stress by generating ROS, and stimulate the involvement of antioxidant enzymes as cellular defense mechanisms. Subsequently, transcriptional changes in hsp gene families were further investigated in the metal-exposed groups for 96\u00a0h. The ROS level and glutathione (GSH) content were significantly increased in Ag-, As-, and Cu-exposed copepods, while they were only slightly elevated in Cd- and Zn-exposed groups. Based on the numbers of significantly modulated hsp genes and their expression levels for 96\u00a0h, we measured the effect of heavy metals to stress genes of T. japonicus in the following order: Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Zn\u00a0>\u00a0Ag\u00a0>\u00a0As\u00a0>\u00a0Cd, implying that Cu acts as a stronger oxidative stress inducer than other heavy metals.

Immunoblot analysis revealed that HO-1 accumulation was not induced by heat shock but was enhanced by sodium arsenite and cadmium chloride in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Immunocytochemistry revealed that these metals induced HO-1 accumulation in a granular pattern primarily in the cytoplasm. Additionally, in 20% of the cells arsenite induced the formation of large HO-1-containing perinuclear structures. In cells recovering from sodium arsenite or cadmium chloride treatment, HO-1 accumulation initially increased to a maximum at 12\u00a0h followed by a 50% reduction at 48\u00a0h. This initial increase in HO-1 levels was likely the result of new synthesis as it was inhibited by cycloheximide. Interestingly, treatment of cells with a mild heat shock enhanced HO-1 accumulation induced by low concentrations of sodium arsenite and cadmium chloride. Finally, we determined that HO-1 accumulation was induced in A6 cells by the proteasomal inhibitors, MG132, withaferin A and celastrol.

     "abstract": "Altered concentration of the vertebrate yolk protein precursor vitellogenin is a recognized biomarker for endocrine disruption in fish, and within recent years yolk protein alteration has also been associated with endocrine disruption in bivalves. Species-specific, direct and sensitive methods for quantification of vitellogenin in fish have been available for years whereas bivalve yolk protein levels have been estimated indirectly by alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) liberated from high molecular weight proteins because the sequence and biochemical structure of most bivalve yolk proteins are unknown. By applying a species-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for accurate determination of yolk protein level the impact of 17\u03b2-estradiol (57, 164 and 512\u00a0ng/L) on the freshwater bivalve Unio tumidus was investigated and compared with ALP estimations. Seven weeks of exposure during the pre-spawning and spawning period had no consistent effect on yolk protein concentration in hemolymph, and ALP levels in hemolymph also remained unchanged in both males and females. Further, basal male and female ALP levels were indistinguishable whereas the ELISA demonstrated that yolk protein levels of females exceeded male levels at the time of sampling, although male basal levels were high compared to fish. Altogether it is shown that individual ALP levels do not reflect yolk protein levels and hence hemolymph ALP levels cannot serve as biomarker for estrogenic exposure during the pre-spawning and spawning period in U. tumidus. The necessity of sensitive and validated biomarkers for reliable interpretation of data and the utility of ALP and yolk protein levels as biomarkers in bivalves are discussed.",

Tissue [Zn] also increased in gill, liver, intestine, and carcass at 0\u00a0ppt. (ii) Both branchial and intestinal Ca2+ ATPase activities decreased in response to Zn at 0\u00a0ppt and were elevated at 35 ppt.

Unfortunately, there is limited information about its potential impacts on responses of genes and enzymes related to fish detoxification. In the present work, we cloned CYP3A and alpha-GST of yellow catfish (Pelteobagrus fulvidraco) and tested the transcriptional expression of CYP1A, CYP3A and GST as well as the alterations of their corresponding enzymes, including ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), aminopyrine N-demethylase (APND), erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT), and also the oxidative product malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the liver of P. fulvidraco exposed to TCS. Amino acids of CYP3A and GST were deduced and phylogenetic tree was constructed respectively. High identity percent was exhibited between P. fulvidraco and other species, such as other fish, birds and mammals. Results indicated that TCS significantly elevated CYP1A and GST but decreased CYP3A expression, EROD activity and MDA content at lower concentrations of TCS at 24\u00a0h. Moreover, CYP3A and GST were significantly inhibited at 72\u00a0h but induced at 168\u00a0h at lower concentrations. However, CYP3A was always induced at the highest concentration during the exposure period. Furthermore, CYP3A, GST, GST enzyme and MDA content exhibited a dose\u2013effect relationship to some extent, but no significant responses were observed in ERND, APND and CAT except for individual treatments. Taken together, EROD was the most sensitive to TCS exposure as compared to other enzymes. Meanwhile, mRNA responses were more sensitive in yellow catfish.",

In this study, the expression patterns of novel teleost CYP3 genes were determined in medaka(Oryzias latipes; CYP3B4, CYP3B5, CYP3B6) and zebrafish (Danio rerio; CYP3C1, CYP3C2, CYP3C3, CYP3C4), two important model fish species. Expression was quantified with real time PCR in multiple internal organs from adult male and female fish. CYP3C gene expression was determined in zebrafish embryos. Expression in all organs was detected for all genes, except for CYP3B4 in male organs. CYP3C1, CYP3C3, CYP3B4, CYP3B5, and CYP3B6 were more highly expressed in liver and/or intestine from at least one gender, suggesting a role in xenobiotic metabolism. Expression of CYP3C1 and CYP3B5 in olfactory rosette was comparable to liver. CYP3C1, CYP3C4, CYP3B5 and CYP3B6 expression was higher in the female organs; CYP3C2 and CYP3B5 were higher in testis. Estrogen and androgen response elements were found upstream of the start site of many of these genes raising the hypothesis that they are under steroid regulation. CYP3C1\u20133 were expressed in all developmental stages examined and appear to be maternally deposited.

Among the described effects to fish, genotoxicity has been pointed out as one of the most hazardous. However, the genotoxic mechanisms of Roundup\u00ae as well as the involvement of the oxidative DNA damage repair system are not entirely understood. Hence, this work aimed to improve the knowledge on the progression of DNA damage upon short-term exposure (3\u00a0days) and post-exposure (1\u201314\u00a0days) periods in association with DNA repair processes in Anguilla anguilla exposed to Roundup\u00ae (58 and 116\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01). DNA damage in hepatic cells was evaluated by the comet assay improved with the DNA-lesion specific endonucleases FPG and EndoIII. In order to evaluate the oxidative DNA damage repair ability, an in vitro base excision repair (BER) assay was performed, testing hepatic subcellular extracts. Besides the confirmation of the genotoxic potential of this herbicide, oxidative damage was implicit as an important mechanism of genetic damage, which showed to be transient, since DNA integrity returned to the control levels on the first day after cessation of exposure. An increased capacity to repair oxidative DNA damage emerging in the post-exposure period revealed to be a crucial pathway for the A. anguilla recovery; nevertheless, DNA repair machinery showed to be susceptible to inhibitory actions during the exposure period, disclosing another facet of the risk associated with the tested agrochemical.",

Liver EROD was correlated with phenanthrene-type metabolites in liver and copper concentrations in water. Strong CYP1A occurrence was observed in acinar pancreatic cells, pancreatic duct epithelium and vascular system endothelium and negative/rare induction were observed in hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelium. In gills, EROD activity showed a significant correlation with different fractions of heavy metals in sediment but no correlation was observed between EROD activity and PAHs. Strongly positive CYP1A associated staining of the vascular system endothelia and primary filament cells and a moderate staining of pillar cells in gills were observed.

However, little is known about changes in polyamine content of metal-stressed marine organisms. In the present study, mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were experimentally exposed to 25\u00a0\u03bcg/L Cd2\u00a0+ or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L Cd2\u00a0+ for up to 15\u00a0days. Cd2\u00a0+ was progressively accumulated in mussel tissues, leading to a characteristic oxidative-stress status. Free putrescine (PUT) production was noticeably induced in response to Cd2\u00a0+ at day 5 and then declined. In contrast, free spermidine (SPD) content was gradually reduced, whereas the concentration of free spermine (SPM) increased. In combination, these changes led to a 69% or 88% reduction in the ratio of (SPD\u00a0+\u00a0SPM)/PUT at day 5, dependent on the Cd2\u00a0+ concentration used, which subsequently followed an upward trend in values, albeit not reaching those of controls. Conjugated polyamines constantly increased, in particular conjugated spermidine and spermine, tagging along with metallothionein production. Acetylated polyamines showed a diverse profile of changes, but their content was generally kept at low levels throughout the exposure period. Collectively, our results suggest that certain polyamine compounds could play a significant role in the tolerance of mussels against Cd2\u00a0+-mediated stress, and that the ratio (SPD\u00a0+\u00a0SPM)/PUT could be a good indicator of the metal-stress status.",

Estradiol has catabolic effects in salmonid white muscle, partially through increases in protein turnover. The current study determines whether phytoestrogens promote similar effects. In rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) primary myocyte cultures, the phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and R- and S-equol reduced rates of protein synthesis and genistein, the phytoestrogen of greatest abundance in soy, also increased rates of protein degradation. Increased expression of the ubiquitin ligase fbxo32 and autophagy-related genes was observed with high concentrations of genistein (100\u00a0\u03bcM), and R- and S-equol (100\u00a0\u03bcM) also up-regulated autophagy-related genes. In contrast, low genistein concentrations in vitro (0.01\u20130.10\u00a0\u03bcM) and in vivo (5\u00a0\u03bcg/g body mass) decreased fbxo32 expression, suggesting a potential metabolic benefit for low levels of genistein exposure. Phytoestrogens reduced cell proliferation, indicating that effects of phytoestrogens extend from metabolic to mitogenic processes. Co-incubation of genistein with the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI 182,780, ameliorated effects of genistein on protein degradation, but not protein synthesis or cell proliferation, indicating that effects of genistein are mediated through ER-dependent and ER-independent mechanisms. Collectively, these data warrant additional studies to determine the extent to which dietary phytoestrogens, especially genistein, affect physiological processes that impact growth and nutrient retention.",

Global DNA methylation, promoter CpG island methylation and target gene transcription in liver of adult females and in 3\u00a0days post fertilization (dpf) F1 and F2 embryos were determined with HPLC, a novel CpG island tiling array containing 54,933 different probes and RT-qPCR, respectively. The results showed that chemical treatment had no significant effect on global DNA methylation levels in F1 (MeHg and TCDD) and F2 (MeHg) embryos and only a limited number of genes were identified with altered methylation levels at their promoter regions. CYP1A1 transcription, an established marker of TCDD exposure, was elevated 27-fold in F1 embryos compared to the controls, matching the high levels of CYP1A1 expression observed in F0 TCDD-treated females. This suggests that maternal transfer of TCDD is a significant route of exposure for the F1 offspring. In conclusion, the selected doses of TCDD and MeHg, two chemicals often found in high concentrations in fish, appear to have only modest effects on DNA methylation in F1 (MeHg and TCDD) and F2 (MeHg) embryos of treated F0 females.",

     "abstract": "Most members of the large ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene family are transporters involved in substrate translocation across biological membranes. In eukaryotes, ABC proteins functioning as drug transporters are located in the plasma membrane and mediate the cellular efflux of a wide range of organic chemicals, with some transporters also transporting certain metals. As the enhanced expression of ABC drug transporters can confer multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancers and multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) to organisms from polluted habitats, these ABC family members are also referred to as MDR or MXR proteins. In mammals, ABC drug transporters show predominant expression in tissues involved in excretion or constituting internal or external body boundaries, where they facilitate the excretion of chemicals and their metabolites, and limit chemical uptake and penetration into \u201csanctuary\u201d sites of the body. Available knowledge about ABC proteins is still limited in teleost fish, a large vertebrate group of high ecological and economic importance. Using transport activity measurements and immunochemical approaches, early studies demonstrated similarities in the tissue distribution of ABC drug transporters between teleosts and mammals, suggesting conserved roles of the transporters in the biochemical defence against toxicants. Recently, the availability of teleost genome assemblies has stimulated studies of the ABC family in this taxon. This review summarises the current knowledge regarding the genetics, functional properties, physiological function, and ecotoxicological relevance of teleostean ABC transporters. The available literature is reviewed with emphasis on recent studies addressing the tissue distribution, substrate spectrum, regulation, physiological function and phylogenetic origin of teleostean ABC transporters.",

We investigated the role of 5-HT in the regulation of the cholinergic activity in the uterine parts of non-pregnant rabbits. The right vagus or pelvic nerve and the left sympathetic trunk were stimulated by an electrical field, and the uterine contractile activity was evaluated by measuring the amplitude and frequency of slow wave electromyogram (EMG), with the surface of microelectrodes applied to the uterus bottom, body, and cervix, respectively. Double stimulation of the vagus or pelvic nerve and the sympathetic trunk increased the frequency and the amplitude of the slow wave EMG in all the uterine parts. Furthermore, the administration of exogenous 5-HT increased the vagus or pelvic induced EMG activity in all parts of the uterus. Overall our results demonstrate that 5-HT enhances the vagus contractile activity with a magnitude of the effect decreasing from the bottom to the cervix, whereas 5-HT enhances the pelvic nerve contractile functions with a magnitude of the response increasing from the bottom to the cervix. The administration of droperidol, a 5-HT3 and 4 receptor inhibitor, and spiperone, a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, inhibited the effect of the serotoninergic fibers of the sympathetic trunk to increase the vagus and pelvic nerve EMG activity. These data suggest that 5-HT stimulation of the parasympathetic nerves results in the induction of uterine contraction via the activation of 5-HT2, 3, and 4 receptor subfamilies.",

After UV radiation, the survival rate of P. nana was significantly reduced. Also, egg sac damage and a reduction in the hatching rate of offspring were observed in UV-irradiated ovigerous females. According to the assessed biochemical parameters, we found dose-dependent increases in ROS levels and high levels of the lipid peroxidation decomposition product by 2\u00a0kJ\u00a0m\u2212\u00a02, implying that P. nana was under off-balanced status by oxidative stress-mediated cellular damage. Antioxidant enzyme activities of GST and SOD increased over different doses of UV radiation. To measure UV-induced lipid peroxidation, we found a slight reduction in the composition of essential fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These findings indicate that UV radiation can induce oxidative stress-triggered lipid peroxidation with modulation of antioxidant enzyme activity, leading to a significant effect on mortality and reproductive physiology (e.g. fecundity). These results demonstrate the involvement of UV radiation on essential fatty acids and its susceptibility to UV radiation in the copepod P. nana compared to other species.",

In the present study, zebrafish were chronically fed diets containing two concentrations of Ni [3.7 (control) and 116\u00a0\u03bcg Ni/g diet]. Ni-exposed males, but not females, were significantly smaller (26%) compared to controls at 80\u00a0days. In addition, total egg production was decreased by 65% in the Ni treatment at 75\u201378\u00a0days of the experiment. Ni was ubiquitously distributed in control animals (similar to previous studies), and concentrations varied between tissues by 15-fold. Ni exposure resulted in modest but significant Ni accumulation in some tissues (increases were highest in brain, vertebrae and gut; 44%, 34% and 25%, respectively), an effect observed only at 80\u00a0days. The limited Ni accumulation may be due to (1) the lack of an acidified stomach in zebrafish and/or (2) the efficient upregulation of Ni transport and excretion mechanisms, as indicated by the 4.5-fold increase in waterborne 63Ni uptake by Ni-exposed fish. Eggs from Ni-exposed adults had Ni concentrations that were 5.2-fold higher than controls. However, by 4\u00a0days post fertilization, larvae had similar Ni concentrations as controls, demonstrating a capacity for rapid Ni depuration. Larvae from Ni-exposed adults were also more resistant to waterborne Ni (35% increase in the 96-h LC50 over controls). In conclusion, elevated dietary Ni significantly affected zebrafish reproduction despite only modest tissue Ni accumulation. There were also indications of adaptation, including increased Ni uptake rates and increased Ni tolerance of offspring from Ni-exposed adults. Ni concentrations were particularly elevated in the brain with exposure; possible relations to growth and reproductive impacts require further study.",

Additionally, sodium molybdate decreased the level of hemolymph glucose in males by 30%, and increased the level of hemolymph trehalose in flies of both sexes. These changes were accompanied by an increase in whole body trehalose and glycogen of about 30\u201390%. Although total lipid levels in flies of both sexes were depleted by 25%, an increased amount of triacylglycerides among total lipids was observed.

On the other hand, fish of the group POEA 1 showed an increase in the activity of superoxide dismutase and in the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Fish exposed to POEA 3 presented increased hepatic activity of glutathione peroxidase and reduced plasma cortisol. The exposure to POEA at all concentrations tested caused an increase in plasma lactate and a decrease in the hepatic activity of catalase, in the number of red blood cells and in hemoglobin content. The comet assay used for analyzing DNA damage in blood cells indicated the genotoxicity of the surfactant at all concentrations tested. Taken together these results show that POEA can cause effects at various levels, such as hemolysis, DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, which are directly related to an imbalance in the redox state of the fish.",

     "abstract": "Municipal wastewater effluent can impact its receiving environment. In the St. Lawrence River, male fish living downstream from Montreal exhibit increased hepatic vitellogenin, intersex, delayed spermatogenesis and altered immune function. Few studies have examined genome-wide effects associated with municipal effluent exposure in fish to decipher the mechanisms of toxicity. The present objective was to identify hepatic cellular signaling pathways in fathead minnows following exposure to municipal wastewater effluent. Immature minnows were exposed for 21\u00a0days to either 0% (Control) or 20% municipal effluent, the highest concentration in the St. Lawrence River. Hepatic RNA was extracted and used to hybridize a fathead minnow oligonucleotide microarray containing approximately 15\u00a0k gene sequences. A total of 1300 genes were differentially expressed, of which 309 genes had more than 2-fold change in expression level between control and MWWE-exposed fish. Of those, 118 were up-regulated and 191 were down-regulated. Altered genes grouped according to function, indicated effects on various signaling pathways, apoptosis, immune responses, and cellular metabolism. Pathway analysis software predicted at least 5 signaling pathways that were altered by treatment: cell adhesion, inflammation, various kinases, estrogen receptor signaling and WNT signaling. Various components of the canonical Wnt pathway were dramatically down-regulated, while several other genes involved in the non-canonical Wnt pathway, such as Wnt4, LRP6, and PPP2R5E, which are known to inhibit the canonical Wnt pathway, were increased. These results indicate that municipal wastewater effluent from Montreal can target and inhibit various signaling including those implicated in hepatic Wnt signaling pathway in fathead minnows.",

     "abstract": "To investigate the effect of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the circadian rhythm pathway, we cloned clock and circadian rhythmic pathway-associated genes (e.g. Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and BMAL1) in the self-fertilizing mangrove killifish Kryptolebias marmoratus. The promoter region of Km-clock had 1 aryl hydrocarbon receptor element (AhRE, GTGCGTGACA) and 8 estrogen receptor (ER) half-sites, indicating that the AhRE and ER half sites would likely be associated with regulation of clock protein activity during EDCs-induced cellular stress. The Km-clock protein domains (bHLH, PAS1, PAS2) were highly conserved in five additional fish species (zebrafish, Japanese medaka, Southern platyfish, Nile tilapia, and spotted green pufferfish), suggesting that the fish clock protein may play an important role in controlling endogenous circadian rhythms. The promoter regions of Km-BMAL1, -Cry1, -Cry2, and -Per2 were found to contain several xenobiotic response elements (XREs), indicating that EDCs may be able to alter the expression of these genes. To analyze the endogenous circadian rhythm in K. marmoratus, we measured expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic genes (e.g. Per2, Cry1, Cry2, and BMAL1) in different tissues, and found ubiquitous expression, although there were different patterns of transcript amplification during different developmental stages. In an estrogen (E2)-exposed group, Km-clock expression was down-regulated, however, a hydroxytamoxifen (TMX, nonsteroid estrogen antagonist)-exposed group showed an upregulated pattern of Km-clock expression, suggesting that the expression of Km-clock is closely associated with exposure to EDCs. In response to the exposure of bisphenol A (BPA) and 4-tert-octyphenol (OP), Km-clock expression was down-regulated in the pituitary/brain, muscle, and skin in both gender types (hermaphrodite and secondary male). In juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue, expression of Km-clock and other circadian rhythmic pathway-associated genes showed a regular oscillation pattern over a period of approximately 24\u00a0h during a 12L:12D cycle. However, the circadian rhythm of BPA-exposed juvenile K. marmoratus liver tissue was perturbed over a 12L:12D period. This study will aid in our understanding of how EDCs perturb endogenous circadian rhythms, particularly in BPA-exposed fish liver tissue.",

An acute toxicity test was conducted in order to determine the median lethal concentration (48-h LC50) and the concentrations to be used in the subsequent subacute toxicity test in which the following biomarkers were evaluated: lipid peroxidation, oxidized protein content, activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, and level of DNA damage. Lipid peroxidation level and oxidized protein content were significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and antioxidant enzymes significantly altered with respect to controls; while the DNA damage were significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) too.

EROD induction potentials are usually expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents, a substance highly toxic to humans. In order to compensate for these shortcomings, two modifications of the EROD protocol are proposed: (1) EROD activity is normalized to the metabolic activity of the cells as determined by a modified thiazolyl blue tetrazolium (MTT) assay and expressed as metabolic cell equivalents (MCE) based on MTT data rather than to protein contents. Via MCE data, cytotoxicity information can always be reported in parallel to EROD data; with the protocol presented here, MTT and EROD data are collected simultaneously. (2) Among several reference substances tested (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), \u03b2-naphthoflavone and benzo[a]pyrene), \u03b2-naphthoflavone proved to be the most suitable reference for the routine in vitro EROD assay, although TCDD has generally been preferred for purely scientific reasons.",

Effects on the transcription of genes involved in gonad development and function that could serve as sensitive biomarkers of reproductive effects in the field is, however, not well known. We have studied mRNA expression in testes and liver of adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) males treated with 0, 5 or 25\u00a0ng/L EE2for 14\u00a0days. qPCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression of four genes linked to zebrafish male sex determination and differentiation, Anti-Mullerian Hormone, Double sex and mab-related protein, Sry-related HMG box-9a and Nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group number 1b were significantly decreased by 25\u00a0ng/L, but not 5\u00a0ng/L EE2 compared with the levels in untreated fish. The decreased transcription was correlated with a previously shown spawning failure in these males (Reyhanian et al., 2011. Aquat Toxicol 105, 41\u201348), suggesting that decreased mRNA expression of genes regulating male sexual function could be involved in the functional sterility. The mRNA level of Cytochrome P-45019a, involved in female reproductive development, was unaffected by hormone treatment. The transcription of the female-specific Vitellogenin was significantly induced in testes. While testicular Androgen Receptor and the Estrogen Receptor-alpha mRNA levels were unchanged, Estrogen receptor-beta was significantly decreased by 25\u00a0ng/L EE2. Hepatic Estrogen Receptor-alpha mRNA was significantly increased by both exposure concentrations, while Estrogen Receptor-beta transcription was unaltered. The decreased transcription of male-predominant genes supports a demasculinization of testes by EE2 and might reflect reproductive disturbances in the environment.",

In this study, these parameters were analysed and related to levels of halogenated organic contaminants (HOCs) in 40 Herring Gull (Larus argentatus) chicks. Chicks were experimentally exposed to HOCs through diet and went through a period of nutrient deprivation at the end of the experiment. HOC exposure and fasting were conducted separately and in combination. NL storages were depleted, and lysosomal membranes were destabilised after HOC exposure and nutrient deprivation. These responses were not related specifically to one type of stress or the extent of the treatment. No synergistic or additive effects from the combination of HOC exposure and fasting were observed. LF accumulated, and MDA levels increased as a result of fasting, but were unaffected by HOC exposure. LF accumulation was strongly associated with the percent weight change in the chicks. Large weight loss was associated with high LF levels, and slight weight gain was associated with low LF levels. Hence, food deprivation affected all the measured parameters, and HOC exposure decreased NL levels and lysosomal membrane stability in HG chick liver. Furthermore, autophagic lysosomal parameters have frequently been applied as biomarkers of cellular health status in previous studies of marine and terrestrial invertebrates, and this study suggests that these parameters may be good candidates for biomarkers of cellular health status in seabirds as well.",

Untreated mussels from this site (C) and mussels inhabiting a polluted area (P) were also examined after a similar time of being kept in the laboratory. The consequences of chronic exposure of the mussels in the P-group were reflected in elevated concentrations of oxyradicals (1.4 times), oxidized glutathione (4.3 times), lipofuscin (2.2 times), and DNA-strand breaks in the digestive gland (DG) in comparison to the C-group, higher levels of caspase-3 activity in the DG, and vitellogenin-like proteins in gonads among all studied groups. Exposed mussels demonstrated some common responses with mussels in the P-group: elevated levels of lactate/pyruvate ratio, lipofuscin (IBU and E1), DNA fragmentation (TCS and E1), and caspase-3 activity (TCS and E1). Exposed to PPCPs mussels also showed elevation of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase and/or glutathione-S-transferase activity in the DG and a decrease in lysosomal stability in hemocytes (TCS and E1). The TCS group was distinguished by having the highest level of DNA-fragmentation and the lowest concentrations of total glutathione, oxyradicals, lipofuscin, pyruvate, and lactate, reflecting total metabolic depression. These results show that selected PPCPs at low concentrations alter a variety of physiological processes in this animal model system.",

Historically, aquatic animal species also stand at the forefront of experimental biology, embryology and stem cell research. Over the past decade, intensive and high-powered investigations principally involving mouse and human cells have brought the generation and study of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to a level that facilitates widespread use in a spectrum of species. A review of key features of these investigations is presented here as a primer for the use of iPSC technology to enhance ongoing aquatic animal species studies. iPSC and other cutting edge technologies create the potential to study individuals from \u201cthe wild\u201d closer to the level of investigation applied to sophisticated inbred mouse models. A wide variety of surveys and hypothesis-driven investigations can be envisioned using this new capability, including comparisons of organism-specific development and exposure response and the testing of fundamental dogmas established using inbred mice. However, with these new capabilities, also come new criteria for rigorous baseline assessments and testing. Both the methods for inducing pluripotency and the source material can negatively impact iPSC quality and bourgeoning applications. Therefore, more rigorous strategies not required for inbred mouse models will have to be implemented to approach global health issues using individuals from \u201cthe wild\u201d for aquatic animal species.",

Here we use light and electron microscopy to examine the repair response in the heart of another cyprinid, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), following cautery injury to a small portion of its ventricular myocardium. We observed a robust inflammatory response in the first two weeks consisting primarily of infiltrating macrophages, heterophils, and melanomacrophages. These inflammatory cells were identified in the lumen of the spongy heart, within the site of the wound, and attached to endocardial cells adjacent to the site of injury. Marked accumulation of collagen fibers and increased connective tissue were also observed during the first and second weeks in a transition zone between healthy and injured myocardium as well as in adjacent sub-epicardial regions. The accumulation of collagen and connective tissue however did not persist. The presence of capillaries was also noted in the injured area during repair. The replacement of the cauterized region of the ventricle by myocardial tissue was achieved in 6\u00a0weeks. The presence of ethynyl deoxyuridine-positive cardiac myocytes and partially differentiated cardiac myocytes during repair suggest effective cardiac myocyte driven regeneration mechanisms also operate in the injured goldfish heart, and are similar to those observed in zebrafish and giant danio.

     "abstract": "Teleost fish are important models for human biology, health, and disease. Because genome duplication in a teleost ancestor (TGD) impacts the evolution of teleost genome structure and gene repertoires, we must discriminate gene functions that are shared and ancestral from those that are lineage-specific in teleosts or tetrapods to accurately apply inferences from teleost disease models to human health. Generalizations must account both for the TGD and for divergent evolution between teleosts and tetrapods after the likely two rounds of genome duplication shared by all vertebrates. Progress in sequencing techniques provides new opportunities to generate genomic and transcriptomic information from a broad range of phylogenetically informative taxa that facilitate detailed understanding of gene family and gene function evolution.We illustrate here the use of new sequence resources from spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), a rayfin fish that diverged from teleosts before the TGD, as well as RNA-Seq data from gar and multiple teleost lineages to reconstruct the evolution of the Paired-related homeobox (Prrx) transcription factor gene family, which is involved in the development of mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme. We show that for Prrx genes, the spotted gar genome and gene expression patterns mimic mammals better than teleosts do. Analyses force the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that regulatory mechanisms for the limb expression domains of Prrx genes existed before the evolution of paired appendages. Detailed evolutionary analyses like those reported here are required to identify fish species most similar to the human genome to optimally connect fish models to human gene functions in health and disease.",

BaP exposure significantly reduced egg production and offspring survival. Moreover, BaP decreased global methylation and altered CG, CHH, and CHG methylation both at 3.3 and 96\u00a0hpf. CG methylation changed by 10% or more due to BaP in six genes (c-fos, cdkn1a, dazl, nqo1, nrf2, and sox3) at 3.3\u00a0hpf and in ten genes (c-fos, cyp1b1, dazl, gstp1, mlh1, nqo1, pten, p53, sox2, and sox3) at 96\u00a0hpf. BaP also induced gene expression of cyp1b1 and gstp1 at 96\u00a0hpf which were found to be hypermethylated.

By using a high concentration of caffeine, we observed almost all the phenotypes that have been described in humans and/or in other animal models, including neural tube closure defect, jittery, touch insensitivity, and growth retardation as well as a drastic coiled body phenotype. Zebrafish embryos exposed to 5\u00a0mM caffeine exhibited high frequent movement, 10\u00a0moves/min comparing with around 3\u00a0moves/min in control embryos, within half an hour post exposure (HPE). They later showed twitching, uncoordinated movement, and eventually severe body curvature by 6\u00a0HPE. Exposure at later stages resulted in the same phenotypes but more posteriorly. Surprisingly, when caffeine was removed before 6\u00a0HPE, the embryos were capable of recovering but still exhibited mild curvature and shorter bodies. Longer exposure caused irreversible body curvature and lethality. These results suggest that caffeine likely targets the neuro-muscular physiology in developing embryos. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the motorneurons in treated embryos developed shorter axons, abnormal branching, and excessive synaptic vesicles. Developing skeletal muscles also appeared smaller and lacked the well-defined boundaries seen in control embryos. Finally, caffeine increases the expression of genes involved in synaptic vesicle migration.

The aim of this study was to establish global and regional baselines of total arsenic concentrations using free-ranging sperm whales. Skin biopsies (n\u00a0=\u00a0342) were collected during the voyage of the Odyssey (2000\u20132005) from 17 regions considering gender and age in males. Arsenic was detectable in 99% of samples with a global mean of 1.9\u00a0\u03bcg/g ww ranging from 0.1 to 15.6\u00a0\u03bcg/g ww. Previous work in toothed whale skin found mean concentrations 3 fold lower with 0.6\u00a0\u03bcg/g ww. A significant gender-related effect was found with males having higher mean arsenic concentrations than females. There was no significant age-related effect between adult and subadult males. Arsenic concentrations in sloughed skin samples were similar to levels in skin biopsies indicating that arsenic excretion can occur by skin sloughing. Regional mean concentrations were highest in the Maldives, Seychelles and Sri Lanka with 3.5, 2.5, and 2.4\u00a0\u03bcg/g ww, respectively, raising concern for arsenic pollution in the Indian Ocean. Literature suggests that arsenic exposure is emitted from natural sources and the heavy use of arsenic-containing pesticides and herbicides in this region. These data suggest that research is needed in determining the extent and source of arsenic pollution in the Indian Ocean.",

     "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cancer, with an almost 100% development of resistance to current therapeutic approaches at progression stages. The incidence of melanoma is steadily increasing worldwide. Although many details leading to the development of malignant melanoma are known, the complex process of melanomagenesis is poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding-RNAs of ~\u00a022nt length that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. It is now well established that deregulated miRNA expression is seen in many cancers including melanoma. To further study the miRNA functions in melanoma formation and progression we use a transgenic melanoma model in Japanese ricefish (medaka; Oryzias latipes) and the natural Xiphophorus melanoma model. In these fishes, dependent on the genetic background various histo- and patho-types of tumors appear, comparable to human melanoma types. We have studied expression profiles of ten known human melanoma-associated miRNAs and their respective target gene expression in the fish melanoma models. We show that miRNAs of the miR-17\u201392 cluster (miR-20a2, miR-92a1, miR-17 and miR-18a), miR-126, miR-182, miR-210 and miR-214 are upregulated and their respective target genes (RUNX1, HIF1A, TGFBR2, THBS1 and JAK2) are down-regulated in melanoma. MicroRNA-125b is down-regulated and the target genes (ERBB3a and ERBB3b) are upregulated in fish melanomas. Results provide clear evidence that the fish melanoma-associated miRNAs and respective target genes are deregulated generally like in human melanoma. Our results confirm the value of fish; such as medaka and Xiphophorus as good model systems to identify and decipher molecular mechanisms associated with malignant melanoma.",

Photolyases are of evolutionary interest since they are ancient and presumably function solely to ameliorate the deleterious effects of UVB exposure. Herein, we report results from detailed studies of CPD and 6-4PP photolyase gene expression within several Xiphophorus tissues. We determined photolyase gene expression patterns before and after exposure to fluorescent light in X. maculatus, X. couchianus, and for F1 interspecies hybrids produced from crossing these two parental lines (X. maculatus Jp 163 B\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0X. couchianus).

As a first step toward this goal, we report results of an RNA-Seq approach to identify genes and pathways showing modulated transcription within the skin of X. maculatus Jp 163 B upon UVB exposure. X. maculatus Jp 163 B were exposed to various doses of UVB followed by RNA-Seq analysis at each dose to investigate overall gene expression in each sample.

     "abstract": "Xiphophorus fishes are comprised of 26 known species. Interspecies hybridization between select species has been utilized to produce experimental models to study melanoma development. Xiphophorus melanoma induction protocols utilize ultraviolet light (UVB) to induce DNA damage and associated downstream tumorigenesis. However, the impact of induced stress caused by the UVB treatment of the experimental animals undergoing tumor induction protocols has not been assessed. Stress is an adaptive physiological response to excessive or unpredictable environmental stimuli. The stress response in fishes may be measured by an assay of cortisol released into the water. Here, we present results from investigations of stress response during an experimental treatment and UVB exposure in Xiphophorus maculatus Jp 163 B, Xiphophorus couchianus, and F1 interspecies hybrids produced from the mating X. maculatus Jp 163 B\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0X. couchianus. Overall, cortisol release rates for males and females after UVB exposure showed no statistical differences. At lower UVB doses (8 and 16\u00a0kJ/m2), X. couchianus exhibited 2 fold higher levels of DNA damage then either X. maculatus or the F1 hybrid. However, based on the cortisol release rates, none of the fish types tested induced a primary stress response at the UVB lower doses (8 and 16\u00a0kJ/m2). In contrast, at a very high UVB dose (32\u00a0kJ/m2) both X. maculatus and the F1 hybrid showed a 5 fold increase in the cortisol release rate. To determine the effect of pigmentation on UVB induced stress, wild type and albino Xiphophorus hellerii were exposed to UVB (32\u00a0kJ/m2). Albino X. hellerii exhibited 3.7 fold increase in the cortisol release while wild type X. hellerii did not exhibit a significant cortisol response to UVB. Overall, the data suggest the rather low UVB doses often employed in tumor induction protocols do not induce a primary stress response in Xiphophorus fishes.",

In this study the expressions of genes involved in cysteine metabolism are characterized in the midge Chironomus tepperi during exposures to sublethal concentrations of cadmium and copper. These metals altered gene expression of the cysteine metabolism differently. Both metals decreased S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase expression and did not change the expression of S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. Cadmium exposure likely increased cystathionine production by up-regulating cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (C\u03b2S) expression, while maintaining control level cysteine production via cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (C\u03b3L) expression. Conversely, copper down-regulated C\u03b2S expression and up-regulated C\u03b3L expression, which in turn could diminish cystathionine to favor cysteine production. Both metals up-regulated glutathione related expression (\u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthase and glutathione synthetase). Only cadmium up-regulated metallothionein expression and glutathione S-transferase d1 expression was up-regulated only by copper exposure. These different transcription responses of genes involved in cysteine metabolism in C. tepperi point to metal-specific detoxification pathways and suggest that the transsulfuration pathway could provide biomarkers for identifying specific metals.",

In our previous study, mRNA expression of cyp17a1 was regulated by endocrine disrupting chemicals in rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus. However, the mechanism underlying the regulation is unclear. In the present study, we aim to explore whether the differential expression of cyp17a1 in distinct tissues and the modulation of its expression upon 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and 17\u03b1-methyltestoterone (MT) are related to the DNA methylation status in G. rarus. The 732-bp fragment of 5\u2032 flanking region of cyp17a1 gene was isolated in G. rarus. The bisulfite sequencing PCR result showed that DNA methylation levels in 5\u2032 flanking of cyp17a1 in the gonads were significantly lower than those in the brains, which is negatively related to its mRNA expression in the 2 tissues in the previous study. The 7-day EE2 exposure of 25\u00a0ng/L caused a significant increase of methylation levels of cyp17a1 gene and a significant decrease of its transcript in testis. While 100\u00a0ng/L MT exposure for 7\u00a0days caused a significant decrease of methylation levels of cyp17a1 gene and a significant increase of its transcript in the ovary. The present findings indicate that the methylation status of cyp17a1 gene is negatively correlated with its mRNA expression in response to EE2 and MT in G. rarus. We hypothesize that the regulation of cyp17a1 expression by EE2 and MT might attribute to the change of its DNA methylation status in G. rarus.",

In this work we aimed to study the effects of deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, on the transcription of stress and detoxification marker genes. Atlantic salmon kept at 12\u00a0\u00b0C (one group was also kept at 4\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C) were treated with deltamethrin alone or in combination with azamethiphos for a total of 40\u00a0min, and gill and liver tissue harvested for transcriptional analysis 2 and 24\u00a0h post treatment. No lethality was observed during the experiment. The result showed that deltamethrin, alone or in combination with azamethiphos, affected the transcriptional levels of several oxidative stress markers, including MnSOD (SOD2) and HSP70 (HSPA8) in the liver, and GPX1, CAT, MnSOD, HSP70 and GSTP1 in the gills. Significant responses for CASP3B, BCLX, IGFBP1B and ATP1A1 (Na\u2013K\u2013ATPase a1b) by some of the treatments suggest that the pharmaceutical drugs may affect apoptosis, growth and ion regulation mechanisms. In fish kept at 4\u20135\u00a0\u00b0C, different effects were observed, suggesting a temperature-dependent response. In conclusion, the observed responses indicate that short-term exposure to deltamethrin has a profound effect on transcription of the evaluated markers in gills and liver of fish. Co-treatment with azamethiphos appears to have small mitigating effects on the transcriptional response caused by deltamethrin exposure alone.",

Antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration, lipid peroxidation (LPO) level, and ATP concentration were evaluated. Control sea anemones showed variations in SOD and LPO while copper pre-exposed sea anemones displayed changes in ACAP, GSH, LPO and ATP. However, no clear pattern of change over time was observed. ACAP was lower in copper pre-exposed sea anemones than in the control ones during hypoxia and recovery. SOD activity was increased during hypoxia and reduced shortly after recovery in control sea anemones. GSH concentration was higher in copper pre-exposed sea anemones than in the control ones in all experimental conditions. The LPO level increased shortly after recovery in both groups of sea anemones, being higher in control sea anemones than in copper pre-exposed ones. ATP concentration showed transient changes in copper pre-exposed sea anemones, being lower in these sea anemones than in control ones during recovery. These findings suggest that B. cangicum possess mechanisms to prevent oxidative stress generated by changes in oxygen availability associated with the tidal cycle, which can be disturbed by pre-exposure to copper.",

Exposure to nZnO caused several changes in levels of liver enzyme activity, antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation end products consistent with an oxidative stress response. Aconitase activity decreased by ~\u00a065% but tended to be restored to original levels upon supplementation with Fe2\u00a0+, indicating oxidative inactivation of the 4Fe\u20134S cluster. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity decreased by ~\u00a029%, and glutathione levels increased by ~\u00a056%. Taken together, these suggest that nZnO induces hepatic physiological stress. Each assay was then validated by using a single liver homogenate or plasma sample that was partitioned and treated with nZnO or Zn2\u00a0+, the breakdown product of nZnO. It was found that Zn2\u00a0+, but not nZnO, increased detected glutathione reductase activity by ~\u00a014% and decreased detected malondialdehyde by ~\u00a039%. This indicates that if appreciable nZnO dissolution occurs in liver samples during processing and assay, it may skew results, with implications not only for this study, but also for a wide range of nanotoxicology studies focusing on nZnO. Finally, in vitro incubations of cell-free rat blood plasma with nZnO failed to generate any significant increase in malondialdehyde or protein carbonyl levels, or any significant decrease in ferric reducing ability of plasma. This suggests that at the level tested, any oxidative stress caused by nZnO is the result of a coordinated physiological response by the liver.",

The animals exposed to 200\u00a0mg/kg and tested 24\u00a0h after administration of the nanoparticles have shown decreased AChE activity, reduction in the exploratory performance, significantly higher level of ferric iron in the brains and induction of casp8, casp 9 and jun genes. Taken together, these findings suggest acute brain toxicity by the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and induction of apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are enzymes that catalyze xenobiotic metabolism in the phase II detoxification process. GSTs have a potential for use as indicators or biomarkers to assess the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants in aquatic environments. In this study, a full-length cDNA of a mu (\u03bc) class GST (RpGST\u03bc) was identified from Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and biochemically characterized. The 1356 bp of the cDNA included an open reading frame of 651 bp encoding a polypeptide of 217 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 25.04\u00a0kDa and an estimated pI of 6.34. Sequence analysis revealed that the RpGST\u03bc possessed several characteristic features of \u03bc class GSTs, such as a thioredoxin-like N-terminal domain containing binding sites for glutathione (GSH), a C-terminal domain containing substrate binding sites, and a \u03bc loop. The recombinant RpGST\u03bc (rRpGST\u03bc) protein exhibited GSH-conjugating catalytic activity towards several substrates, and significantly strong activity was detected against 4-nitrophenethyl bromide (5.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB, 3.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05). Kinetic analysis as a function of GSH and CDNB concentrations revealed relatively low Km values of 1.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0mM and 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\u00a0mM, respectively, thereby indicating a GSH-conjugation attributed with high rates. The optimum pH and temperature for the catalytic activity of the rRpGST\u03bc protein were 7.7 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The effect of two inhibitors, Cibacron blue and hematin, on the activity of rRpGST\u03bc was evaluated and the IC50 values of 0.65\u00a0\u03bcM and 9\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, were obtained. While RpGST\u03bc transcripts were highly expressed in gills and hemocytes, a significant elevation in mRNA levels was detected in these tissues after lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) and live bacterial (Vibrio tapetis) challenges. These findings collectively suggest that RpGST\u03bc functions as a potent detoxifier of xenobiotic toxicants present in the aquatic environment, and that its mRNA expression could be modulated by pathogenic stress signal(s).",

However, nothing is known about the 5-HT receptors involved in this inhibitory effect. In this study, we investigated the effects of several 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor agonists on food intake in rainbow trout. In the first experiment, fish were injected i.p. or i.c.v. with two 5-HT1B receptor agonists, anpirtoline (2\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) and CP93129 (100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.c.v.). Neither of these treatments significantly altered food intake. In a second set of experiments, different groups of fish were injected i.p. (1\u00a0mg/kg) or i.c.v. (30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. In both cases, administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist inhibited food intake. In a third set of experiments, we explored the effects of different 5-HT2 receptor agonists. Different groups of fish were injected i.p. or i.c.v. with the mixed 5-HT2B/2C agonist m-CPP (5\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.), 5-HT2C agonist MK212 (60\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.c.v.) and 5-HT2B agonist BW723C86 (50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, i.c.v.). Administration of the 5-HT2B/2C and 5HT2C receptor agonists significantly inhibited food intake. Administration of the lowest dose of the 5-HT2B receptor agonist did not have any significant effect, while administration of the highest dose induced a significant increase in food intake. Activation of the 5-HT1A-like (food intake inhibition) and 5-HT1B-like (no effect on food intake) receptors in the rainbow trout induced different effects on food intake from those observed in mammals. We conclude that in rainbow trout the anorexigenic actions of 5-HT are probably mediated by activation of 5-HT1A and 5-H2C-like receptors.",

Using a substrate depletion method, intrinsic hepatic clearance (in vitro Clint) was determined. Significantly, rates of oxidative transformation of meloxicam, likely mediated via cytochromes P450 (CYP), were higher in marsupials compared to rats or dogs. The rank order of apparent in vitro Clint was brushtail possums (n\u00a0=\u00a03) (mean: 394\u00a0\u03bcL/min/mg protein), >\u00a0koalas (n\u00a0=\u00a06) (50), >\u00a0ringtail possums (n\u00a0=\u00a02) (36) (with no significant difference between koalas and ringtail possums), >\u00a0pooled rats (3.2)\u00a0>\u00a0pooled dogs (in which the rate of depletion, as calculated by the ratio of the substrate remaining was <\u00a020% and too slow to determine). During the depletion of meloxicam, at a first-order rate constant, 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (M1) was identified in the brushtail possums and the rat as the major metabolite. However, multiple hydroxyl metabolites were observed in the koala (M1, M2, and M3) and the ringtail possum (M1 and M3) indicating that these specialized foliage-eating marsupials have diverse oxidation capacity to metabolize meloxicam. Using a well-stirred model, the apparent in vitro Clint of meloxicam for koalas and the rat was further scaled to compare with published in vivo Cl. The closest in vivo Cl prediction from in vitro data of koalas was demonstrated with scaled hepatic Cl(total) (average fold error\u00a0=\u00a01.9) excluding unbound fractions in the blood and microsome values; whereas for rats, the in-vitro scaled hepatic Cl fu(blood, mic), corrected with unbound fractions in the blood and microsome values, provided the best prediction (fold error\u00a0=\u00a01.86). This study indicates that eutherians such as rats or dogs serve as inadequate models for dosage extrapolation of this drug to marsupials due to differences in hepatic turnover rate. Furthermore, as in vivo Cl is one of the pharmacokinetic indexes for determining therapeutic drug dosages, this study demonstrates the utility of in vitro to in vivo scaling as an alternative prediction method of drug Cl in koalas.",

To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying these differences in relative potency of PeCDF among avian species, we tested the hypothesis that this is due to species-specific differential binding affinity of PeCDF to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 (AHR1). Here, we modified a cell-based binding assay that allowed us to measure the binding affinity of dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) to avian AHR1 expressed in COS-7 (fibroblast-like cells). The results of the binding assay show that PeCDF and TCDD bind with equal affinity to chicken AHR1, but PeCDF binds with greater affinity than TCDD to pheasant (3-fold) and Japanese quail (5-fold) AHR1. The current report introduces a COS-7 whole-cell binding assay and provides a mechanistic explanation for differential relative potencies of PeCDF among species of birds.",

EE2 uptake rate and MO2 were relatively consistent among species (2.5\u20133.0 fold variation), with the only significant differences being a lower EE2 uptake rate in medaka, and lower MO2 in medaka, goldfish, and zebrafish relative to the other species. EE2 accumulation, however, exhibited two distinct patterns, suggesting differences in metabolic processing. In killifish and medaka, the highest accumulation (~\u00a050%) occurred in the liver and gallbladder, whereas in minnow, goldfish, zebrafish and trout, >\u00a050% accumulated in the carcass. No significant sex differences were found in killifish or minnow, apart from lower gill tissue EE2 accumulation in minnow females. This study demonstrated that metabolic processing of EE2 may be species-specific and tissue specific EE2 distribution profiles vary.

The statistically significant higher index of phenotypic plasticity for protease correlated with lower variability. Protease isoforms at the same cadmium treatments differed between genotypes, while some protease isoforms from one egg-mass differed between cadmium treatments. Owing to the low sensitivity and plasticity of mass change during exposure to cadmium, as well as its small influence, we concluded that larval mass is not a good indicator of cadmium presence in food.

Exposure of trout to 11.0\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u2212\u00a01 TFM (12-h LC50) led to increases in muscle TFM and TFM-glucuronide concentrations, peaking at 9\u00a0h and 12\u00a0h, respectively. Muscle and brain glycogen was reduced by 50%, while kidney and muscle lactate increased with TFM exposure. Kidney ATP and phosphocreatine decreased by 50% and 70%, respectively. TFM exposure caused no changes in whole body ion (Na+, Cl\u2212, Ca2\u00a0+, K+) concentrations, gill Na+/K+ ATPase activity, or unidirectional Na+ movements across the gills. We conclude that TFM causes a mismatch between ATP supply and demand in trout, leading to increased reliance on glycolysis, but it does not have physiologically relevant effects on ion balance in hard water.",

These parameters are performed in a target tissue or whole earthworm, without considering the marked zonation in histological organisation, enzyme activities and gene expression pattern existing along the body. Thus, the present work was aimed at (a) characterising the morphofunctional heterogeneity along the digestive tract of E. fetida in tissue morphology and turnover, lysosomal enzyme markers (\u03b2-glucuronidase, \u03b2-GUS; hexosaminidase, HEX), lipofuscin contents (LPF) and metallothionein (MT) and catalase (CAT) gene expression; and (b) determining whether the responsiveness to Cd exposure varies among tissues and along the digestive tract. HEX and \u03b2-GUS exhibited a heterogeneous distribution pattern along and across the digestive tract and Cd exposure caused a marked decrease of HEX and an increase of \u03b2-GUS activity. Likewise, the significant decrease of cell turnover and the induction of MT transcription were was zone-dependent. Therefore, in was concluded that the consideration of the zonation when applying biomarker for toxicity assessment would reduce the intrinsic variability that results from overlooking the marked morphofunctional heterogeneity that exists in annelids along their body axis.",

     "abstract": "Altered DNA methylation is associated with changes in gene expression, signal transduction and stress response after exposure to a wide range of exogenous compounds, and abnormal methylation is a major toxic effect induced by chemicals such as benzene and phenols. 2,4-Dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), a derivative of phenol, has been classified as a priority pollutant by the US EPA due to its toxic effects on aquatic organisms. However, the effect of 2,4-DCP on DNA methylation and its potential mechanism in fish are rarely understood. The present study aims to figure out whether 2,4-DCP could impact DNA methylation and explore its potential mechanisms by measuring the global DNA methylation levels, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) contents, the mRNA expression of DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) and DNA methyltransferase3 (DNMT3) in the liver of goldfish Carassius auratus. DNA methylation levels were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and MspI/HpaII ethidium bromide assay, SAM and SAH contents were determined by HPLC, the mRNA expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3 was measured by quantitative-PCR (qPCR). The results showed that 2,4-DCP caused global DNA hypermethylation, elevated the methylation levels of CpG islands, increased the SAM and SAH contents, decreased the SAM/SAH ratio, and upregulated the mRNA expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3, while depletion of SAM with Na2SeO3 and inhibition of DNMTs activity with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5AdC) impaired 2,4-DCP-induced global DNA hypermethylation, suggesting that the increase of SAM contents and upregulation of the mRNA expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3 may play important roles in 2,4-DCP-induced global DNA hypermethylation process. Our report is the first one to show that short-term 2,4-DCP exposure caused the global DNA hypermethylation via altered SAM level and DNMTs expression in fish.",

This study defined the oxidative stress and related transcriptional effects of PFNA at various concentrations on zebrafish larvae. Activities of superoxide dismutase were induced in PFNA-treated groups but attenuated with exposure to higher concentration. Catalase activity and lipid peroxidation were significantly inhibited or increased at the highest concentration, respectively. To test the apoptotic pathway, several genes related to cell apoptosis were examined using real-time PCR. The expression of p53, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNK) was partially increased, while Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene, was reduced, with no significant effects on Bax and caspase-3 during the exposure period. The effect of PFNA on lipid \u03b2-oxidation system was investigated by examining the activity of peroxisome fatty acyl-COA oxidase (ACOX) and the expression of peroxisome proliferating activating receptors (PPARs). ACOX activity was moderately elevated with marginal significance and was not a significant consequence of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 expression. The overall results suggest that turbulence of oxidative stress and apoptotic pathway is involved in PFNA-induced toxicity in zebrafish larvae, and the gene expression patterns are able to reveal some potential mechanisms of developmental toxicity.",

A significant dissolution effect was observed, where dissolved ZnO constituted over 50% of total Zn within a two day exposure to the test medium, suggesting that the nominal exposure to pure ZnONPs represents in vivo, at best, a mixture exposure of ionic zinc and nanoparticles. Nevertheless, the analyses provided evidence that the metallothioneins (mtl-1 and mtl-2), the phytochelatin synthase (pcs-1) and an apoptotic marker (cep-1) were transcriptionally activated. In addition, the DCFH-DA assay provided in vitro evidence of the oxidative potential of ZnONPs in the metal exposure sensitive triple mutant. Raman spectroscopy highlighted that the biomolecular phenotype changes significantly in the mtl-1;mtl-2;pcs-1 triple knockout worm upon ZnONP exposure, suggesting that these metalloproteins are instrumental in the protection against cytotoxic damage. Finally, ZnONP exposure was shown to decrease growth and development, reproductive capacity and lifespan, effects which were amplified in the triple knockout.

At the early life stage, fertilized eggs were exposed to 5, 50, 500, 5000\u00a0ng/L E3 for 15\u00a0days, and the hatched fry were exposed continuously to the same concentrations for an additional 15\u00a0days. Exposure to 500 and 5000\u00a0ng/L E3 resulted in adverse effects on hatchability and time to hatching. At 5000\u00a0ng/L, the gross abnormality rate was increased and the number of females that hatched was twice that of males. When the fish were exposed to 5\u20135000\u00a0ng/L E3 for further 60\u00a0days, the male hepatosomatic index (HSI) was increased at 5000\u00a0ng/L.

Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the hepatic vitellogenin-I (Vtg-I) genes were up-regulated in females at 500 and 5000\u00a0ng/L E3 and in males at all E3 concentrations, whereas E3 did not affect estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) mRNA transcription. These results showed that E3 at environmental concentration of 5\u00a0ng/L has no adverse effects on growth and development of the Japanese medaka.

     "abstract": "Pyrethroids are extensively used for the control of pest insects and disease vectors. Pyrethroid use is regarded safe due to their selective toxicity: they are effective against insects but relatively harmless to mammals and birds. Unfortunately, pyrethroids are very toxic to fishes. The high toxicity of pyrethroids to fishes is only partly explained by slow elimination rate of toxins, suggesting that high affinity binding to their molecular targets, the Na+ channels, is involved. This study tests the hypothesis that Na+ channels of the fish heart are targets to a type II pyrethroid, deltamethrin (DM), and therefore pyrethroids are cardiotoxic to fishes. In ventricular myocytes of the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) heart DM (10\u2212\u00a07\u20133\u00a0\u00b7\u00a010\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M) modified Na+ current by slowing inactivation and shifting the reversal potential of the current to the left. Maximally 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% of the cardiac Na+ channels were modified by DM and the half-maximal effect occurred at the concentration of 2.1\u00a0\u03bcM. The effect of DM on trout cardiac Na+ channels is stronger and occurs about an order of magnitude lower in concentration in comparison to the orthologous mammalian Na+ channels. In sinoatrial preparations of the trout heart DM (10\u00a0\u03bcM) caused irregularities in rate, rhythm and force of the heartbeat indicating that DM can be arrhythmogenic for the trout heart. Consistent with this, DM (>\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcM) induced spontaneous action potentials in otherwise quiescent ventricular myocytes. DM (10\u00a0\u03bcM) did not affect calcium current or inward rectifier and delayed rectifier potassium currents. Collectively, these findings indicate that DM exerts cardiotoxic effects in trout, and suggest that the high sensitivity of fishes to pyrethroid toxicity might be partially due to the high affinity of fish Na+ channels to pyrethroids.",

     "abstract": "Zinc demonstrates protective and antioxidant properties at physiological levels, although these characteristics are not attributed at moderate or high concentrations. Zinc toxicity has been related to a number of factors, including interference with antioxidant defenses. In particular, the inhibition of glutathione reductase (GR) has been suggested as a possible mechanism for acute zinc toxicity in bivalves. The present work investigates the biochemical effects of a non-lethal zinc concentration on antioxidant-related parameters in gills of brown mussels Perna perna exposed for 21\u00a0days to 2.6\u00a0\u03bcM zinc chloride. After 2\u00a0days of exposure, zinc caused impairment of the antioxidant system, decreasing GR activity and glutathione levels. An increase in antioxidant defenses became evident at 7 and 21\u00a0days of exposure, as an increase in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity along with restoration of glutathione levels and GR activity. After 7 and 21\u00a0days, an increase in cellular peroxides and lipid peroxidation end products were also detected, which are indicative of oxidative damage. Changes in GR activity contrasts with protein immunoblotting data, suggesting that zinc produces a long lasting inhibition of GR. Contrary to the general trend in antioxidants, levels of peroxiredoxin 6 decreased after 21\u00a0days of exposure. The data presented here support the hypothesis that zinc can impair thiol homeostasis, causes an increase in lipid peroxidation and inhibits GR, imposing a pro-oxidant status, which seems to trigger homeostatic mechanisms leading to a subsequent increase on antioxidant-related defenses.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene p53 plays a critical role in safeguarding the integrity of genome in mammalian cells. It acts as a sequence-specific transcription factor. Once activated by a variety of cellular stresses, p53 transactivates downstream target genes, through which it regulates cell cycle and apoptosis. However, little is known about p53 as well as its downstream target genes in invertebrates. A full length cDNA that encodes a 453-amino-acid p53 protein (Lvp53) was characterized in the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to explore the potential relationships between p53 and two antioxidant enzyme genes: Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in eliminating cell stresses in L. vannamei. Sequence analysis revealed a close phylogenetic relationship between Lvp53 and that of Marsupenaeus japonicus, and a high degree of conservation in critical amino acids residues is involved in DNA and zinc binding among species. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that Lvp53 was expressed with varied levels in all the 11 tissues under investigation. In response to acute pH challenge, the relative expression of Lvp53 was induced in a pH- and time-dependent manner, with the peak observed at pH\u00a06.1 and after 24\u00a0h of treatment, in which condition, both the relative mRNA expressions and the enzymatic activities of LvMnSOD and LvGPx were increased correspondingly. In response to acute cadmium (Cd) exposure, the relative expression of Lvp53 was upregulated in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with the maximum detected at Cd 6.6\u00a0\u03bcM and after 48\u00a0h of exposure, in which case, both the transcripts and the enzymatic activities of LvMnSOD and LvGPx were also induced. After Lvp53 transcripts were declined by double-strand RNA injection, the relative mRNA expressions of LvMnSOD and LvGPx were decreased correspondingly. Meanwhile, pH\u00a06.1 or 6.6\u00a0\u03bcM Cd could not induce the transcripts or the enzymatic activities of LvMnSOD or LvGPx any more in Lvp53-silenced shrimp, but increased shrimp mortalities. These results indicated the involvement of Lvp53, LvMnSOD and LvGPx in mediating cell stress caused by suboptimal pH and elevated levels of Cd in L. vannamei, and that the expressions of LvMnSOD and LvGPx were positively regulated by Lvp53, which is a potential mechanism for shrimp to survive the oxidative stress that occurs during short-term exposure to Cd or challenge with acidic pH. This finding will contribute to better understanding of p53 signaling pathways and redox regulation in invertebrate organisms.",

Bivalves were exposed in the laboratory to individual lead spiked sediments at < 0.01, 100 and 300\u00a0\u03bcg/g dry mass, for 28\u00a0days and accumulated total tissue lead concentrations of 4, 96 and 430\u00a0\u03bcg/g, respectively. Subcellular fractionation indicated that around 70% of the total accumulated tissue lead was detoxified, three quarters of the detoxified lead fraction was converted into metal rich granules, with the remainder in the metallothionein like protein fraction. The majority of biologically active lead was associated with the mitochondrial fraction with up to a 128 fold increase in lead burden in exposed organisms compared to controls. This indicates lead detoxification was occurring but the organism was unable to prevent lead interacting with sensitive organelles. With increased lead exposure T. deltoidalis showed a suppression in glutathione peroxidase activity, total glutathione concentration and reduced GSH:GSSG ratios, however, these differences were not significant. Lead exposed T. deltoidalis had a significantly reduced total antioxidant capacity which corresponded with increased lipid peroxidation, lysosomal destabilisation and micronuclei frequency.

As FASD is a neurobehavioral disorder, we are searching for a molecular target of ethanol that alters neurological functions. In this communication, we have focused on neuroligin genes (nlgn) which are known to be active at the postsynaptic side of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses of the central nervous system. There are six human NLGN homologs of Japanese ricefish reported in public data bases. We have partially cloned these genes and analyzed their expression pattern during normal development and also after exposing the embryos to ethanol. Our data indicate that the expression of all six nlgn genes in Japanese ricefish embryos is developmentally regulated. Although ethanol is able to induce developmental abnormalities in Japanese ricefish embryogenesis comparable to the FASD phenotypes, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of nlgn mRNAs indicate unresponsiveness of these genes to ethanol. We conclude that the disruption of the developmental rhythm of Japanese ricefish embryogenesis by ethanol that leads to FASD may not affect the nlgn gene expression at the message level.",

Expression levels of these antioxidant genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technique. MaCAT, MaGPx1 and MaCu/Zn-SOD expression was greatest in the liver and qRT-PCR was used to assess expression of these genes in juvenile fish during 72\u00a0h of exposure to 15\u00a0mg/L nitrite. Prolonged nitrite exposure resulted in the formation of excess ROS that caused oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and reduced the activities of antioxidant enzymes. Fish exposed to nitrite also showed liver damage. This study provides transcriptional data for MaCAT, MaGPx1 and MaCu/Zn-SOD that suggest expression is related positively with oxidative stress induced by nitrite exposure, indicating that imbalance between ROS and antioxidant defenses is one mechanism underlying nitrite toxicity in M. amblycephala.",

     "abstract": "Alterations of the reproductive organs of gastropod molluscs exposed to pollutants have been reported in natural populations for more than 40\u00a0years. In some cases, these impacts have been linked to exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which are known to induce adverse impacts on vertebrates, mainly by direct binding to steroid receptors or by altering hormone synthesis. Investigations on the mechanisms of action of endocrine disruptors in molluscs show that EDCs induce modifications of endogenous titres of androgens (e.g., testosterone, androstenedione) and oestrogens (e.g., 17\u00df-oestradiol). Alterations of the activity of enzymes related to steroid metabolism (i.e., cytochrome P-450 aromatase, acyltransferases) are also often observed. In bivalves and gastropods, fatty acid esterification of steroids might constitute the major regulation of androgen and oestrogen homeostasis. The present review indicates that metabolism of steroid hormones to fatty acid esters might be a target of synthetic EDCs. Alterations of this process would impact the concentrations of free, potentially bioactive, form of steroids.",

Disruption of normal thyroid status by environmental contaminants can cause severe impairment in reproductive functions. In our previous study, we reported down-regulation of a protein in seminal vesicular fluid of air-breathing catfish, Clarias gariepinus during experimentally induced hyperthyroidism. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis followed by search in sequence database denoted it to be lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (ptgds-b). In the present study, we cloned full-length cDNA of ptgds-b based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Surprisingly, Northern blot as well as RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of ptgds-b transcript predominantly in seminal vesicles and developing testis. Further, ptgds-b mRNA significantly decreased in seminal vesicles following L-thyroxine overdose while there was an increased expression of ptgds-b after depletion of thyroid hormone by thiourea and withdrawal of the treatments reverted this effect. Treatment of catfish with human chorionic gonadotropin and estradiol significantly reduced ptgds-b expression. Taken together, we report ptgds-b as a thyroid hormone regulated protein in the seminal vesicles in addition to gonadotropin and estradiol. Further studies might explain the exclusive presence of ptgds-b in seminal vesicles and developing testis yet present data evaluated it as a putative biomarker for thyroid hormone disruption.",

However, most studies have been carried out with a limited number of natural DOM isolates or were restricted to the use of commercial or artificial humic substances. We therefore employed three previously characterized, chemically-distinct natural DOMs, as well as a commercially available humic acid (Aldrich, AHA), at circumneutral (7\u20138) and acidic pH (~\u00a05), to examine DOM effects on whole-body Na+ concentration, unidirectional influx and efflux rates of Na+, and ammonia and urea excretion rates in Daphnia magna. Whole-body Na+ concentration, Na+ influx, and Na+ efflux rates were all unaffected regardless of pH, suggesting no influence of the various natural DOMs on active uptake and passive diffusion of Na+ in this organism. Ammonia and urea excretion rates were both increased by low pH. Ammonia excretion rates were reduced at circumneutral pH by the most highly colored, allochthonous DOM, and at low pH by all three natural DOMs, as well as by the commercial AHA. Urea excretion rates were not influenced by the presence of the various DOMs in circumneutral solutions, but were attenuated by the presence of two allochthonous DOM sources (isolated from Bannister Lake and Luther Marsh) at acidic pH. The observed reductions may be attributed partially to the higher buffering capacities of natural DOM sources, as well as their ability to interact with biological membranes as estimated by a new measure calculated from their acid\u2013base titration characteristics, the Proton Binding Index (PBI).",

     "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals are widely used in human and veterinary medicine. However, they are emerging as a significant contaminant in aquatic environments through wastewater. Due to the persistent and accumulated properties of pharmaceuticals via the food web, their potential harmful effects on aquatic animals are a great concern. In this study, we investigated the effects of six pharmaceuticals: acetaminophen, ATP; atenolol, ATN; carbamazepine, CBZ; oxytetracycline, OTC; sulfamethoxazole, SMX; and trimethoprim, TMP on acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3.1.1.7) activity and its transcript expression with chlorpyrifos (as a positive control) in the monogonont rotifer, Brachionus koreanus. ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure also remarkably inhibited Bk-AChE activity at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L (24\u00a0h) and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L (12\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h). ATP, CBZ, and TMP exposure showed a significant decrease in the Bk-AChE mRNA level in a concentration-dependent manner. However, in the case of OTC and SMX, a slight decrease in Bk-AChE mRNA expression was found but only at the highest concentration. The time-course experiments showed that ATP positively induced Bk-AChE mRNA 12\u00a0h after exposure at both 100 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L, while the Bk-AChE mRNA expression was significantly downregulated over 6 to 24\u00a0h after exposure to 1000\u00a0\u03bcg/L of CBZ, OTC, SMX, and TMP. Our findings suggest that Bk-AChE would be a useful biomarker for risk assessment of pharmaceutical compounds as an early signal of their toxicity in aquatic environments. Particularly, ATP, CBZ, and TMP may have a toxic cholinergic effect on rotifer B. koreanus by inhibiting AChE activity.",

     "abstract": "This study is related to the accumulation of Cd2\u00a0+, its effects on oxidative stress biomarkers and its role in macromolecule damage in liver and kidney of common carp. We present evidence of an increased ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) in both organs after 10\u00a0mg/L Cd2\u00a0+ exposure, with different underlying biological mechanisms and consequences. In the liver, the expressions and/or activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase increased to cope with the Cd2\u00a0+-generated toxic effects during the first 48\u00a0h of treatment. In contrast, none of these selected antioxidant markers was significantly altered in the kidney, whereas the expression of glutathione synthetase was upregulated. These results suggest that the major defense mechanism provoked by Cd2\u00a0+ exposure involves the regeneration of GSH in the liver, while its de novo synthesis predominates in the kidney. High levels of accumulation of Cd2\u00a0+ and peroxynitrite anion (ONOO\u2212) were detected in the kidney; the major consequences of ONOO\u2212 toxicity were enhanced lipid peroxidation and GSH depletion. The accumulation of ONOO\u2212 in the kidney suggests intensive production of NO and the development of nitrosative stress. In the liver the level of hydrogen peroxide was elevated.",

Daphnids were exposed to concentrations ranging from 2 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u00a0\u22121 over two successive generations. Genotoxic effects were assessed using random amplified polymorphic DNA and real time PCR (RAPD-PCR). Effects on life history (survival, fecundity and somatic growth) were monitored from hatching to release of brood 5. Different exposure regimes were tested to investigate the specific sensitivity of various life stages to DU. When daphnids were exposed continuously or from hatching to deposition of brood 5, results demonstrated that DNA damage accumulated in females and were transmitted to offspring in parallel with an increase in severity of effects on life history across generations. When daphnids were exposed during the embryo stage only, DU exposure induced transient DNA damage which was repaired after neonates were returned to a clean medium. Effects on life history remained visible after hatching and did not significantly increase in severity across generations. The present results suggest that DNA damage might be an early indicator of future effects on life history.",

Fly larvae were raised on food supplemented with 1.0\u00a0mM SNP, 0.5 or 1.25\u00a0mM DNP, or with mixtures 1.0\u00a0mM SNP plus 0.5 or 1.25\u00a0mM DNP.

Biochemical analyses of oxidative stress markers and activities of antioxidant and associated enzymes were carried out on 2-day-old flies emerged from control larvae and larvae fed on food supplemented with SNP, DNP, or SNP/DNP mixtures. Larval exposure to SNP lowered activities of aconitase, while the presence of DNP reduced the negative impact of SNP by raising aconitase activity back to near control levels. Larval treatment with SNP also elevated the contents of carbonyl protein, uric acid and low molecular mass thiols and produced higher activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase in adult flies. However, the presence of DNP in the food mixtures prevented SNP-induced changes in thioredoxin reductase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities, as well as uric acid and low-molecular-mass thiol content. The potential mechanisms by which DNP exerts protective effects against SNP toxicity are discussed.",

     "abstract": "To identify and characterize CHH (TJ-CHH) gene in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, we analyzed the full-length cDNA sequence, genomic structure, and promoter region. The full-length TJ-CHH cDNA was 716\u00a0bp in length, encoding 136 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of TJ-CHH showed a high similarity of the CHH mature domain to other crustaceans. Six conserved cysteine residues and five conserved structural motifs in the CHH mature peptide domain were also observed. The genomic structure of the TJ-CHH gene contained three exons and two introns in its open reading frame (ORF), and several transcriptional elements were detected in the promoter region of the TJ-CHH gene. To investigate transcriptional change of TJ-CHH under environmental stress, T. japonicus were exposed to heat treatment, UV-B radiation, heavy metals, and water-accommodated fractions (WAFs) of Iranian crude oil. Upon heat stress, TJ-CHH transcripts were elevated at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 35\u00a0\u00b0C for 96\u00a0h in a time-course experiment. UV-B radiation led to a decreased pattern of the TJ-CHH transcript 48\u00a0h and more after radiation (12\u00a0kJ/m2). After exposure of a fixed dose (12\u00a0kJ/m2) in a time-course experiment, TJ-CHH transcript was down-regulated in time-dependent manner with a lowest value at 12\u00a0h. However, the TJ-CHH transcript level was increased in response to five heavy metal exposures for 96\u00a0h. Also, the level of the TJ-CHH transcript was significantly up-regulated at 20% of WAFs after exposure to WAFs for 48\u00a0h and then remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the enhanced TJ-CHH transcript level is associated with a cellular stress response of the TJ-CHH gene as shown in decapod crustaceans. This study is also helpful for a better understanding of the detrimental effects of environmental changes on the CHH-triggered copepod metabolism.",

However, despite these neuropeptides being the best studied family of insect hormones, their precise signaling pathways in their OS responsive role remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have used an in vitro assay to determine the importance of extra and intra-cellular Ca2\u00a0+ stores as well as the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) and cyclic adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate (cAMP) pathways by which AKH exerts its anti-oxidative effects.

The effects of mitigation of OS in isolated CNS by AKH were negated when these treatments were conducted in the presence of Ca2\u00a0+ channel inhibitors (CdCl2 and thapsigargin). Presence of either bisindolylmaliemide or chelyrythrine chloride (inhibitors of PKC) in the incubating medium also compromised the anti-oxidative function of AKH. However, supplementing the medium with either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, an activator of PKC) or forskolin (an activator of cAMP) restored the protective effects of exogenous AKH treatment by reducing 4-HNE levels and increasing membrane fluidity to control levels. Taken together, our results strongly implicate the importance of both PKC and cAMP pathways in AKHs' anti-oxidative action by mobilizing both extra and intra-cellular stores of Ca2\u00a0+.",

In this study, we exposed three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus to produced water (PW), i.e. wastewater from offshore petroleum production. PW contains substances such as alkylphenols (APs) and aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) known to induce toxicant stress and endocrine disruption in a variety of organisms. Following exposure to PW, a standardized confinement treatment was applied as a second stressor (PW-stress), testing how fish already under stress from the pollutant would respond to an additional stressor. The endpoint for analysis was a combination of blood levels of cortisol and glucose, in addition to transcribed levels of a set of genes related to toxicant stress, endocrine disruption and general stress. The findings of this study indicate that low doses of PW do not induce vitellogenin in immature female stickleback, but do cause an upregulation of cytochrome (CYP1A) and UDP-glucuronsyltransferase (UDP-GT), two biomarkers related to toxicant stress. However, when the second stressor was applied, both genes were downregulated, indicating that the confinement exposure had a suppressive effect on the expression of toxicant biomarkers (CYP1A and UDP-GT). Further, two of the stress related genes, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and stress-induced phosphoprotein (STIP), were upregulated in both PW- and PW-stress-treatment, but not in the water control confinement treatment, indicating that PW posed as a larger stress-factor than confinement for these genes.

     "abstract": "Tributyltin (TBT) is a widespread environmental contaminant in aquatic systems whose adverse effects in development and reproduction are related to its well-known endocrine-disrupting activity. In this work, the early molecular effects of TBT in Chironomus riparius (Diptera) were evaluated by analyzing its DNA damaging potential and the transcriptional response of different endocrine-related genes. Twenty-four-hour in vivo exposures of the aquatic larvae, at environmentally relevant doses of TBT, revealed genotoxic activity as shown by significant increases in DNA strand breaks quantified with the comet assay. TBT was also able to induce significant increases in transcripts from the ecdysone receptor gene (EcR), the ultraspiracle gene (usp) (insect ortholog of the retinoid X receptor), the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) gene and the E74 early ecdysone-inducible gene, as measured by real-time RT-PCR. In contrast, the expression of the vitellogenin (vg) gene remained unaltered, while the hsp70 gene appeared to be down-regulated. The ability of TBT to up-regulate hormonal target genes provides the first evidence, at genomic level, of its endocrine disruptive effects and also suggests a mechanism of action that mimics ecdysteroid hormones in insects. These data reveal for the first time the early genomic effects of TBT on an insect genome.",

Besides hormonal effects, BPA has been suspected to be responsible for adverse effect on reproductive ability of various species. In the present study the effect of BPA on the quality parameters, oxidative stress, the DNA integrity and intracellular ATP content of sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus) spermatozoa were investigated in vitro. Fish spermatozoa were exposed to concentrations of BPA possibly occurring in nature (0.5, 1.75, 2.5, 5 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) for 2\u00a0h. Results revealed that BPA significantly decreased spermatozoa motility and velocity of spermatozoa at concentration of BPA 2.5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Significant positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.713, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was found between percent motile spermatozoa and ATP content. Oxidative stress was observed at concentrations 1.75\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg/L, as reflected by significantly higher levels of protein and lipid oxidation and superoxide dismutase activity. Intracellular ATP content of spermatozoa decreased with increasing concentrations of BPA. A dramatic increase in DNA fragmentation expressed as percent tail DNA (2.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46) and Olive tail moment (0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 arbitrary units) was recorded at concentrations of 1.75\u00a0\u03bcg/L and above.

Addition of two spectroscopically distinct dissolved organic matters (DOM) from fresh water (Nordic Reservoir) and sea water (Inshore) moderately decreased the toxicity of Pb to both mussels, but not in a concentration-dependent fashion, with only an approximate doubling of EC50 over the range of 1.4\u201311.2\u00a0mg\u00a0C\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. Independent Pb binding capacity determinations for DOC explained the lack of a relationship between DOM concentration and toxicity. Salinity had no effect on Pb toxicity down to 21\u00a0ppt in M. trossolus, and low salinity (21\u00a0ppt) did not enhance the protective effect of DOC. Both DOMs increased the toxicity of Pb in developing sea urchin embryos, in contrast to mussels. Relative to Pb, the organisms were 6\u20139 fold less sensitive to Zn on a molar basis in 100% seawater with the following Zn EC50s: M. trossolus \u2014 135 (103\u2013170) \u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01; M. galloprovincialis \u2014 172 (126\u2013227) \u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, S. purpuratus \u2014 151 (129\u2013177) \u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. Nordic Reservoir and Inshore DOM (2\u201312\u00a0mg\u00a0C\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) had no significant effect on Zn toxicity to mussels, in accord with voltammetry data showing an absence of any strong ligand binding for Zn by DOMs. As with Pb, DOMs increased Zn toxicity to urchin larvae. Critical Tissue Residues (CTR) based on whole body concentrations of Pb and Zn were determined for M. galloprovincialis at 48\u00a0h and S. purpuratus at 72\u00a0h. The median lethal CTR values (LA50s), useful parameters for development of saltwater Biotic Ligand Models (BLMs), were approximately 4-fold higher on a molar basis for Zn than for Pb. The latter were not altered by DOM exposure, despite increased EC50 values, in accord with the tenets of the BLM.",

In this study, using bacteria produced enzymes, we demonstrated that both CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 participate in the oxidative metabolism of quinoxalines. For CYP1A5, three hydroxylated metabolites of quinocetone were generated. In addition, CYP1A5 is able to hydroxylate carbadox. For CYP1A4, only one hydroxylated product of quinocetone on the phenyl ring was identified. Neither CYP1A5 nor CYP1A4 showed hydroxylation activity towards mequindox and cyadox.

In this study, we cloned and sequenced four GST genes from the monogonont rotifer Brachionus koreanus. The domain regions of four Bk-GSTs showed a high similarity to those of other species. In addition, to evaluate the potential of GST genes as an early warning signal for oxidative stress, we exposed sublethal concentrations of copper (Cu) to B. koreanus and measured glutathione (GSH) contents and several antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx; EC 1.11.1.9), and glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.8.1.7). The reactive oxygen species (ROS) at 12\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h after copper exposure increased significantly. GSH contents however did not increase significantly and even it decreased at 0.24\u00a0mg/L at 12\u00a0h. The activities of several antioxidant enzymes, particularly GPx and GR, showed a dramatic increase in 0.24\u00a0mg/L of CuCl2. Messenger RNAs of each Bk-GST showed different patterns of modulations according to GST types, and particularly, Bk-GST-omega, Bk-GST-sigma, and Bk-GST zeta genes were highly sensitive to Cu. These results indicate that Bk-GSTs, functioning as one of the enzymatic defense mechanisms particularly in the early stage of oxidative stress response, were induced by Cu exposure. This also suggests that these genes and related enzymes have a potential as biomarkers for a more sensitive initial stress response.",

Presently, the cell- and tissue-specific localization of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase as well as neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthase isoforms (nNOS and iNOS) responsible for production of nitric oxide (NO) were carried out during different stages of metamorphosis in tail of tadpole Xenopus laevis. NO also has profound effect on the mitochondrial function having its own nitric oxide NOS enzyme. Hence, in situ staining for NO and mitochondria also was investigated. The distribution of nNOS and iNOS was found to be stage specific, and the gene expression of nNOS was up-regulated by thyroxin treatment. In situ staining for NO and mitochondria shows co-localization, suggesting mitochondria being one of the sources of NO. SOD and catalase showed significant co-localization during earlier stages of metamorphosis, but before the tail regression begins, there was a significant decrease in activity as well as co-localization suggesting increased ROS accumulation. These findings are discussed in terms of putative functional importance of ROS and cytoplasmic as well as mitochondrial derived NO in programmed cell death in tail tissue.",

     "abstract": "Hepatic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs: EC2.5.1.1.8) catalyze the detoxification of reactive electrophilic compounds, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic intermediates, via conjugation with the endogenous tripeptide glutathione (GSH). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-mediated detoxification is a critical determinant of species susceptibility to the toxic and carcinogenic mycotoxin aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), which in resistant animals efficiently detoxifies the toxic intermediate produced by hepatic cytochrome P450 bioactivation, the exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide (AFBO). Domestic turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) are one of the most sensitive animals known to AFB1, a condition associated with a deficiency of hepatic GST-mediated detoxification of AFBO. We have recently shown that unlike their domestic counterparts, wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), which are relatively resistant, express hepatic GST-mediated detoxification activity toward AFBO. Because of the importance of GSTs in species susceptibility, and to explore possible GST classes involved in AFB1 detoxification, we amplified, cloned, expressed and functionally characterized the hepatic mu-class GSTs tGSTM3 (GenBank accession no. JF340152), tGSTM4 (JF340153) from domestic turkeys, and a GSTM4 variant (ewGSTM4, JF340154) from Eastern wild turkeys. Predicted molecular masses of tGSTM3 and two tGSTM4 variants were 25.6 and 25.8\u00a0kDa, respectively. Multiple sequence comparisons revealed four GSTM motifs and the mu-loop in both proteins. tGSTM4 has 89% amino acid sequence identity to chicken GSTM2, while tGSTM3 has 73% sequence identity to human GSTM3 (hGSTM3). Specific activities of Escherichia coli-expressed tGSTM3 toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and peroxidase activity toward cumene hydroperoxide were five-fold greater than tGSTM4 while tGSTM4 possessed more than three-fold greater activity toward 1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene (DCNB). The two enzymes displayed equal activity toward ethacrynic acid (ECA). However, none of the GSTM proteins had AFBO detoxification capability, in contrast to recombinant alpha-class GSTs shown in our recent study to possess this important activity. In total, our data indicate that although turkey hepatic GSTMs may contribute to xenobiotic detoxification, they probably play no role in detoxification of AFBO in the liver.",

The continuous decreases of GSH-Px and GST activities dependent on the growth period of G. mellonella occurred in JH and 20E groups over and under their controls, respectively. While the GR activities of G. mellonella showed increases in young pupa (YP) for both control and in old larvae (OL) for the 20E groups after the minimum at these periods, they also increased after old pupa (OP) for the JH group with a maximum in OL period. Although GR activity levels in the JH group were significantly higher compared with controls and 20E groups up to OP period, the activity levels for the control and 20E groups were higher than those of the JH group at adult (AD) and old pupa (OP) periods, respectively. In spite of increases in the GR activity of 20E and control groups of G. mellonella, decreased GSH and increased GSSG levels were observed at aging period. GSH levels in the JH group reached a maximum at prepupa (PP) and then decreased with non-significant changes from OL to AD period. According to the results, GSH and GSSG levels, as well as GSH/GSSG ratios, were below and over control levels in 20E and JH groups, respectively, during all of the investigated developmental stages. On the contrary, the LPO levels were higher than the control for 20E and lower for the JH groups during the developmental period.

In all cases water hardness was protective against acute Ni toxicity with LC50 values 3\u20133.5\u00a0\u00d7 higher in the hard water vs. soft water. In addition, higher water hardness significantly reduced Ni bioaccumulation in these organisms suggesting that competition by Ca and Mg for uptake at the biotic ligand may contribute to higher metal resistance. CBR50 values (Critical Body Residues) were less dependent on water chemistry (i.e. more consistent) than LC50 values within and across species by ~\u00a02 fold. These data support one of the main advantages of the Tissue Residue Approach (TRA) where tissue concentrations are generally less variable than exposure concentrations with respect to toxicity. Whole body Ni bioaccumulation followed Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics in all organisms, with greater hardness tending to decrease Bmax with no consistent effect on Kd. Across species, acute Ni LC50 values tended to increase with both Kd and Bmax values \u2014 i.e. more sensitive species exhibited higher binding affinity and lower binding capacity for Ni, but there was no correlation with body size. With respect to biotic ligand modeling, log KNiBL values derived from Ni bioaccumulation correlated well with log KNiBL values derived from toxicity testing. Both whole body Na and Mg levels were disturbed, suggesting that disruption of ionoregulatory homeostasis is a mechanism of acute Ni toxicity. In L. stagnalis, Na depletion was a more sensitive endpoint than mortality, however, the opposite was true for the other organisms. This is the first study to show the relationship between Na and Ni.",

This study's purpose was to examine the effects of nanoZnO on the elemental composition (metallome) in exposed freshwater mussels, Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed for 21\u00a0days to an environmentally realistic (low) concentration (2\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of nanoZnO and zinc chloride. The mussels were also exposed to a physically and chemically treated municipal effluent (ME), both alone and in the presence of both forms of Zn. The metallome profile was characterized by the following 15 elements in gills, digestive gland and gonad tissues: Ag, Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, V and Zn. The levels of metallothioneins (MT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the digestive gland were also measured as biomarkers of toxic effects. The data revealed that exposure to nanoZnO increased the total levels of Zn, MT and LPO in the digestive gland. Discriminate function analysis revealed that the digestive gland responded the most to exposure to either nanoZnO or Zn2\u00a0+. For nanoZnO, the observed changes in Al, As and Mo in the digestive gland offered the best discrimination from dissolved Zn2\u00a0+. Co-exposure of nanoZnO with the ME changed the metallome profile closer to dissolved Zn2\u00a0+, suggesting a common interaction site within the ME. This was observed in changes in Ni, Cu, Se and Zn in the digestive gland of exposed mussels. Canonical analysis of essential and non-essential elements revealed that exposure to nanoZnO increased the relationships between LPO and the sum of essential elements in the digestive gland. Conversely, exposure to dissolved Zn2\u00a0+ and the ME decreased the relationship between the sum of non-essential elements and LPO and MT. In conclusion, the use of a \u201cmetallomic\u201d approach was used to discriminate changes following exposure to nanoZnO and dissolved Zn in freshwater mussels and provided insights into the interaction of forms of Zn in ME towards mussels.",

     "abstract": "In order to get insights into the effects of cadmium (Cd) on cell morphology and functions, we exposed haemocytes of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri to sub-lethal concentrations of CdCl2. Results indicate that Cd hampers haemocyte spreading and phagocytosis in a dose-dependent way, through the alteration of the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, the metal decreases the stability of the internal membranes, as revealed by the Neutral Red assay. The fraction of cells showing positivity for the lysosomal enzyme acid phosphatase is also reduced in the presence of Cd, whereas the number of cells responsive to the Annexin-V assay and showing chromatin condensation increases, suggesting a metal-dependent induction of apoptosis in exposed cells. As Cd is a known cause of oxidative stress, the decrease in the percentage of cells positive to the assay for superoxide anion, observed at low Cd concentrations, is indicative of the synthesis of metal-chelating molecules, such as metallothioneins, whereas, the increase at high Cd concentrations suggests a depletion of the cell reducing redox potential.",

The results showed that expression patterns of Vtg subtype, ER subtype, AR subtype, MT and CYP1A genes in male mosquitofish varied according to tissue and specific hormone stress. Vtg subtype mRNA expression was induced in the liver in E2-added treatments, and an up-regulation of ER\u03b1 mRNA expression was also observed. In addition, hormone treatments increased three Vtg subtype mRNA expression levels in the testis, at least to some extent. All hormone treatments significantly inhibited ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2 and AR\u03b2 mRNA expression in the testis. Some of hormone treatments could affect MT and CYP1A gene expression in mosquitofish. In general, multiple hormone treatments showed different effects on target gene expression compared with corresponding hormone alone. The results from the present study provided valuable information on the toxicological effects of steroid hormones in mosquitofish.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium is a ubiquitous environmental metal contaminant with an affinity for biological membranes; it can enter cells by facilitated transport and it binds therein to various biomolecules and affects membrane system function. The relationship between cadmium exposure, dose and response was investigated in the benthic, deposit feeding, marine bivalve Tellina deltoidalis, using 28 day microcosm spiked cadmium exposures. Tissue cadmium reached steady state with the exposure concentration. Half the accumulated cadmium was detoxified and with increased exposure more was converted into metal rich granules. Most biologically active cadmium was in the mitochondrial fraction, with up to 7320-fold cadmium increases in exposed organisms. Cadmium exposed T. deltoidalis generally had reduced glutathione peroxidase enzyme activity. An increase in total glutathione concentrations, due to a build up of oxidised glutathione, was indicated by the reduced to oxidised glutathione ratio. All cadmium exposed T. deltoidalis had reduced total antioxidant capacity that corresponded with increased lipid peroxidation, lysosomal destabilisation and micronuclei frequency. Clear exposure-dose-response relationships have been demonstrated for T. deltoidalis exposed to cadmium-spiked sediments, supporting this organism's suitability for laboratory or in situ evaluation of sediment cadmium toxicity.",

The conjugating activities of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and UPD-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) were also assessed. Specific mammalian inhibitors were used as diagnostic tools for related activities of CYP1A (\u03b1-naphthoflavone; \u03b1NF), CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 (ticlopidine) and CYP3A4 (ketoconazole). The in vitro sensitivity to organophosphorous pesticides (OP) was tested in the S10 homogenate of brain (acetylcholinesterase-AChE) and liver (CbE). Furthermore, the pesticide chlorpyrifos oxon (CLPO) was used to explore the OP sensitivity of CbE of both species in two subcellular fractions (microsomes and cytosol), using two substrates. Overall, only two parameters confirmed species differences: EROD and cytosolic CbE being significantly elevated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the common sole, S. solea. A high inhibition of CYP1A related activities using several fluorometric substrates (ER, MR and CEC) after in vitro incubation with \u03b1NF confirmed all measure CYP1A1-related activities whereas ketoconazole was more specific for BFCOD (CYP3A4). Pesticide sensitivity was similar for brain AChE but hepatic CbE had a protective role that was species and pesticide dependent.",

     "abstract": "The chicken (Gallus gallus) is one of the most economically important domestic animals and also an avian model species. Chickens have two CYP1A genes (CYP1A4 and CYP1A5) which are orthologous to mammalian CYP1A1 and CYP1A2. Although the importance of chicken CYP1As in metabolism of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics is well recognized, their enzymatic properties, substrate preference and inhibitor selectivity remain poorly understood. In this study, functional enzymes of chicken CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 were successfully produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The substrate preference and inhibitor specificity of the two chicken CYP1As were compared. Kinetic results showed that the enzymatic parameters (Km, Vmax, Vmax/Km) for ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and benzyloxyresorufin O-debenzylase (BROD) differed between CYP1A4 and CYP1A5, while no significant difference was observed for methoxyresorufin O-demethylase (MROD). Lower Km of CYP1A4 for BROD suggests that CYP1A4 has a greater binding affinity to benzyloxyresorufin than either ethoxyresorufin or methoxyresorufin. The highest Vmax/Km ratio was seen in BROD activity for CYP1A4 and in MROD for CYP1A5 respectively. These results indicate that substrate preference of chicken CYP1As is more notably distinguished by BROD activity and CYP1A5 prefers shorter alkoxyresorufins resembling its mammalian ortholog CYP1A2. Differential patterns of MROD inhibition were observed between CYP1As and among the five CYP inhibitors (\u03b1-naphthoflavone, furafylline, piperonyl butoxide, erythromycin and ketoconazole). \u03b1-Naphthoflavone was determined to be a potent MROD inhibitor of both CYP1A4 and CYP1A5. In contrast, no or only a trace inhibitory effect (<\u00a015%) was observed by erythromycin at a concentration of 500\u00a0\u03bcM. Stronger inhibition of MROD activity was found in CYP1A5 than CYP1A4 by relatively small molecules \u03b1-naphthoflavone, piperonyl butoxide and furafylline. AROD kinetics and inhibition profiles between chicken CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 demonstrate that the two paralogous members of the CYP1A subfamily have distinct enzymatic properties, reflecting differences in the active site geometry between CYP1A4 and CYP1A5. These findings suggest that CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 play partially overlapping but distinctly different physiological and toxicological roles in the chicken.",

The in vitro bioassays for (anti-)androgenic activities showed that TBBPA had a weak androgenic activity in vitro with recombinant yeast systems carrying human androgen receptor (hAR). In the in vivo bioassays, the gene expression patterns of vitellogenin (Vtg), estrogen receptors (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2), and androgen receptors (AR\u03b1 and AR\u03b2) in adult males and juveniles after exposure to TBBPA for 60\u00a0days were evaluated. Significant up-regulation of Vtg, ER\u03b1, and ER\u03b2 mRNAs was observed in the liver after exposure to 500\u00a0nM of TBBPA. In the testis, the lowest concentration of TBBPA (50\u00a0nM) markedly induced Vtg, ER\u03b2, and AR\u03b2 mRNA expression, but the same concentration significantly inhibited AR\u03b1 mRNA expression. In addition, in juveniles, 100\u00a0nM of TBBPA significantly up-regulated the expression of Vtg, ER\u03b2, and AR\u03b1 mRNAs. However, TBPPA did not cause histological alterations in the liver and testis of adult male mosquitofish. The results from this present study suggest that TBBPA could display low but multiple hormonal activities despite its low toxicity to mosquitofish.",

     "abstract": "Pike-perch Sander lucioperca is currently considered as one of the most promising candidates for production in freshwater recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). Here, due to the lack of studies on nitrite (NO2\u2212) toxicity in pike-perch, a flow-through exposure at 0, 0.44, 0.88, 1.75, 3.5, 7, 14 and 28\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N was carried out to determine the acute and chronic toxicity over a period of 32\u00a0days. In juvenile pike-perch, 120\u00a0h LC50 was 6.1\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N and at \u2265\u00a014\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N all fish had died within 24\u00a0h. Chronic exposure revealed a significant build up of NO2\u2212 in the plasma as well as in the muscles at \u2265\u00a00.44\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N peaking in fish exposed to the highest concentration of 3.5\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N after 32\u00a0days. Still, due to high individual variation methemoglobin (MetHb) was only significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) at 3.5\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N. No adverse effects on red blood cells (RBC) and hematocrit were observed in any of the treatments. In a second experiment, compensation of NO2\u2212 toxicity at increasing chloride concentrations (40 (freshwater), 65, 90, 140, 240, 440\u00a0mg/L Cl\u2212) was observed at a constant exposure of 10\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N for 42\u00a0days. At \u2265\u00a0240\u00a0mg/L Cl\u2212, NO2\u2212 build-up in blood plasma and muscle was completely inhibited. At lower Cl\u2212 concentrations (\u2264\u00a0140\u00a0mg/L), NO2\u2212 was significantly increased in plasma, but only insignificantly elevated in muscle due to high individual variation. MetHb was increased significantly difference only at 40\u00a0mg/L Cl\u2212 (freshwater control) compared to the control. Again, high individual variations were observed. As a conclusion, S. lucioperca is moderately sensitive towards NO2\u2212 and acceptable levels in RAS should hence not exceed 1.75\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N to avoid MetHb formation. However, based on the 120\u00a0h LC50 and a factor of 0.01 according to Sprague (1971), a NO2\u2212 concentration of \u2264\u00a00.061\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N is considered as \u201csafe.\u201d Thereby, no NO2\u2212 should accumulate in the plasma or muscle tissue during chronic exposure. For 10\u00a0mg/L NO2\u2212\u2013N, \u2265\u00a0240\u00a0mg/L chloride compensates for NO2\u2212 uptake in plasma and muscle.",

     "abstract": "Estrogens and estrogen mimics are aquatic contaminants that can elicit a variety of deleterious effects in exposed fauna. One of the most potent xenoestrogens found in the aquatic environment is 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the pharmaceutically derived semi-synthetic hormone found in oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies. Exposure to 100\u00a0ng/L EE2 has previously been shown to profoundly decrease functional hepatic nucleotide excision repair (NER) processes in adult zebrafish in correlation with dramatic decreases in the abundance of hepatic XPC and XPA transcripts; however, its effects on these processes in embryos are currently unknown. Because developing organisms are known to have increased sensitivities to endocrine disrupting compounds such as EE2, the goal of this study was to examine the impacts of estrogen exposure on mRNA expression of these two key NER genes in zebrafish embryos during the first 4 days of development. Embryos were exposed from 0\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf) to waterborne EE2, its major metabolite, estrone (E1), or combinations of the two compounds and sampled at 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hpf. Increased abundance of vitellogenin-1 (VTG1) mRNA, a bioindicator of estrogen exposure, was evident as early as 24 hpf in embryos that were co-exposed to EE2 and E1 and this effect was sustained throughout 96 hpf. Embryos exposed to EE2 alone exhibited elevated VTG1 beginning at 72 hpf. In contrast to observations from adult zebrafish exposed to EE2, embryos did not show any change in mRNA abundance of the excision repair gene, XPC, during the first 4\u00a0days of development. However, co-exposure to EE2 and E1 elicited an increase in XPA mRNA abundance at 48 and 72 hpf, which was the opposite response as that observed in exposed adults where hepatic XPA mRNA abundance decreased after EE2 exposure. These differences between embryos and adults suggest that alteration of NER gene transcription by EE2 is operating under different stimuli during development.",

The apoptotic cell ratio and mRNA expression level of CTSB were significantly increased in shrimp exposed to nitrite-N for 48 and 72\u00a0h. Caspase-3 mRNA expression level significantly increased by 766.50% and 1811.16% for 24 and 48\u00a0h exposure, respectively.

Expression level of TRx reached its highest level after 48\u00a0h exposure.

In this study, the full-length cDNAs of amh, dax1 and cyp19a1a were cloned and characterized in a triploid gynogenic fish, the Pengze crucian carp. Their expression profilings in juvenile development, adult tissues and juveniles exposed to 100\u00a0ng/L 17\u03b1-methyltestosterone (MT) were investigated. Results showed that their putative proteins shared high identities to their counterparts in cyprinid fish species, respectively. The tissue distribution results indicated that amh and cyp19a1a were predominantly expressed in the ovary and dax1 was dominantly expressed in the liver. Gene profiling in the developmental stages showed that all the three target genes had a consistent highest expression at 48\u00a0days post hatching (dph). The period of 48\u00a0dph appeared to be a key time during the process of the gonad development of Pengze crucian carp. 100\u00a0ng/L MT significantly increased the mRNA expression of amh at 2- and 4-week exposures and enhanced dax1 and cyp19a1a at 6-week exposure.

Furthermore, the present study will be of great significance to broaden the understanding of molecular mechanisms of the physiological processes of reproduction in fish.",

For the last 150\u00a0days, dietary ascorbic acid concentrations were decreased from 3500 to 50\u00a0mg/kg diet and the fish sampled periodically to assess ascorbic acid concentrations. The ascorbic acid depletion curves were faster in the E\u00a0\u2212 compared with E\u00a0+ fish (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); the estimated half-life of depletion in the E\u00a0\u2212 fish was 34\u00a0days, while in it was 55\u00a0days in the E\u00a0+ fish. To assess swimming behavior, zebrafish were monitored individually following a \u201cstartle-response\u201d stimulus, using computer and video technology. Muscle histopathology was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining on paramedian sections of fixed zebrafish. At study end, E\u00a0\u2212 fish contained 300-fold less \u03b1-tocopherol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), half the ascorbic acid (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and 3-fold more malondialdehyde (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) than did E\u00a0+ fish.

Nm23 oncoprotein, arginine methyltransferase, fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase and glutathione S-transferase were down-regulated, whereas two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase isoforms and a lipocalin-like crustacyanin (CTC) were up-regulated after WSF exposure. CTC mRNA levels were further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR showing an increased expression after WSF exposure.

     "abstract": "Although dietary exposure of adult fish to organoselenium in contaminated aquatic ecosystems has been reported to bioaccumulate and cause larval deformities in offspring, subtle physiological effects produced through low level waterborne selenium exposure in fish such as swim performance and aerobic capacity have not been investigated. To evaluate potential effects of selenite on these responses, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to nominal aqueous concentrations of 0, 10 or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L sodium selenite for 14\u00a0days. Upon completion of the exposure period, fish underwent two successive swim trials in a swim tunnel respirometer to determine critical swim speed (Ucrit), oxygen consumption (MO2), standard and active metabolic rates, aerobic scope (AS) and cost of transport (COT) followed by analysis of whole body triglyceride and glycogen concentrations. Selenite exposure had a significant negative effect on Ucrit and aerobic capacity. Active metabolic rates and AS significantly decreased in both selenite exposure groups after the second swim trial. No significant effect was observed in MO2, standard metabolic rate, COT, triglyceride and glycogen levels, or condition factor between groups. These results suggest that aqueous selenite exposure at environmentally relevant concentrations produces adverse effects on aerobic capacity that can diminish endurance and maximum swim speeds, which may lower fish survivability.",

     "abstract": "Copper is a common chemical contaminant in coastal environments, including coral reefs. Ecotoxicological studies have demonstrated that exposure to copper can cause stress and detrimental effects in both host cnidarian and algal symbionts. The objective of this study was to investigate the sublethal effects of copper on the reef-building coral Montastraea franksi, by identifying genes with altered expression in corals exposed to dissolved copper, and by measuring the extent of damage to DNA in response to copper exposure. Corals exposed to 30\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 copper for 48\u00a0h experienced significant DNA damage and displayed changes in expression patterns of genes that are known to play role cellular and oxidative stress responses. Corals also experienced changes in gene expression of genes that are not already known to play roles in oxidative stress in corals. Our data suggest that these genes may either play roles directly in mediating a stress response, or may be genes acting downstream of the stress response. These include an ETS domain-containing transcription factor related to the ETS1 family of transcription factors, known in mammals to mediate development, disease, and stress response, and two genes that are associated with biomineralization: galaxin, a protein from the organic matrix of the coral skeleton, and a coral-specific gene SCRIP2.",

Known pyrethroid-associated changes to insect neuromuscular function may translate into similar effects in fish, thereby altering swimming ability and affecting foraging, predator avoidance, and migration. Three experiments were conducted using critical (Ucrit) and burst (Umax) swimming speeds to assess the sublethal effects of the pyrethroids permethrin and deltamethrin in juvenile rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were exposed to deltamethrin (100, 200, or 300\u00a0ng/L) or permethrin (1, 2, or 3\u00a0\u03bcg/L) in water for 4\u00a0d, and assessed for swimming performance. Deltamethrin (200 and 300\u00a0ng/L) reduced Ucrit, but not Umax, while both swim performance measurements were unaffected by permethrin. Subsequent experiments used only Ucrit to assess deltamethrin exposure. In a time course experiment, deltamethrin (300\u00a0ng/L) reduced Ucrit after 1 and 4\u00a0d of exposure, but after 7\u00a0d of exposure Ucrit was fully recovered. Finally, deltamethrin (1, 2, or 3\u00a0\u03bcg/L) reduced Ucrit after 1\u00a0h bath exposures similar to recommended protocols for deltamethrin based sea-lice treatment in aquaculture. The real-world implications of the revealed pyrethroid-associated swimming ability reductions in salmon may be important in areas close to aquaculture facilities.",

Prevention of FASD, other than women abstaining from alcohol drinking during pregnancy, is not known. A limitation of the use of synthetic anti-alcoholic drugs during pregnancy led us to investigate herbal products. In particular, many plants including Asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) have therapeutic potential for the treatment of alcoholism. We used Japanese ricefish (medaka) (Oryzias latipes), an animal model of FASD, for identifying herbal medicines that can attenuate ethanol toxicity. Fertilized eggs in standard laboratory conditions were exposed to ginseng (PG) root extract (0\u20132\u00a0mg/mL) either 0\u20132 (group A) or 1\u20133 (group B) day post fertilization (dpf) followed by maintenance in a clean hatching solution. The calculated IC50 as determined 10\u00a0dpf in A and B groups were 355.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.12 and 679.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively. Simultaneous exposure of embryos in sub-lethal concentrations of PG (50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and ethanol (300\u00a0mM) for 48\u00a0h disrupted vessel circulation and enhanced mortality. However, PG (100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) may partially protect trabecular cartilage (TC) deformities in the neurocranium in B group embryos induced by ethanol (300\u00a0mM). To understand the mechanism, embryonic ethanol concentration was measured at 2\u00a0dpf and adh5, adh8, aldh2, aldh9a, catalase, GST, and GR mRNAs were analyzed at 6\u00a0dpf. It was observed that although ethanol is able to reduce adh8 and GST mRNA contents, the simultaneous addition of PG was unable to alter ethanol level as well as mRNA contents in these embryos. Therefore, antagonistic effects of PG on ethanol toxicity are mediated by a mechanism which is different from those regulating ethanol metabolism and oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "The acute toxicity of organic tin compounds (OTCs) has been studied in detail. However, due to their complex nature, very little is known about species-specific methods of accumulation and consequences for food-webs. Chironomids, on which e.g. Daubenton's bats feed, may act as vectors for the transport of organic tin compounds from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems. Bats are prone to environmental toxins because of their longevity and their ecological role as top predators. Organic tin compounds are associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species and associated oxidative damage as well as suppression of immune function. The present paper investigates whether the OTC, tributyltin (TBT) and its metabolite, dibutyltin (DBT), accumulate in natural populations of Daubenton's bats and whether TBT-associated effects are seen in general body condition, redox balance, redox enzyme activities, associated oxidative damage of red blood cells and complement function. We discovered the concentration of bat fur DBT correlated with local marine sediment TBT concentrations. However, we did not find a correlation between the explanatory factors, bat fur DBT and marine sediment TBT concentrations, and several physiological and physical response variables apart from complement activity. Higher DBT concentrations resulted in weaker complement activity and thus a weaker immune response. Although the observed physiological effects in the present study were not strongly correlated to butyltin concentrations in fur or sediment, the result is unique for natural populations so far and raises interesting questions for future ecotoxicological studies.",

Here, we conveniently use archived tissues obtained from controlled laboratory exposure studies to look for evidence that MeHg can disrupt DNA methylation across taxa. Brain (cerebrum) tissues from MeHg-exposed mink (Neovison vison), chicken (Gallus gallus) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were analyzed for total Hg levels and global DNA methylation. Tissues from chicken and mink, but not perch, were also analyzed for DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity. In mink we observed significant reductions in global DNA methylation in an environmentally-relevant dietary exposure group (1\u00a0ppm MeHg), but not in a higher group (2\u00a0ppm MeHg). DNMT activity was significantly reduced in all treatment groups. In chicken or yellow perch, no statistically significant effects of MeHg were observed. Dose-dependent trends were observed in the chicken data but the direction of the change was not consistent between the two endpoints. Our results suggest that MeHg can be epigenetically active in that it has the capacity to affect DNA methylation in mammals. The variability in results across species may suggest inter-taxa differences in epigenetic responses to MeHg, or may be related to differences among the exposure scenarios used as animals were exposed to MeHg through different routes (dietary, egg injection), for different periods of time (19\u201389\u00a0days) and at different life stages (embryonic, juvenile, adult).",

Among the multiple pleiotropic responses elicited by AHR agonists, the antiestrogenic and endocrine-disrupting action of the receptor activation is one of the most studied. It has been demonstrated that some AHR agonists disrupt estradiol-induced vitellogenin synthesis in the fish liver via a mechanism that involves crosstalk between the AHR and the estrogen receptor (ER). Chicken hepatocytes have become a model for the study of AHR action in birds and the induction of the signal and its effect in these cells are well established. However, the impact of AHR activation on estradiol-regulated responses in the chicken liver remains to be demonstrated. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to determine the effect of AHR action on ER-driven transcription in a convenient model of chicken liver cells. For this purpose, we designed a reporter construct bearing the 5\u2032 regulatory region of the chicken vitellogenin II gene and used it to transfect chicken hepatoma LMH cells. We found that \u03b2-naphthoflavone represses ER-driven vitellogenin promoter activity and that this action is mediated by the AHR. This inhibitory crosstalk between both pathways appears to be unidirectional, since estradiol did not alter the transcript levels of an AHR target gene. Besides, and highly relevant, we show that LMH cell line transfected with a reporter construct bearing the chicken vitellogenin promoter sequence is a useful and convenient model for the study of AHR\u2013ER interaction in chicken liver-derived cells.",

Preexposed females, in comparison to the individuals from the reference site, responded with increased SOD activity, irrespective of the stressing factor.

However, reports on the simultaneous assessment of Cr toxicity in fish and its toxico-kinetics, namely involving metal speciation, are scarce. Therefore, keeping in view the understanding of the mechanisms of Cr(VI) toxicity, this work intended to detect the formation of paramagnetic Cr species in liver of Anguilla anguilla following short-term dichromate(VI) intraperitoneal treatment (up to 180\u00a0min), assessing simultaneously the pro-oxidant properties. The formation of Cr(V) and Cr(III) was examined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), as an innovative approach in the context of fish toxicology, and related with the levels of total Cr. Cr(V) was successfully detected and quantified by EPR spectrometry, showing a transient occurrence, mostly between 15 and 90\u00a0min post-injection, with a peak at 30\u00a0min. The limitations of EPR methodology towards the detection and quantification of Cr(III) were confirmed. Although Cr(VI) exposure induced the antioxidant system in the eel's liver, the oxidative deterioration of lipids was not prevented. Overall, the results suggested that Cr(V), as a short-lived species, did not appear to be directly and primarily responsible for the cellular damaging effects observed, since stress responses persisted up to the end of exposure regardless Cr(V) drastic decay. Though further research is needed, ROS mediated pathways (suggested by superoxide dismutase and catalase activity induction) and formation of Cr(III) complexes emerged as the most plausible mechanisms involved in Cr(VI) toxicity.",

     "abstract": "The health of sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon stocks is of increasing concern; reflecting both a sentinel of human-impacted aquatic environments and as a key fishery for British Columbia, Canada. The spawning migration of Pacific sockeye salmon represents a critical life stage where significant demands are made on animal biology and important BC fisheries are linked to this migration in the Skeena and Fraser River watersheds. These watersheds present very different environments; the former being sparsely populated with little industrial impact, while the latter flows through highly-populated areas. The present study used quantitative real-time PCR analysis of adult sockeye salmon from four 2008 stocks [Fulton River and Pinkut Creek (Skeena) and Weaver Creek and Harrison River (Fraser)] to evaluate ten hepatic gene transcripts associated with reproduction, stress, energy metabolism, and exposure to environmental contaminants. Dynamic changes in mRNA abundance were observed in Fulton River stock animals from the Skeena River mouth to the spawning ground which reflect the physiological demands of in-river migration and reproductive maturation. Inter-stock comparisons of migrants at spawning grounds demonstrated a marked difference in the sex-specific gene hepatic gene expression profiles. Our original hypothesis was that a greater diversity in mRNA profiles is associated with watersheds with higher human impact. However, our observations contradict this posit. Skeena males and females displayed poor definition in their molecular profiles between sexes while the Fraser River fish had very distinctive sex differences that were consistent with the previous year's migration. The genetic sex distribution and ratio of milt versus roe production did not differ between the Skeena and Fraser River spawning site fish. However, a significant percentage of Skeena animals displayed marked discordance of these characteristics with gender-specific hepatic mRNA profiles implying that an alteration in estrogen-mediated signaling has occurred. Continued geospatial and longitudinal assessments will help determine to what extent the dynamic molecular biology of late life-stage sockeye salmon reflects natural variation or modulation by anthropogenic causative agents.",

To check whether the Om-CYP1A would be inducible, we tested two strong CYP1A inducers, \u03b2-naphthoflavone (\u03b2-NF) and benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P), and observed concentration-dependent transient expression on transcripts of Om-CYP1A for 96\u00a0h over a wide range of concentrations. Om-CYP1A mRNA level was significantly increased in exposure to different concentrations of \u03b2-NF and B[\u03b1]P, and its expression was highly transcribed within 12\u00a0h upon the exposure to low concentrations of both chemicals. Inducible transcript profiles revealed that Om-CYP1A would be associated with the toxicant metabolism via AhREs/DREs/XREs in its promoter region. To uncover the effects of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil on transcripts of Om-CYP1A, we measured mRNA expression of Om-CYP1A towards different concentrations of WAF for 24\u00a0h. As a result, WAF exposure significantly increased Om-CYP1A transcripts at all concentrations as well as during time-course experiments for 96\u00a0h. In this paper, we demonstrated that WAF would trigger up-regulation of the CYP1A gene that would be associated with the initiation of the cellular defense systems. This finding provides a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of cellular protection particularly that involved in the WAF-mediated cellular response in O. melastigma.",

We examined transcriptional and metabolic changes in Lumbriculus variegatus exposed to benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), cadmium (Cd) or pentachlorophenol (PCP) by DNA microarrays (7422 ESTs) and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), respectively. In addition, the DNA damage response of worms exposed to B(a)P was assessed by a capillary electrophoresis laser induced fluorescence (CE-LIF) immunoassay. We found elevated expression of oxidative stress responsive genes, which correlated positively with the changes in antioxidant vitamin precursors including alpha-tocopherol and cholecalciferol. Other genes with strong differential expressions were mostly involved in actin related processes and proteolysis, despite an apparent delayed Cd response. Phosphates, sugars and fatty acids were effectively reduced and suggested that chemical treatments may have interfered with energy metabolism. The increased amount of B(a)P diol-epoxide (BPDE)\u2013DNA adducts in exposed worms appeared to correlate with the variability in uridine, inosine and xanthine, which are key components of nucleoside metabolism. This suggests that DNA damage was imminent or peaked within 6\u00a0h. The results conformed to transcriptional changes in B(a)P exposed worms and compliment other approaches to elucidate underlying molecular changes.",

The objectives of the present study were to determine whether the weak estrogenic chemical, bisphenol A (BPA), disrupts gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) system by altering the transcription of GnRHs and GnRH receptor (GnRHR) genes in adult rare minnow Gobiocypris rarus. In the present study, the histological examination of the ovary after 35-day BPA exposure at 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L demonstrated the perturbing effects of environmentally relevant BPA on the ovarian development in G. rarus. In addition mRNA expression of ovarian P450 aromatase in both ovaries and testes were significantly down-regulated by 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L BPA. GnRH2, GnRH3, GnRHR1A and GnRHR1B gene were identified in G. rarus. The expression patterns of GnRHs and GnRHR1s were analyzed in various tissues of G. rarus by quantitative real-time PCR. GnRHs and GnRHR1s were all predominantly expressed in the brains. Both GnRH3 and GnRHR1A were significantly upregulated in the brains of female exposed to 15\u00a0\u03bcg/L BPA for 35\u00a0days. It would suggest a potential negative feedback in the GnRH system in response to the disturbance of downstream of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis. Collectively, the present findings suggest that the transcripts of some key genes in the neuroendocrine system can be used as critical biomarkers in endocrine disruption assays of teleost fish.",

P. annandale is one of a few copepod species that can be cultured relatively easy under laboratory condition, and it is considered to be a potential model species for toxicity study. In the present study, P. annandalei were exposed to nickel at a concentration of 8.86\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 for 24\u00a0h, after which the RNA was prepared for SSH using unexposed P. annandalei as drivers. A total of 474 clones on the middle scale in the SSH library were sequenced. Among these genes, 129 potential functional genes were recognized based on the BLAST searches in NCBI and Uniprot databases. These genes were then categorized into nine groups in association with different biological processes using AmiGO against the Gene Ontology database. Of the 129 genes, 127 translatable DNA sequences were predicted to be proteins, and the putative amino acid sequences were searched for conserved domains (CD) and proteins using the CD-Search service and BLASTp. Among 129 genes, 119 (92.2%) were annotated to be involved in different biological processes, while 10 genes (7.8%) were classified as an unknown-function gene group. To further confirm the up-regulation of differentially expressed genes, the quantitative real time PCR were performed to test eight randomly selected genes, in which five of them, i.e. \u03b1-tubulin, ribosomal protein L13, ferritin, separase and Myohemerythrin-1, exhibited clear up-regulation after nickel exposure. In addition, MnSOD was further studied for the differential expression pattern after nickel exposure and the results showed that MnSOD had a time- and dose-dependent expression pattern in the copepod after nickel exposure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the toxicity effects of nickel on a copepod at molecular level.",

     "abstract": "Organisms chronically exposed to organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can develop resistance to these chemicals, a condition associated with reduced inducibility of the biomarker enzyme cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A). This study addresses the CYP1A response of members of the families Ictaluridae and Centrarchidae, two fish families found throughout much of the United States. We measured CYP1A expression, PCB body burdens, and conducted CYP1A challenge experiments in species from these families residing in the Town Branch/Mud River system (Logan County, KY, USA), a stream system historically contaminated with high levels of PCBs. Despite PCB concentrations in muscle tissue typically associated with elevated CYP1A (16.7 to 75.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0PCB/g wet edible flesh), resident fish in the contaminated Town Branch/Mud River sites (yellow bullhead [Ameiurus natalis], green sunfish [Lepomis cyanellus], and spotted bass [Micropterus punctulatus]) had hepatic CYP1A activity levels similar to, rather than higher than, those in reference fish, suggesting reduced sensitivity to CYP1A induction. Lack of CYP1A expression following direct contaminant exposure has often been associated with resistance to those contaminants. To determine if CYP1A in resident populations was resistant to induction by PCBs, we exposed resident fish to a single, intraperitoneal injection with a potent CYP1A inducer, 3,4,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77). PCB 77 treatment significantly induced hepatic CYP1A activity and protein in yellow bullhead from reference, but not contaminated, sites and had no effect on CYP1A in green sunfish from either site. The low CYP1A expression levels in resident fish with elevated PCB body burdens, together with the failure of PCB injection to induce CYP1A in certain populations, indicate an acclimatory CYP1A response in yellow bullheads and likely an inherently resistant CYP1A in green sunfish. This work demonstrates for the first time acclimation of CYP1A to PCBs in a species within the family Ictaluridae and provides further support for our previous work indicating an apparent inherent lack of CYP1A sensitivity to chlorinated inducers in Centrarchids. These traits may explain, at least in part, the common association of these families with degraded habitats and indicate Lepomis members are likely to be excellent candidates for exploring the mechanistic basis of \u2018inherent\u2019 CYP1A resistance. This study also underlines to the need for thorough characterization of the CYP1A responsivity of a population and/or species prior to using CYP1A as a reliable biomonitoring tool.",

Such genetically based and heritable resistance contribute to the persistence of populations in contaminated areas. Here we report on molecular responses to experimental copper in populations of the earthworm, Dendrobaena octaedra, originating from copper contaminated soil near Gusum (Sweden) where heavy metal pollution has been present for several decades. We studied gene expression of six genes potentially involved in resistance to copper toxicity using F2-generations of D. octaedra populations, originating from reference sites and contaminated (High, Medium and Low) sites around Gusum. The main result was different expression patterns of genes encoding for two different isoforms (mt1 and mt2) of metallothionein proteins during experimental exposure to copper contaminated soil. Expression of mt1 showed a fast and significant upregulation in the High population and a slower, albeit significant, upregulation in Medium and Low populations. However, in the three reference populations no upregulation were seen. In comparison, a fast upregulation was also seen for the High population in the isoform mt2, whereas, gene expression of all other populations, including reference populations, showed slower upregulation in response to experimental copper. The results indicate that copper resistance in D. octaedra from contaminated areas is related to an increased expression of metallothioneins.",

A reference transcriptome of 25,342 contigs was constructed from RNA from livers of fathead minnows exposed to various experimental conditions. Exposure to untreated OSPW resulted in greater abundances of 104 transcripts and lesser abundances of 91 transcripts. Oxidative metabolism, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and immune function were identified as processes affected by OSPW. Exposure to ozone-treated OSPW resulted in greater abundances of 57 transcripts and lesser abundances of 75 transcripts.

Based on known physiological differences between FWT and SWT which aid in regulating ion levels and osmolarity, we hypothesized that SWT would have lower rates of Ca uptake. Also, we predicted that Cd rates would also be lower because Cd is known to share a common transport mechanism with Ca. Kinetics of Ca and Cd transport were determined using mucosal salines of varying concentrations [1, 10, 30, 60, and 100 (mmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 for Ca, \u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 for Cd)]. Linear and saturating relationships were found for Ca for FWT and SWT, but overall SWT had lower rates. Linear and/or saturating relationships were also found for Cd uptake, but rates varied little between fish types. Elevated Ca had no inhibitory effect on Cd transport, and Ca channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil had little effect on Ca or Cd uptake. However, lanthanum reduced Ca transport into some compartments. A 21\u00a0day in vivo feeding experiment was also performed where FWT and SWT were exposed to control diets or Cd-spiked diets (552\u00a0\u03bcg Cd g\u2212\u00a01 food). Whole body Cd uptake between fish types was similar, but the majority of Cd in SWT remained in the posterior intestine tissue, while FWT transported more Cd through their gut wall. Overall it appears that large differences in Ca and Cd uptake between FWT and SWT exist, with SWT generally having lower rates.",

Enhanced toxicity has been shown to be mediated through the bioactivation of these xenobiotics by one or more flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs), which are induced by hyperosmotic conditions. To better understand the number of FMO genes that may be regulated by hyperosmotic conditions, rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were maintained and acclimated to freshwater (<\u00a00.5\u00a0g/L salinity) and to 18\u00a0g/L salinity. The expression of 3 different FMO transcripts (A, B and C) and associated enzymatic activities methyl p-tolyl sulfoxidation (MTSO) and benzydamine N-oxigenation (BZNO) were measured in four tissues. In freshwater-acclimated organisms FMO catalytic activities were as follows: liver\u00a0>\u00a0kidney\u00a0>\u00a0gills\u00a0=\u00a0olfactory tissues; in hypersaline-acclimated animals activities were higher in liver\u00a0>\u00a0gills\u00a0>\u00a0olfactory tissues\u00a0>\u00a0kidney. Acclimation to 18\u00a0g/L caused a significant induction in the stereoselective formation of R-MTSO in gill. In olfactory tissues, stereoselective (100%) formation of S-MTSO was observed and was unaltered by acclimation to hypersaline water. When specific transcripts were evaluated, salinity-acclimation increased FMO A in liver (up to 2-fold) and kidney (up to 3-fold) but not in olfactory tissues and gills. FMO B mRNA was significantly down-regulated in all tissues, and FMO C was unchanged by hypersaline acclimation. FMO B and C failed to correlate with any FMO catalytic activity, but FMO A mRNA expression linearly correlated to both FMO catalytic activities (MTSO and BZNO) in liver (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.92 and r2\u00a0=\u00a00.88) and kidney microsomes (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.93 and r2\u00a0=\u00a090). FMO A only correlated with MTSO activity in gills (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.93). These results indicate unique tissue specific expression of FMO genes in salmonids and are consistent with salinity-mediated enhancement of thioether-containing pesticide bioactivation by FMO which may occur in liver or kidney after salinity acclimation.",

In order to minimize the use of animal tests according to the 3Rs principle of replacement, reduction and refinement, we propose a transcriptomics and fish embryo based approach as an alternative to identify and analyze an estrogenic activity of environmental chemicals. For this purpose, the suitability of 48\u00a0h and 7\u00a0days post-fertilization zebrafish and medaka embryos to test for estrogenic disruption was evaluated. The embryos were exposed to the phytoestrogen genistein and subsequently analyzed by microarrays and quantitative real-time PCR. The functional analysis showed that the genes affected related to multiple metabolic and signaling pathways in the early fish embryo, which reflect the known components of genistein's mode of actions, like apoptosis, estrogenic response, hox gene expression and steroid hormone synthesis. Moreover, the transcriptomic data also suggested a thyroidal mode of action and disruption of the nervous system development. The parallel testing of two fish species provided complementary data on the effects of genistein at gene expression level and facilitated the separation of common from species-dependent effects. Overall, the study demonstrated that combining fish embryo testing with transcriptomics can deliver abundant information about the mechanistic effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals, rendering this strategy a promising alternative approach to test for endocrine disruption in a whole organism in-vitro scale system.",

In the \u201ctheory of aging\u201d, senescence is mainly due to the degradation of lipids, proteins and DNA by reactive oxygen species (ROS), by-products of oxidative metabolism. Some studies have shown that oxidative stress susceptibility could be a cost of reproduction. The present study investigates the effect of reproductive investment on antioxidant capacity in the gills of a species with a very high reproductive investment, the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas. We used RNA interference targeting the oyster vasa-like gene (Oyvlg) to produce oysters with contrasted reproductive investment. Antioxidant capacity was studied by measuring the mRNA levels of genes encoding major antioxidant enzymes, and the activity of these enzymes. The highest reproductive investment was associated with the highest transcript levels for glutathione peroxidase and extra-cellular and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase. In contrast, lipid peroxidation did not show any sign of oxidative damage whatever the reproductive investment. Up-regulation of certain genes encoding enzymes involved in the first step of ROS detoxification could therefore be a part of the organism's strategy for managing the pro-oxidant species produced by heavy reproductive investment.",

One population of Neotoma albigula was fed juniper that contains volatile terpenes. Juniper caused upregulation of CYP2B and GST in the nasal epithelium and the expression of CYP2B and GST in the nasal epithelium was correlated to liver expression, showing that the nasal epithelia responds to PSC and the response is similar to the liver. Two populations of Neotoma bryanti were fed creosote that contains less volatile phenolics. The creosote naive animals upregulated CYP2B in their nasal epithelia while the creosote experienced animals upregulated GST. There was no correlation between CYP2B and GST expression in the nasal epithelia and livers of either population.

Biological effects of contaminant exposure on caged mussels were evaluated by measuring a suite of biomarkers including catalase, glutathione S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, lipid peroxidation, acetylcholinesterase activity and lysosomal membrane stability. Mussels transplanted near the harbor area were able to elevate their antioxidant defense in response to environmental contamination. Reduced morphometric condition index and soft tissue growth rate together with increased lipid peroxidation and low lysosomal membrane stability were also observed at the most contaminated site.

In addition, plasma cortisol titers were correlated to the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), one of the oxidative stress parameters. 4-NP treatments resulted in high levels of POMC mRNA, HSP70 mRNA and plasma cortisol. On the contrary, E2 basically down-regulated POMC expression. Moreover, elevated cortisol levels in fish exposed to the highest dose of 4-NP were accompanied by low TAC. These results suggest that 4-NP modulates the sole HPI axis inducing a cortisol-mediated stress response.

After exposure, gills (anterior and posterior) were dissected and activities of enzymes involved in glycolysis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), Krebs cycle (citrate synthase), and mitochondrial electron transport chain (cytochrome c oxidase) were analyzed. Membrane potential of mitochondria isolated from anterior and posterior gill cells was also evaluated. In anterior gills of crabs acclimated to 2\u00a0ppt salinity, copper exposure inhibited hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, and citrate synthase activity, increased lactate dehydrogenase activity, and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. In posterior gills, copper inhibited hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and increased citrate synthase activity. In anterior gills of crabs acclimated to 30\u00a0ppt salinity, copper exposure inhibited phosphofructokinase and citrate synthase activity, and increased hexokinase activity. In posterior gills, copper inhibited phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and increased hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase activity. Copper did not affect cytochrome c oxidase activity in either anterior or posterior gills of crabs acclimated to 2 and 30\u00a0ppt salinity. These findings indicate that exposure to a sublethal copper concentration affects the activity of enzymes involved in glycolysis and Krebs cycle, especially in anterior (respiratory) gills of hyperosmoregulating crabs. Changes observed indicate a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, characterizing a situation of functional hypoxia. In this case, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential would suggest a decrease in ATP production. Although gills of isosmotic crabs were also affected by copper exposure, changes observed suggest no impact in the overall tissue ATP production. Also, findings suggest that copper exposure would stimulate the pentose phosphate pathway to support the antioxidant system requirements. Although N. granulata is very tolerant to copper, acute exposure to this metal can disrupt the energy balance by affecting biochemical systems involved in carbohydrate metabolism.",

The H. virescens larvae that were fed a diet containing 0.5% ILTI showed an 84% decrease in weight. ILTI was not digested by the midgut proteinases of either species of larvae. The trypsin levels were reduced by 55.3% in the feces of D. saccharalis and increased by 24.1% in the feces of H. virescens.

The organization of the ilti gene was elucidated by analyzing its corresponding genomic sequence. The recombinant ILTI protein (reILTI) was expressed and purified, and its efficacy was evaluated. Both native ILTI and reILTI exhibited a similar strong inhibitory effect on bovine trypsin activity. These results suggest that ILTI presents insecticidal properties against both insects and may thus be a useful tool in the genetic engineering of plants.",

We topically exposed eggs of red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta) and snapping turtles (Chelydra serpentina) to 200 and 177\u00a0\u03bcg/g of perchlorate (as NaClO4), respectively, to determine impacts on glandular thyroxine concentrations, embryonic growth and development, and metabolic rates of hatchlings for a period of 2\u00a0months post-hatching. In red-eared sliders, in ovo perchlorate exposure delayed hatching, increased external yolk size at hatching, increased hatchling mortality, and reduced total glandular thyroxine concentrations in hatchlings. In snapping turtles, hatching success and standard metabolic rates were reduced, liver and thyroid sizes were increased, and total glandular thyroxine concentrations in hatchlings were reduced after exposure to perchlorate. While both species were negatively affected by exposure, impacts on red-eared sliders were most severe, suggesting that the slider may be a more sensitive sentinel species for studying effects of perchlorate exposure to turtles.",

In vivo experiments have demonstrated that BMAA can cause a number of motor dysfunctions if ingested or injected, and in vitro experiments show that this toxin binds to glutamate receptors with deleterious results. Also, BMAA exists in the human food chain worldwide, and has been detected in the brains of ALS and AD patients. This paper offers the first demonstration by intracellular recording of the effect of ingested BMAA on the postsynaptic response of an identified glutamatergic cell in a living, undissected organism (Drosophila melanogaster), and correlates these observations with the specific motor dysfunctions that result from ingestion. The results suggest that BMAA acts as a glutamate agonist, causing NMDA receptor channels to remain open for prolonged periods of time, thereby damaging the cell by excitotoxicity. The effect on the postsynaptic response became apparent days before the function of the postsynaptic cell (wing beat) became affected. Severely depolarized cells were able to fully recover with the removal of BMAA from the food source, suggesting that blocking BMAA binding in the brain might be a good treatment strategy.",

However, genotyping of X. laevis has only recently become possible, so studies performed in the past were rarely able to make explicit linkages between genetic and phenotypic sex. Therefore, to further characterize this relationship, X. laevis tadpoles were exposed during development to 0.09, 0.84, or 8.81\u00a0\u03bcg/L 17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol (EE2), which is the estrogen analog commonly used in oral contraceptives. Exposure to all concentrations of EE2 tested resulted in significant delays in time to metamorphosis. Genotyping showed that genetic sex ratios were similar among treatments. However, morphological evaluation revealed that a significant number of individuals with a male genotype displayed mixed sex and abnormal phenotypes. Additionally, both genetic males and females exposed to EE2 exhibited greater presence of vitellogenin protein relative to the respective controls. Since estrogens function downstream of the initial molecular signals of sexual differentiation, it is likely that genetic male animals received mixed endogenous male and exogenous female signals that caused disordered sexual development. The production of vitellogenin was probably temporally separated and independent from primary effects on sexual differentiation, and might have contributed to delays in metamorphosis observed in individuals exposed to EE2.",

In this study, the expression profiles of four HSP genes (Lvhsp60, Lvhsp70, Lvhsc70, and Lvhsp90) of the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei under acute thermal stress, pH challenge, and heavy metal exposure were investigated, respectively, using the quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique. Results showed that the four genes exhibited quite different expression profiles when the shrimp were subjected to each of the above stressors. Under acute thermal stress, the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of all the four genes were significantly induced, and the transcription level of Lvhsp70 was the most sensitive to temperature fluctuations. Under acute pH challenge, the relative mRNA expression of the four genes was shown to be time and pH dependent, and the strongest response occurred in Lvhsp60. Under acute heavy metal exposure, transcripts of each of the four genes varied depending on metal type and exposure time. Lvhsp60 displayed particularly high sensitivity to cadmium and manganese exposure, while Lvhsp70 showed the most sensitive response to iron and zinc treatments. The results obtained suggest that different LvHSP genes may play different roles in mediating cell stress caused by a specific environmental stressor. Given the response sensitivity and intensity of LvHSP genes to environmental stresses, Lvhsp70 may be most suitable to act as a biomarker indicating thermal stress, iron and zinc stimulation, while Lvhsp60 may be a promising candidate marker of pH stress, cadmium and manganese exposure in shrimp.",

The results revealed a complex network of genes associated with different biological processes that may be engaged in the cellular response to ZEA exposure, i.e. blood coagulation or iron-storage processes.",

     "abstract": "Sub-chronic exposure to municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) in situ was recently shown to impact the acute response to a secondary stressor in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). However, little is known about whether MWWE exposure in itself is stressful to the animal. To address this, we carried out a laboratory study to examine the organismal and cellular stress responses and tissue-specific metabolic capacity in trout exposed to MWWE. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to 0, 20 and 90% MWWE (from a tertiary wastewater treatment plant), that was replenished every 2\u00a0d, for 14\u00a0d. Fish were sampled 2, 8 or 14\u00a0d post-exposure. Plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate levels were measured as indicators of organismal stress response, while inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), constitutive heat shock protein 70 (hsc70) and hsp90 expression in the liver were used as markers of cellular stress response. Impact of MWWE on cortisol signaling was ascertained by determining glucocorticoid receptor protein (GR) expression in the liver, brain and, heart, and metabolic capacity was evaluated by measuring liver glycogen content and tissue-specific activities of key enzymes in intermediary metabolism. Plasma glucose and lactate levels were unaffected by exposure to MWWEs, whereas cortisol showed a transient increase in the 20% group at 8\u00a0d. Liver hsc70 and hsp90, but not hsp70 expression, were higher in the 90% MWWE group after 8\u00a0d. There was a temporal change in GR expression in the liver and heart, but not brain of trout exposed to MWWE. Liver glycogen content and activities liver gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) were significantly affected by MWWE exposure. The glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase (PK) and hexokinase (HK) activities were significantly higher temporally by MWWE exposure in the gill and heart, but not in the liver and brain. Overall, a 14\u00a0d exposure to MWWE evokes a cellular stress response and perturbs the cortisol stress response in rainbow trout. The tissue-specific temporal changes in the metabolic capacity suggest enhanced energy demand in fish exposed to MWWE, which may eventually lead to reduced fitness.",

Moreover, due to its high hydrophobicity, TCS accumulates in fatty tissues in various aquatic organisms. TCS can be converted into methyl-triclosan (2,4,4\u2032-trichloro-2\u2032-methoxydiphenyl ether; MTCS) after biological methylation. In this study, the acute cytotoxicity of TCS and MTCS in short-term in vitro experiments was assessed on cell cultures from the European abalone Haliotis tuberculata. The results showed that morphology and density of hemocyte are affected from a concentration of 8\u00a0\u03bcM TCS. Using the XTT reduction assay, TCS has been demonstrated to decrease hemocyte metabolism activity in a dose- and time-dependent exposure. The IC50 was evaluated at 6\u00a0\u03bcM for both hemocyte and gill cells after a 24\u00a0h-incubation with TCS. A significant cytotoxicity of MTCS was also observed from 4\u00a0\u03bcM in 24\u00a0h-old hemocyte culture.

Here, we have cloned an inducible ferritin cDNA with 519\u00a0bp within the open reading frame fragment from the hepatopancreas of Aplysia juliana (AJ). The subunit sequence of the ferritin was predicted to be a polypeptide of 172 amino acids with a molecular mass of 19.8291\u00a0kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.01. The cDNA sequence of hepatopancreas ferritin in AJ was constructed into a pET-32a system for expressing its relative protein efficiently in E. coli strain BL21, under isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactoside induction. The recombinant ferritin, which was further purified on a Ni\u2013NTA resin column and digested with enterokinase, was detected as a single subunit of approximately 20\u00a0kDa mass using both SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The secondary structure and phosphorylation sites of the deduced amino acids were predicted using both ExPASy proteomic tools and the NetPhos 2.0 server, and the subunit space structure of the recombinant AJ ferritin (rAjFer) was built using a molecular operating environment software system. The result of in-gel digestion and identification using MALDI-TOF MS/MS showed that the recombinant protein was AjFer. ICP-MS results indicated that the rAjFer subunit could directly bind to cisplatin[cis-Diaminedichloroplatinum(CDDP)], giving approximately 17.6 CDDP/ferritin subunits and forming a novel CDDP-subunit. This suggests that a nanometer CDDP core-ferritin was constructed, which could be developed as a new anti-cancer drug. The flow cytometry results indicated that CDDP\u2013rAjFer could induce Hela cell apoptosis. Results of the real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that the expression of AjFer mRNA was up-regulated in AJ under Cd2+ stress.

In vivo assessment of these corticosteroid analogs is essential to understand the difference in molecular signaling of the ligands that share the corticosteroid backbone. Our research identified a novel function of GCs as modulators of tissue regeneration and demonstrated that GCs activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to inhibit early stages of tissue regeneration in zebrafish (Danio rerio). We utilized this phenomenon to assess the effect of different GC analogs on tissue regeneration and identified that some GCs such as beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) possess inhibitory properties, while others, such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone have no effect on regeneration. We performed in silico molecular docking and dynamic studies and demonstrated that type and size of substitution at the C17 position of the cortisol backbone confer a unique stable conformation to GR on ligand binding that is critical for inhibitory activity. In the field of tissue regeneration, our study is one of the first Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) investigations performed in vertebrates demonstrating that the in vivo tissue regeneration model is a powerful tool to probe structure function relationships, to understand regenerative biology, and to assist in rational drug design.",

     "abstract": "The juvenile hormone, methyl farnesoate (MF), and its analog insecticides have been used successfully to induce the production of males in cladocerans under long-day conditions in the laboratory. However, without hormone addition Daphnia do not usually produce male offspring under long photoperiods, while short photoperiods are a stimulus for the induction of males. We used 21 clones of Daphnia pulex differing in their propensity to produce males under short-day conditions to test whether the treatment with MF would result in an additive effect of shifting the sex ratio towards males. Contrary to our expectations, clones with a high tendency of male production showed a reduced sex ratio in response to MF treatment under short-day conditions, but clones that produced normally few males or did not produce males were stimulated by 700\u00a0nM MF to produce up to 40% males. We suggest that the endocrine disruptive effect of MF or juvenile hormone analogs in the field may depend on the clonal composition of the cladoceran population and on the natural photoperiod. This may affect the seasonal occurrence of sexual reproduction and eventually cause a mismatch between the presence of males and ephippial females.",

Zebrafish females were exposed to 0, 8.9, 17.8, and 35.6\u00a0\u03bcM Cd2+ for 72\u00a0h, and their ovaries and F1 larvae were collected to measure their Cd2+ contents and their smtB and mt2 mRNA expression.

Furthermore, F1 larvae had noticeably enhanced Cd2+ tolerance after maternal Cd2+ treatment. These results demonstrate that maternal Cd2+ was transferred to larval fish and induced mt2 and smtB mRNA expression to protect larva against the impacts of Cd2+. In female ovaries, mt2 expression showed a noticeable increase after exposure to a metal environment, while smtB did not show exactly the same effect.

Gill cellular NKA expression was reduced in salt-water, together with the expression of the CFTR chloride channel in hypersaline water.

Exposure to E2 and BaP alone significantly induced the gene expression of ER\u03b1\u2013VTG and AhR2\u2013CYP1A, respectively. Moreover, the obvious expression of related proteins was also observed. However, these inductions were significantly reduced after combined exposure to E2 and lower concentrations of BaP (20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L), indicative of a reciprocal inhibiting ER\u2013AhR interaction. However, high concentrations (100\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of BaP did not affect the E2-induced gene expression. Changes in VTG protein were in accordance with the expression of VTG mRNA, and more VTG protein was observed in liver than in serum. The induced endogenous E2 levels were suppressed by the presence of BaP. While the gene expression of CYP1A showed a concentration-dependent increase, EROD induction exhibited a bell-shaped concentration-response curve. Taken together, these results demonstrate a reciprocal inhibiting mode of ER\u2013AhR interactions and may lead to a possible underestimation of actual exposure.",

Although results for 96-h exposures reflect a repair/recovery phase, there was no significant correlation between metabolic rate and Na+/K+ ATPase activity. Metabolic rate of shiners was significantly elevated (65\u2013100%) at all concentrations compared to the control after 96-h, whereas Na+/K+ ATPase activity did not differ from the control. Elevated metabolic rate after 96-h likely reflects the influence of a variety of energetically demanding processes associated with repair and recovery.",

Morphological responses of hydra polyps to a range of toxaphene concentrations suggested that toxaphene negatively affects the nervous system of H. magnipapillata. We used real-time quantitative PCR of RNA extracted from polyps exposed to two concentrations of toxaphene (0.3\u00a0mg/L and 3\u00a0mg/L) for 24\u00a0h to evaluate the differential regulation of levels of transcripts that encode six antioxidant enzymes (CAT, G6PD, GPx, GR, GST and SOD), two proteins involved in detoxification and molecular stress responses (CYP1A and UB), and two proteins involved in neurotransmission and nerve cell differentiation (AChE and Hym-355). Of the genes involved in antioxidant responses, the most striking changes were observed for transcripts that encode GPx, G6PD, SOD, CAT and GST, with no evident change in levels of transcripts encoding GR. Levels of UB and CYP1A transcripts increased in a dose-dependent manner following exposure to toxaphene. Given that toxaphene-induced neurotoxicity was not reflected in the level of AChE transcripts and only slight accumulation of Hym-355 transcript was observed only at the higher of the two doses of toxaphene tested, there remains a need to identify transcriptional biomarkers for toxaphene-mediated neurotoxicity in H. magnipapillata. Transcripts that respond to toxaphene exposure could be valuable biomarkers for stress levels in H. magnipapillata and may be useful for monitoring the pollution of aquatic environments.",

     "abstract": "We investigated mechanisms leading to the assimilation of particle-bound arsenic (As) ingested by the deposit-feeding polychaete Alitta succinea using a radiotracer approach.The release of As from different particle types into extracted gut fluid or bovine serum albumin (BSA), a gut fluid mimic, was measured. In addition, gut fluid proteins were analyzed by separating proteins via 2D gel electrophoresis, and protein peptide sequences were determined by mass spectrometry. Major ions in the gut fluid were measured by ion chromatography and metals by mass spectrometry. Percentages of particulate As release were related to As assimilation efficiencies (AEs) in polychaetes feeding on different particle types. AEs of As were highest from radiolabeled pure diatoms (72%) and radiolabeled diatoms added to sediment (51%), lower from radiolabeled sediment (10%), and lowest from a radiolabeled iron oxide mineral, goethite (2%). It appears that As release from particles is a necessary but not sufficient requirement of As assimilation. For example, 15% of As was released from goethite into the gut fluid but only 2% was assimilated by A. succinea. Our results suggest that the likelihood of As assimilation is higher when it is bound to an organic compound of nutritional value in the ingested particles.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the CfER is an ortholog of the other mollusk ERs. Tissue distribution analysis of the CfER mRNA revealed that the expression of ER mRNA was observed in various tissues, and highest in the gonad of males and females. C. farreri were exposed for 10\u00a0days to endocrine disrupting chemicals including Benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)p) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (BDE-47). B(a)p exposure at 0.4 and 2\u00a0\u03bcg/L caused significant increase in mRNA expression of ER and VTG, but B(a)p at 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L down-regulated CfER and VTG mRNA expression compared to control.

In this study, a full-length cDNA representing a novel sigma-like GST was identified from Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum (RpGST\u03c3). RpGST\u03c3 (884\u00a0bp) was found to possess an open reading frame of 609\u00a0bp. The encoded polypeptide (203 amino acids) had a predicted molecular mass of 23.21\u00a0kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.64. Sequence analysis revealed two conserved GST domain profiles in N- and C-termini. Alignment studies revealed that the identity between deduced peptides of RpGST\u03c3 and known GST\u03c3 members was relatively low (<\u00a035%), except a previously identified Manila clam GST\u03c3 isoform (87.2%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that RpGST\u03c3 clustered together with molluscan GST\u03c3 homologs, which were closely related to insect GST\u03c3s. The RpGST\u03c3 was subsequently cloned and expressed as recombinant protein, in order to characterize its biological activity. The recombinant RpGST\u03c3 exhibited characteristic glutathione conjugating catalytic activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene and ethacrynic acid. It had an optimal pH and temperature of 8.0 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Expression profiles under normal conditions and in response to lipopolysaccharide-, poly I:C- and Vibrio tapetis-challenges were also investigated. RpGST\u03c3 demonstrated a differential tissue distribution with robust transcription in gills of normal animals. We explored potential association of GST\u03c3 in cellular defense during bacterial infection and found that in challenged clams, RpGST\u03c3 gene was significantly induced in internal and external tissues, in conjunction with manganese- as well as copper\u2013zinc superoxide dismutase (MnSOD and CuZnSOD) genes. Moreover, the induction was remarkably higher in hemocytes than in gill.

     "abstract": "The oil sands region of northern Alberta represents the world's largest reserves of bitumen, and the accelerated pace of industrial extraction activity has raised concern about the possible impacts on the Athabasca River and its tributaries. An ecotoxicogenomic study was undertaken on Oncorhynchus mykiss trout hepatocytes exposed to extracts of water samples near the oil sand development area, as well as to oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) extracts using the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. The expression of the following genes (mRNA) was monitored to track changes in xenobiotic biotransformation (CYP1A1, CYP3A4, glutathione S-transferase, multi-drug resistance transporter), estrogenicity (estrogen receptor and vitellogenin), oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and metallothionein) and DNA repair activity (DNA ligase). The extent of DNA-aromatic hydrocarbon adducts was also determined in cells by immuno-staining. A comparative analysis of gene expression between the river/lake and OSPW samples revealed that CYP3A4, metallothioneins, DNA ligase and GST genes, were specifically expressed by OSPW. Cells exposed to OSPW, commercial naphthenic acids, and benzo(a)pyrene showed increased polyaromatic hydrocarbon DNA-adducts, as determined by cell immunofluorescence analysis. Other genes were induced by all types of water samples, although the induction potential was stronger in OSPW most of the time (e.g., VTG gene was expressed nearly 15-fold by surface waters from the lake and river samples but increased to a maximum of 31-fold in OSPW). A multivariate discriminant function analysis revealed that the lake and river water samples were well discriminated from the OSPW. The CYP3A4 gene was the most highly expressed gene in cells exposed to OSPW and responded less to the lake or river water in the Athabasca River area. This study identified a suite of gene targets that responded specifically to OSPW extracts, which could serve as toxicogenomic fingerprints of OSPW contamination.",

In the natural environment, selenium exposure to fish occurs primarily in the form of selenomethionine in diet. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the tissue-specific selenium burden and speciation in fish exposed to elevated dietary selenomethionine. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were treated with dietary selenomethionine (40\u00a0\u03bcg g\u2212\u00a01 dry mass) for 2\u00a0weeks, and at the end of the exposure different tissue samples were collected to assess the tissue-specific distribution and speciation of selenium. We used synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to determine the selenium speciation profile. Selenomethionine, selenocysteine and selenocystine were found to be the predominant form of selenium in all of the tissues; however their relative proportion varied across different tissues. In general, the organs primarily involved in selenium handling in fish (e.g., liver, kidney) accumulated a higher percentage of selenocystine. We also found that dietary selenomethionine exposure resulted into a marked increase in selenium burden of all major tissues in fish including the brain. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the tissue-specific distribution and speciation of selenium in fish exposed to selenomethionine via diet.",

In this study, adult zebrafish were exposed to several concentrations of As (0.05, 5, and 15\u00a0mg As/L; Na2HAsO4 as AsV) during 96\u00a0h to evaluate the zebrafish locomotor activity, anxiety, and brain extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis. We showed that 5\u00a0mg/L As is able to promote significant decrease in the locomotor activity as evaluated by the number of line crossings. In addition, animals treated with 5\u00a0mg/L As presented an increase in time spent in the lower zone of the tank test, suggesting an anxiogenic effect. Considering that behavioral parameters, such as anxiety and locomotion, might be modulated by the purinergic system, we also evaluated the ectonucleotidase activities in zebrafish brain after a 96-h As exposure. A significant decrease in ATP, ADP, and AMP hydrolysis was observed at 0.05, 5, and 15\u00a0mg/L when compared to control group. These findings demonstrated that As might affect behavioral parameters and the ectonucleotidase activities in zebrafish, suggesting this enzyme pathway is a target for neurotoxic effects induced by As.",

We measured expression of GSTp2 in embryos exposed to individual and co-exposures of the PAHs benzo[k]fluoranthene (BkF), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), and fluoranthene (FL) as well as 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126). GSTp2 mRNA expression was induced by exposure to BkF, BaP, PCB-126, and BaP\u00a0+\u00a0FL and BkF\u00a0+\u00a0FL co-exposure. A splice junction morpholino was then used to knockdown GSTp2 in developing zebrafish. GSTp2 knockdown exacerbated the toxicity caused by co-exposures to BkF\u00a0+\u00a0FL and BaP\u00a0+\u00a0FL. However, GSTp2 knockdown did not affect PCB-126 toxicity. These results further suggest that pi class GSTs serve a protective function against the synergistic toxicity caused by PAHs in developing zebrafish.",

In the present paper, we studied the presence of cadmium, copper and zinc, metallothioneins (MTs) and glutathione (GSH), and antioxidant enzyme activities in the Antarctic teleosts Trematomus bernacchii and Trematomus newnesi, in order to determine the influence of the peculiar physico-chemical features of the Antarctic marine environment on these physiological defence systems in two species of teleosts. In both of them, cadmium and copper accumulation occurs mostly in the liver. T. bernacchii accumulates zinc mostly in the hepatic tissue, whereas T. newnesi does not show a preferential accumulation site. In addition to the intra-specific analysis, we decided to compare the two species of the Trematomus genus in order to verify if the different feeding habits and motility of these fish affects metal accumulation. Our results show that the liver of T. bernacchii accumulates cadmium and zinc at a higher extent with respect to T. newnesi. Glutathione (GSH) and metallothioneins (MTs) are present in great quantity in the liver of both species. Moreover liver is the tissue which generally showed the highest antioxidant enzyme levels.

PI3-kinase was investigated with the use of wortmannin, a specific covalent inhibitor of PI3-kinase. Moreover, phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), a well-known protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated NADPH oxidase and nitric oxide (NO) synthase stimulator, was also used for elucidating PI3-kinase involvement during the respiratory burst process in challenge hemocytes. According to the results, cells pre-treated with non-toxic concentrations of wortmannin (1 and/or 50\u00a0nM, as revealed by neutral red retention assay) for 15\u00a0min, showed a significant attenuation of cadmium ability (at concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcM) to promote cell death, superoxide anion (O2\u2212) production, NO generation and lipid peroxidation (in terms of malondialdehyde equivalents). On the other hand, wortmannin-treated cells showed a significant attenuation of PMA ability to induce NO generation but not O2\u2212 production. These findings reveal that PI3-kinase could lead to a PKC-independent induction of NO synthase activity in cells faced with pro-oxidants, such as cadmium, while its activation could be fundamental for the regulation of NAPDH oxidase activity, probably through a PKC-dependent signaling pathway.",

Partial mRNA sequences of ABC transporters (ABCB1b, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCG2) were identified, and their tissue distribution patterns evaluated in liver, gill and intestine, showing similarities with other fish and mammals. After 14\u00a0days of water exposure to BaP, ABC transporters mRNA expression was up-regulated, namely ABCC2 in gill (up to 16-fold) and ABCG2 in liver (up to 2-fold) and proximal intestine (up to 7-fold). CYP1A mRNA expression was up-regulated in water exposed animals, with maximum fold inductions of 5, 35 and 155, respectively in liver, gill and proximal intestine. After dietary exposure, intestinal CYP1A mRNA showed a 13-fold increase in exposed animals. No significant changes were seen in ABCB1b, ABCC1 and GST\u03b1 mRNA expression after both routes of exposure to BaP. In conclusion, this study has shown that transcriptional expression of some ABC transporters and CYP1A respond to the presence of BaP, indicating a possible involvement and cooperation in the detoxification process in Nile tilapia.",

So far the pathogenesis of environmental MC-LR toxicity to aquatic organisms has not been fully elucidated. In the present study the accumulation of MC-LR was investigated in various organs/tissues of Cyprinus carpio L. (C. carpio) following exposure to MC-LR for 14\u00a0d at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1 to 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01). Results showed that the presence of MC-LR enhanced toxin accumulation in all investigated organs and the highest accumulation was found in the liver of fish exposed to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of MC-LR. An EPR analysis indicated \u00b7OH intensity in liver was significantly induced at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of MC-LR and then restored when the MC-LR concentration was greater than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. After 14-day exposure, MC-LR (1.0\u201310.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of MC-LR) caused a pronounced promotion of glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity and a depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) content in fish liver, which indicated that GSH was involved in detoxification of MC-LR and the conjugation reaction of MC-LR and GSH occurred. A mild oxidative damage was evidenced by the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) level at 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of MC-LR exposure, but which was restored when the MC-LR concentration was increased to 10.0\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. The responses of antioxidant enzymes and the induction of HSP70 expression might contribute to MC-LR tolerance of C. carpio. However, the protein phosphatase (PP) activities were strikingly inhibited in all treated groups. Thus, the overall toxicity of environmental MC-LR on C. carpio seems to be initiated in the liver via both the ROS pathway and the PP inhibition pathway, and the latter might be more important when ambient MC-LR concentration is greater than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. More importantly, these results can help to support the evaluation on the potential effects of MC-LR under common environmental concentrations.",

In general, treatments enhanced expression of ovary-specific transcription factors, steroidogenic enzymes steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and aromatases while transcripts of tryptophan hydroxylase2 (tph2) and catfish gonadotropin-releasing hormone declined in the brain of all treated groups with maximum reduction in the endosulfan group. Significant reduction of tph2 immunoreactivity in the forebrain/telencephalon\u2013preoptic area endorsed our results. Increased number of pre-vitellogenic and less immature oocytes in the treated groups indicated hastened ovarian growth. Elevated ovarian aromatase activity and plasma estradiol-17\u03b2 levels were noticed in the treated groups with maximum being in the endosulfan group.

HCB-P, RG-HCB and TCDD all induced EROD activity and up-regulated CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 mRNA. Induction was not caused by contamination of HCB with polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans or biphenyls. Based upon a comparison of the EC50 and ECthreshold values for EROD and CYP1A4/5 concentration\u2013response curves, the potency of HCB relative to TCDD was 0.001 in ring-necked pheasant and 0.01 in Japanese quail embryo hepatocytes. Differences in species sensitivity to HCB were found to be mainly dictated by differences in species sensitivity to TCDD rather than differences in the absolute potency of HCB. Consequently, ring-necked pheasant and Japanese quail embryo hepatocytes were found to be equally sensitive to HCB exposure. Species sensitivity comparisons were also made with chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) and revealed that chicken embryo hepatocytes were less responsive to EROD induction (lower maximal response) by HCB compared to the embryo hepatocytes of pheasant and quail.",

An unsupplemented diet was used as control. Hepatic key enzymes of intermediary metabolism and antioxidant status, superoxide dismutase isoenzyme profile, glutathione (total, reduced and oxidized) and oxidative damage markers were determined under normoxia, hypoxia challenge and during normoxia recovery. Dietary white tea inclusion decreased plasma glucose levels under normoxia and seemed to induce an increase in anaerobic pathways as showed by enhanced liver lactate dehydrogenase activity. Hypoxia challenge reversed some of the responses induced by diet tea supplementation. Hypoxia decreased plasma glucose levels, increased glucose 6-P-dehydrogeanse activity, decreased superoxide dismutase activity (especially Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD isoforms) and increased glutathione peroxidase activity in all dietary treatments. Catalase activity during hypoxia varied with dietary treatments and glutathione reductase was not modified. Antioxidant defenses were insufficient to avoid an oxidative stress condition under hypoxia, independently of dietary treatment. In general, pre-challenge values were recovered for almost all parameters within 6\u00a0h recovery time.",

All VpGSTs showed differential response profiles depending on the concentrations of various toxicants and exposure times. More notably, the expressions of VpGSTS2 and VpGSTS3 transcripts were significantly up-regulated in hepatopancreas from Cu and B[a]P-exposed animals, indicating that these two sigma VpGSTs were highly sensitive to Cu and B[a]P exposure.

The amount of valproate to cause 50% mortality (IC50) is found to be developmental stage-specific. The embryos were more sensitive to valproate at early stages of development (Iwamatsu stages 4\u201310) than in the embryos in late stages (Iwamatsu stages 17\u201330). Valproate exposed embryos have microcephaly and disrupted cardiovasculature with delayed vessel circulation, thrombus formation, and slow heart rate. The hatching efficiency is also reduced by valproate exposure due to developmental delay. The mRNA analysis of nine genes belong to oxidative stress (catalase, gsr, gst), neurogenesis (iro3, wnt1, shh, otx2, nlgn3b) and cell cycle regulation (ccna2) have been done. It was observed that the genes belong to oxidative stress remained unaltered after valproate exposure. However, some of the genes belong to neurogenesis (wnt1,shh, otx2 and nlgn3b) and cell cycle (ccna2) showed developmental stage-specific alteration after valproate exposure. This study indicates that valproate is able to induce some of the phenotypic features which are analogous to human fetal valproate syndrome (FVS). Modulation of genes expressed in neural tissues indicates that this fish can be used to analyze the mechanisms of many neurobehavioral disorders like Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in human.",

     "abstract": "Marine biotoxins synthesized by Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) represent one of the most important sources of contamination in marine environments as well as a serious threat to fisheries and aquaculture-based industries in coastal areas. Among these biotoxins Okadaic Acid (OA) is of critical interest as it represents the most predominant Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning biotoxin in the European coasts. Furthermore, OA is a potent tumor promoter with aneugenic and clastogenic effects on the hereditary material, most notably DNA breaks and alterations in DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, a great effort has been devoted to the biomonitoring of OA in the marine environment during the last two decades, mainly based on physicochemical and physiological parameters using mussels as sentinel organisms. However, the molecular genotoxic effects of this biotoxin make chromatin structure a good candidate for an alternative strategy for toxicity assessment with faster and more sensitive evaluation. To date, the development of chromatin-based studies to this purpose has been hampered by the complete lack of information on chromatin of invertebrate marine organisms, especially in bivalve molluscs. Our preliminary results have revealed the presence of histone variants involved in DNA repair and chromatin specialization in mussels and clams. In this work we use this information to put forward a proposal focused on the development of chromatin-based tests for OA genotoxicity in the marine environment. The implementation of such tests in natural populations has the potential to provide an important leap in the biomonitoring of this biotoxin. The outcome of such monitoring may have critical implications for the evaluation of DNA damage in these marine organisms. They will provide as well important tools for the optimization of their harvesting and for the elaboration of additional tests designed to evaluate the safety of their consumption and potential implications for consumer's health.",

The full-length cDNA of LcHSP27 was 1227\u00a0bp, including a 5\u2032-terminal untranslated region (UTR) of 54\u00a0bp, a 3\u2032-terminal UTR of 561\u00a0bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 612\u00a0bp encoding a polypeptide of 203 amino acids.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LcHSP27 was categorized together with the HSP27 obtained from other fish. And a closer phylogenetic relationship of HSP27 was found with HSP22, then HSP30. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated the strongest expression of LcHSP27 in heart. However, expression of LcHSP27 in other examined tissues including muscle, brain, liver, spleen, kidney, gill, and blood was very weak. The impact of temperature and cadmium (Cd2+) stress on LcHSP27 expression was tested in liver and brain. The results showed that the levels of LcHSP27 expression increased significantly after low temperature (19\u00a0\u00b0C) and high temperature (27\u00a0\u00b0C and 31\u00a0\u00b0C) stress both in liver and brain.

Enchytraeids are extensively used in studies of soil ecotoxicology. Ecotoxicogenomic tools have shown to be valuable in nanotoxicity interpretation. A cDNA microarray for Enchytraeus albidus has recently been developed, which was used in this study. We compared the gene expression profiles of E. albidus when exposed to Cu-salt (CuCl2) and Cu-nanoparticles (Cu-NP) spiked soil. Exposure time was 48\u00a0h with a concentration range of 400 to 1000\u00a0mg Cu/kg. There were more down-regulated than up-regulated genes. The number of differently expressed genes (DEG) decreased with increasing concentration for CuCl2 exposure, whereas for Cu-NP, the number did not change. The number of common DEG decreased with increasing concentration. Differences were mainly related to transcripts involved in energy metabolism (e.g. monosaccharide transporting ATPase, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1, cytochrome c). Overall, our results indicated that Cu-salt and Cu-NP exposure induced different gene responses. Indirect estimates of Cu-NP related ion-release indicated little or no free Cu2+ activity in soil solutions. Hence, it was concluded that the Cu-NP effects were probably caused by the nanoparticles themselves and not by released ions.",

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate was higher for succinate as substrate compared with those of glutamate, malate and pyruvate. Complex I and complex II mediated respirations were higher at low salinity (10\u00a0ppt) than high salinity (17\u00a0ppt and 35\u00a0ppt). Although activities of electron transport chain enzymes particularly complexes I (EC 1.6.5.3), II (EC 1.3.99.1) and II\u2013III (EC 1.3.2.1) were elevated linearly in response to salinity treatment, activity of complex V (ATPase, EC 3.6.1.34) was decreased at 35\u00a0ppt salinity. However, ATPase activity was higher at 17\u00a0ppt salinity in comparison to 10\u00a0ppt and 17\u00a0ppt salinity. Results of the experiment suggest that high salinity (35\u00a0ppt) causes hypoxic state in mitochondria of mud crabs. Hypoxic condition induced by high salinity was accompanied with increased hydrogen peroxide production resulting oxidative stress in mitochondria of crabs. A possible mechanism of hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species generation and OS due to salinity stress in the crabs is discussed.",

     "abstract": "The present study investigated the mechanisms of intestinal cadmium (Cd) uptake and efflux, using isolated enterocytes of freshwater rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the experimental model. The apical uptake of free Cd2+ in the enterocytes was a saturable and high-affinity transport process. Both zinc (Zn2+) and iron (Fe2+) inhibited cellular Cd2+ uptake through a competitive interaction, suggesting that Cd2+ enters enterocytes via both Zn2+ (e.g., ZIP8) and Fe2+ (e.g., DMT1) transport pathways. Cellular Cd2+ uptake increased in the presence of HCO3\u2212, which resembled the function of mammalian ZIP8. Cellular Cd2+ uptake was unaffected by Ca2+, indicating that Cd2+ does not compete with Ca2+ for apical uptake. Interestingly, Cd uptake was influenced by the presence of l-cysteine, and under the exposure condition where Cd(Cys)+ was the predominant Cd species, cellular Cd uptake rate increased with the increased concentration of Cd(Cys)+. The kinetic analysis indicated that the uptake of Cd(Cys)+ occurs through a low capacity transport mechanism relative to that of free Cd2+. In addition, Cd efflux from the enterocytes decreased in the presence of an ATPase inhibitor (orthovanadate), suggesting the existence of an ATPase-coupled extrusion process. Overall, our findings provide new mechanistic insights into the intestinal Cd transport in freshwater fish.",

These toxins are able to induce hepatotoxicity in several organisms mainly through the inhibition of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A and oxidative stress generation. Since recent evidence shows that MCs can either accumulate in brain or alter behavior patterns of fish species, in this study we tested the in vitro and in vivo effects of MC-LR at different concentrations on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in zebrafish brain. In vivo studies showed that 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L MC-LR led to a significant increase in the AChE activity (27%) when zebrafish were exposed to the toxin dissolved in water, but did not cause any significant changes when injected intraperitoneally. In addition, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L MC-LR exposure also increased ache mRNA levels in zebrafish brain. The in vitro assays did not reveal any significant changes in AChE activity. These findings provide the first evidence that brain AChE is another potential target for MCs and suggest that the observed increases in AChE enzymatic activity and in ache transcript levels after MC-LR exposure depend, at least partially, on branchial uptake or ingestion.",

     "abstract": "The polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a group of brominated flame retardants. Human health concerns of these agents have largely centered upon their potential to elicit reproductive and developmental effects. Of the various congeners, BDE 49 (2,2\u2032,4,5\u2032-tetrabromodiphenyl ether) has been poorly studied, despite the fact that it is often detected in the tissues of fish and wildlife species. Furthermore, we have previously shown that BDE 49 is a metabolic debromination product of BDE 99 hepatic metabolism in salmon, carp and trout, underscoring the need for a better understanding of biological effects. In the current study, we investigated the developmental toxicity of BDE 49 using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo larval model. Embryo and larval zebrafish were exposed to BDE 49 at either 5 hours post fertilization (hpf) or 24\u00a0hpf and monitored for developmental and neurotoxicity. Exposure to BDE 49 at concentrations of 4i\u03bc\u201332\u00a0\u03bcM caused a dose-dependent loss in survivorship at 6\u00a0days post fertilization (dpf). Morphological impairments were observed prior to the onset of mortality, the most striking of which included severe dorsal curvatures of the tail. The incidence of dorsal tail curvatures was dose and time dependent. Exposure to BDE 49 caused cardiac toxicity as evidenced by a significant reduction in zebrafish heart rates at 6\u00a0dpf but not earlier, suggesting that cardiac toxicity was non-specific and associated with physiological stress. Neurobehavioral injury from BDE 49 was evidenced by an impairment of touch\u2013escape responses observed at 5\u00a0dpf. Our results indicate that BDE 49 is a developmental toxicant in larval zebrafish that can cause morphological abnormalities and adversely affect neurobehavior. The observed toxicities from BDE 49 were similar in scope to those previously reported for the more common tetrabrominated congener, BDE 47, and also for other lower brominated PBDEs, suggest that these compounds may share similarities in risk to aquatic species.",

The putative amino acid sequences of these ZP gene isoforms contain the typical trefoil motif and a ZP domain. These five G. rarus ZP gene isoforms were named as grZPB.1, grZPB.2, grZPB.3, grZPB.4 and grZPB.5. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis indicated that all these ZP mRNA isoforms were exclusively expressed in ovary.

The results indicate that induction by 0.1\u20131\u00a0nM EE2 on mRNA expression of the grZPB isoforms is weaker than for vitellogenin. 4-NP exposures at three concentrations had differential effects on the grZPBs.

Embryos were exposed to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of 1.5\u00a0nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) possessing negatively charged 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MES) or neutral 2-(2-(2-mercaptoethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol (MEEE) ligands or 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of the AuNPs possessing positively charged trimethylammoniumethanethiol (TMAT).

A subset of embryos that were exposed to 1.5\u00a0nm MES- and TMAT\u2013AuNPs during development from 6 to 120\u00a0h post fertilization was raised to adulthood. Behavioral abnormalities and the number of survivors into adulthood were evaluated at 122\u00a0days post fertilization. We found that both treatments induced abnormal startle behavior following a tap stimulus. However, the MES\u2013AuNPs exposed group also exhibited abnormal adult behavior in the light and had a lower survivorship into adulthood. This study demonstrates that acute, developmental exposure to 1.5\u00a0nm MES- and TMAT\u2013AuNPs, two NPs differing only in the functional group, affects larval behavior, with behavioral effects persisting into adulthood.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the sublethal effects of iron chloride to the larvae of the lace coral Pocillopora damicornis by measuring a suit of oxidative-stress biomarkers. The larvae were exposed to a range of sublethal concentrations of iron chloride (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100\u00a0ppm) for seven days. With reference to oxidative stress biomarkers, the no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) and the lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of iron chloride were observed to be 0.01 and 100\u00a0ppm respectively. At the end of the seventh day the antioxidant status of the larvae was evaluated by the levels of glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GR), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), in both experimental and control groups. For the quantification of cellular oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation (LPO) activity was determined in the same and the extent of DNA damage was assessed by the expression of DNA apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. Iron chloride exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of GSH and GPX and induction of GR, GST, LPO, and DNA-AP sites in the P. damicornis larvae when compared to the control group. The oxidative stress biomarkers of the larvae exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10\u00a0ppm of iron chloride did not show any significant overall differences when compared to the control group. However the activities of LPO, GSH, GPX, GR, GST and DNA-AP in the larval group exposed to 100\u00a0ppm of iron chloride exhibited statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002, 0.003, 0.002, 0.002, 0.005 and 0.007) differences when compared to the control group.

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic waterborne copper (Cu) exposure on the acute stress-induced cortisol response and associated physiological consequences in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Trout were exposed to 30\u00a0\u03bcg Cu/L in moderately hard water (120\u00a0mg/L as CaCO3) for 40\u00a0days, following which time the acute cortisol response was examined with a series of stressors. At 40\u00a0days, a 65% increase in Cu was observed in the gill, but no accumulation was observed in the liver, brain or head kidney. Stressors such as air exposure or confinement did not elicit an increase in circulating cortisol levels for Cu-exposed fish, in contrast to controls. However, this inhibitory effect on the acute cortisol response appeared to have few implications on the ability of Cu-exposed fish to maintain ion and carbohydrate homeostasis. For example, plasma Na+, Ca2+ and glucose levels as well as hepatic glycogen levels were the same post-stress in control and Cu-exposed fish. Trout were also challenged with exposure to 50% seawater for 48\u00a0h, where Cu-exposed trout maintained plasma Na+, glucose and hepatic glycogen levels. However, Cu-exposed fish experienced decreased plasma K+ levels throughout the Cu exposure and stress tests. In conclusion, chronic Cu exposure resulted in the abolition of an acute cortisol response post-stress. There was no Cu accumulation in the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis (HPI axis) suggesting this was not a direct toxic effect of Cu on the cortisol regulatory pathway. However, the lack of an acute cortisol response in Cu-exposed fish did not impair the ability of the fish to maintain ion and carbohydrate homeostasis. This effect on cortisol may be a strategy to reduce costs during the chronic stress of Cu exposure, and not endocrine disruption as a result of toxic injury.",

To identify and characterize OGG1 gene (TJ-OGG1) in the copepod Tigriopus japonicus, the full-length cDNA sequence, genomic structure, and promoter region was analyzed. In addition, to investigate transcriptional change of TJ-OGG1 mRNA under oxidative stress conditions, T. japonicus were exposed to environmental oxidative inducers, H2O2, UV-B, and heavy metals (Cd, Cu, and Zn), respectively. The full-length cDNA of TJ-OGG1 gene was 1708\u00a0bp in length, encoding 343 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequences of TJ-OGG1 showed a 56% similarity with human. Two conserved motifs (HhH and PVD loop) and two conserved residues (lysine and aspartic acid) in active sites were also observed. TJ-OGG1 genome structure contained six exons and five introns and putative transcription factor binding sites such as Nrf-2, p53, ERE-half sites, and XRE were detected on the promoter region. TJ-OGG1 mRNA level was increased at approximately three-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 1\u00a0mM and approximately 4-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) at 10\u00a0mM of H2O2, respectively. UV-B enhanced the expression of TJ-OGG1 mRNA at 15\u00a0kJ/m2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and more (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In a time-course experiment, TJ-OGG1 gene was highly transcribed within 12\u00a0h after exposure of 10\u00a0kJ/m2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and 20\u00a0kJ/m2 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The expression of TJ-OGG1 mRNA after exposure to Cu and Cd for 96\u00a0h was significantly up-regulated at 0.1\u00a0\u03bcg/L and then remarkably reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Their transcript levels did not change at low dose (0.1 and 1\u00a0\u03bcg/L) but were dose-dependently down-regulated at high dose (10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L). These findings suggest that H2O2, UV-B, and heavy metals induce oxidative stress and generate oxidatively damaged DNA. Consequently, the enhanced TJ-OGG1 gene expression would be associated with active involvement of TJ-OGG1 gene in DNA repair process as a cellular protection mechanism. This is the first report on the cloning and characterization of OGG1 gene in aquatic animals. This study is helpful for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cellular protection against various environmental oxidative stress inducers such as UV-B and heavy metals in aquatic invertebrates.",

Furthermore, treatment of cells with NA or CdCl2 reduced the relative levels of proteasome chymotrypsin (CT)-like activity compared to control. Interestingly, pretreatment of cells with the HSP accumulation inhibitor, KNK437, prior to NA or CdCl2 exposure decreased the relative levels of ubiquitinated protein as well as HSP30 and HSP70. A similar finding was made with ubiquitinated protein induced by proteasomal inhibitors, MG132 and celastrol, known to induce HSP accumulation in A6 cells. However, the NA- or CdCl2-induced decrease in proteasome CT-like activity was not altered by KNK437 pretreatment.

Regarding the antioxidant enzymes, exposure to 0.01\u00a0mg Cd/L significantly increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased the activity of glutathione reductase (GR) in liver, independently of heat stress. In gills, exposure to 21\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in a significantly increased activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), whereas the activity of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was significantly reduced as compared to fish exposed to 15\u00a0\u00b0C.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 family members participate in xenobiotic transformation as a detoxification mechanism. We have characterized a CYP gene, assigned to the 4G family, in Chironomus riparius, a reference organism in aquatic toxicology. Due to the potential interest of CYP genes and P450 proteins for monitoring pollution effects at the molecular level, the alterations in the pattern of expression of this gene, induced by different xenobiotics, were analyzed. Different compounds, such as the biocide tributyltin (TBTO) and two other well-known endocrine disruptors, nonylphenol (NP) and bisphenol A (BPA), were tested at different concentrations and acute exposures. Upregulation of the CrCYP4G gene was found after exposures to TBTO (1\u00a0ng/L 24\u00a0h\u20130.1\u00a0ng/L 96\u00a0h) and, as measured by RT-PCR mRNA quantification, its level was up to twofold that of controls. However, in contrast, NP (1, 10, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L, 24\u00a0h) and BPA (0.5\u00a0mg/L 24\u00a0h\u20133\u00a0mg/L 96\u00a0h) downregulated the gene (by around a half of the control level) suggesting that this gene responds specifically to particular chemicals in the environment. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzymatic activity was also evaluated for each condition. A fairly good correlation was found with CYP4G gene behavior, as it was activated by TBTO (96\u00a0h), but inhibited by NP and BPA (24\u00a0h). Only the higher concentration of BPA tested activated GST, whereas it inhibited CYP4G activity. The results show that different xenobiotics can induce distinct responses in the detoxification pathway, suggesting multiple xenobiotic transduction mechanisms. This work confirms that specific P450 codifying genes, as well as GST enzyme activities, could be suitable biomarkers for ecotoxicological studies.",

Accumulated Cu concentrations in P. nuntia increased in a time-dependent manner. Intracellular ROS reached high levels 6\u00a0h after exposure in P. nuntia with an increase of GST activity and glutathione (GSH) content. Particularly, GSH in polychaetes showed a positive correlation with Cu contents accumulated in P. nuntia. Messenger RNA expressions of GST sigma and GST omega showed relatively high expressions at 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L of Cu exposure, even though the moderate increase of rest of GST isoforms was also observed. Also regarding long-term exposure, we reared P. nuntia in sediments for 15\u00a0days, and found that there was an obvious increase of Pn-GSTs, Pn-CAT, and Pn-MT genes with elevated concentrations of Cu and Cd in polychaete body, compared to initial levels, suggesting that P. nuntia in sediment was affected by metals as well as by other organic pollutants to induce oxidative stress genes and enzymes. These findings suggest that oxidative stress is a potential modulator of defense system of P. nuntia.

During the two periods examined, the chromaffin tissue reacted differently to nonylphenol. During December\u2013January, the numeric ratio of norepinephrine granules to epinephrine granules, and the epinephrine serum levels, increased, suggesting the stimulation of epinephrine release.

Recently, extensive gene information has been identified from the intertidal copepod, Tigriopus japonicus. Here, we developed a 55\u00a0K (54,254 genes) oligomicroarray and tested its usefulness to identify the effect of single dose of UV-B irradiation (12\u00a0kJ/m2) on transcriptomes of the copepod T. japonicus. A total of 35,361 spots were identified to be significantly modulated on the 55\u00a0K oligomicroarray by hierarchical clustering after exposure to UV-B irradiation over 48\u00a0h (6, 12, 24, and 48\u00a0h). Of them, 1300 and 588 genes were observed to be up-regulated and down-regulated at all time points, respectively. Particularly, it was observed that several genes involved in DNA repair mechanism were significantly modulated in the UV-B-exposed T. japonicus by microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. In detail, UV-B irradiation specifically up-regulated some genes in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), base excision repair (BER), and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways. On the other hand, a majority of down-regulated genes were representatives for the nucleotide excision repair (NER) mechanism. These results demonstrated that DNA damage would be induced by UV-B irradiation in this species, resulting in reliable induction or repression of various DNA repair mechanism on UV-B-induced DNA damage. In this report, we suggest that a high density microarray-based approach for risk assessment of UV-B irradiation would be useful to elucidate the mechanistic analysis in a non-model organism. This study could also provide a better understanding of molecular mechanisms of cellular protection against UV-B-induced stress.",

Administration of sGnRH increased proliferation and mRNA levels of a proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, in trout leucocytes. Superoxide production in zymosan-stimulated phagocytic leucocytes was also increased by sGnRH in a dose-related manner from 0.01 to 100\u00a0nM. There was no significant effect of sGnRH on mRNA levels of growth hormone (GH) expressed in trout phagocytic leucocytes. Immunoneutralization of GH by addition of anti-salmon GH serum into the medium could not block the stimulatory effect of sGnRH on superoxide production.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the tissue distribution patterns of PPARs and their ligand specificities in grass carp. We cloned three PPAR isotypes of the species and evaluated their organ distribution patterns using real-time PCR. Through analyzing the deduced amino acid sequences identities between the products cloned in grass carp and those described in other species, we concluded that the same type of PPAR amino acid sequences in different species were with high homology, and different subtypes of PPAR in the same species were with low homology. The mRNA constitutive expression level of PPAR\u03b1 predominated in the liver, but was weak in other tested tissues. PPAR\u03b2 was present in all tested organs, and particularly abundant in heart, liver and muscle. PPAR\u03b3 was only detected in the liver, and to a lesser extent in brain, muscle and visceral adipose tissue. Grass carp were intraperitoneally injected with 50\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 body mass (bw) dose of clofibrate, 42\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 bw dose of 2-bromo palmitate and 1\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 bw dose of 15-deoxy-\u039412,14 prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), respectively, and the relative changes of the mRNA abundance of PPARs in liver were analyzed by real-time PCR. Clofibrate was able to increase the expressions of both PPAR\u03b1 and \u03b2, but was not able to for PPAR\u03b3. 2-bromo palmitate could affect the expressions of both PPAR\u03b2 and \u03b3, but was not able to for PPAR\u03b1. 15d-PGJ2 was able to induce PPAR\u03b2 expression, but PPAR\u03b1 and \u03b3 were not enhanced.

Determination of protein carbonyls (PCs) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, monitoring of activity of antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), as well as measuring of the mRNA expression of CAT and SOD were used as markers of the OS. Injection of the Manse-AKH (5\u00a0pmol per individual) reversed the OS status by mitigation of PCs formation and by stimulation of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) activity. The CAT and SOD mRNA expression was significantly suppressed after the Manse-AKH injection while activity of these enzymes was not affected.

Differences in glutathione-S-transferase activity in the liver and vitellogenin-like proteins in the serum were also showed between B and Z control groups. Common effects of pesticides were related to a decrease in GSH, an increase in O2 production, ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity and hepatosomatic index. Apollo provoked particular elevation of MT\u2013SH/MT\u2013Me ratio.

The fish were exposed during sexual differentiation and development from 0 to 60\u00a0days post hatch (dph).

NOEC/LOEC and ECx designs were compared to optimize the test approach. Results show that both species are highly sensitive to prochloraz during sexual development. They respond by skewing of the sex ratio towards male phenotype and by a VTG decline in females. The NOEC/LOEC approach is preferred because sex ratio is difficult to analyze with a regression model. The mean NOEC/LOEC for prochloraz on the sex ratio was 43.3/134\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 101/293\u00a0\u03bcg/L for zebrafish and fathead minnow, respectively.

The test media consisted of natural waters from across North America, varying in pertinent water chemistry parameters including dissolved organic carbon (DOC), calcium, pH and total CO2. Chronic toxicity was assessed using reproductive endpoints for C. dubia and P. rapida while growth was assessed for L. stagnalis, with chronic toxicity varying markedly according to water chemistry. A multi-linear regression (MLR) approach was used to identify the relative importance of individual water chemistry components in predicting chronic Pb toxicity for each species. DOC was an integral component of MLR models for C. dubia and L. stagnalis, but surprisingly had no predictive impact on chronic Pb toxicity for P. rapida. Furthermore, sodium and total CO2 were also identified as important factors affecting C. dubia toxicity; no other factors were predictive for L. stagnalis. The Pb toxicity of P. rapida was predicted by calcium and pH. The predictive power of the C. dubia and L. stagnalis MLR models was generally similar to that of the current C. dubia BLM, with R2 values of 0.55 and 0.82 for the respective MLR models, compared to 0.45 and 0.79 for the respective BLMs. In contrast the BLM poorly predicted P. rapida toxicity (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.19), as compared to the MLR (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.92). The cross species variability in the effects of water chemistry, especially with respect to rotifers, suggests that cross species modeling of invertebrate chronic Pb toxicity using a C. dubia model may not always be appropriate.",

By virtue of their transparent chorions, imaging of normal and abnormal development can be detected and related to exposure or to alterations due to environmental factors. However, the detection of changes at sub-individual levels of organization is hampered by time required to detect important events within cells and tissues of affected organisms. We describe herein development of a highly cost effective embryo chip enabling stringent inter-individual comparisons and multiplex detection in embryos and eleutheroembryos. As a proof of principle we examine cell proliferation and controlled cell death in normoxic and hypoxic conditions and relate these to tissue turnover in individual organisms. Coupled with a recently developed whole adult animal platform, we can now move beyond the common approach focusing on single target organ to the detection and characterization of systemic phenomena (syndromes) affecting the organism. Taken together, we can now determine adult consequences of early life stage exposure and assess ability of exposed individuals to respond to stresses superimposed along the axis of time.",

     "abstract": "Zinc is a micronutrient important in several biological processes including growth and development. We have limited knowledge on the impact of maternal zinc deficiency on zinc and zinc regulatory mechanisms in the developing embryo due to a lack of in vivo experimental models that allow us to directly study the effects of maternal zinc on embryonic development following implantation. To overcome this barrier, we have proposed to use zebrafish as a model organism to study the impact of zinc during development. The goal of the current study was to profile the mRNA expression of all the known zinc transporter genes in the zebrafish across embryonic and larval development and to quantify the embryonic zinc concentrations at these corresponding developmental time points. The SLC30A zinc transporter family (ZnT) and SLC39A family, Zir-,Irt-like protein (ZIP) zinc transporter proteins were profiled in zebrafish embryos at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 120\u00a0h post fertilization to capture expression patterns from a single cell through full development. We observed consistent embryonic zinc levels, but differential expression of several zinc transporters across development. These results suggest that zebrafish is an effective model organism to study the effects of zinc deficiency and further investigation is underway to identify possible molecular pathways that are dysregulated with maternal zinc deficiency.",

Our laboratory is currently characterizing the disease progression in medaka using fluorescent reporter systems that are introduced into engineered strains of M. marinum. While conducting these studies we observed differences in growth, plasmid stability, and virulence depending on which fluorescent reporter construct was present. Here, we describe large negative effects on virulence and organ colonization that occurred with a commonly used plasmid pG13, that expresses green fluorescent protein (Gfp). The studies presented here, indicate that Gfp over-expression was the basis for the reduced virulence in this reporter construct. We also show that these negative effects could be reversed by significantly reducing Gfp expression levels or by using low-expression constructs of Rfp.",

Although high-throughput processing has been widely applied for sperm cryopreservation in livestock for decades, application in biomedical model fishes is still in the concept-development stage because of the limited sample volumes and the biological characteristics of fish sperm. High-throughput processing in livestock was developed based on advances made in the laboratory and was scaled up for increased processing speed, capability for mass production, and uniformity and quality assurance. Cryopreserved germplasm combined with high-throughput processing constitutes an independent industry encompassing animal breeding, preservation of genetic diversity, and medical research. Currently, there is no specifically engineered system available for high-throughput of cryopreserved germplasm for aquatic species.

Currently, 58 well-pedigreed lines exist among 24 Xiphophorus species housed as live animals at the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center. The technique of sperm cryopreservation has been applied to preserve these valuable genetic resources, and production of offspring has been reported with cryopreserved sperm in two species (X. helleri and X. couchianus). The goal of this research was to establish protocols for sperm cryopreservation and artificial insemination that yield live young in X. maculatus, a widely used research species. The objectives were to: 1) collect basic biological characteristics of males, and quantify the sperm production yield after crushing of dissected testis; 2) cryopreserve sperm from X. maculatus by adapting as necessary the protocols for sperm cryopreservation of X. helleri and X. couchianus; 3) use cryopreserved sperm to inseminate virgin females of X maculatus and other species (X. helleri and X. couchianus), and 4) compare experimental trials over a 3-year period to identify opportunities for improving female fecundity. In total, 117 males were used in this study with a standard length of 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0cm (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD), body weight of 0.474\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.149\u00a0g, and dissected testis weight of 7.1\u00a0 \u00b1\u00a03.7\u00a0mg.

Male-to-male variation (1\u201370%) was observed in post-thaw motility despite little variation in motility before freezing (60\u201390%) or genetic variation (~\u00a0100 generations of sib-mating). Comparisons of biological factors of males did not have significant correlations with the production of live young, and the influence of females on production of young was identified from the comparison of artificial insemination over 3\u00a0years.

A contributing factor to this dilemma, especially given our current understanding of the importance of UV light in melanoma etiology, is the lack of quality UV-inducible melanoma animal models. In this study we elaborate on the capability of UV light to induce cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM) in Xiphophorus fishes, which were previously found to develop melanomas after acute neonatal UVB irradiation. In two separate tumorigenesis experiments, we exposed adult Xiphophorus hybrids to either acute UVB irradiations (5 consecutive daily treatments) or chronic solar irradiations (continuous UVA/UVB treatment for 9\u00a0months). Acute adult UVB irradiation resulted in the significant induction of melanomas, and moreover, this induction rate is equivalent to that of animals exposed to acute neonatal UVB irradiation. This study represents the first evidence that acute adult UVB irradiation, in the absence of any early life exposures, induces CMM. Similar to the findings conducted on other divergent melanoma models, including HGF/SF transgenic mice and Monodelphis domestica, prolonged chronic solar UV was not a factor in melanomagenesis.",

     "abstract": "The Xiphophorus melanoma model has gained attention in biomedical research as a genetic model for tumor formation. Melanoma development in interspecific hybrids of Xiphophorus is connected to pigment cell specific overexpression of the mutationally activated receptor tyrosine kinase Xmrk. In purebred fish the oncogenic function of xmrk is suppressed by a so far unknown regulator locus R. To test the hypothesis that R is involved in transcriptional regulation of xmrk and consequently acts upstream of the xmrk signal, we performed a quantitative analysis of xmrk transcript levels in normal and melanoma tissues of different Xiphophorus genotypes carrying either a highly tumorigenic or a non-tumorigenic xmrk allele. Our results demonstrate that expression of the tumorigenic xmrk allele is highly increased in malignant melanomas compared to benign lesions, macromelanophore spots, and healthy skin. Transcription of the non-tumorigenic xmrk allele in pigment cells, in contrast, is not influenced by the presence or absence of R. These findings strongly indicate that differential transcriptional regulation of the xmrk promoter determines the tumorigenic potential of xmrk alleles in the Xiphophorus melanoma system, thereby supporting the hypothesis that R suppresses the oncogenic function of xmrk on the level of transcriptional control.",

     "abstract": "Research investigating telomere lengths and telomerase expression in vertebrates has progressively become important due to the association of these two biological endpoints with cellular aging and cancer in humans. Studies that rely upon the traditional use of laboratory mice have been faced with limitations largely due to inbred mice possessing large telomeres and ubiquitous expression of telomerase. Recently, a number of small fish species have been shown to provide potentially informative models for examining the role of telomeres and telomerase within intact vertebrate animals. Xiphophorus fishes represent a new world live-bearing genus that has not previously been assessed for telomere length or telomerase expression. To add to the knowledge base of telomere and telomerase biology in vertebrates we assessed telomere length and telomerase expression among several species of Xiphophorus. The telomere lengths in several organs (gill, brain, eyes, testis, ovary and liver) in three species (Xiphophorus hellerii, Xiphophorus maculatus, Xiphophorus couchianus) and also in F1 interspecies hybrids were approximately 2\u20136\u00a0kb. This size was consistent within the same organs of the same species, as well as between species and F1 hybrids. Despite possessing relatively short telomere lengths compared to humans, the consistency of size among Xiphophorus species and organs may allow experimental detection of telomere shortening.The relative expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression levels of TERT was measured in seven organs (ovary, testis, liver, gill, brain, heart, skin) from X. maculatus, X. hellerii and in control and ultraviolet light (UVB) exposed skin samples from X. maculatus, X. hellerii, and F1 interspecies hybrids. TERT gene expression was significantly higher in ovary and testis, while all other organs showed low relative TERT expression. Detectable increases in TERT expression were found in skin samples upon UVB exposure. Our findings suggest that Xiphophorus may serve as a suitable model for future studies investigating the association of telomere length and telomerase expression in regard to aging and disease.",

Studying allelic specific gene expression (ASGE) within interspecies hybrids provides a unique opportunity to reveal underlying mechanisms of genetic variation. Using Xiphophorus interspecies hybrid fishes and high-throughput next generation sequencing technology, we were able to assess variations between two closely related vertebrate species, Xiphophorus maculatus and Xiphophorus couchianus, and their F1 interspecies hybrids. We constructed transcriptome-wide SNP polymorphism sets between two highly inbred X. maculatus lines (JP 163 A and B), and between X. maculatus and a second species, X. couchianus. The X. maculatus JP 163 A and B parental lines have been separated in the laboratory for \u2248\u00a070\u00a0years and we were able to identify SNPs at a resolution of 1 SNP per 49\u00a0kb of transcriptome. In contrast, SNP polymorphisms between X. couchianus and X. maculatus species, which diverged \u2248\u00a05\u201310 million years ago, were identified about every 700\u00a0bp. Using 6524 transcripts with identified SNPs between the two parental species (X. maculatus and X. couchianus), we mapped RNA-seq reads to determine ASGE within F1 interspecies hybrids. We developed an in silico X. couchianus transcriptome by replacing 90,788 SNP bases for X. maculatus transcriptome with the consensus X. couchianus SNP bases and provide evidence that this procedure overcomes read mapping biases. Employment of the in silico reference transcriptome and tolerating 5 mismatches during read mapping allow direct assessment of ASGE in the F1 interspecies hybrids. Overall, these results show that Xiphophorus is a tractable vertebrate experimental model to investigate how genetic variations that occur during speciation may affect gene interactions and the regulation of gene expression.",

To develop a new more powerful model system, we have pursued methods to establish and expand cultures of primary lung cell types and reconstituted tissues from marine mammals. What little is known about the physiology of the deep-sea diving pygmy sperm whale (PSW), Kogia breviceps, comes primarily from stranding events that occur along the coast of the southeastern United States. Thus, development of a method for preserving live tissues and retrieving live cells from deceased stranded individuals was initiated. This report documents successful cryopreservation of PSW lung tissue. We established in vitro cultures of primary lung cell types from tissue fragments that had been cryopreserved several months earlier at the stranding event. Dissociation of cryopreserved lung tissues readily provides a variety of primary cell types that, to varying degrees, can be expanded and further studied/manipulated in cell culture. In addition, PSW-specific molecular markers have been developed that permitted the monitoring of fibroblast, alveolar type II, and vascular endothelial cell types. Reconstitution of 3-D cultures of lung tissues with these cell types is now underway. This novel system may facilitate the development of rare or disease-specific lung tissue models (e.g., to test causes of PSW stranding events and lead to improved treatments for pulmonary hypertension or reperfusion injury in humans).

     "abstract": "The non-l-glutamate (l-Glu) receptor component of d-aspartate (d-Asp) currents in Aplysia californica buccal S cluster (BSC) neurons was studied with whole cell voltage clamp to differentiate it from receptors activated by other well-known agonists of the Aplysia nervous system and investigate modulatory mechanisms of d-Asp currents associated with synaptic plasticity. Acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin (5-HT) activated whole cell excitatory currents with similar current voltage relationships to d-Asp. These currents, however, were pharmacologically distinct from d-Asp. ACh currents were blocked by hexamethonium (C6) and tubocurarine (d-TC), while d-Asp currents were unaffected. 5-HT currents were blocked by granisetron and methysergide (MES), while d-Asp currents were unaffected. Conversely, while (2S,3R)-1-(Phenanthren-2-carbonyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid(PPDA) blocked d-Asp currents, it had no effect on ACh or 5-HT currents. Comparison of the charge area described by currents induced by ACh or 5-HT separately from, or with, d-Asp suggests activation of distinct receptors by all 3 agonists. Charge area comparisons with l-Glu, however, suggested some overlap between l-Glu and d-Asp receptors. Ten minute exposure to 5-HT induced facilitation of d-Asp-evoked responses in BSC neurons. This effect was mimicked by phorbol ester, suggesting that protein kinase C (PKC) was involved.",

     "abstract": "Over the past several decades, a number of fish species, including the zebrafish, medaka, and platyfish/swordtail, have become important models for human health and disease. Despite the increasing prevalence of these and other fish species in research, methods for health maintenance and the management of diseases in laboratory populations of these animals are underdeveloped. There is a growing realization that this trend must change, especially as the use of these species expands beyond developmental biology and more towards experimental applications where the presence of underlying disease may affect the physiology animals used in experiments and potentially compromise research results. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop, improve, and implement strategies for managing health and disease in aquatic research facilities. The purpose of this review is to report the proceedings of a workshop entitled \u201cAnimal Health and Disease Management in Research Animals\u201d that was recently held at the 5th Aquatic Animal Models for Human Disease in September 2010 at Corvallis, Oregon to discuss the challenges involved with moving the field forward on this front.",

At this meeting, discussion at a workshop entitled Bioinformatics and Computational Biology with Web-based Resources (20 September 2010) led to an important conclusion: Aquatic model research using feral and experimental fish, in combination with web-based access to annotated anatomical atlases and toxicological databases, yields data that advance our understanding of human gene function, and can be used to facilitate environmental management and drug development. We propose here that the effects of genes and environment are best appreciated within an anatomical context \u2014 the specifically affected cells and organs in the whole animal. We envision the use of automated, whole-animal imaging at cellular resolution and computational morphometry facilitated by high-performance computing and automated entry into toxicological databases, as anchors for genetic and toxicological data, and as connectors between human and model system data. These principles should be applied to both laboratory and feral fish populations, which have been virtually irreplaceable sentinals for environmental contamination that results in human morbidity and mortality. We conclude that automation, database generation, and web-based accessibility, facilitated by genomic/transcriptomic data and high-performance and cloud computing, will potentiate the unique and potentially key roles that aquatic models play in advancing systems biology, drug development, and environmental risk management.",

     "abstract": "Fundulus heteroclitus, the mummichog or Atlantic killifish, is the dominant small-bodied fish species of the east coast estuaries and salt marshes of Canada and the USA, where it is present as two subspecies, the northern F. h. macrolepidotus and the southern F. h. heteroclitus. Recently identified as the premier teleost model in environmental biology, the species has long been of value in understanding evolved tolerance to toxicants and more lately in adding to our knowledge about reproductive effects of environmental endocrine disruptors. The body of literature on F. heteroclitus ovarian physiology and reproduction, from both field and laboratory studies, provides the foundation for present work focused on understanding the reproductive effects and modes of action of environmental toxicants. In this paper, we review the environmental and endocrine factors controlling ovarian and reproductive cycling in F. heteroclitus, noting specifics related to field and laboratory studies on the two subspecies as well as key research gaps compared to other fish species. We also summarize recent development of methodologies to study the effects of environmental contaminants on endocrine signalling and egg production in F. heteroclitus. Continued efforts to progress both our fundamental understanding of reproductive physiology in mummichog, coupled with studies focused on the modes of action of environmental contaminants, have high potential to further develop this teleost model. While the model may presently lag behind those based on other species of fish, the unique biochemical and physiological adaptations which allow F. heteroclitus to adapt to changing environmental and toxic conditions provide a valuable experimental system for comparative physiologists, ecotoxicologists and evolutionary biologists.",

We quantified changes in the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX1) enzyme whose transcription is induced by PPARs. In addition, we analyzed gene expression patterns for enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase: SOD, catalase: CAT and glutathione peroxidase: GPx). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were analyzed as a measure for lipid peroxidation. Juvenile Atlantic salmon were repeatedly force-fed food spiked with PFOA or PFOS at 0.2\u00a0mg/kg, and samples were collected after 0, 2, 5 and 8\u00a0days and after a 7\u00a0days recovery period. Our data showed that exposure of salmon to PFOS or PFOA produced changes (either increased or decreased) in mRNA expression for PPARs, ACOX1, oxidative stress responses and lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and these responses showed marked organ differences, associated with tissue bioaccumulation patterns and dependent on exposure time. Given that a classical reaction during reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced damage involves the peroxidation of lipids, our study demonstrates that salmon continuously exposed to dietary PFOS or PFOA dose showed alteration in peroxisomal responses and oxidative stress responses, with higher severity in the kidney, compared to liver. Overall, our data suggest that ROS-mediated oxidative damage maybe a significant and putative toxic effect of PFOA and PFOS in fish as has been reported in mammals.",

Male tilapia were exposed to 44.45\u00a0\u03bcM ambient Cd for 12\u00a0h, and we found blood glucose significantly increased, however, lactate levels showed no significant changes. The glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activity increased immediately after 0.75 to 3\u00a0h of Cd exposure in the gills, and after 1 to 6\u00a0h in the liver, respectively. In addition, the glycogen level depleted faster in the gills than in the liver. Plasma cortisol level increased from 0.25 to 1\u00a0h and recovered after 3\u00a0h, while the glucagon did not significantly change during Cd exposure. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) mRNA expression decreased after 0.75\u00a0h in the gills, while it significantly increased after 6\u00a0h in the liver. Ca2+, Na+, Cl\u2212, and K+ significantly decreased upon Cd exposure within 6\u00a0h following Cd-induced toxic stress. We suggested that the cortisol is the spontaneous stimulation of glycogen metabolism in the gills, and it triggers a subsequent energy supply later in the liver. Taken together, the profile of glycogen metabolism between gills and liver during Cd-exposure stress provide good support to our hypothesis.",

We hypothesize that these changes are caused by exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds and that genes involved in reproduction are affected. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an orphan receptor that is activated by environmental contaminants. AHR mRNA was measured in turtles exposed to soil collected from a contaminated site. Adult turtles were trapped from the study site (Moody Pond, MP) or a reference site and exposed to laboratory environments containing soil from either site. The red-eared slider was used to assess neonatal exposure to soil and water from the sites. The environmental exposures occurred over a 13-month period. Juveniles showed an age-dependent increase in brain AHR1. Juvenile turtles exposed to the MP environment had elevated gonadal AHR1. Adult turtles exposed to the MP environment showed significantly decreased brain AHR2. The painted turtle AHR is the first complete reptile AHR cDNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis of the painted turtle AHR showed that it clusters with other AHR2s. Partial AHR1 and partial AHR2 cDNA sequences were cloned from the red-eared slider. MEME analysis identified 18 motifs in the turtle AHRs, showing high conservation between motifs that overlapped functional regions in both AHR isoforms.",

Using MALDI/TOF-MS, a remarkable degree of intra-species variation between venom samples from both locations was identified. To evaluate variability in the cytotoxic effects of Conus venom, mice were injected with the same dose from each location. The oxidative stress biomarkers [malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PCC)], antioxidants [glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)], total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and nitric oxide (NO), were measured 3, 6, 9 and 12\u00a0h post venom injection. The venoms induced a significant increase in the levels of PCC, MDA, NO, GSH and CAT. The venoms significantly inhibited the activity of SOD and reduced the TAC. Toxicological data showed that the venom obtained from Hurgada was more potent than that obtained from Sharm El-Shaikh. It can be concluded that: (1) the venom of the same Conus species from different regions is highly diversified (2) the venoms from different locations reflect clear differences in venom potency and (3) the cytotoxic effects of C. vexillum venom can be attributed to its ability to induce oxidative stress.",

For the present study, an anti-rainbow trout p53 polyclonal antibody was generated. A variety of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) tissues and cell lines were examined through western blot analysis of cellular protein extracts, which revealed relatively high p53 levels in brain and gills. To evaluate the checkpoint response of rainbow trout p53, RTbrain-W1 and RTgill-W1 cell lines were exposed to varying concentrations of the DNA damaging agent bleomycin and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea. In contrast to mammals, these checkpoint-inducing agents provoked no apparent increase in rainbow trout p53 levels. These results infer the presence of alternate DNA damage checkpoint mechanisms in rainbow trout cells.",

The larvae were exposed for 4\u00a0days and harvested for transcriptional analysis at 13\u00a0days post hatching. The most significant differently expressed genes were observed in cod larvae exposed to the highest concentration of the dispersed oil (containing 10.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46\u00a0\u03bcg \u2211\u00a0PAH/L), with CYP1A showing the strongest response. Functional analysis further showed that the top scored network as analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was \u201cDrug Metabolism, Endocrine System Development and Function, Lipid Metabolism\u201d. Oil exposure also increased the expression of genes involved in bone resorption and decreased the expression of genes related to bone formation. In conclusion, oil exposure affects drug metabolism, endocrine regulation, cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, fatty acid biosynthesis and tissue development in Atlantic cod larvae. The altered gene transcription was dominated by the WSF and the corresponding oil droplet fraction only had a moderate contribution to the observed changes.",

After treatment, they were transferred to clean seawater, and reared with an EE2 free diet for 350\u00a0days.

In the control group, sex differentiation was not confirmed until 206\u00a0days after transfer to a clean environment. However, some of the fish in the 0.04\u00a0\u03bcg EE2-treated group had ovarian cavity and oocytes at 26\u00a0days. In most of the fish in the 4\u00a0\u03bcg EE2-treated group, the ovarian cavity had already appeared at the end of EE2 treatment (0\u00a0day), and oocytes were observed at 26\u00a0days, suggesting that EE2 accelerates ovarian differentiation. These results suggest that previous exposure to EE2 has long-term effects on VTG synthesis and gonadal development.",

In the present study, the effects of berberine on cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) and CYP3A in crucian carp were investigated. Injection of different concentrations of berberine (0, 5, 25, 50, and 100\u00a0mg/kg) inhibited the CYP1A mRNA expression, thereby inhibiting further the catalytic activity of CYP1A-related ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD). Furthermore, both CYP1A expression and EROD activity were further inhibited with increasing berberine concentrations. In addition, the CYP3A expressions at both the mRNA and the protein levels were downregulated by higher berberine concentrations. The catalytic activity of CYP3A-related erythromycin N-demethylase (ERND) was also inhibited by berberine at a dose of no less than 25\u00a0mg/kg. Moreover, at the berberine concentration exceeding 25\u00a0mg/kg, the inhibition of CYP3A expression and ERND activity increased with increasing berberine concentrations. In vitro experiments were also performed. When berberine was pre-incubated with the crucian carp liver microsomes, it competitively inhibited the corresponding EROD activity with the IC50 of 11.7\u00a0\u03bcM. However, the ERND activity was slightly inhibited by berberine with the IC50 of 206.4\u00a0\u03bcM. These results suggest that, in crucian carp, berberine may be a potent inhibitor to CYP1A, whereas the CYP3A inhibition needs a higher concentration of berberine.",

Previously, we cloned and characterised the CYP2C, CYP4A, and CYP4B gene subfamilies from marsupials and demonstrated important species-differences in both activity and tissue expression of these CYP enzymes. Recently, we isolated the Eastern grey kangaroo CYP3A70. Here we have cloned and characterised the second identified member of marsupial CYP3A gene subfamily, CYP3A78 from the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus). In addition, we have examined the gender-differences in microsomal erythromycin N-demethylation activity (a CYP3A marker) and CYP3A protein expression across test marsupial species. Significant differences in hepatic erythromycin N-demethylation activity were observed between male and female koalas, with the activity detected in female koalas being 2.5-fold higher compared to that in male koalas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). No gender-differences were observed in tammar wallaby or Eastern grey kangaroo. Immunoblot analysis utilising anti-human CYP3A4 antibody detected immunoreactive proteins in liver microsomes from all test male and female marsupials including the koala, tammar wallaby, and Eastern grey kangaroo, with no gender-differences detected across test marsupials. A 1610\u00a0bp koala hepatic CYP3A complete cDNA, designated CYP3A78, was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction approaches. It displays 64% nucleotide and 57% amino acid sequence identity to the Eastern grey kangaroo CYP3A70. The CYP3A78 cDNA encodes a protein of 515 amino acids, shares approximately 68% nucleotide and 56% amino acid sequence identity to human CYP3A4, and displays high sequence similarity to other published mammalian CYP3As from human, monkey, cow, pig, dog, rat, rabbit, mouse, hamster, and guinea pig. Collectively, this study provides primary molecular data regarding koala hepatic CYP3A78 gene and enables further functional analyses of CYP3A enzymes in marsupials. Given the significant role that CYP3A enzymes play in the metabolism of both endogenous and exogenous compounds, the clone provides an important step in elucidating the metabolic capacity of marsupials.",

Cyclic AMP content and PKA activity in gills were evaluated as biological endpoints related to cell signaling. Expression of the MgPgp (ABCB1) and MgMvp genes was also assessed as involved in the mussel MXR mechanism. Levels of cAMP and PKA activities were not modified in mussels exposed to Ni or CHP, whereas they significantly increased in organisms exposed to the mixture. Similar responses were also detected for MgPgp expression, which is thought to be under cAMP/PKA-mediated regulation. Expression of MgMvp was unaffected by CHP or Ni/CHP exposure, and increased by Ni. The differential regulation of MgPgp and MgMvp expressions could be ascribed to the different intracellular localization and function of the two transporters. On the whole, present data indicated that Ni and CHP elicited interactive effects on mussel physiology, both at the signal transduction and at the gene expression levels.",

We found previously that Neotoma stephensi, a juniper specialist, upregulated catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) mRNA almost seven fold in response to an ecologically relevant diet (70% juniper). To further investigate the relevance of this enzyme with respect to juniper metabolism, we compared the protein expression, activity and kinetics of the two forms of COMT, soluble (S-COMT) and membrane bound (MB-COMT), in the blood, kidneys and liver of N. stephensi on its natural juniper diet to that of N. stephensi fed an experimental diet of 70% juniper as well as a non-toxic control diet under laboratory conditions. In addition, we compared these results to that of Neotoma albigula, a generalist species, which consumes a diet of 25% juniper in the wild. The specialist consuming juniper under both field and laboratory conditions had increased S-COMT expression and activity in their livers and kidneys, and increased S-COMT activity in their blood compared to the specialist and generalist fed the control diet. The specialist showed expression and activity of S-COMT in their kidneys that was as high as or higher than that in their livers. The generalist had an elevated Vmax for MB-COMT compared to the specialist that resulted in higher activity for MB-COMT than the specialist despite lower expression of MB-COMT in the generalist's livers and kidneys. This high activity MB-COMT may be in part responsible for differences in the behaviors of the generalist compared to the specialist. We conclude that S-COMT is important in the specialist's ability to consume high levels of juniper.",

A maximum accumulation of 0.49\u00a0\u03bcg Cu/mg protein was detected at week 6. Also at this week, the hepatosomatic index (HSI) showed the highest decrease (50%) in response to Cu exposure. SOD and GST activities were significantly increased at weeks 4, 5 and 6, reaching an activity on average 50% higher than in controls for GST. CAT activity and GSH increased significantly at weeks 5 and 6. Despite this response, oxidative damage measured as TBARS and carbonyl groups contents increased significantly at weeks 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Digestive tubule and duct atrophy and cell-type replacement in treated mussels were observed by histological studies. The presence of intracellular rhodanine-positive granules, suggests copper accumulation in intracellular vacuoles of digestive cells.",

     "abstract": "Antioxidant enzymes play important roles in the protection against oxidative damage caused by environmental pollutants by scavenging high levels of reactive oxygen species and have been quantified as oxidative stress markers. However, combining mRNA expressions of genes coding for detoxification enzymes along with enzyme activities will be more useful biomarkers of stress. Therefore, in this study the cDNA of the catalase gene from the aquatic midge, Chironomus riparius (CrCAT) was sequenced using 454 pyrosequencing. The 2139\u00a0bp CrCAT cDNA included an open reading frame of 1503\u00a0bp encoding a putative protein of 500 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 56.72\u00a0kDa. There was an 18\u00a0bp 5\u2019 and a long 618\u00a0bp 3' untranslated region with a polyadenylation signal site (AATAAA). The deduced amino acid sequence of CrCAT contained several highly conserved motifs including the proximal heme\u2013ligand signature sequence RLFSYNDTX and the proximal active site signature FXRERIPERVVHAKGXGA. A comparative analysis showed the presence of conserved amino acid residues and all of the catalytic amino acids (His70, Asn143, and Tyr353) were conserved in all species. The CrCAT contained three potential glycosylation sites and a peroxisome targeting signal of \u2018AKM\u2019. The mRNA was detected using RT-PCR at all developmental stages. The time-course expression of CrCAT was measured using quantitative real-time PCR after exposure to different concentration and durations of Paraquat (PQ), cadmium chloride (Cd) and nonylphenol (NP). The expression of CrCAT was significantly up regulated on exposure to 50 and 100\u00a0mg/L PQ for 12 and 24\u00a0h. Among the different concentrations and durations of Cd tested, significantly highest level of expression for CrCAT mRNA and catalase enzyme activity was observed on exposure to 10\u00a0mg/L for 24\u00a0h. In the case of NP, the highest level of CrCAT expression was observed after exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L for 24\u00a0h. The expression profiles of three selected C. riparius glutathione S-transferase genes (CrGSTs) viz. CrGSTdelta3, CrGSTsigma4 and CrGSTepsilon1 was also studied on exposure to NP and were up or down regulated at different time points and concentrations. Significantly highest level of expression for CrGSTdelta3 was observed after 48\u00a0h and for CrGSTsigma4 and CrGSTepsilon1 after 24\u00a0h exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L of NP. The results show that CrGSTs and CrCAT could be used as potential biomarkers in C. riparius for aquatic ecotoxicological studies.",

The salinity-dependent differences in acute Ni toxicity could not be explained by differences in Ni bioaccumulation. Therefore, differences in physiology of the organisms at the two salinities may be the most likely factor contributing to differences in acute Ni toxicity. Chronic LC50 values (2.7\u201323.2\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121) were similar in the two species, but salinity had no significant effect, indicating that water chemistry and osmoregulatory strategy do not influence chronic toxicity.

The reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO) damage, catalase (CAT) activity, and the melatonin immunohistochemical reactivity in the eyestalks were evaluated.

The natural waters were selected to range in pertinent water chemistry parameters such as calcium, pH, total CO2 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Acute toxicity was determined for C. dubia and P. promelas using standard 48\u00a0h and 96\u00a0h protocols, respectively. For both organisms acute toxicity varied markedly according to water chemistry, with C. dubia LC50s ranging from 29 to 180\u00a0\u03bcg/L and P. promelas LC50s ranging from 41 to 3598\u00a0\u03bcg/L. Additionally, no Pb toxicity was observed for P. promelas in three alkaline natural waters. With respect to water chemistry parameters, DOC had the strongest protective impact for both organisms. A multi-linear regression (MLR) approach combining previous lab data and the current data was used to identify the relative importance of individual water chemistry components in predicting acute Pb toxicity for both species. As anticipated, the P. promelas best-fit MLR model combined DOC, calcium and pH. Unexpectedly, in the C. dubiaMLR model the importance of pH, TCO2 and calcium was minimal while DOC and ionic strength were the controlling water quality variables. Adjusted R2 values of 0.82 and 0.64 for the P. promelas and C. dubia models, respectively, are comparable to previously developed biotic ligand models for other metals.",

In the present study, thioredoxin 1 (named as VpTrx1) and thioredoxin-related protein (named as VpTrp14) were identified from Venerupis philippinarum, respectively. Similar to most Trx1s, VpTrx1 possessed all conserved features critical for the fundamental structure and function of Trx1s, such as the conserved catalytic residues (C-G-P-C), but lacked the other cysteine residues, while VpTrp14 contained the conserved motif (C-P-D-C). Quantitative Real-time PCR assay showed that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 transcripts were distributed in a wide array of tissues most abundantly expressed in the hepatopancreas. The expression of VpTrp14 mRNA in the hepatopancreas was significantly up-regulated after exposure to 10 and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/L Cd, while the VpTrx1 expression level was kept relatively constant. Both the expression levels of VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 in the hepatopancreas were induced after exposure to Cu, and increased to the peak value at 96\u00a0h under the 40\u00a0\u03bcg/L Cu exposure. These results showed that VpTrp14 transcripts responded to metal stress more acutely than VpTrx1, and both Trxs responded to Cu stress more sensitively than Cd. Together, it was suggested that VpTrx1 and VpTrp14 perhaps played important roles in the antioxidant responses against metal stress in V. philippinarum.",

Cu appeared to be regulated and its excess is eliminated via, among others, the molting process, while Cd was rather accumulated by the spiders. The level of MTs increased significantly mainly in females exposed to both metals, irrespectively of the pollution degree of their site of origin, indicating a defensive role of the proteins.

The aim of the work was to search for differences among populations of the insects as a result of various multistress pressures in their habitats. The question of zinc toxicity in the context of energy allocation was also considered. Zinc caused a decrease in glutathione concentration in the body of zinc-treated larvae. Significant differences between control and zinc-treated groups were confirmed for young females' progeny from Pilica and Olkusz as well as old females' progeny from Olkusz. GSTs activity was generally not influenced by zinc. It is possible that GSTs were not the most important target of zinc action. On the contrary, the influence of zinc on CAT activity was found. The increase in CAT activity after zinc treatment was similar for all studied populations. An increase in CAT activity after zinc exposure seems to be the most universal reaction.

Frogs of both sexes were exposed for 7 or 14\u00a0days to 1.353\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 (ppm) of mercury chloride (HgCl2) dissolved in water. The activity of the investigated enzymes participating in cysteine metabolism depends on cysteine in their active sites. Mercury ions can bind to \u2013SH groups and, therefore, lower the activity of enzymes and change the level of sulfane sulfur, a product of l-cysteine desulfuration. The effect of mercury was found to depend on the time of exposure and the kind of tissue. In the liver, the main site of glutathione biosynthesis, the ratio of GSH to GSSG was essentially unchanged. The total glutathione level was decreased after 7\u00a0days of exposure to mercury, similarly as the activity of rhodanese. Sulfane sulfur levels were significantly increased after a shorter duration, while they decreased after a longer time of exposure. The kidney, brain and testes were able to enhance the level of GSH, probably thanks to high \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidase activity. These tissues showed an increased value of GSH/GSSG ratio during the shorter exposure to mercury. The activity of sulfurtransferases was decreased, especially after the longer exposure to mercury. In the heart and skeletal muscle, the level of GSH, sulfane sulfur, and the activity of the investigated sulfurtransferases was diminished after 14\u00a0days of exposure to Hg. It can be concluded that the main mechanism of toxic Hg activity is generation of reactive oxygen species in cells due to depleted GSH level, and a decreased sulfurtransferases activity either by blocking or oxidation of their \u2013SH groups, what in consequence results in a diminished sulfane sulfur levels in tissues, especially the heart and testes.",

For individual sea bass, biochemical biomarkers showed numerous significant correlations with growth and condition indices, such as the Fulton's K condition index, the RNA:DNA ratio and the lipid storage index. On the contrary, there were only a few significant correlations for turbot, suggesting a species-specific response. Our study indicates that the analysis of the simultaneous responses of both biochemical and physiological biomarkers can be useful for monitoring complex exposure and to assess habitat quality.",

In addition, a single exposure study was performed with a 50\u00a0days latency period on adult worms of Nereis succinea. Since reduced glutathione (GSH) is required in detoxification of NP and is the precursor of the spawning pheromone nereithione (CSSG) in N. succinea, we analysed how the estrogenic chemical NP affects GSH concentrations. PGC were not affected by exposure to E2 and EE2 from 24hpf to 6\u00a0days. Chronic exposure of P. dumerilii with NP over the full life cycle did not influence segment proliferation. Mature females that developed, even at high concentrations, were able to spawn and successful fertilization occurred. However, at high NP levels no P. dumerilii males matured. A significant decline of GSH can be seen in N. succinea males upon treatment with NP, but not in females, indicating that females stabilize GSH levels even in stress situations.

In the present paper we therefore investigated how laboratory raised F1-generations of these populations coped when exposed to increased copper concentrations in the soil and to sub-zero temperatures. We found that D. octaedra from polluted sites accumulated the same amount of copper as reference worms. Furthermore, earthworms from polluted sites survived equally to reference worms when exposed to freezing temperatures (\u2212\u00a08 or \u2212\u00a012\u00a0\u00b0C). However, when simultaneously exposed to the lowest temperature and copper, the worms from polluted sites survived significantly better than reference worms.

PXR is an ideal receptor to study xenobiotic metabolism as it binds to a vast array of anthropogenic compounds and induces transcription of genes involved in metabolizing xenobiotic compounds, such as CYP3A4. In this study FHM were separated by gender and feeding regimen (fed versus unfed), and injected with control (corn oil), clotrimazole, or pregnene-16\u03b1-olone, and expression monitored after 2- and 5-days of treatment. Our research indicates that there are gender- and diet-specific differences in the expression of PXR and CYP3A4, the most striking of which was a significant increase in the expression of PXR and CYP3A4 in unfed females as compared to all other groups.

     "abstract": "Reproductive changes have been observed in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) from a site with known contamination located on Cape Cod, MA, USA. We hypothesize that these changes are caused by exposure to endocrine-disrupting compounds and that genes playing a significant role in reproduction are affected. cDNA sequences were determined for estrogen receptor alpha and aromatase in the painted turtle. These genes were measured in our study animals using quantitative PCR. Adult turtles were trapped from our study site (Moody Pond, MP) or a reference site (Washburn Pond) and exposed to laboratory environments containing soil from either site. The red-eared slider (Pseudemys scripta), a pond turtle closely related to the painted turtle, was used to assess neonatal exposure to soil and water from the sites. Our results show an increase in hepatic estrogen receptor, which suggests exposure to estrogenic contaminants. Female turtles from MP appear to have a long-term effect on hepatic ER. Other findings were apparent age-dependent differences in expression of aromatase and ER in the brains of neonate and year-old juvenile turtles. Phylogenetic analyses of the cDNA sequences further support the hypothesis that turtles are in a sister clade to birds and crocodilians.",

In this study, rainbow trout was exposed to low (0.5 and 5.0\u00a0nM) concentrations of medetomidine for up to 54\u00a0days. Recently we have reported on effects on paleness and melanophore aggregation of medetomidine in these fish. Here, specific growth rates were investigated together with a broad set of physiological parameters including plasma levels of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and leptin, glucose and haemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), condition factor, liver and heart somatic indexes (LSI, HSI). Hepatic enzyme activities of CYP1A (EROD activity), glutathione S-transferases (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) were also measured. Additionally, hepatic mRNA expression was analysed through microarray and quantitative PCR in fish sampled after 31\u00a0days of exposure. Medetomidine at both concentrations significantly lowered blood glucose levels and the higher concentration significantly reduced the LSI. The mRNA expression analysis revealed few differentially expressed genes in the liver and the false discovery rate was high. Taken together, the results suggest that medetomidine at investigated concentrations could interfere with carbohydrate metabolism of exposed fish but without any clear consequences for growth.",

A common effect of exposure was related to genotoxicity, a decrease in GSH and an increase in microsomal ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity in the liver. However, the systems of oxidative stress and biotransformation were more efficient in fish from the polluted site, while the responsivity of MTs in this fish was impaired. Principle Component Analysis separated the subgroups from the unpolluted site and fish loaded by lesser concentrations of metals on the one side, and fish from the polluted site jointly with fish exposed to higher concentrations of metals on the other side. The main distinguishing indices of sites and exposures selected by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis were MT characteristics and genotoxicity.",

Fish were exposed to dietary Aroclor1254 (10\u00a0mg kg\u2212\u00a01 body mass/day) for 3\u00a0days and then subjected to a 3-min handling disturbance and sampled over a 24\u00a0h recovery after the stressor exposure. In the pre-stress fish, PCB exposure significantly elevated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and cytochrome P4501A1 (Cyp1A1) mRNA abundance and Cyp1A protein expression confirming AhR activation. There was no significant effect of PCB on plasma cortisol and glucose levels, while plasma lactate levels were significantly elevated compared to the sham group. PCB exposure significantly elevated liver glycogen content and hexokinase activity, whereas lactate dehydrogenase activity was depressed. Short-term PCB exposure did not modify the acute stressor-induced plasma cortisol, glucose and lactate responses. Liver glycogen content dropped significantly after stressor exposure in the PCB group but not in the sham group. This was matched by a significantly higher liver LDH activity and a lower HK activity during recovery in the PCB group suggesting enhanced glycolytic capacity to fuel hepatic metabolism. Liver AhR, but not Cyp1A1, transcript levels were significantly reduced during recovery from handling stressor in the Aroclor fed fish. Collectively, this study demonstrates that short-term PCB exposure may impair the liver metabolic performance that is critical to cope with the enhanced energy demand associated with additional stressor exposure in rainbow trout.",

     "abstract": "Several recent studies have demonstrated that the freshwater pulmonate snail Lymnaea stagnalis is extremely sensitive to metals (Co, Ni, Pb) in chronic exposures. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the acute and chronic sensitivity of L. stagnalis to Cu and investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of toxic action. A 96-h LC50 of 31\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 Cu was estimated indicating L. stagnalis was moderately acutely sensitive to Cu relative to other aquatic organisms. However, in a 30-day chronic exposure using juvenile snails an EC20 of 1.8\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 Cu was estimated for snail growth making L. stagnalis the most sensitive organism tested to date for Cu. Hardness-based and BLM-based water quality criteria for Cu at the water quality conditions used in this study were 7.8 and 1.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, respectively, indicating L. stagnalis is significantly under-protected by hardness-based WQC. Investigations into the mechanism(s) of toxic action for Cu were conducted on young adult snails necessitating higher Cu exposures. Exposure to Cu at 12\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 resulted in no detectable effects on hemolymph osmolality, net Ca2+ uptake, titratable acid excretion, or ammonia excretion. Exposure to 48\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 Cu was shown to significantly reduce (91%) net Ca2+ uptake which is strongly correlated with shell deposition and corresponding snail growth. Snails exposed to 48\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 Cu also exhibited reduced ammonia excretion, a marked hemolymph acidosis, and a compensatory increase in titratable acid excretion. The reduction in net Ca2+ uptake was hypothesized to be a secondary effect of Cu-induced inhibition of carbonic anhydrase, but no reduction in carbonic anhydrase activity was detected. Overall, it remains unclear whether inhibition of Ca2+ uptake is a direct result of Cu exposure or, along with the other observed physiological effects, is secondary to an unidentified primary mode of toxic action. Given the hypersensitivity of L. stagnalis to Cu, further study into the mechanisms of action and effects of varying water chemistry on Cu toxicity is clearly warranted.",

A time- and/or concentration- dependent decrease in muscle glycogen and increase in LDH activity suggested that glycolysis was accelerated during the treatments. Increased protease activity, lowering of FAA and the initially increased and subsequently decreased aminotransferase activities suggest an enhanced protein mobilization during early Cd2+ exposure followed by a metabolic impairment during late exposure. Decreased hemolymph glucose level was observed in the crabs treated with 2.9\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01 Cd2+ for 21\u00a0d, suggesting an impaired gluconeogenesis. Ammonia level barely changed during the 14\u00a0d Cd2+ exposure most likely due to the increased urea and glutamine production; After 1.45 and 2.9\u00a0mg\u00b7L\u2212\u00a01 Cd2+ treatment for 21\u00a0d, ammonia was observed increased followed by an exclusive increase in glutamine. Taken together, our results indicate that carbohydrate and protein are mobilized to a varying degree as a compensatory metabolism to response to the energy stress during acute Cd2+ exposure.

Turtles from PAO showed higher silicon and cadmium concentrations, but lower \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane, \u03b3-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene and aldrin concentrations than individuals from BMA. In BMA cadmium concentration decreased as the standard carapace length of the turtles increased. In PAO concentrations of \u03b1-hexachlorocyclohexane, heptachlor and hexachlorobenzene were positively correlated with the weight of the individuals. Lipid peroxidation levels were positively correlated with cadmium concentrations. In turtles captured in PAO, enzymatic antioxidant activities correlated mostly with pesticide concentrations, while in individuals from BMA enzyme activities were correlated with trace element concentrations. Correlations between antioxidant enzyme activities and concentration of xenobiotics suggest physiological sensitivity of East Pacific green turtles to chemicals. Regional differences found could be influenced by habitat conditions such as currents, upwellings (PAO) and agricultural activities (BMA). We suggest that, combined, circulating contaminant concentrations, lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzyme activities in sea turtles could be used as biomarkers of the habitat conditions.",

Fish offer unlimited versatility for biomedical research.

Thus, high-throughput sperm cryopreservation is urgently needed to preserve these genetic resources. Although high-throughput processing has been widely applied for sperm cryopreservation in livestock for decades, application in biomedical model fishes is still in the concept-development stage because of the limited sample volumes and the biological characteristics of fish sperm. High-throughput processing in livestock was developed based on advances made in the laboratory and was scaled up for increased processing speed, capability for mass production, and uniformity and quality assurance. Cryopreserved germplasm combined with high-throughput processing constitutes an independent industry encompassing animal breeding, preservation of genetic diversity, and medical research. Currently, there is no specifically engineered system available for high-throughput of cryopreserved germplasm for aquatic species. This review is to discuss the concepts and needs for high-throughput technology for model fishes, propose approaches for technical development, and overview future directions of this approach.",

In order to use GSTs as molecular biomarkers for marine pollution monitoring, we cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA of seven GST genes from the marine polychaete Perinereis nuntia. The deduced amino acid sequence of Pn-GSTs showed a high similarity to those of other species that clustered into the same clades in a phylogenetic analysis. In addition, to evaluate Pn-GSTs as useful biomarkers on effects after cadmium (Cd) exposure, we exposed sublethal concentrations of Cd (5, 50, and 500\u00a0\u03bcg/L) to P. nuntia, and they showed relatively different but significantly increases, depending on exposure time and Cd concentrations. Particularly, Pn-GST-omega and Pn-GST-sigma genes were highly sensitive with a clear dose-dependent manner on mRNA expression. The total GST activities also have significantly increased levels at higher concentrations of Cd exposure. These results indicate that Pn-GSTs play important roles in Cd-induced oxidative stress in terms of the physiological changes relating to metabolism and cell protection, and those genes would have great potential as molecular biomarkers to monitor marine environmental health.",

Expression of Cu homeostasis genes copper transporter 1 (CTR1), Cu ATPase (ATP7A), Cu chaperone (ATOX1) and metallothionein (MT) together with the oxidative stress markers glutathione reductase (GR) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZn/SOD) were measured 0, 4 and 24 hours post-exposure by qRT-PCR. Microarray was conducted on samples from 4 hours post Cu exposure. Cu, Zn and Cd increased MT and GR mRNA levels, while only Cu increased ATP7A mRNA levels. Microarray results confirmed the effects of Cu on ATP7A and MT and in addition showed changes in the expression of genes involved in protein transport and secretion.

Mussels were continuously exposed to increasing concentrations of the effluents for 14\u00a0days. Genotoxicity was determined by tracking changes in key enzymes for purine and pyrimidine synthesis (dehydrofolate reductase and aspartate transcarbamoylase), catabolism of purines (xanthine oxido-reductase) and DNA strand-break levels as determined by the alkaline precipitation assay. Other biomarkers related to xenobiotic biotransformation (cytochrome P4503A and glutathione S-transferase activities), metal metabolism (labile zinc and redox state of metathioneins) and oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase activity) were also determined in the mussels. The data revealed that dehydrofolate reductase activity was reduced by the initial effluent and increased by the ozonated effluent. Aspartate transcarbamoylase activity was significantly induced only with the ozonated effluent. The levels of DNA strand breaks responded in a biphasic manner in mussels exposed to the physically and chemically treated effluent where an initial decrease was observed at a low effluent concentration (3% v/v) followed by an increase in DNA strand breaks at a higher effluent concentration (20%). This response pattern was lost in the ozonated effluent, where only a decrease in DNA breaks was found. Xanthine oxidoreductase activity was not significantly affected but did correlate significantly with dehydrofolate reductase activity. Multivariate factorial and canonical analyses revealed that oxidative stress and metal/xenobiotic metabolism markers were strongly correlated with DNA strand breaks in mussels, suggesting that the presence of metals (zinc) and planar hydroxylated hydrocarbons present in these effluents were strong contributors to the observed response. We conclude that municipal effluents contain a complex mixture of pollutants that could modulate DNA synthesis and repair mechanisms in mussels.",

In the present study, it was further observed that long-term chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of BaP modulated the immunocompetence of abalones in terms of the change in activity of the antioxidant and immune associated parameters tested. In addition, the effect of tributyltin (TBT), another important genotoxicant in the aquatic environment, was investigated. Exposure of abalones to sublethal concentrations of TBT and BaP for 21\u00a0days resulted in significant decrease of total hemocyte count, phagocytosis, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. Conversely induction of extra and intra cellular superoxide generation, nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase and myeloperoxidase activity was present when the abalones were exposed to TBT and BaP. Most of the immune associated parameters tested showed clear time dependent response to both toxicants. Within 14\u00a0days after the 21\u00a0day exposure to BaP, recovery was observed as evidenced by most of the parameters returning to their normal level. However, no recovery was observed within 14\u00a0days after the 21\u00a0day exposure to TBT as evidenced by continued elevation of intra cellular superoxide and nitrite production and decrease in THC, membrane stability and lysozyme activity. This suggested a prolonged TBT-induced impact on the immune reaction and possibly more damage than that caused by BaP. Overall the results suggest that chronic exposure to sublethal concentrations of TBT or BaP causes modulations in the immunocompetence of abalones with most of the immune associated parameters tested being stimulated, and this might be harmful to the host.",

However, data on potential toxicological and molecular responses to exposure are lacking, especially for avian species. A combined in vitro/in ovo approach was used to determine concentration-dependent effects of DP in chicken embryonic hepatocytes (CEH) and chicken embryos following injection of DP into the air cell of eggs prior to incubation. Overt toxicity (i.e. cytotoxicity and pipping success) and mRNA expression levels of transcripts previously determined to be responsive to a brominated flame retardant were assessed in CEH and hepatic tissue. DP was not cytotoxic up to a maximum concentration of 3\u00a0\u03bcM in CEH, and no effects on pipping success were observed up to the highest nominal dose group of 500\u00a0ng/g egg. A significant shift in isomeric content of syn- and anti-DP was detected between stock solutions of the commercial mixture and hepatic tissue; the proportion of the syn-DP isomer increased from 0.34 to 0.65 with a concomitant decrease of anti-DP from 0.66 to 0.35. None of the mRNA transcripts changed as a result of in vitro or in ovo exposure to DP indicating that, although there was concordance between the two approaches, DP may evoke its toxicity through other modes of action. At current environmental exposure levels, no adverse effects of DP on embryonic viability or pathways associated with the genes assessed are predicted.",

The antioxidant enzymes include Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), Mn-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), catalase (CAT), mu-glutathione-s-transferase (mu-GST) and thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx). The results showed that the mRNA expression of these antioxidant enzymes increased and reached the maximum at the dietary zinc level of 33.8\u00a0mg/kg, and then dropped progressively. Expression levels of the heat shock proteins (HSP26, HSP70 and HSP90) firstly increased at 33.8\u00a0mg/kg dietary Zn level, and reached to the maximum at 710.6\u00a0mg/kg, then dropped at 3462.5\u00a0mg/kg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Excessive dietary Zn (710.6 and 3462.5\u00a0mg/kg) significantly increases the Zn content and significantly decreases the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in hepatopancreas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These findings showed that dietary Zn (33.8\u00a0mg/kg) could highly trigger the expression levels of antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins, but excessive dietary Zn (710.6 and 3462.5\u00a0mg/kg) induces a high oxidative stress in abalone.",

In order to examine these relationships, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were aqueously exposed to solvent control (ethanol) or two nominal concentrations of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), a mitochondrial electron transport chain uncoupler, for a 24-h period. Following exposure, fish were placed in a swim tunnel in clean water for swimming testing or euthanized immediately without testing, followed by analysis of whole body triglyceride levels. Ucrit decreased in both the 6\u00a0mg/L and 12\u00a0mg/L DNP groups, with 12\u00a0mg/L approaching the LC50. A decrease in tail beat frequency was observed without a significant change in tail beat amplitude. In contrast, triglyceride levels were elevated in a concentration-dependent manner in the DNP exposure groups, but only in fish subjected to swimming tests. This increase in triglyceride stores may be due to a direct interference of DNP on lipid catabolism as well as increased triglyceride production when zebrafish were subjected to the co-stressors of swimming and toxicant exposure. Future studies should be directed at determining how acute DNP exposure combines with swimming to cause alterations in triglyceride accumulation.",

To uncover the role of the heat shock protein upon temperature stress and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure, we cloned heat shock protein 20 (Hsp20) and determined its modulatory response under different temperatures and H2O2 concentrations. Under different temperature stresses (10\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C), the rotifer Brachionus sp. Hsp20 (Br-Hsp20) gene was highly expressed over time, and reached the maximum level 90\u00a0min after exposure, indicating that Br-Hsp20 gene would be involved in the chaperoning process to protect proteins at both low and high temperatures. To test the ability of thermotolerance of the recombinant Br-Hsp20-containing transformed Escherichia coli, we expressed the recombinant Br-Hsp20 protein with 1\u00a0mM IPTG for 18\u00a0h at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, exposed them at 54\u00a0\u00b0C with time course (10 to 60\u00a0min), and measured cell survival. In this elevated temperature shock (54\u00a0\u00b0C), the cell survival was significantly higher at the Br-Hsp20 transformed E. coli, compared to the control (vector only). To analyze the modulatory effect of Br-Hsp20 gene on oxidative stress, we initially exposed 0.1\u00a0mM H2O2 over time and measured antioxidant enzyme activities along with the expression level of Br-Hsp20 mRNA. Upon H2O2 exposure, Br-Hsp20 gene was time-dependently upregulated and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were also elevated at the 12\u00a0h-exposed group in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the Br-Hsp20 gene would be an important gene in response to oxidative and temperature stress.

The objective of this study was to compare such defenses in chicks from three species, Black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), Northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), and Herring gull (Larus argentatus), and the relationship with tissue concentrations of essential metals such as selenium and iron and halogenated organic compounds, represented by polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). The results showed significant species-specific differences in the antioxidant responses which also corresponded with metal and PCB levels in different ways. The capability to neutralize hydroxyl radicals (TOSC-HO\u2022) and the activities of catalase and Se-dependent glutathione peroxidases (GPX) clearly increased in species with the higher levels of metals and PCBs, while the opposite trend was observed for Se-independent GPX, TOSC against peroxyl radicals (ROO\u2022) and peroxynitrite (ONOOH). Less clear relationships were obtained for glutathione levels, GSH/GSSG ratio, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase. The results showed differences in antioxidant efficiency between the species, and some of these defenses exhibited dose\u2013response-like relationships with measured levels of selenium, iron and \u03a3PCBs. PCBs, selenium and iron levels were positively related to the responses of antioxidants with potential to reduce HO\u2022/H2O2 (Se-dependent GPX, CAT and TOSC against HO\u2022). However, direct causal relationships between antioxidant responses and contaminant concentrations could not be shown on individual level. Varying levels of metals and contaminants due to different diet and age were probably the main explanations for the species differences in antioxidant defense.",

Also, their induction time courses were compared after waterborne exposure to a transient (indigo) or a persistent (3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032,5-pentacholorbiphenyl PCB 126) AHR agonist. The cloned stickleback CYP1s exhibited a high amino acid sequence identity compared with their zebrafish orthologs and their constitutive tissue distribution patterns largely agreed with those reported in other species. PCB 126 (100\u00a0nM) induced different CYP1 expression patterns in the four tissues, suggesting tissue-specific regulation. Both indigo (1\u00a0nM) and PCB 126 (10\u00a0nM) induced a strong CYP1 expression in gills. However, while PCB 126 gave rise to a high and persistent induction in gills and liver, induction by indigo was transient in both organs. The number of putative dioxin response elements found in each CYP1 gene promoter roughly reflected the induction levels of the genes. The high responsiveness of CYP1A, CYP1B1, and CYP1C1 observed in several organs suggests that three-spined stickleback is suitable for monitoring of pollution with AHR agonists.",

Data demonstrated that in mussels exposed to BaP antioxidant enzymes (catalase \u2013 CAT, total glutathione peroxidase \u2013 tGPx, glutathione S-transferase \u2013 GST and glutathione reductase \u2013 GR) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) increased in the gill. On the contrary, in the digestive gland inhibitory antioxidant effects (superoxide dismutase-SOD, GR, metallothioneins-MT) and no changes in LPO levels were detected. Cu was also a potent oxidant agent since MT and LPO levels increased in mussel gill, despite no LPO effect in the digestive gland. For both single contaminants the organ specificity and distinct physiologic/metabolism roles were evident in terms of antioxidant capacity. Gill SOD inhibition, MT and GST unchanged was a result of \u201csimple independent action\u201d of exposure to BaP and Cu. \u201cInteractions\u201d in the binary mixtures, led to absence of changes in LPO effects. In the digestive gland, BaP and Cu interactions were also responsible for the GST and LPO enhancement (antagonistic effects). The current findings demonstrate the differences in antioxidant responses where the organ dependency highlights each contaminant particular mode of action. Generally, in the gill \u201cnon-interactive\u201d effects occurred with the lowest Cu concentration while \u201cinteractions\u201d exist for the mixture with the highest Cu concentrations. In the digestive gland, \u201cinteractions\u201d and \u201cno interaction\u201d effects occurred in all the binary mixtures.

In this study, we obtained the full-length cDNA of zebrafish abcc2, analyzed its expression in developing embryos and adult tissues, investigated its transcriptional response to heavy metals, and evaluated its roles in efflux of heavy metals including cadmium, mercury and lead. Zebrafish abcc2 gene is located on chromosome 13 and composed of 32 exons. The deduced polypeptide of zebrafish ABCC2 consists of 1567 amino acids and possesses most of functional domains and critical residues defined in human ABCC2. Zebrafish abcc2 gene is not maternally expressed and its earliest expression was detected in embryos at 72\u00a0hpf. In larval zebrafish, abcc2 gene was found to be exclusively expressed in liver, intestine and pronephric tubules. In adult zebrafish, the highest expression of abcc2 gene was found in intestine followed by those in liver and kidney, while relative low expression was detected in brain and muscle. Expression of abcc2 in excretory organs including kidney, liver and intestine of zebrafish larvae was induced by exposure to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM mercury or 5\u00a0\u03bcM lead. Moreover, exposure to 0.125\u20131\u00a0\u03bcM of mercury or lead also significantly induced abcc2 expression in these excretory organs of adult zebrafish. Furthermore, overexpression of zebrafish ABCC2 in ZF4 cells and zebrafish embryos decreased the cellular accumulation of heavy metals including cadmium, mercury and lead as determined by MRE (metal responsive element)- or EPRE (electrophile response element)-driven luciferase reporters and atomic absorption spectrometry. These results suggest that zebrafish ABCC2/MRP2 is capable of effluxing heavy metals from cells and may play important roles in the detoxification of toxic metals.",

The results showed that LET and TAM produced distinct expression profiles in a complex tissue- and gender-specific manner, confirming that they exert their anti-estrogenic effects via different molecular mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional levels of hepatic vitellogenin were significantly downregulated in females exposed to either LET or TAM, while they were significantly upregulated in TAM-exposed males and did not exhibit any change in LET-treated males. The expression of genes involved in steroidogenesis was also modulated by these two anti-estrogens in a way that corresponded with their anticipated mode of action.

Thus, through the possibility of occurrence of these two situations in same place the purpose of this study was to evaluate if damage caused by crude oil on genotoxic and morphological parameters in the marine fish species Hippocampus reidi will be aggravated by events of severe hypoxia. Sea horses were exposed during 8\u00a0h to the following conditions: crude oil (OIL), severe hypoxia (HYP), association of severe hypoxia and crude oil (HYP\u00a0+\u00a0OIL) and normoxia without contaminant (CONT). An increase in micronuclei observed in OIL and HYP\u00a0+\u00a0OIL groups indicates that the crude oil exposure was a determining factor in the micronuclei induction and hypoxia did not intensify this result. In comet assays, both petroleum and hypoxia provoke DNA damage. The most frequent histopathology in the control groups and in those exposed to OIL and HYP\u00a0+\u00a0OIL groups were: hypertrophy and capillary dilation; hypertrophy and hyperplasia; hypertrophy, epithelial \u201clifting\u201d and epithelial hyperplasia. An elongation of the lamellae was observed in fish from the two groups exposed to hypoxia, probably due to the fact that these groups required a greater flow of blood in the gills to increase the efficiency of gas exchange, since they were in a hypoxic environment. In summary, the micronuclei test and comet assay can be used as a good biomarker of contamination by petroleum. The association of hypoxia with crude oil in some aspects may exacerbate the responses of fish, in the light of the increase in DNA damage and the alterations in thickness of the gill epithelium.",

First, seasonal variations were studied in a non-polluted area. Hepatopancreas and gills showed season-related fluctuations in catalase (CAT), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities and in lipid peroxidation levels (LPO), but not in superoxide dismutase (SOD). Then, adults were exposed semi-statically to sublethal doses for 7\u00a0days. CAT, SOD, GST, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities and LPO, reduced glutathione (GSH) and protein oxidation (PO) levels were determined. Exposed individuals showed significant increases in CAT, SOD, and GST activities in hepatopancreas and CAT activity in gills. GPx activity did not vary in either tissues. While LPO levels increased, GSH levels decreased significantly in hepatopancreas of exposed animals, but PO levels showed no variation. Induction of SOD was also assessed by Real-time PCR mRNA expression in hepatopancreas. The non-enzymatic antioxidant activity was also tested; ABTS 2,2\u2032-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was higher in hemolymph of treated-prawns compared to controls, but ferric reducing activity of plasma assay (FRAP) values did not change. Taken together, the present results indicated that the antioxidant defenses of M. borellii, mainly in hepatopancreas, were significantly affected by aquatic hydrocarbon contamination, regardless of the season.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium is a widespread heavy metal that enters the aquatic environment and affects many processes involved in fish reproduction such as sperm motility. Fish seminal plasma proteins can protect spermatozoa against toxic effects of heavy metals. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the ability of a major carp seminal plasma protein-transferrin (TF) to bind cadmium ions and to neutralize the toxic effect of cadmium on carp sperm motility. To obtain a high quantity of carp seminal plasma TF necessary for the experiment, immunoaffinity chromatography as a one-step isolation procedure was established. The titration of TF with cadmium ions spectrophotometrically at 247\u00a0nm revealed that TF binds cadmium ions at only one spectrophotometrically-sensitive binding site, which suggests that TF is capable of neutralizing the cadmium toxic effect. Indeed, the addition of carp TF to carp semen incubated with 50\u00a0ppm cadmium for 48\u00a0h led to about a four-times higher percentage of sperm motility (30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1%) in comparison to samples incubated with only 50\u00a0ppm cadmium (8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2%). Similarly, higher values of other parameters of sperm movement measured by a computer-assisted sperm motility analysis system (VSL, VCL and ALH) were observed at the presence of transferrin. In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence that transferrin from carp seminal plasma can protect sperm motility from cadmium toxicity.",

Relative expression levels of twelve candidate HKGs were examined by real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in gill and hepatopancreas of abalone following a 7-day challenge with either tributyltin chloride (TBT) or 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). The expression levels of several conventional HKGs, such as 18s rRNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and \u03b2-actin, were significantly altered by the challenges, indicating that they might not be suitable internal controls. Instead, the geNorm analysis pinpointed ribosomal protein L-5/ elongation factor 1 and ribosomal protein L-5/ succinate dehydrogenase as the most stable HKGs under TBT and E2 challenges, respectively. Moreover, these three HKGs also showed the highest stabilities overall amongst different tissues, genders and EDC challenges. The expression of a biomarker gene, cytochrome P450 4B (CYP4), was also investigated and exhibited a significant increase after the challenges. Importantly, when unsuitable HKGs were used for normalization, the influence of two EDCs on CYP4 expression was imprecisely overestimated or underestimated, which strongly emphasized the importance of selecting appropriately validated HKGs as internal controls in biomarker studies.",

     "abstract": "Our previous studies have provided evidence that birds have two isoforms of aryl hydrocarbon receptors (AHR1 and AHR2) and AHR nuclear translocators (ARNT1 and ARNT2) that potentially mediate toxic responses to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and related compounds. We have also shown that while both in vitro-expressed chicken AHR1 (ckAHR1) and AHR2 (ckAHR2) exhibit binding affinities to TCDD, only ckAHR1 but not ckAHR2 showed a TCDD-dose-dependent transactivation potency of chicken cytochrome P450 1A5 (ckCYP1A5) in in vitro reporter gene assays. To explore the molecular mechanism of functional difference in the two ckAHRs, the present study investigated the molecular characteristics and function of chicken ARNT (ckARNT) that is a potential dimerization partner for the activation of ckAHR. The full-length ckARNT1 and ckARNT2 cDNAs were isolated and their alternative splice variants were also identified. The ckARNT1 transcript was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues, but ckARNT2 showed restricted expressions in brain, kidney and eye, indicating a similar expression pattern to mammalian ARNTs. The expressions of tagged-ckARNT1 and -ckARNT2 were confirmed in a chicken hepatoma LMH cells by western blot analyses, and their interactions with each ckAHR and a specific recognition DNA element, xenobiotic response element (XRE), were examined by gel shift assays. The result showed that ckARNT1 and ckARNT2 dimerize with each ckAHR isoform and bind with the XRE in a TCDD-dependent manner. Hence, we conclude that functional loss on the dimerization with ckARNTs or the XRE binding is not the major cause of the deficient TCDD-dependency of ckAHR2 for the transactivation. Furthermore, in vitro reporter gene assays showed that transfected ckARNT1 failed to modulate the transcriptional induction of ckAHR-mediated ckCYP1A5 gene by TCDD in COS-7 and LMH cells, whereas ckARNT2 could potentiate the TCDD-dependent response in COS-7 but not in LMH cells. This suggests that ckARNT2 has a distinct role from ckARNT1 in AHR signaling pathway and in a cell-specific mode of action.",

     "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 CYP2 family enzymes are important in a variety of physiological and toxicological processes. CYP2 genes are highly diverse and orthologous relationships remain clouded among CYP2s in different taxa. Sequence and expression analyses of CYP2 genes in diapsids including birds and reptiles may improve understanding of this CYP family. We sought CYP2 genes in a liver cDNA library of the common cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), and in the genomes of other diapsids, chicken (Gallus gallus), zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), and anole lizard (Anolis carolinensis), for phylogenetic and/or syntenic analyses. Screening of the cDNA library yielded four CYP2 cDNA clones that were phylogenetically classified as CYP2C45, CYP2J25, CYP2AC1, and CYP2AF1. There are numerous newly identified diapsid CYP2 genes that include genes related to the human CYP2Cs, CYP2D6, CYP2G2P, CYP2J2, CYP2R1, CYP2U1, CYP2W1, CYP2AB1P, and CYP2AC1P. Syntenic relationships show that avian CYP2Hs are orthologous to CYP2C62P in humans, CYP2C23 in rats, and Cyp2c44 in mice, and suggest that avian CYP2Hs, along with human CYP2C62P and mouse Cyp2c44, could be renamed as CYP2C23, based upon the nomenclature rules. Analysis of sequence and synteny identifies cormorant and finch CYPs that are apparent orthologs of phenobarbital-inducible chicken CYP2C45. Transcripts of all four cormorant CYP2 genes were detected in the liver of birds from Lake Biwa, Japan. The transcript levels bore no significant relationship to levels of chlorinated organic pollutants in the liver, including polychlorinated biphenyls and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites. In contrast, concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorononanoic acid were negatively correlated with levels of CYP2C45 and/or CYP2J25, suggesting down-regulation of expression by these environmental pollutants. This study expands our view of the phylogeny and evolution of CYP2s, and provides evolutionary insight into the chemical regulation of CYP2 gene expression in diapsids including birds.",

Currently, increasing evidence suggests the significance of PDI in immune and stress responses. To clarify the role of PDIs in the innate immunity of shrimp, two PDI genes were isolated and identified from Fenneropenaeus chinensis (fleshy prawn). FcPDI1 is 1878\u00a0bp in length and encodes a protein of 383 amino acids. It has 18-amino acid signal peptide, 3 thioredoxin domains with 3 active sites of CGHC, and KEDL retention signal at its C-end. FcPDI1 is an atypical PDI. The open reading frame of FcPDI2 encodes a 497-amino acid protein and shows the classical domain organization a-b-b\u2032-a\u2032. Phylogenic analysis and multiple alignments show that FcPDI1 is similar to PDI that contains 3 thioredoxin domains from other species including invertebrates and vertebrates. FcPDI2, LvPDI, and insect PDIs are grouped into one cluster and are similar to PDIs having a-b-b\u2032-a\u2032 domain organization. Tissue distribution shows that FcPDI1 and FcPDI2 were expressed in all detected tissues at the mRNA level. Changes in FcPDI1 and FcPDI2 expression at the mRNA level in hemocytes, hepatopancreas, gills, and ovaries upon Vibrio or white spot syndrome virus challenge were also analyzed. The results suggest that FcPDI1 and FcPDI2 might have roles in the innate immunity of shrimp.

During the exposure experiments, no mortalities occurred. The most effective metal concentrations, which caused significant alterations, were determined to be 42\u00a0\u03bcmol/L Co2+ (10\u00a0mg CoCl2\u00b76H2O/L) and 3.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L Zn+\u00a02 (1\u00a0mg ZnSO4\u00b77H2O/L).

The results indicate that micromolar cobalt and zinc exposure causes significant attenuation in the expressions of these three genes' time dependently.

The cause of this TFM-induced ATP deficit is unclear. One possibility is that TFM uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, thus impairing ATP production. To test this hypothesis, mitochondria were isolated from the livers of sea lamprey and rainbow trout, and O2 consumption rates were measured in the presence of TFM or 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), a known uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation. TFM and 2,4-DNP markedly increased State IV respiration in a dose-dependent fashion, but had no effect on State III respiration, which is consistent with uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. To determine how TFM uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation, the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (TMP) was recorded using the mitochondria-specific dye rhodamine 123. Mitochondrial TMP decreased by 22% in sea lamprey, and by 28% in trout following treatment with 50\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 TFM. These findings suggest that TFM acted as a protonophore, dissipating the proton motive force needed to drive ATP synthesis.

Characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they are structurally similar to magainins (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, CPF (2 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, XPF (1 peptide) that have been previously isolated from other species of the genus Xenopus. The magainins and the XPF peptide were active only against the Gram-negative microorganism Escherichia coli whereas the CPF peptides were also active against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the secretions, CPF-C1 (GFGSLLGKALRLG ANVL.NH2) inhibited the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC\u00a0\u2264\u00a025\u00a0\u03bcM) suggesting potential for development into an anti-infective agent for use against these emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens.",

Twenty-seven differentially expressed genes were identified, which were associated with the cytoskeleton, development, metabolism, nucleic acid/protein binding, and signal transduction. Among these genes, those encoding molecular biomarkers known to be involved in metabolism, ATP hydrolysis, and protein regulation were strongly induced at the transcription level, and genes encoding one structural protein subunit or involved in lipid metabolism were strongly downregulated. The same trends in gene expression changes were observed with real-time PCR analysis of 12 selected clones. The genes identified could be used as molecular biomarkers of biological responses to polychlorinated camphene contamination in aquatic environments.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously produced and eliminated by living organisms normally maintaining ROS at certain steady-state levels. Under some circumstances, the balance between ROS generation and elimination is disturbed leading to enhanced ROS level called \u201coxidative stress\u201d. The primary goal of this review is to characterize two principal mechanisms of protection against oxidative stress \u2014 regulation of membrane permeability and antioxidant potential. The ancillary goals of this work are to describe up to date knowledge on the regulation of the previously mentioned mechanisms and to identify areas of prospective research and emerging directions in investigation of adaptation to oxidative stress. The ubiquity for challenges leading to oxidative stress development calls for identification of common mechanisms. They are cysteine residues and [Fe,S]-clusters of specific regulatory proteins. The latter mechanism is realized via SoxR bacterial protein, whereas the former mechanism is involved in operation of bacterial OxyR regulon, yeast H2O2-stimulon, plant NPR1/TGA and Rap2.4a systems, and animal Keap1/Nrf2, NF-\u03baB and AP-1, and others. Although hundreds of studies have been carried out in the field with different taxa, the comparative analysis of adaptive response is quite incomplete and therefore, this work aims to cover a plethora of phylogenetic groups to delineate common mechanisms. In addition, this article raises some questions to be elucidated and points out future directions of this research. The comparative approach is used to shed light on fundamental principles and mechanisms of regulation of antioxidant systems. The idea is to provide starting points from which we can develop novel tools and hypothesis to facilitate meaningful investigations in the physiology and biochemistry of organismic response to oxidative stress.",

The preclinical pharmacology of structurally characterized marine compounds isolated from marine animals, algae, fungi and bacteria is discussed in a comprehensive manner. Antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis and antiviral activities were reported for 74 marine natural products. Additionally, 59 marine compounds were reported to affect the cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems as well as to possess anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, 65 marine metabolites were shown to bind to a variety of receptors and miscellaneous molecular targets, and thus upon further completion of mechanism of action studies, will contribute to several pharmacological classes. Marine pharmacology research during 2007\u20138 remained a global enterprise, with researchers from 26 countries, and the United States, contributing to the preclinical pharmacology of 197 marine compounds which are part of the preclinical marine pharmaceuticals pipeline. Sustained preclinical research with marine natural products demonstrating novel pharmacological activities, will probably result in the expansion of the current marine pharmaceutical clinical pipeline, which currently consists of 13 marine natural products, analogs or derivatives targeting a limited number of disease categories.",

     "abstract": "Photogenic organs (photophores) of the velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax) are under hormonal control, since melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger luminescence while \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) prevents this light to be emitted. A recent study supported, however, the presence of numerous nerve fibres in the photogenic tissue of this shark. Immunohistochemical and pharmacological results collected in this work support these nerve fibres to be inhibitory GABAergic nerves since (i) GABA immunoreactivity was detected inside the photogenic tissue, where previous labelling detected the nerve fibre structures and (ii) GABA was able to inhibit MT and PRL-induced luminescence, which was on the other hand increased by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline (BICU). In addition, we also demonstrated that BICU can induce light per se by provoking pigment retraction in the pigmented cells composing the iris-like structure of the photophore, attaining, however, only about 10% of hormonally induced luminescence intensity at 10\u2212\u00a03\u00a0mol\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01. This strongly supports that a GABA inhibitory tonus controls photophore \u201caperture\u201d in the photogenic tissue of E. spinax but also that MT and PRL have more than one target cell type in the photophores.",

The antibacterial effects of king cobra venom LAAO were tested against several strains of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli using broth microdilution assay. For comparison, the antibacterial effects of several antibiotics (cefotaxime, kanamycin, tetracycline, vancomycin and penicillin) were also examined using the same conditions. King cobra venom LAAO was very effective in inhibiting the two Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus and S. epidermidis) tested, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.78\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (0.006\u00a0\u03bcM) and 1.56\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (0.012\u00a0\u03bcM) against S. aureus and S. epidermidis, respectively. The MICs are comparable to the MICs of the antibiotics tested, on a weight basis. However, the LAAO was only moderately effective against three Gram-negative bacteria tested (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), with MIC ranges from 25 to 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL (0.2\u20130.4\u00a0\u03bcM). Catalase at the concentration of 1\u00a0mg/mL abolished the antibacterial effect of LAAO, indicating that the antibacterial effect of the enzyme involves generation of hydrogen peroxide. Binding studies indicated that king cobra venom LAAO binds strongly to the Gram-positive S. aureus and S. epidermidis, but less strongly to the Gram-negative E. coli and P. aeruginosa, indicating that specific binding to bacteria is important for the potent antibacterial activity of the enzyme.",

Lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase and catalase activity and total Fe content were estimated in the digestive glands (DG) of L. elliptica. The labile Fe pool (LIP) represents the amount of cellular Fe responsible for catalyzing radical-dependent reactions. LIP assessed by the calcein assay, represents 3.5% of the total Fe in L. elliptica. Experimental isolation of ferritin (Ft) was performed. Subunit analyses of the protein by SDS-polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the protein was composed of 20.6\u00a0kDa protein subunits, consistent with the horse spleen Ft and the molecular weight markers, however, a higher molecular mass subunit could appear. The identity of the protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The nitrate\u00a0+\u00a0nitrite content was 73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0pmol/mg fresh mass (FW). The nitric oxide (NO) content in DG homogenates, assessed by electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping measurements using the NO trap sodium-N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate\u2013Fe at room temperature, was 30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0pmol/mg FW. Nitric oxide synthase-like activity (1.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0pmol/mg FW min) was assessed by measuring NO production by EPR in the presence of L-arginine (L-A) and NADPH. This activity was significantly inhibited by L-A analogs such as N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (-\u00a077%) and N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine (-\u00a062%), or by the lack of added L-A (-55%). The data presented here documented the physiological presence of labile Fe, Ft and highly reactive nitrogen species, and are the first evidence that support the hypothesis that NO being generated in L. elliptica might contribute to restrict oxidative damage by a close link with Fe metabolism.",

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids. In order to better understand the potential of environmental NSAIDS for interruption of normal levels of COX products in fishes, we developed an LC/MS/MS-based approach for tissue analysis of 7 prostanoids. Initial studies examining muscle, gut and gill demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was the most abundant of the measured prostanoids in all tissues and that gill tissue had the highest and most consistent concentrations of PGE2. After short-term 48-h laboratory exposures to nominal concentrations of 5, 25, 50 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L ibuprofen, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L exposure concentrations resulted in significant reduction of gill tissue PGE2 concentration by approximately 30% and 80% respectively. The lower exposures did not result in significant reductions when compared to unexposed controls. Measured tissue concentrations of ibuprofen indicated that this NSAID had little potential for bioconcentration (BCF\u00a0=\u00a01.3) and the IC50 of ibuprofen for inhibition of PGE2 production in gill tissue was estimated to be 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM.",

Zebrafish were exposed to the neurotoxicants copper chloride (CuCl, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.6\u00a0\u03bcM, or 6.3, 16, 40\u00a0ppb), chlorpyrifos (CPF, 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM, 0.6\u00a0\u03bcM, or 35, 88, 220\u00a0ppb) and binary mixtures for 24\u00a0h to better understand the effects of Cu on CPF neurotoxicity. Exposure to CPF increased the number of animals undergoing freeze responses (an anti-predator behavior) and, at the highest CPF dose (0.6\u00a0\u03bcM), elicited a decrease in zebrafish swimming rates. Interestingly, the addition of Cu caused a reduction in the number of zebrafish in the CPF exposure groups undergoing freeze responses. There was no evidence of additive or synergistic toxicity between Cu and CPF. Although muscle AChE activity was significantly reduced by CPF, there was a relatively poor relationship among muscle AChE concentrations and swimming behavior, suggesting non-muscle AChE mechanisms in the loss of swimming behavior. In summary, we have observed a modulating effect of Cu on CPF swimming impairment that appears to involve both AChE and non-AChE mechanisms. Our study supports the utility of zebrafish in understanding chemical mixture interactions and neurobehavioral injury.",

Larvae were exposed 48\u00a0h to AM 3 and 6\u00a0mg/L or CB 10 and 20\u00a0mg/L. Cholinesterase and carboxylesterases were strongly inhibited by CB and AM. In insecticide-exposed larvae, carboxylesterases may serve as alternative targets protecting cholinesterase from inhibition. GSH-S-transferase (GST) activity was significantly increased by CB and AM. Superoxide dismutase activity increased in tadpoles exposed to 6\u00a0mg/L AM. Conversely, catalase (CAT) was significantly inhibited by both pesticides. GSH levels, GSH reductase and GSH peroxidase activities were not significantly affected by pesticide exposure. GST increase constitutes an important adaptive response to CB and AM exposure, as this enzyme has been related to pesticide tolerance in amphibian larvae. Besides, the ability to sustain GSH levels in spite of CAT inhibition indicates quite a good antioxidant response. In R. arenarum larvae, CAT and GST activities together with esterases could be used as biomarkers of CB and AM exposure.",

By fusion with bacterial signal peptide, chicken POR gene was functionally expressed in E. coli membrane and showed activities in reduction of cytochrome c and oxidation of NADPH. The Km values for cytochrome c and NADPH were 21.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0\u03bcM and 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. A Ping-Pong mechanism was proposed for chicken POR.",

We have previously reported the cloning and characterisation of the koala CYP4A15, the first reported member of the CYP4 family from marsupials, and have demonstrated important species differences in CYP4A activity and tissue expression. In the present study, the cloning of CYP4B1 in the wallaby (Macropus eugenii) and their expression across marsupials is described. Rabbit anti-mouse CYP4B1 antibody detected immunoreactive proteins in lung and liver microsomes from all test marsupials, with relative weak signal detected from the koala, suggesting a species-specific expression. Microsomal 2-aminofluorene bio-activation (a CYP4B1 marker) in wallaby lung was comparable to that of rabbit, with significant higher activities detected in wallaby liver and kidneys compared to rabbit. A 1548\u00a0bp wallaby lung CYP4B complete cDNA, designated CYP4B1, which encodes a protein of 510 amino acids and shares 72% nucleotide and 69% amino acid sequence identity to human CYP4B1, was cloned by polymerase chain reaction approaches. The results demonstrate the presence of wallaby CYP4B1 that shares several common features with other published CYP4Bs; however the wallaby CYP4B1 cDNA contains four extra amino acid residues at the NH2-terminal, a fundamentally conserved transmembrane anchor of all eukaryote CYPs.",

Zebrafish were subjected to 1, 3 and 5\u00a0mg/L MP and the proteomic changes in their brains were revealed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Six protein spots were observed to be significantly changed by MP exposure. Among these, 4 spots were down-regulated, while 2 spots were up-regulated. These altered spots were excised from the gels and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and database searching. The results indicate that these proteins were involved in binding, catalysis, regulation of energy metabolism and cell structure. These data may provide novel biomarkers for the evaluation of MP contamination and useful insights for understanding the mechanisms of MP toxicity.",

Although recently banned, it still threatens coastal water ecosystems and accumulates in filter-feeding molluscs. TBT is known to act as a membrane-active toxicant; however data on mussels are scanty and exposure effects on mitochondrial ATPase activities remain hitherto unexplored. TBT effects on the mitochondrial Mg-ATPase activities in the digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated both in vitro and in TBT-exposed mussels. Both an oligomycin-sensitive Mg-ATPase (OS Mg-ATPase) (70% of total Mg-ATPase activity) and an oligomycin-insensitive ATPase (OI Mg-ATPase) (30%) were found. The OS-Mg-ATPase was as much as 70% in vitro inhibited by 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM (203\u00a0\u03bcg/L) TBT, while higher concentrations promoted a partial inhibition release up to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcM TBT; higher than 10.0\u00a0\u03bcM TBT concentrations yielded nearly complete enzyme inhibition. Concentrations higher than 1\u00a0\u03bcM TBT enhanced the OI Mg-ATPase. Mussels exposed to 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L TBT in aquaria showed a 30% depressed OS Mg-ATPase activity, irrespective of TBT dose and exposure time (24 and 120\u00a0h). The OI Mg-ATPase activity was apparently refractory to TBT exposure and halved both in control and TBT-exposed mussels after 120\u00a0h exposure.",

Additionally, acute (96-h) and chronic (30-d) bioassays were performed for P. promelas to more clearly define the influence of pH (5.5\u20138.3) on Pb toxicity as modified by addition of HCl or NaOH using an automated titration system. Results indicate that Ca2+ is protective against acute Pb toxicity to P. promelas but not C. dubia. Strong protection was afforded by DOC and NaHCO3 against acute Pb toxicity to P. promelas, whereas milder protection was observed for C. dubia with both parameters. Dissolved Pb LC50s from the P. promelas pH bioassays revealed a complex effect of pH on Pb toxicity, likely explained in part by Pb speciation and the competitive interaction of H+ with ionic Pb2+. Chronic pH bioassays also demonstrated that 30-d growth is not impaired in fathead minnows at relevant Pb concentrations. The findings reported herein suggest that development of separate BLMs for P. promelas and C. dubia should be considered.",

     "abstract": "Prior to hatching, the zebrafish embryo is surrounded by an acellular envelope, the chorion. Despite repeated speculations, it could not be clarified unequivocally whether the chorion represents an effective barrier and, thus, protects the embryo from exposure to distinct chemicals. Potentially, there is a risk of generating false negative results in developmental toxicity studies due to limited permeability of the chorion for some compounds. The simplest way to exclude this is to remove the chorion and expose the \u201cnaked\u201d embryo. In the context of ecotoxicity testing, standardized protocols do not exist for fish embryo dechorionation, and survival rates of dechorionated embryos have usually not been subjected to statistical analysis. Since reproducibly high survival rates are of fundamental importance for chemical toxicity assessment, the present study was designed to develop and optimize a dechorionation procedure. With appropriate modifications of the fish embryo test protocol, embryos can be dechorionated at 24\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf) with survival rates of \u2265\u00a090%. However, for fish embryo tests with dechorionated embryos, the standard positive control test substance, 3,4-dichloroaniline, should be replaced by another compound, e.g., acetone, since 3,4-dichloroaniline exerts its effects during the first 24\u00a0h of development. Dechorionation of younger stages (<\u00a024\u00a0hpf) is generally possible, however with lower survival rates. The effect of dechorionation was demonstrated with the cationic polymer Luviquat HM 552, which is blocked by the chorion non-dechorionated embryos due to its molecular weight of ~\u00a0400,000 Dalton, but becomes strongly toxic after dechorionation.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the sex ratio, vitellogenin (Vtg)-like proteins, serotonin, arachidonate cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and dopamine status in wild mussels living at sites upstream and downstream of two municipal effluent outfalls in the Mille-\u00celes River (Quebec, Canada). Gonad integrity was also studied by monitoring the gonado-somatic index (GSI), the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC) for purine synthesis, and changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO). The results showed that the proportion of females was dramatically increased from 30% at the upstream sites to 80% at the downstream sites. The levels of Vtg-like proteins were significantly elevated in the male mussels only. Male mussels downstream of the municipal effluent plumes expressed female-specific protein bands (Vtg-like), as determined by high-resolution gel electrophoresis and silver staining. The serotonin/dopamine ratio was significantly decreased in the downstream mussels, indicating that the gonad was in a state of early vitellogenesis. However, this change was not accompanied by changes in ATC, suggesting no significant egg production was underway; this was confirmed by the observation that the downstream mussels displayed significantly low GSIs. GSIs were rather dependent on the serotonin/dopamine ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a00.44; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while Vtg-like proteins were dependent on dopamine levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.50; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The increase in COX activity at the downstream sites and its close relationship with increased serotonin levels suggest a concomitant serotonergic signalling in addition to VTG production. The production of Vtg-like proteins combined with the serotonergic effects of the municipal effluents was associated with oxidative damage (LPO) in the gonad. This study provides the first evidence of feminization in wild mussel populations and the disruption in gonad physiology by exposure to municipal effluents.",

Size-matched pairs of toadfish were implanted intraperitoneally with the same dose of fluoxetine (0, 10 or 25\u00a0\u03bcg g\u2212\u00a01). After a social interaction between a pair of fish, circulating levels of serotonin (5-HT; 5-hydroxytryptamine) and cortisol were measured and relative mRNA expression of the 5-HT1A receptor in the toadfish brain was determined using quantitative (real-time) PCR (qPCR). Behavioral endpoints such as the number of aggressive acts and swimming activity were also quantified so that dominant and subordinate fish could be identified. Fluoxetine treatment resulted in an increase in circulating levels of 5-HT, regardless of social status. Circulating cortisol concentrations were unaffected by fluoxetine, but were significantly higher in subordinate individuals when compared to dominant fish. Toadfish brain 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was not affected by treatment or social status. Lastly and contrary to our predictions, fluoxetine treatment resulted in an increase in the number of aggressive acts made by dominant individuals, with no differences in the level of aggression or swimming activity of subordinate fish. This study is the first to describe elevated aggression in a teleost fish with elevated circulating levels of 5-HT.",

Complete Km-O6-MGMT cDNA was 1324\u00a0bp in length, and the open reading frame of 567\u00a0bp encoded a polypeptide of 188 amino acid residues. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Km-O6-MGMT was clustered with those of other fish species. Embryo, juveniles, and aged secondary fish had low levels of Km-O6-MGMT mRNA than adults, indicating more susceptibility to DNA damage by alkylating agent exposure during these developmental stages. Km-O6-MGMT mRNA levels differed according to tissue type and was highest in the liver. Exposure to an alkylating agent, N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) exposure increased the mRNA expression of tumor suppressor gene such as p53 and oncogenes such as R-ras1, R-ras3, N-ras, c-fos as well as Km-O6-MGMT mRNA in a time-dependent manner. On the contrary, several (anti)estrogenic compounds (17\u03b2-estradiol 100\u00a0ng/L, tamoxifen 10\u00a0\u03bcg/L, bisphenol A 600\u00a0\u03bcg/L, and 4-tert-octylphenol 300\u00a0\u03bcg/L) suppressed mRNA expression of Km-O6-MGMT in most tissues, especially the liver. In juvenile fish, 17\u03b2-estradiol, bisphenol A, and 4-tert-octylphenol also decreased the expression of Km-O6-MGMT mRNA in a time-dependent manner.

In this study we have determined the oxidative stress and the mRNA content of four antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase, and superoxide dismutase) during Japanese rice fish embryogenesis (from 0\u00a0day post-fertilization to hatching) and after exposing the embryos to ethanol (100 and 300\u00a0mM) for 48\u00a0h at three stages (0\u20132, 1\u20133 and 4\u20136\u00a0days post-fertilization, dpf) of organogenesis. We observed that oxidative stress was minimal in blastula, gastrula or neurula stages, increased gradually with the advancement of morphogenesis and reached its maximum level in hatchlings. The antioxidant enzyme mRNAs were constitutively expressed throughout development; however, the expression pattern was not identical among the enzymes. Catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) mRNAs were minimal in the fertilized eggs, but increased significantly in 1\u00a0dpf and then either sharply dropped (SOD) or maintained a steady-state (catalase). Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) was very high in fertilized eggs and sharply dropped 1\u00a0dpf and then gradually increased thereafter. Glutathione reductase (GR) maintained a steady-state throughout the development. Ethanol was able to attenuate oxidative stress in embryos exposed only to 300\u00a0mM 1\u20133\u00a0dpf; no significant difference with controls was observed in other ethanol-treated groups. The antioxidant enzyme mRNAs also remained unaltered after ethanol treatment. From these data we conclude that the attenuation of oxidative stress by ethanol is probably due to the inhibition of normal growth of the embryos rather than by inhibiting catalase, GST, GR or SOD-dependent activities.",

Our transactivation assay employs a fish cell line and uses recombinant proteins combining the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain with the ligand-binding domain of PPARs from plaice (Pleuronectes platessa).

However, little is known about the toxicity of these brominated derivatives. An appraisal on the ecotoxicity of B4BPA and its derivatives was carried out with several bioassays representing organisms (bacteria, algae, micro-invertebrates and fish) of different taxonomic groups present in aquatic ecosystems. Endpoint values showed that B4BPA was significantly less toxic than the other chemicals when tested with the Microtox and algal asssays. A similar trend was observed with other bioassays for BPA. One of the brominated derivatives was particularly toxic: B2BPA. The LuminoTox assay and the rainbow trout hepatocytes assay reported the most significant toxicity for this derivative. Its toxicity was also significantly higher than the other compounds barring B3BPA when tested with the micro-crustacean test.",

     "abstract": "Prolactin plays an essential role in ion uptake as well as reduction in ion and water permeability of osmoregulatory surfaces in euryhaline fish. Kryptolebias marmoratus is a euryhaline fish with unique internal self-fertilization. In order to understand the effect of different salinities and environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on the regulation of prolactin (PRL) and prolactin receptor (PRLR) genes, the full-length sequences of PRL and two PRLR genes were cloned from K. marmoratus. The expression pattern of K. marmoratus PRL (Km-PRL) and PRLR (Km-PRLR1, Km-PRLR2) mRNAs was analyzed in different developmental stages (2\u00a0dpf to 5\u00a0h post-hatching) and tissues of hermaphrodite fish. To investigate the effects of salinity changes and EDC exposure, the mRNA expression pattern of PRL, PRLR1 and PRLR2 was analyzed in exposed fish. The Km-PRL mRNA in the hermaphrodite was predominantly expressed in the brain/pituitary, the Km-PRLR1 mRNA was highly expressed in the intestine, while the Km-PRLR2 mRNA was intensively expressed in the gills. The expression of the Km-PRL mRNA generally increased from stage 1 (2\u00a0dpf) to stage 3 (12\u00a0dpf) in a developmental, stage-dependent manner. It decreased in stage 4 (12\u00a0dpf) and the hatching stage (stage 5). Km-PRLR1 and Km-PRLR2 mRNAs showed a gradual increase in expression from stage 1 (2\u00a0dpf) to stage 4 (12\u00a0dpf) and decreased by stage 5 (5\u00a0h post-hatching). Also, both mRNAs of PRLR showed a different expression pattern after exposure to different salinity concentrations (0, 33, and 50\u00a0ppt) in juvenile fish. The expression of PRL mRNA was upregulated at 0\u00a0ppt, but was downregulated at a moderately higher salinity concentration (33 to 50\u00a0ppt). The Km-PRLR1 mRNA showed upregulation at freshwater stress (0\u00a0ppt) compared to other concentrations of salinity (33\u00a0ppt to 50\u00a0ppt). The Km-PRLR2 mRNA was marginally upregulated at freshwater stress (0\u00a0ppt), but was downregulated at a higher salinity concentration (50\u00a0ppt) and showed no significant change in expression at 33\u00a0ppt salinity. Interestingly, both mRNAs showed upregulation in the brain (e.g. Km-PRL) and intestine (e.g. Km-PRLR1) after EDC exposure. These findings suggested that Km-PRL and two Km-PRLR mRNAs would be useful in analyzing the effect of different salinities as well as the modulatory effect of EDC exposure on these gene expressions in K. marmoratus.",

The deduced protein contains 171 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass (MW) about 19.8\u00a0kDa and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 4.792. Amino acid alignment revealed that HdhNFT shared high similarity with other known ferritins. The HdhNFT contained a highly conserved motif for the ferroxidase center, which consists of seven residues of a typical vertebrate heavy-chain ferritin with a typical stem-loop structure. HdhNFT mRNA contains a 27\u00a0bp iron-responsive element (IRE) in the 5\u2032-untranslated region. This IRE exhibited 82.14% similarity with abalone H. discus discus and 78.57% similarity with Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas IREs. By real-time PCR assays, the mRNA transcripts of HdhNFT were found to be higher expressed in kidney, hepatopancreas, gill, mantle and muscle than in haemocytes and gonad. Moreover, mRNA expression levels of HdhNFT in the hepatopancreas and haemocytes were measured by real-time PCR in abalone fed with graded levels of dietary iron (29.2, 65.7, 1267.2 and 6264.7\u00a0mg/kg). Results showed that the expression of the HdhNFT mRNA increased with dietary iron contents. Furthermore, the maximum value of the HdhNFT mRNA was found in the treatment with 6264.7\u00a0mg/kg of dietary iron. These data indicated that dietary iron can up-regulate HdhNFT at transcriptional level in abalone.",

The estimated elimination half-life (T1/2) after IV administration of STX in salmon was 102.6\u00a0min. The volume of distribution (Vz) was observed to be 467.2\u00a0mL/kg and the total body clearance (ClT) was 3.2\u00a0mL/min/kg. Waterborne exposure clearly showed that salmon absorbed PSP toxins directly from the water. In cod, 3H-STX was observed in gills, muscle, brain, liver and posterior kidney from 30 to 480\u00a0min. The lowest concentrations of 3H-STX were found in brain and muscle, whereas posterior kidney contained the majority of the toxin. Autoradiograms confirmed the high levels of 3H-STX in the kidneys, indicating that renal excretion was the main elimination route.

To obtain a better understanding on the modulation of gonadotropin subunit genes expression upon bisphenol A (BPA) exposure in hermaphroditic fish, we studied differential regulation of gonadotropin subunit genes from Kryptolebias marmoratus after the exposure of several EDCs. Expression profiles of these three genes when using quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that brain/pituitary tissues were highly expressed in these genes compared to other tissues. At different developmental stages, expression of those genes dramatically increased over the course of development but showed a decrease in expression at the secondary male (showing atresia) stage. When adult fish were exposed to BPA (600\u00a0\u03bcg/L for 96\u00a0h), a significant upregulation of these three genes was observed in the brain/pituitary. A time course study also revealed the increased expression of gonadotropin subunit genes over 12\u00a0h with a more pronounced effect on the expression of FSH-\u03b2 and LH-\u03b2 genes, indicating that both genes were associated with the BPA exposure on the transcriptional regulation. This is the first report of gonadotropin subunit genes from K. marmoratus, with particular emphasis on the modulation of their expressions by EDCs. In addition, these findings suggest that EDCs modulate the expression of gonadotropin subunit genes and would act as potential biomarkers upon EDCs exposure.",

For the time-course experiment, all the antioxidant genes were significantly induced over time except for Cu/Zn-SOD in the liver, and there was a 5-fold induction in hepatic GR, CAT, and Mn-SOD mRNA compared to the control. These findings indicate that the liver of T. obscurus has a robust antioxidant system.

We have identified the site of damage caused by copper to the symbiotic cnidarian, Zoanthus robustus (Anthozoa, Hexacorallia). External changes to the zoanthids were apparent when compared with controls. The normally flexible bodies contracted and became rigid. Histological examination of the zoanthid tissue revealed that copper had caused sub-cellular changes to proteins within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tubular body. Collagen in the ECM and the internal septa increased in thickness to five and seven times that of controls respectively. The epithelium, which stained for elastin, was also twice as thick and tough to cut, but exposure to copper did not change the total amount of desmosine which is found only in elastin. We conclude that copper stimulated collagen synthesis in the ECM and also caused cross-linking of existing proteins. However, there was no expulsion of the symbiotic algae (Symbiodinium sp.) and no effect on algal pigments or respiration (44, 66 and 110\u00a0\u00b5g Cu L\u22121). A decrease in net photosynthesis was observed only at the highest copper concentration (156\u00a0\u00b5g Cu L\u22121).

The activity of catalase enzyme also showed a similar increasing pattern when exposed to these model stressors. The full-length catalase cDNA of D. magna was cloned using mixed primers by the method of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR.

     "abstract": "Multixenobiotic transporters have been extensively studied for their ability to modulate the disposition and toxicity of pharmacological agents, yet their influence in regulating the levels of dietary toxins within marine consumers has only recently been explored. This study presents functional and molecular evidence for multixenobiotic transporter-mediated efflux activity and expression in the generalist gastropod Cyphoma gibbosum, and the specialist nudibranch Tritonia hamnerorum, obligate predators of chemically defended gorgonian corals. Immunochemical analysis revealed that proteins with homology to permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) were highly expressed in T. hamnerorum whole animal homogenates and localized to the apical tips of the gut epithelium, a location consistent with a role in protection against ingested prey toxins. In vivo dye assays with specific inhibitors of efflux transporters demonstrated the activity of P-gp and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) families of ABC transporters in T. hamnerorum. In addition, we identified eight partial cDNA sequences encoding two ABCB and two ABCC proteins from each molluscan species. Digestive gland transcripts of C. gibbosum MRP-1, which have homology to vertebrate glutathione-conjugate transporters, were constitutively expressed regardless of gorgonian diet. This constitutive expression may reflect the ubiquitous presence of high affinity substrates for C. gibbosum glutathione transferases in gorgonian tissues likely necessitating export by MRPs. Our results suggest that differences in multixenobiotic transporter expression patterns and activity in molluscan predators may stem from the divergent foraging strategies of each consumer.",

     "abstract": "The Harderian gland is an orbital gland found in many tetrapod species that possess a nictitating membrane. While the main role of the Harderian gland is lubrication of the eyeballs, numerous other functions are attributed to this gland. In amphibians, mast cells have been detected in the Harderian gland, suggesting that the gland is involved in the host's system of innate immunity defending against microbial invasions. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we cloned from the bullfrog Harderian gland total RNA preparations, cDNAs encoding biosynthetic precursors for the antimicrobial peptides temporin-CBa (FLPIASLLGKYL-NH2), previously isolated from an extract of bullfrog skin, and chensirin-2CBa (IIPLPLGYFAKKP) that contained the amino acid substitution Thr13\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Pro compared with chensirin-2 from the Chinese brown frog, Rana chensinensis. By means of in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes for preprotemporin-CBa and preprochensirin-2CBa, we have demonstrated for the first time in an amphibian the presence of mRNAs encoding these two precursors in the cytoplasm of the glandular cells in the bullfrog Harderian gland.",

Our data show higher plasma concentrations of free triiodothyronine (T3), and ratios of free and total T3 in Baltic seals as compared to Svalbard seals. Baltic seals had also higher hepatic mRNA expressions of deiodinase-I, thyroid hormone receptor \u03b2, retinoic acid receptor \u03b1, growth hormone receptor and interleukin-1\u03b2 compared to Svalbard seals. Levels of plasma retinol were lower in the Baltic seals as compared to Svalbard seals. No geographical difference was observed for other thyroid hormone levels and hepatic retinoid levels. Ratios of free and total T3 were positively correlated to OH-POPs in plasma. The results of the present study suggest that endocrine homeostasis may be affected by contaminant and metabolite exposure in the Baltic ringed seals with respect to circulating hormones and retinol and hepatic mRNA expressions. In addition, OH-POPs may putatively produce the disruption of thyroid hormone transport in plasma.",

RT-PCR analysis revealed that the rare minnow cyp19a1a mRNA was predominantly expressed in ovary while cyp19a1b was predominantly expressed in brain. Sequences for binding sites of steroidogenic factor-1, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, estrogen responsive element, glucocorticoid responsive element, and retinoic acid receptor were identified on promoter regions of cyp19a1 genes. The influence of several EDCs on the transcript abundance of cyp19a1a and cyp19a1b was investigated in rare minnow juveniles. Clofibrate did not influence the expression of either cyp19a1 genes. Exposure to 1\u00a0nM ethinylestradiol (EE2) for 3\u00a0days significantly downregulated the expression of cyp19a1a gene, however 0.1 and 1\u00a0nM EE2 significantly increased the gene expression of cyp19a1b. Exposure to 100 and 1000\u00a0nM 4-nonylphenol (NP) significantly suppressed the cyp19a1a expression, but it had no effect on the expression of cyp19a1b gene. Bisphenol A (BPA) strongly suppressed the cyp19a1b gene expression from 0.1 to 10\u00a0nM and significantly suppressed the gene expression of cyp19a1a only at 10\u00a0nM. These results indicate that EDCs may influence the expression of cyp19a1 genes through differential transcriptional modulation in rare minnow juveniles.",

     "publication date": "09-2010",
     "abstract": "In general, copper is primarily an osmoregulatory toxicant to fish and Cu toxicity is thought to be related to the rate of sodium loss. Looking at a previous research it is striking that gibel carp, Carassius auratus gibelio, do not seem so susceptible to the first ionoregulatory shock phase of Cu exposure, but rather build up physiological disturbances slowly until mortality occurs. Since it was noted that gibel carp experience severe hypoxia under Cu exposure, we hypothesised that, besides the Na loss, the slow depletion of liver glycogen stores contributed equally to the collapse of physiological integrity. It is clear from our results that glycogen stores are being depleted in Cu exposed fish and that dead fish suffered more extensive glycogen losses compared to surviving fish, with liver glycogen levels of 125\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08\u00a0mg g\u22121 in dead fish compared to 230\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0mg g\u22121 in surviving fish. However, changes in liver glycogen did not contribute significantly to mortality, while changes in whole body sodium and the rate of sodium loss did. Whole body Na levels dropped from 1111\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0\u03bcg g\u22121 dry weight in control fish to 850\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054\u00a0\u03bcg g\u22121 in surviving fish and to 607\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0\u03bcg g\u2212\u00a01 in fish that had died resulting in Na loss rates of 1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22\u00a0\u03bcg g\u2212\u00a01 h\u2212\u00a01 and 3.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19\u00a0\u03bcg g\u2212\u00a01 h\u2212\u00a01 in surviving and dead fish respectively.

Zebrafish eggs showed less sensitivity to Cr (VI) (96\u00a0h-LC50\u00a0=\u00a0145.7\u00a0mg/L) than adults (96\u00a0h-LC50\u00a0=\u00a039.4\u00a0mg/L) probably due to the protective action of the chorion. However, biomarkers were much more responsive in larvae than in adults and gave clear indications about Cr (VI) mode of action: it seems to be neurotoxic (inhibited cholinesterase), to inhibit glutathione S-transferase activity and to interfere with cellular metabolic activity (changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity) in larvae. In adults, only glutathione S-transferase was responsive, showing a clear inhibition. The responsiveness of the analyzed biomarkers in larvae reinforces the idea of the usefulness of early life stage assays in the assessment of chemicals effects. Moreover, early life stage assays also contributed with relevant information regarding anomalies in larvae development and behavior. Further research should focus on the use of biomarkers to assess long term effects which are ecologically more relevant.",

In order to verify the role of either NHE, or NADPH oxidase and NO synthase in Cd-mediated toxicity, inhibitors such as ethyl-N-isopropyl-amiloride (EIPA), diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were used in each case. Moreover, phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA), a well-known protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated NADPH oxidase and NO synthase stimulator, as well as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a well-known genotoxic agent, was also used for elucidating the modulation of signaling molecules within cells, thus leading to the induction of lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. The results of the present study showed that micromolar concentrations of Cd (0.05\u201350\u00a0\u03bc\u039c) could enhance both lipid peroxidation and DNA damage, possible via a PKC-mediated signaling pathway with the involvement of NHE, thus leading to the induction of NADPH oxidase and NO synthase activity, since inhibition of either NHE, or NADPH oxidase and NO synthase activity, significantly attenuates Cd-induced toxic effects in each case.",

Glutathione status clearly demonstrated the development of oxidative stress, whereas changes in protein carbonyls and lipid peroxides were less pronounced. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was virtually unaffected after 24 or 96\u00a0h exposure, but 48\u00a0h exposure to Cr6+ reduced SOD activity in brain (by 30%), enhanced activity in kidney (by 28%) and had no effect on liver SOD.

The hepatic metabolism of B[a]P is a multi-step process requiring several Phase I and Phase II enzymes, notably cytochrome p450 1A (CYP1A), epoxide hydrolase (EH), and glutathione S-transferase (GST). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of arsenite (As(III)) on the activity of these enzymes in vivo utilizing adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish were exposed to either 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM B[a]P, 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM B[a]P\u00a0+\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcM As(III), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM B[a]P\u00a0+\u00a08\u00a0\u03bcM As(III), 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM As(III), or 8\u00a0\u03bcM As(III) for 7\u00a0days. Co-exposures to As(III) and B[a]P led to significant decreases in CYP1A enzyme activity (approximately 3-fold) when compared to exposure to B[a]P alone. No similar effects occurred with EH or GST, although B[a]P exposure did significantly increase EH activity. Furthermore As(III) and B[a]P co-exposures significantly decreased CYP1A transcript levels (up to 35-fold) when compared to B[a]P. However, B[a]P-induced CYP1A protein levels remained elevated following co-exposures to As(III). This evidence suggests that As(III) has the potential to modify components of the B[a]P biotransformation pathway in vivo via a disruption of CYP1A activity by way of both pre- and post-translational mechanisms.",

The nominal concentrations of atrazine tested (1, 10 and 100\u00a0\u03bcg/L) were representative of and exceeded the levels measured in the North American freshwater environment. After seven days in seawater, fish were weighed, bled for the determination of plasma electrolyte levels, euthanized and samples collected for the determination of gonadosomatic index, muscle water content and gill Na+/K\u00a0+\u00a0-ATPase activity. Measured atrazine concentrations during the freshwater exposure period were 76\u201399% of nominal levels. There were no mortalities attributed to atrazine exposure. There were also no statistically significant differences in body weight, plasma sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride levels, muscle water content or gill Na+/K\u00a0+\u00a0-ATPase activity between control and atrazine treated fish. Measurement of testis and ovary weights showed that there were no treatment effects on relative gonad size in male or female fish. These studies have shown that short term exposure to atrazine during the freshwater phase of their lifecycle had no effects on subsequent survival, body weight, relative gonad size or various measures of iono-regulatory performance in juvenile Atlantic salmon upon transfer to seawater. The concentrations of atrazine tested exceed those likely to be experienced in the natural aquatic environment suggesting that short term exposure to atrazine does not pose a risk to Atlantic salmon during the period of smoltification.",

     "abstract": "In bivalve molluscs, responses to bacterial infection have been largely characterized in terms of both functional responses and gene expression in the immune cells, the hemocytes. The effects of bacterial challenge at the tissue level, where bacterial infection may cause stressful conditions, have not been so far specifically investigated. Biomarkers are widely utilised to evaluate the health status of bivalves, from the molecular to the organism level, in response to both natural and anthropogenic stressors. In this work, the effects of in vivo challenge with heat-killed vibrio species, Vibrio splendidus LGP32 and Vibrio anguillarum (ATCC19264), on different biomarkers in the digestive gland of the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis were investigated. Mussels were injected with either vibrio and tissues sampled at 3, 6 and 24\u00a0h post injection (p.i.). Lysosomal biomarkers, such as lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) and lipofuscin accumulation, as well as specific activities of antioxidant enzymes (catalase and glutathione transferase-GST) were evaluated. Moreover, the expression of antioxidant molecules (catalase, GST-\u03c0 and metallothioneins MT10 and MT20) was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Both V. splendidus and V. anguillarum significantly affected all parameters measured, to a different extent and at different times p.i. Interestingly, whereas both vibrios induced lysosomal membrane destabilisation and increases in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, distinct responses were observed in terms of lysosomal lipofuscin accumulation and expression of antioxidant molecules. In particular, V. splendidus induced a general increase in the transcription of antioxidant genes, indicating that Mytilus digestive gland can mount an efficient antioxidant response towards this vibrio species. On the other hand, a general down-regulation or no effect was observed with V. anguillarum. The lack of this response was reflected in stronger oxidative stress conditions in the digestive gland of mussels challenged with V. anguillarum, as indicated by higher levels of lysosomal lipofuscin observed at longer times p.i. Overall, these data indicate that lysosomal and oxidative stress biomarkers could be usefully applied in order to monitor early changes in the health status of bivalves induced by bacteria. Moreover, the results support the hypothesis that host responses to bacteria may be taken into account when interpreting biomarker data in ecotoxicological studies.",

The full length of HdhGPx cDNA was 963\u00a0bp with a 669\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 222 amino acids and a 101\u00a0bp eukaryotic selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) in 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR). It was showed that HdhGPx has a characteristic codon at 235TGA237 that corresponds to selenocysteine (SeC) as U72. Sequence characterization revealed that HdhGPx contains a characteristic GPx signature motif 2 (96LGLPCNQF103), an active site motif (179WNFEKF184). In addition, two potential N-glycosylation sites (112NGTE115 and 132NLTQ135) were identified in HdhGPx. 3D modeling analysis showed that the overall structure of HdhGPx monomer had more similarity to human GPx3 than human GPx1. Relatively higher-level mRNA expression was detected in hepatopancreas, mantle and gonad by real-time PCR assays. The relative expression levels of HdhGPx mRNA in hepatopancreas and haemocytes were detected by real-time PCR in abalone fed with nine different diets containing graded levels of selenium (0.15, 1.32 and 48.7\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01), zinc (6.69, 33.85 and 710.63\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) and iron (29.17, 65.7 and 1267.2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01) for 20\u00a0weeks, respectively.

In two sub-cellular fractions (untreated cytosol and heat-treated cytosol), isolated from the whole gastrointestinal tract of indigenous chubs collected during spawning (April/May 2006) and post-spawning period (September 2006), seasonal or gender related differences of trace metals and proteins were determined. In both fractions, cytosol and heat-treated cytosol, metal levels decrease as follows: Zn\u00a0>\u00a0Fe\u00a0>\u00a0Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Mn\u00a0>\u00a0Cd and are significantly higher during the spawning period. Besides that, the level of heat-sensitive proteins (metalloenzymes) in cytosolic fractions is also significantly higher during the spawning period in both male and female specimens. Higher condition indices of chubs in the spawning period imply higher feeding activity, energy reserves and recent growth of indigenous chubs. Metallothionein levels, determined in the heat-treated cytosol, are comparable in gastrointestinal tract of feral chubs collected in both seasons and confine the background metallothionein levels, on average 3\u00a0mg\u00a0g\u22121 wet tissue. Chub spawning has been identified as a confounding factor, having an impact on cytosolic metal and protein levels, presumably due to enhanced food supply (higher condition indices) and fish spawning (higher gonadosomatic indices in some male specimens).",

The full-length cDNA of V. philippinarum GST-pi (denoted as VpGSTp) was 1142\u00a0bp, with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of 87\u00a0bp, a 3\u2032 UTR of 438\u00a0bp, and an open reading frame (ORF) of 618\u00a0bp encoding a protein of 205 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 23.9\u00a0kDa and an predicted isoelectric point (pI) of 7.9.

Tissue distribution analysis of the VpGSTp mRNA revealed that the GST-pi expression level was observed higher in gill, adductor muscle, mantle and foot while lower in digestive gland. Using quantitative real-time PCR, the dose- and time-related effects of benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P) on VpGSTp mRNA expression were investigated in gills and digestive gland. The results showed that a time-dependant increase in the expression of VpGSTp was induced by B[\u03b1]P and appeared a good linear relationship with B[\u03b1]P concentrations.

     "abstract": "The effect of in vivo Fe exposure on the oxidative metabolism of the bivalve Myaarenaria was studied. Fe was supplemented in natural seawater and resulted in a significant increase in the total Fe content in the bivalve digestive gland (DG) between 9 to 17\u00a0days of exposure. Mortality of treated animals increased drastically after day 18. Oxidative stress conditions were characterized in DG through assessment of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ascorbyl radical (A) content. Both parameters were affected following a biphasic profile showing significant increases by days 2 and 9 of Fe exposure. The content of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was significantly increased over control values by days 2, 9 and 17 of treatment. The labile Fe pool (LIP) in isolated DG was elevated over control values by day 7, and maintained this increase until day 17 of Fe exposure. The content of NO, assessed by EPR spin trapping, was 60% lower in DG of animals exposed for 2\u00a0days to Fe than in control values, with no further changes. The biphasic profile of oxidative stress response to Fe exposure in DG suggests that at early stages of Fe supplementation the cellular control mechanisms, such as CAT activity, were operative to limit oxidative damage, but further Fe exposure overwhelmed these abilities. Moreover, the second phase could be understood as the consequence of the exhaustion of cellular protective systems that could also involve NO.",

Our ISH analysis showed that cyp1a1 expression was markedly activated by 3,4-DCA in the gill and intestinal epithelia, skin epidermis, and liver parenchymal cells of adult zebrafish. Before differentiation of the gill, intestine, and liver, skin was the site of cyp1a1 activation in embryos. Unlike the cyp1a1 response, 3,4-DCA-mediated ahr activation was not marked in either adults or embryos, indicating a possibility that stable ahr transcripts persist in the cytoplasm of these cells to induce cyp1a1. Young oocytes (previtellogenic to early vitellogic stage) express ahr; however activation of cyp1a1 by 3,4-DCA was negligible in these oocytes, suggesting that ahr expression in oocytes is not directly linked to cyp1a1 activation. Based on our finding that skin epidermis up-regulates cyp1a1 in response to 3,4-DCA, we demonstrated that fin explants, which can be harvested without sacrificing fish, can be used as a standard for assaying cyp1a1 activation in addition to embryos that are now used.",

     "abstract": "It has been extensively documented that exposure of amphibians and teleost fish to exogenous steroid hormones like estrogen, androgen, xenoestrogen or steroid biosynthesis inhibitors can impair their gonadal development or induce sex reversal against genotypic sex. However, the molecular pathways underlying sexual development and the effects of sex steroids or other exogenous hormones in these aquatic vertebrates remain elusive. Recently, a germ plasm-associated piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway has been shown to be a determinant in the development of animal gonadal germline cells. In the current study, we examined whether this piRNA pathway is involved in the regulation of sex steroid hormones in gonadal development. We firstly established developmental expression patterns of three key piRNA pathway genes (mael, piwi and vasa), during Silurana (Xenopus) tropicalis embryogenesis and early larval development. All three genes exhibit high expression at early developmental stages and have significantly decreased expression thereafter, indicating a very active involvement of piRNA pathway at the beginning of embryogenesis. We further examined gene expression changes of those genes in frog larvae exposed to two sex steroid biosynthesis inhibitors, fadrozole and finasteride, both of which are known to result in male-biased or female-biased phenotypes, respectively. We found that fadrozole and finasteride exposures increased the expression of piRNA pathway genes such as mael and vasa at the larval stage when the expression of piRNA pathway genes is programmed to be very low. Therefore, our results indicate that the piRNA pathway is likely a common pathway by which different sex steroid hormones regulate gonadal sex differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the neurochemical effects of morphine, diazepam, a common benzodiazepine, and an effluent concentrate on the endemic freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed to the drugs and to the solid-phase concentrate of a municipal effluent and left to stand at 15\u00a0\u00b0C for 48\u00a0h. Neurochemical effects were determined by monitoring changes in dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) levels in the visceral mass (containing the nerve ganglia) of mussels. The activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), dopamine and serotonin-dependent adenylyl cyclase (ADC) were also determined in the mussels. Oxidative stress was determined by tracking changes in lipid peroxidation (LPO) in the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions. The results revealed that the drugs and the effluent extract were biologically active in mussels. Morphine reduced serotonin and increased dopamine in mussel tissues while reducing AChE activity and increasing GABA levels. This suggests the induction of a relaxation state in mussels. Diazepam also reduced serotonin levels but produced no change in dopamine levels. However, dopamine-sensitive ADC activity was readily activated, indicating the potential effect on opiate signaling. Diazepam increased glutamate levels slightly, but AChE remained stable. The increase in both dopamine ADC activity and glutamate concentrations was also associated with greater oxidative stress on the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions in cells. A comparison of the global response pattern of these drugs with those of the effluent extract revealed only a relative proximity to morphine. In conclusion, the data warrant more studies on the analysis of opiates and benzodiazepines in municipal effluents to better address the potential environmental hazard of these neuroactive drug classes to aquatic organisms.",

To this end, three different deltamethrin concentrations (0.25, 1, 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/L) were administrated to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at different time intervals (6, 12, 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h) in order to observe the influences of the pesticide on the activity of glutathione reductase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-ghosphogluconate dehydrogenase, and the expression of Hsp70 gene. We observed that the activities of the enzymes decreased with increasing deltamethrin concentrations and exposure time. The pesticide had more inhibitory effects on gill enzymes than those of muscle, liver and kidney. In addition, we detected that deltamethrin increased the expression of the stress-related protein Hsp70 with significant fold-chance values. The efficiency rate was 96.4% which is equal to 1.96 calculated via conversion formula used to calculate fold-chance value. We conclude that deltamethrin causes oxidative stress in fish both at protein and mRNA levels.",

However, roles of such genes on cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) expression are not fully understood. To investigate the effects of dioxins on the hepatic expression profiles of AHR1, AHR2, ARNT1 and ARNT2 in avian species, and whether the expression levels of AHRs and ARNTs affect the transcriptions of CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 genes, the eggs of common (great) cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo) collected from Lake Biwa, Japan, were in ovo administrated with 0, 1500 and 4500\u00a0pg/g egg of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and the hepatic expression levels of AHRs, ARNTs and CYP1As in embryos were monitored with two-step real-time RT-PCR. In young and adult cormorants collected from the same location, the hepatic expressions of these genes were also measured to understand the effects of growth stage. The residue levels of TCDD and other chlorinated dioxin-like congeners (DLCs) in the body of cormorants were quantified with high-resolution gas chromatography equipped with mass-spectrometry. There was no observable effect of in ovo TCDD treatment even at the highest dosage on mortality, body weight and morphology of the liver, heart, spleen, kidney and lung in the embryos. The mRNA expression of ARNT2 was slightly suppressed by the treatment with TCDD, while no alteration was observed for the expression of AHR1, AHR2 and ARNT1. Expressions of CYP1A4 and CYP1A5 were dose-dependently enhanced by TCDD, but CYP1A4 mRNA level increased more prominently than CYP1A5, indicating the difference in induction efficiency between the CYP1A isozymes. Comparison of hepatic mRNA levels of these genes among embryonic, young and adult cormorants revealed that young and adult cormorants had greater CYP1A5 expression levels than embryos, independently of the accumulation levels of DLCs. These results suggest that the hepatic induction of each CYP1A by DLCs in cormorants occurs in an isoform-specific manner and CYP1A5 expression, at least partially, depends on the factors related to the growth of cormorants, but the transcriptional processes of CYP1As are not related to the expression levels of AHRs and ARNTs. This study yielded results supporting our previous observations that in reality, high accumulation of DLCs induces hepatic CYP1A4 and 1A5 expressions in the wild cormorant population.",

In general, a significant increase was observed as exposure concentration increased. Tissue BCF values were dependent upon stage and species.

     "abstract": "Marine animals can induce metallothioneins (MTs) in their responses to exposure to certain trace metals in the environment. MTs generally function as metal storage/detoxification or homeostatic regulation of both essential and non-essential metals. This review discusses the important roles of MTs in metal biokinetics other than metal detoxification and homeostasis in marine animals. Recent studies have revealed the complicated cellular and biochemical processes involving intracellular ligands (cytosolic proteins and insoluble deposits) during metal uptake and elimination. The responses of metal biokinetics to MT induction are metal- and organism-specific. Depending on the different marine animals and metals, all biokinetic parameters such as dissolved metal uptake rate, dietary assimilation efficiency and elimination (efflux) rate can be significantly impacted by MT induction. Among the different metal biokinetic parameters, dietary assimilation efficiency and elimination rate appear to be most impacted by MT induction. MT turnover kinetics can also significantly affect metal uptake kinetics, but again, such influence is also dependent on the organism, particularly its predominant pathway of metal detoxification. Even though the total MT pool in aquatic animals may remain constant, the turnover of MTs, involving MT synthesis and breakdown, can potentially lead to a major change of metal accumulation biokinetics. We propose several issues that need to be further addressed in studying the interaction between MT induction and metal accumulation biokinetics.",

Larval and metamorphosing summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) were exposed to the dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl congener PCB 126, to compare their sensitivity to other fish species early life stages, and to document effects on metamorphic development, including degree of eye migration and gastric maturation. Median lethal doses (LD 50\u00a0s) ranged between 30 and 220\u00a0ng/g wet mass, indicating that pre- and early-metamorphic stages of summer flounder are equally sensitive to the embryos of some of the most vulnerable fish species tested. Consistent with the presence of a functional aryl hydrocarbon receptor pathway, dose-dependent induction of cytochrome P-4501A (CYP1A) at four days post-exposure was observed in liver, stomach, intestine, and kidney of metamorphosing larvae. Stage-dependent differences in the epithelial distribution of CYP1A immunoreactivity were observed in the developing stomach of fish exposed to relatively high PCB 126 doses. A single sublethal dose (15\u00a0ng/g) delayed metamorphic progress (determined by the degree of eye migration), and resulted in abnormally high levels of cell proliferation and abnormal gastric gland morphology in late metamorphic stages. These results suggest that the post-embryonic larval and metamorphic stages of summer flounder, and potentially other fish species with complex life histories, are vulnerable to the effects of dioxin-like compounds, including lethality, developmental delay, and malformations.",

Three consolidated biomarkers were measured, i.e. lysosomal membrane stability, lipofuscin and metallothionein contents. In parallel, the expressions of stress-related genes encoding metallothioneins (mt10 and mt20), 70-kDa heat shock proteins (MgHSC70 and MgHSP70), and Multi Xenobiotic Resistance-related transporters (MgPgp, MgMrp2, and MgMvp) were analyzed, to have a greater insight into the time-related evolution of the response. Significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) biomarker responses were induced after 7\u00a0days of exposure and further increased with time, whereas gene expression profiles were dramatically altered 2\u00a0days after transplanting.

Phase I and II enzymes were analyzed at the transcriptional, translational and activity levels. For gene expression patterns, quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR), using gene-sequence primers, were performed. Protein levels were analyzed using immunochemical assays of western blot with commercially available antibodies. Liver samples were analyzed for phase I and II enzyme activities using a variety of substrates including ethoxyresorufin (cytochrome (CYP)1A1/1A2), pentoxyresorufin (CYP2B), methoxyresorufin (CYP1A), benzyloxyresorufin (CYP3A), testosterone (CYP3A/CYP2B), 1-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene (CDNB) (glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and 4-nitrophenol (uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT)). In addition, the hydroxylated (OH-) polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were analyzed in the blood, liver and brain tissue, whereas the methylsulfone (MeSO2-) PCBs were analyzed in liver tissue.

We hypothesized that the induction of cytochrome P-450 1A (CYP1A), a sensitive and widely used indicator of response to aquatic contaminants, would serve as an effective biomarker of organic pollutant exposure in Lepomis species. We examined the response of CYP1A and two of the major pollutant-responsive phase II enzymes, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT), in Lepomis exposed to organic pollutants under laboratory and field conditions. Two Lepomis species (longear sunfish, Lepomis megalottis and bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus) were exposed in the laboratory via intraperitoneal injection to corn oil (vehicle), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (10 and 50\u00a0mg/kg), a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) or 3,4,3\u2032,4\u2032-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB 77) (0.1 and 1.0\u00a0mg/kg), a dioxin-like planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon (HAH), and sacrificed 2 (BaP) or 7 (corn oil, PCB77) days later. Lepomis hepatic CYP1A exhibited differential sensitivity to these two classes of environmental contaminants. CYP1A activity was weakly induced in bluegill exposed to 1.0\u00a0mg/kg PCB 77 (3 fold induction over controls) but strongly induced in both bluegill and longear sunfish exposed to 50\u00a0mg/kg BaP (37 and 15 fold induction over controls, respectively). In contrast, hepatic GST activity in both species remained unchanged following the treatment with either compound and hepatic UDPGT activity, which was assessed only in BaP-treated longear sunfish, was unaffected by that chemical, indicating these phase II enzymes may not be sensitive pollutant biomarkers in this genus. Further, longear sunfish collected from a PCB contaminated site displayed relatively low levels of CYP1A activity despite PCB body burdens associated with strong induction of CYP1A activity in other fish species. The strong induction of CYP1A by BaP with much weaker CYP1A response to PCB indicates that CYP1A in Lepomis sp. could be an excellent biomarker for PAH pollution, but may not be a reliable indicator of site contamination by halogenated hydrocarbons. We conclude that Lepomis species provide a useful model for examining the regulation and potential consequences of differential pollutant sensitivity, but that CYP1A in these species should be used with caution as an indicator of halogenated contaminants.",

In contrast, EM-treated fish showed immunopositive reactions against P450scc and 3\u03b2-HSD but not against P450arom in interstitial Leydig cells.

     "abstract": "To reevaluate the toxicity of the organochlorine insecticide and persistent organic pollutant dieldrin and confirm its impact on development, an exposure trial using bird eggs was performed. Dieldrin at concentrations of 10\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg/g of egg was injected into the yolks of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) eggs. Hatchlings from the eggs were raised to sexual maturity and multiple tests to detect the harmful effects of dieldrin were conducted. Dieldrin at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/g decreased egg hatchability by 50.0% (vehicle control, 86.7%), although embryogenesis even in unhatched eggs treated with high doses of dieldrin was normal. In safely hatched chicks, dose-dependent early death with tonic seizure was observed and all birds exposed to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/g died within 3\u00a0days. Other significant alterations in hatchlings were enlargement of the whole brain, decreases in mRNA expressions of tryptophan hydroxylase in the brainstem and cholesterol side-chain cleavage in the male gonad, and increases in mRNA expressions of cytochrome P450 1A and 2C18 in the liver. For mature birds (males at 5\u00a0weeks and females at 10\u00a0weeks of age), impairment of eggshell formation such as reduced eggshell mass and eggshell thinning, increases in the body mass of males and the liver mass of females and increases in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were observed. The results indicated that not only does the neurotoxicity of dieldrin bring early death, but its effects on reproductive and hepatic functions (detected as gene transcriptional changes in hatchlings) persist harmfully after maturity.",

Our results show that hexavalent chromium induces increased cell death and chromosome damage in both human and sea lion cells with increasing intracellular chromium ion levels. The data further indicate that both sodium chromate and lead chromate are less cytotoxic and genotoxic to sea lion cells than human cells, based on an administered dose. Differences in chromium ion uptake explained some but not all of the reduced amounts of sodium chromate-induced cell death. By contrast, uptake differences could explain the differences in sodium chromate-induced chromosome damage and particulate chromate-induced toxicity. Altogether they indicate that while hexavalent chromium induces similar toxic effects in sea lion and human cells, there are different mechanisms underlying the toxic outcomes.",

Fish were exposed to 0\u201310\u00a0\u03bcg Hg2+\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 solutions from embryonic to the juvenile stages for 80\u00a0days. Antioxidative responses to mercury exposure were studied in metamorphosing larvae (18\u00a0days post hatching, dph), settling larvae (33\u00a0dph) and juveniles (78\u00a0dph). Results showed that increasing mercury concentration led to increased mercury bioaccumulation and reduced flounder growth. Of the antioxidants investigated, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities at the three developmental stages were sensitive to mercury exposure and increased with increasing mercury concentration. Glutathione (GSH) content was elevated in metamorphosing larvae, but decreased in juveniles as mercury concentration increased. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity did not significantly vary with mercury concentration in either larvae or juveniles. Mercury exposure did not affect malondialdehyde (MDA) content of larvae, but significantly increased MDA content of juveniles. Results suggest that flounder larvae and juveniles have the potential to manipulate the levels of antioxidants such as SOD, CAT and GSH, which protect flounder from oxidative stress induced by mercury exposure. These antioxidants could serve as biomarkers of mercury contamination in the aquatic environment.",

The results indicated that MCP induced increases in plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol levels and the 17\u03b2-estradiol/testosterone ratio via interference with the reproductive axis at multiple potential sites through two mechanisms: (a) MCP exposure enhanced the mRNA expression of gonadal aromatase, the enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens, consequently reducing plasma testosterone levels and increasing plasma concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol; and (b) MCP treatment increased follicle-stimulating hormone \u03b2 subunit mRNA expression and secretion and decreased luteinizing hormone \u03b2 subunit mRNA expression and secretion, leading to the disruption of reproductive endocrine control and androgen and estrogen balance.

In this study, we compared factors determining warfarin sensitivity between bird species and rats based on vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase (VKOR) kinetics, VKOR inhibition by warfarin and warfarin metabolism assays. In VKOR characterization, chickens and ostriches showed significantly lower enzymatic efficiencies than rats (one-sixth and one-third, respectively), suggesting bird species depend more on a non-VKOR vitamin K source. On the other hand, the inhibition constants (Ki) of VKOR for warfarin were significantly different between chickens and ostriches (11.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). Interestingly, the ostrich Ki was similar to the values for rats (0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0\u03bcM). The Ki results reveal a surprising possibility that VKOR in some bird species are easily inhibited by warfarin. Warfarin metabolism assays also showed a large inter-species difference in bird species. Chickens and ostriches showed higher metabolic activity than that of rats, while mallards and owls showed only a slight ability to metabolize warfarin. In this study, we clarified the wide inter-species difference that exists among birds in xenobiotic metabolism and sensitivity to a rodenticide.",

So far no one has described a protocol on how to use Atlantic cod hepatocytes in bioassays. In this work we describe an experiment in which we were able to isolate intact liver cells from mature individuals. Hepatic cytochrome P450 1A (CYP1A) expression in the isolated cells was evaluated with in situ hybridization after intraperitoneal injection with the strong CYP1A inducer \u00df-naphthoflavone (BNF). Cod hepatocytes were further exposed to 1,2,3,7,8-polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) and cadmium (Cd). Transcriptional responses of 11 genes were quantified (CYP1A, metallothionein (MT), aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 (AhR2), UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), vitellogenin B (VTGB), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), transferrin, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)). Immunohistochemisty evaluation clearly showed elevated CYP1A mRNA expression in primary hepatocytes isolated from BNF-exposed fish. The transcriptional results showed that PCDD exposure resulted in a 311-fold up-regulation of CYP1A and Cd a 1.82-fold increase of MT. Unexpectedly, AhR2 and UGT mRNA levels were not significantly up-regulated in PCDD-exposed cod hepatocytes. HO-1 and transferrin showed a dose-dependent transcriptional response to Cd exposure. Cd appears to act as an endocrine-disrupting metal in exposed primary Atlantic cod hepatocytes.

Dose-dependent effects of 585 were determined by icv injections of saline vehicle, 3, 10, and 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW by once daily increment. A switchback study of iv and icv 585 treatment determined central and peripheral regulation of GH secretion by the secretagogue at 30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW. When administered icv, 585 increased GH concentration in a dose-dependent manner, with a return to baseline by 60\u00a0min. GH secretion was attenuated by increased numbers of icv 585 injections (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, it was not affected by increased numbers of iv 585 injections. Icv administration of somatostatin (SRIF) decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) GH secretion compared with saline-treated controls, and decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) peak GH response when given in combination with 585 as compared with 585 alone. Porcine galanin (pGAL) modestly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) GH levels compared with saline controls, but when given icv in combination with 585 peak GH response was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with 585 alone. Porcine neuropeptide Y (pNPY) administered icv was without effect on GH levels compared with saline controls and decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) peak GH response when given in combination with 585 as compared with 585 alone.

The pain is due to discharge of jellyfish nematocysts and associated toxins and discharge can be caused by a variety of mechanical and chemical stimuli. A series of tests were carried out with chemicals traditionally used to treat jellyfish stings e.g. acetic acid ammonia meat tenderizer baking soda and urea to determine if these chemicals stimulated or inhibited nematocyst discharge and if they brought relief to testers who were exposed to jellyfish tentacles. Chrysaora quinquecirrha (sea nettle) Chiropsalmus quadrumanus (sea wasp) and Physalia physalis (Portuguese man-of-war) were used in the study. It was found that many of the chemicals traditionally used to treat jellyfish stings stimulated nematocyst discharge and did not relieve the pain. However there was immediate relief when a common anesthetic lidocaine was sprayed on the skin of testers in contact with jellyfish tentacles. Initial exposure of tentacle suspensions to lidocaine prevented the nematocyst discharge by subsequent exposure to acetic acid ethanol ammonia or bromelain. Thus lidocaine in addition to acting as an anesthetic on skin in contact with jellyfish tentacles inhibited nematocyst discharge possibly by blocking sodium and/or calcium channels of the nematocytes.",

Results following 6, 24, 48 and 96\u00a0h exposure to different concentrations of these substances show cellular effects on intracellular ROS formation, glutathione levels and redox status, expression of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, \u03b3-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (GCS) and thioredoxin, as well as cytotoxicity parameters. The most consistent effects (maximum values within brackets), observed in dose and time parameters for both model compounds and environmental sample, were the depletion of total glutathione (9.4% of control), induced levels of oxidized glutathione (695% of control), and gene expression regulation depicted relative to the control gene beta-actin of GCS mRNA (239% of control) and catalase (29% of control).

To evaluate the potential ecological risk of 2,4-D, we assessed the biological parameters including the survival rate, adult sex ratio of emerged adults, and mouthpart deformities in Chironomus riparius after long-term exposure to 2,4-D. The larvae were treated with 0.1, 1 or, 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 of 2,4-D for short- and long-term exposure periods.

Survival rates were not significantly affected by 2,4-D. Furthermore, we evaluated the molecular and biochemical responses of biomarker genes such as gene expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), ferritins and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) in C. riparius exposed to 2,4-D for 24\u00a0h. The expressions of HSP70, HSP40, HSP90 and GST levels in C. riparius were significantly increased after exposure to a 10\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 concentration of 2,4-D, whereas ferritin heavy and light chain gene expressions were significantly increased at all concentrations of 2,4-D exposure.

Compared with the control, liver-carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (L-CPT1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) \u03b12 mRNA level of M. biceps femoris (BF) were down-regulated significantly by DEX, while mRNA expression of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1), heart-fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP), long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), activities of LPL and AMPK in both skeletal muscles were not obviously affected. Feed restriction increased the mRNA expression of LPL, L-CPT1 and LCAD of M. pectoralis major (PM), and FATP1, H-FABP, L-CPT1 and LCAD of BF. In conclusion, DEX retards the growth of body mass but facilitates lipid accumulation in both adipose and skeletal muscle tissues. In contrast to the favorable effect of mild feed restriction, DEX did not alter the uptake of fatty acids in the skeletal muscle. The result suggests that DEX may promote intramyocellular lipid accumulation by suppressed fatty acid oxidation while mild feed restriction improved fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, especially in red muscle.

However, females exposed to aluminum at acidic water pH showed a decreased of plasma 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol. No differences in plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol were observed. The physiological mechanisms underlying the disturbances observed are discussed focusing on reproduction. We suggest that aluminum can be considered an endocrine disrupting compound in mature O. niloticus females.",

     "abstract": "The biogenic amines are widespread regulators of physiological processes, and play an important role in regulating heart rate in diverse organisms. Here, we present the first pharmacological evidence for a role of the biogenic amines in the regulation of dorsal blood vessel pulse rate in an aquatic oligochaete, Lumbriculus variegatus (M\u00fcller, 1774). Bath application of octopamine to intact worms resulted in an acceleration of pulse rate, but not when co-applied with the adenylyl cyclase inhibitor MDL-12,330a. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline mimicked the effects of OA, but the polar adenosine receptor antagonist 8(p-sulphophenyl)theophylline was significantly less potent than theophylline. Pharmacologically blocking synaptic reuptake of the biogenic amines using the selective 5-HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine or various tricyclic antidepressants also accelerated heart rate. Depletion of the biogenic amines by treatment with the monoamine vesicular transporter blocker reserpine dramatically depressed pulse rate. Pulse rate was partially restored in amine-depleted worms after treatment with octopamine or dopamine, but fully restored following treatment with serotonin. This effect of 5-HT was weakly mimicked by 5-methoxytryptamine, but not by \u03b1-methylserotonin; it was completely blocked by clozapine and partially blocked by cyproheptadine. Because they are known to orchestrate a variety of adaptive behaviors in invertebrates, the biogenic amines may coordinate blood flow with behavioral state in L.variegatus.",

Dietary copper-deficient (CuD) rats and mice were produced using a modified AIN-76A diet.

Plasma from CuD rat dams and pups, and CuD and Cp\u2212/\u2212 mice contained no detectable Cp diamine oxidase activity. Importantly, no ferroxidase activity was detectable for CuD rats, mice, or Cp\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to robust activity for copper-adequate (CuA) rodent controls using western membrane assay. Immunoblot protocols detected major reductions (60\u201390%) in Cp protein in plasma of CuD rodents but no alteration in liver mRNA levels by qRT-PCR.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos at different developmental stages (12\u201360\u00a0hpf) were treated with different dosages of AAP (0\u201345\u00a0mM) for different time courses (12\u201360\u00a0h). Results showed that zebrafish embryos exhibited no evident differences in survival rates and morphological changes between the mock-treated control (0\u00a0mM) and 2.25\u00a0mM AAP-exposure (12\u201372\u00a0hpf) groups. In contrast, after higher doses (22.5 and 45\u00a0mM) of exposure, embryos displayed malformed kidney phenotypes, such as curved, cystic pronephric tube, pronephric duct, and a cystic and atrophic glomerulus. The percentages of embryos with malformed kidney phenotypes increased as the exposure dosages of AAP increased. Interestingly, under the same exposure time course (12\u00a0h) and dose (22.5\u00a0mM), embryos displayed higher percentages of severe defects at earlier developmental stage of exposure (12\u201324\u00a0hpf), whereas embryos displayed higher percentages of mild defects at later exposure (60\u201372\u00a0hpf). With an exposure time course less than 24\u00a0h of 45\u00a0mM AAP, no embryo survived by the developmental stage of 72\u00a0hpf. These results indicated that AAP-induced nephrotoxicity depended on the exposure dose, time course and developmental stages. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the cells' morphologies of the pronephric tube, pronephric duct and glomerulus were disrupted by AAP, and consequently caused cell death. Real-time RT-PCR revealed embryos after AAP treatment decreased the expression of cox2 and bcl2, but increased p53 expression. In conclusion, AAP-induced defects on glomerulus, pronephric tube and pronephric duct could be easily and dynamically observed in vivo during kidney development in this present model.",

Blood samples were obtained from barn swallows collected at sites with different background levels of radiation, including a relatively uncontaminated area. The extent of DNA damage was evaluated using the alkaline (pH\u00a0=\u00a012.1) comet assay, a robust and sensitive electrophoresis-based technique widely employed in research ranging from biomonitoring to clinical studies. We found that levels of DNA damage, as indexed by the extent of DNA migration, were increased in barn swallows living in areas surrounding Chernobyl when compared to swallows sampled at low-level sites. The results we obtained are consistent with previous findings on this same species, which showed that swallows breeding in areas heavily contaminated with radionuclides have increased mutation rates, higher oxidative stress and incidence of morphological aberrations and tumors. Overall, these results indicate that chronic exposure to radioactive contaminants, even 20\u00a0years after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, continues to induce DNA damage in cells of free-living animals.",

Daphnids were exposed to chemical substances known to affect DNA methylation in mammals: vinclozolin, 5-azacytidine, 2\u2032-deoxy-5-azacytidine, genistein and biochanin A. Effects on overall DNA cytosine methylation, body length and reproduction were evaluated in 21\u00a0day experiments. Using a multi-generational experimental design these endpoints were also evaluated in the F1 and F2 generation of both exposed and non-exposed offspring from F0 daphnids exposed to 5-azacytidine, genistein or vinclozolin. A reduction in DNA methylation was consistently observed in daphnids exposed to vinclozolin and 5-azacytidine. Only in organisms exposed to 5-azacytidine was this effect transferred to the two subsequent non-exposed generations. A concurrent reduction in body length at day 7 was observed in these treatments. For the first time, exposure to environmental chemicals was shown to affect DNA methylation in the parental generation of D. magna. We also demonstrated a transgenerational alteration in an epigenetic system in D. magna, which indicates the possibility of transgenerational inheritance of environment-induced epigenetic changes in non-exposed subsequent generations.",

Existence of different isoforms of NOS has been shown in mammalian testis, but report on their presence in the testis of ectothermic vertebrates is non-existent. This study demonstrates the differential expressions of two isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (neuronal-nNOS and inducible-iNOS) like molecules in different cell types in the testis of seasonally breeding catfish, Clarias batrachus through immunohistochemistry. Positive immunoprecipitation of nNOS and iNOS like molecules were detected in germ cells as well as interstitial cells only in the recrudescing and fully mature fish. The immunoreactions differed in intensity and varied with changing reproductive status. Treatment of adult male fish with NO donor, sodium nitroprusside, and a NOS inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) increased and decreased the total nitrate and nitrite concentration in the testis, respectively. Sodium nitroprusside and L-NAME also induced simultaneous decline and rise in the testicular testosterone level, respectively. These findings, thus, suggest that NOS isoforms are expressed variedly in different cell types in the testis of reproductively active fish. This investigation also suggests that NO inhibits testosterone production in the testis.",

Most of the cyanide absorbed by an animal is detoxified by enzymatic combination with sulfur, thus the detoxification process imposes a nutritional cost. In mammals, interactions among nutrients and toxics may influence the composition of the diet and food intake, as a function of positive or negative post-ingestive feedback. The present work aimed to describe the toxic effects of cyanide, and to determine whether cyanide interferes with diet selection in quail (Coturnix coturnix). A toxicological study was performed with 27 female quails that were assigned to three groups that received by gavage 0, 1.0 or 3.0\u00a0mg of KCN/kg/day, for 7 consecutive days. The diet selection trial was conducted with 20 female quails, that had access to two separate rations: a conventional quail ration and the same ration supplemented with 1% NaSO4. During the toxicological study, clinical signs of poisoning and death occurred in a quail treated with cyanide. Histological changes were found only in animals dosed with cyanide, and these consisted of mild hepatic periportal vacuolation, an increased number of vacuoles in the colloid of the thyroid glands, and spongiosis in the mesencephalon. No clinical signs were found in any quail throughout the diet selection trial. There were no significant differences in food consumption or ration preference. In conclusion, exposure to cyanide promotes damage to the liver and central nervous system in quails. In contrast, the ingestion of sulfur by quail was not affected by exposure to cyanide.",

The \u03ba antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine, significantly increased food intake, while naltrexone (general antagonist) and naloxonazine (\u00b5 antagonist) both reduced feeding. A large mass loss was observed in cockroaches treated with nor-binaltorphimine, despite the increased food intake. Males did not lose as much mass during the 3\u00a0h as females, although drug treatment did have some effect on the loss. Time of activity (%) was not influenced by any drug. Water loss experiments suggested that nor-binaltorphimine increased water loss, accounting for the mass loss despite the increased feeding.

To investigate the role of EcR during development and the effect to environmental stressors on EcR expression in a copepod, we isolated and characterized cDNA and 5\u2032-promoter region of the Tigriopus japonicus EcR (TJ-EcR), and studied mRNA expression pattern. The full-length TJ-EcR cDNA sequence was 1962\u00a0bp in length and the open reading frame encoded 546 amino acids. The deduced TJ-EcR protein contained well-conserved DNA-binding domain and ligand-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TJ-EcR was clustered with the EcR of other crustaceans. TJ-EcR mRNA was expressed in a developmental stage-specific manner: high in early developmental stages and low in the adult stage. Significantly elevated expression of the TJ-EcR gene in adults was detected at hypersalinity (42\u00a0ppt) and high temperature (35\u00a0\u00b0C) condition. The 5\u2032-flanking region of TJ-EcR gene contains heat shock protein 70 response elements, implying that the environmental stressors may affect its expression via the stress-sensor. In addition, bisphenol A (100\u00a0\u00b5g/L) repressed TJ-EcR expression.

     "abstract": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a eukaryotic transcription factor that plays an essential role in neuronal, immune, vascular, hepatic and hematopoietic development. In mammals, AHR induces metabolism-associated genes in response to xenobiotics. AHR is evolutionarily conserved, and the C. elegans AHR ortholog likely shares many physiologic functions with the mammalian version. While the role of AHR in development is known, the molecular basis of AHR action is less well understood. To understand the physiologic role of AHR in C. elegans, a combination of fatty acid profiling, transcriptomics, and phenotyping approaches was used. Fatty acid profiles from L4 larval stage whole animals indicated that C17isoA, C18:1n9t, C20:3n6 and C20:4n6 were significantly increased in an ahr-1 mutant compared to wild-type. Consistent with these changes, we observed a significant 5.8 fold increase in fat-7, and 1.7\u20131.9 fold increases in elo-5, nhr-49, and mdt-15 gene expression during the L4 stage. The ahr-1(ju145) mutant displayed deficits in growth and development including a reduced number of eggs laid, a higher proportion of dead embryos, delay in time to reach L4 stage, and movement deficits including a fewer number of body bends and a longer defecation cycle. To understand global effects of AHR-1 on transcription, microarray analysis was performed on L1 stage animals. Expression changes (324 under- and 238 over-expressed) were found in genes associated with metabolism, growth, and development. These results indicate a role for C. elegans AHR in regulating fatty acid composition and in contributing to some aspects of development. Since the transcriptional control of AHR targets may be evolutionarily conserved, these results provide a deeper understanding of the molecular actions of AHR in a model invertebrate system that may be informative for higher organisms.",

B(a)P induces phase I biotransformation metabolism and peroxisome proliferation which is characterised in rodents by increased peroxisomal volume density, accompanied by the transcriptional induction of peroxisomal proteins. The aim of the present work was to study peroxisome proliferation at the transcriptional level, in comparison to the transcription of the well-characterised cytochrome P450 1A gene (cyp1a) in the thicklip grey mullet Chelon labrosus. For this purpose, genes coding for the major peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 and CYP1A were cloned using degenerate primers. Then juvenile mullets were single injected with B(a)P (5\u00a0mg/kg) and transcription of palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (aox1), multifunctional protein (mfp1), 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thio), \u03942,\u03944dienoyl-CoA reductase 2, pmp70, catalase and cyp1a was semi-quantified in liver and gills 1 and 7\u00a0days after the injection. Transcription of aox1 and cyp1a was induced in gills 1\u00a0day after B(a)P injection. Cyp1a transcription was also induced in mullet liver one day after injection, indicating that B(a)P was available for the liver. This was further proved by the significant accumulation of B(a)P-like metabolites in bile 7\u00a0days after the injection. In liver, aox1, mfp1 and thio transcription was induced at day 1 followed by the induction of catalase transcription at day 7 that may reflect a response to an oxidative stress caused by B(a)P itself or by oxyradicals produced through the biotransformation metabolism and the peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation. These hepatic responses were not reflected at AOX1 activity level. In conclusion, it has been shown for the first time that the three enzymes in the fish peroxisomal \u03b2-oxidation pathway are transcriptionally induced by B(a)P. It remains to be tested whether this enhanced transcription is reflected in an increase in the volume of peroxisomes.",

     "abstract": "Exposure and effect assessment of organophosphate (OP) pesticides generally involves the use of cholinesterase (ChE) inhibition. In earthworm, this enzyme activity is often measured in homogenates from the whole organism. Here we examine the tissue-specific response of ChE and carboxylesterase (CE) activities in Lumbricus terrestris experimentally exposed to chlorpyrifos-spiked field soils. Esterases were measured in different gut segments and in the seminal vesicles of earthworms following acute exposure (2 d) to the OP and during 35\u00a0d of a recovery period. We found that inhibition of both esterase activities was dependent on the tissue. Cholinesterase activity decreased in the pharynx, crop, foregut and seminal vesicles in a concentration-dependent way, whereas CE activity (4-nitrophenyl valerate) was strongly inhibited in these tissues. Gizzard CE activity was not inhibited by the OP, even an increase of enzyme activity was evident during the recovery period. These results suggest that both esterases should be determined jointly in selected tissues of earthworms. Moreover, the high levels of gut CE activity and its inhibition and recovery dynamic following OP exposure suggest that this esterase could play an important role as an enzymatic barrier against OP uptake from the ingested contaminated soil.",

Here, we identified the full-length Vg1 and Vg2 sequence from the brackish water copepod, Paracyclopina nana. Vg1 gene contained 5718\u00a0bp of the open reading frame (ORF) that encoded the putative protein of 1905 amino acids residues, while Vg2 gene consisted of 5442\u00a0bp of ORF, encoding the putative protein of 1813 amino acids residues. P. nana Vgs showed highly conserved domains in the N-terminal region. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that P. nana Vgs are distinct from other arthropods, such as insects and decapods, as it formed a clade with other copepods, Tigriopus japonicus and salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis). The expression of Vg transcripts was detectable after the copepodid stages 4\u20135. Female copepods expressed over 83 times and 223 times more Vg1 and Vg2 transcripts, respectively, than males. When copepods were exposed to heavy metals (0.1\u00a0mg/L Cd, 0.4\u00a0mg/L Cu, and 2\u00a0mg/L AsIII) for 24, 48, 72, and 96\u00a0h, P. nana Vg transcripts were highly induced in a time-dependent manner. Interestingly, Vg2 gene was more susceptible than Vg1 to trace heavy metal exposure. This finding indicates that P. nana Vgs provide a potential indicator for assessing the toxic effect of heavy metals. In addition, we suggest P. nana as a potential model species for risk-assessment to environmental pollutants in brackish water.",

Mussels were caged at coastal sites in the vicinity of major cities, in areas influenced by major industries, agricultural practices and in islands away from known sources of pollution. Biomarkers indicative of neurotoxicity (acetylcholinesterase, AchE), oxidative stress (catalase, CAT), phase II biotransformation of xenobiotics (glutathione S-transferase, GST), metal exposure (metallothioneins, MTs) and protein synthesis (RNA:DNA ratio) were measured to assess effects of various types of pollutants. AchE activity proved to be the most responsive biomarker with decreased values at sites influenced by agricultural, urban and industrial activities. Decreased CAT and GST activities and increased MTs levels were recorded at a number of anthropogenic-impacted sites. RNA:DNA ratio showed a biphasic response as both high and low values were found at impacted sites. Principal component analysis clearly distinguished sites receiving pollution inputs from non-polluted sites. The combination of the selected biomarkers used in caged mussels resulted useful in the assessment of the effects of environmental pollution.",

No effects on GAD activity were measured. Concentration-dependent decreases in [3H]-muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors and GABA-T activity were found in several brain regions, with reductions as great as 94% (for GABA(A) receptor levels) and 71% (for GABA-T activity) measured in the brain stem and basal ganglia. These results show that chronic exposure to environmentally relevant levels of MeHg disrupts GABAergic signaling. Given that GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, prolonged disruptions of its function may underlie the sub-clinical impacts of MeHg at relevant levels to animal health.",

Growth, Cd accumulation, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18), and levels of glutathione (GSH) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were investigated at three developmental stages. Flounder growth decreased and Cd accumulation increased with increasing Cd concentration. In metamorphosing larvae, CAT and SOD activities were inhibited and GSH level was elevated, while LPO was enhanced by increasing Cd concentrations. CAT and GST activities of settling larvae were inhibited but GSH level was elevated at high Cd concentrations. In juveniles, SOD activity and LPO level were increased but GST activity was inhibited as Cd concentration increased. Antioxidants in flounder at ELS were able to develop ductile responses to defend against oxidative stress, but LPO fatally occurred due to Cd exposure. These biochemical parameters could be used as effective oxidative biomarkers for evaluating Cd contamination and toxicity in marine environments: CAT, SOD, GSH, and LPO for metamorphosing stage; CAT, GSH, and GST for settling stage; and SOD, GST, and LPO for juvenile stage.",

Although dogs are frequently used for toxicologic and pharmacokinetic characterization of novel drugs, nothing is known about their OATP1B1/1B3 ortholog. Therefore, we cloned and characterized the first canine organic anion transporting polypeptide from dog liver, termed Oatp1b4. The isolated Oatp1b4 cDNA comprises 3661 base pairs (bp) with an open reading frame of 2076\u00a0bp, encoding a 692-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of \u223c\u00a085\u00a0kDa. The Oatp1b4 gene is approximately 61\u00a0kb long and has a similar organization as the human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 with 13 exons identical in length. Northern blot analysis shows that Oatp1b4 is predominantly expressed in the liver. Oatp1b4 mediates sodium-independent transport of typical organic anions including bromosulfophthalein (BSP), [D-penicillamine2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE), estradiol-17\u03b2-glucuronide (E17\u03b2G), estrone-3-sulfate and taurocholate. In addition, Oatp1b4 transports the OATP1B3-specific substrate cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). Kinetic studies showed that Oatp1b4-mediated E17\u03b2G and estrone-3-sulfate transports were monophasic with Km values of 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u00b5M and 33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively.

Endocrine disrupters (EDCs) are chemicals in the environment that adversely affect organisms by binding to nuclear receptors, including ARs. Vinclozolin, a fungicide used on fruit and vegetable crops, is a known anti-androgen, a type of EDC that blocks signals from testosterone and its derivatives. In order to better understand the effects of EDCs, further research on androgen receptors and other hormone signaling pathways is necessary. In this study, we demonstrate the evolutionary conservation between the genomic structure of the human and zebrafish ar genes and find that ar mRNA expression increases in zebrafish embryos exposed to vinclozolin, which may be evolutionarily conserved as well. At 48 and 72\u00a0h post-fertilization, vinclozolin-treated embryos express ar mRNA 8-fold higher than the control level. These findings suggest that zebrafish embryos attempt to compensate for the presence of an anti-androgen by increasing the number of androgen receptors available.",

Thioredoxin reductase activity and malondialdehyde levels were determined in all tissues. Thioredoxin reductase inhibition was detected only in digestive gland exposed to menadione whilst malondialdehyde levels did not vary in response to treatment in all tissues. GNP caused a decrease in the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio in digestive gland, but no difference was found in other tissues or for other treatments. One dimensional electrophoresis of proteins containing thiol groups was performed in all tissues and revealed a reduction in protein thiols for all treatments in digestive gland. Two dimensional electrophoresis of digestive gland extracts, from GNP and control groups, showed decreased levels of thiol proteins in response to GNP which we attribute to oxidation.

The primary cultures were exposed to six different concentrations of endosulfan (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100\u00a0\u00b5M) for 48\u00a0h. Cell morphology as well as a molecular toolbox of 16 genes encoding stress responsive and biotransformation proteins was examined. Endosulfan exposure caused moderate cytotoxicity and steatosis in a dose-dependent manner in the hepatocytes. In general, endosulfan hepatoxicity seems to be unaffected by the fatty acid composition of the hepatocytes. Exceptions were general stress (HSP70) and markers for estrogen exposure (ZP and VTG), which appeared to be slightly less responsive in hepatocytes isolated from the vegetable oil fed fish.",

The results showed that acute heat stress induced a significant production of ROS, function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, antioxidative enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px)] activity, and formation of malondialdehybe (MDA). Within the first 12\u00a0h after removal of the heat stress, the acute modification of the above parameters induced by heat stress gradually approached to pre-heat levels. The results of the present study suggest that acute exposure to high temperatures may depress the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. This leads to over-production of ROS, which ultimately results in lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. When the high temperature was removed, the production of ROS, mitochondrial respiratory function and oxidative injury that were induced by acute heat exposure gradually approached the levels observed before heating, in a time-dependent manner.",

To further understand the impact of elevated copper concentrations on marine symbiotic organisms, toxicity tests were conducted using the model sea anemone, Aiptasia pallida, with and without its zooxanthellae symbiont. Symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida were exposed to sublethal copper concentrations (0, 5, 15, and 50\u00a0\u00b5g/L) for 7\u00a0d and copper accumulation, behavior, and the activity of the oxidative stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were measured. Additionally, acute 96-h toxicity tests were conducted to determine LC50 values of the organisms after copper exposure. Both symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida rapidly accumulated copper in a time and dose dependent manner. However, higher copper concentrations accumulated in the aposymbiotic as compared to the symbiotic A. pallida. In response to the highest two copper exposures (15 and 50\u00a0\u00b5g/L) symbiotic A. pallida upregulated CAT activity to combat the damaging effects of hydrogen peroxide. Contrary to these results, SOD activity significantly decreased during the highest copper exposure, when compared to controls. CAT activity was not detected and SOD was substantially (>\u00a010 fold) reduced in aposymbiotic A. pallida, suggesting that the zooxanthellae are associated with the oxidative stress response. Copper exposure as low as 5\u00a0\u00b5g/L caused tentacle retraction and increased mucus production in both symbiotic and aposymbiotic anemones. The LC50 values for symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida exposed to copper for 96\u00a0h were 148\u00a0\u00b5g/L (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a0126.4, 173.8) and 206\u00a0\u00b5g/L (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a0175.2, 242.2), respectively. Understanding the varying responses of symbiotic and aposymbiotic A. pallida to copper stress may advance our comprehension of the functional roles of zooxanthellae and host. Although the mechanism of copper toxicity has not been fully elucidated, it is clear that A. pallida accumulate copper and are sensitive, as effects were detected at environmentally relevant copper concentrations. Likewise, A. pallida may be useful in biomonitoring copper polluted environments.",

Despite this trend, the 96-h LC50 value at 15\u2030 (43.4\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01) was significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than at both 30\u2030 and 45\u2030 (65.8 and 75.2\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01, respectively). This may be due to significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) haemolymph ammonia-N levels of crabs at low salinities and may similarly explain the general ammonia-N toxicity pattern to other crustacean species.",

Three types of age-dependent responses were indicated in fish blood: 1. enzymatic activity did not change with age; 2. enzymatic activity decreased with age and 3. enzyme activity increased with age or varied unclearly. The interspecies differences of age-related enzymatic activities associated with the specificity of fish biology and ecology were indicated. Despite no clear evidence of age-related differences between fish species belonging to different ecological groups both benthic forms exhibited similar age-dependent trends of SOD and PER. The correlations between blood antioxidant enzyme activities in fish belonging to suprabenthic and benthic/pelagic groups demonstrated the intermediate values as compared to the benthic and pelagic forms.

Embryos should therefore develop protective systems to reduce ROS toxicity and achieve successful development. The present work was aimed to characterize the effects produced by the widespread-used ROS-generator pesticide Paraquat during early embryonic development in the toad Chaunus arenarum, as well as to get insights into the defense response elicited by amphibian embryos. The approach consisted in generating a sharp and brief oxidative stress condition early during embryonic development to stimulate the cellular mechanisms involved in ROS-antioxidant response. Results revealed that Paraquat-treatment reduced the ability of embryos to develop normally, leading to arrests of development and severe malformations such as tail abnormalities, abdominal edema, reduced head development and curved dorsal structures. Although Paraquat effects were morphologically evident from gastrula stage on, alterations such as chromatin condensation were observed even at blastula stage by histological examinations. Regarding detoxifying enzymes, a significant induction of Mn-superoxide dismutase activity was detected at stages beyond gastrula in embryos surviving Paraquat treatment, suggesting a major role of this enzyme in the antioxidant response during early embryonic development.",

High levels of manganese are neurotoxic to people, causing Manganism, a Parkinson-like disease. Clinical interventions for Manganism have not been very successful. Recently, p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS) was reported as an effective treatment of severe Manganism in humans; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. Previously, we reported that manganese treatments caused disruption of the dopaminergic innervation of gill of C. virginica. Here we compared the effects of manganese on gill innervation in the presence of PAS, EDTA or Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), and examined whether co-treating animals with PAS could block the deleterious effects of manganese on the oyster's dopaminergic innervation of the gill. Beating rates of the lateral cilia of the gill were measured by stroboscopic microscopy. Pre-treating gill preparations with PAS or EDTA blocked the neurotoxic effects of manganese, while ASA did not. In other experiments, animals exposed to three day treatments with manganese produced a dose dependent impairment of the dopaminergic, cilio-inhibitory system, which was decreased by co-treatment with PAS. The study shows that PAS protects the animal against neurotoxic effects of manganese and the mechanism of action of PAS in alleviating Manganism is more likely related to its chelating abilities than its anti-inflammatory actions.",

The profile of free and total fatty acids (FA) was analysed using a similar LC separation with a reversed phase C8 column and mass spectrometry detection. In mussel the free FA profile was reflected in the FA esterified to OA, being palmitic acid for instance the most abundant in both cases. In cockle, 7-O-acyl esters with palmitic acid were almost absent and esters with a C16:0 isomer were dominant, followed by esters with C15:1 and C15:0. The cockle free FA profile was similar to mussel, and in accordance with literature findings in bivalves. After hydrolysis, a major difference in the FA profile occurred in both species, presenting a high percentage of a C16:0 isomer. The isomer found in general lipids and bound to OA seemed to be related, presenting similar relative retention times (RRT) to C16:0, differing from expected RRT of monomethyl-branched isomers (iso- or anteiso-). A tentative identification was made with the multimethyl-branched isoprenoid, 4,8,12-trimethyltridecanoic acid (TMTD). TMTD is a product of phytol degradation. This was also suspected when the proportion of this compound in relation to palmitic acid was reduced in vivo in mussels fed a chlorophyll-free diet. Extensive esterification of OA by, among others, phytol-degrading bacteria is discussed as a plausible hypothesis in cockle, but not in mussel, due to the relatively high specific proportion of odd-numbered and branched FA.",

In addition to the exposure conditions, heavy metal toxicity is strongly dependent on exposure time. In this study, BLM is extended to predict time dependency of heavy metal toxicity by connecting with the concept of primary reaction. The model developed in this study also generates the estimation of the 50% effect concentration (EC50) for toxicologically unknown organisms and heavy metals. Two toxicological and kinetic constants, f50,0 and k, were derived from the initial value of f50 (f50,0) and a time constant (k) independent of time. The model developed in this study enables us to acquire information on the toxicity of heavy metals such as Cu, Cd and Co easily.",

In this paper, the mRNA differential display technique was applied to analyze transcriptional regulation in response to cadmium exposure in the lizard embryos. Lizard eggs may be particularly susceptible to soil contamination and in ovo exposure may interfere or disrupt normal physiological function in the developing embryo, including regulation of gene expression.Fertilized eggs of the lizard Podarcis sicula were incubated in cadmium-contaminated soil at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0days. Gene expression profiling showed 5 down- and 9 up-regulated genes. Four cDNAs had no homology to known gene sequences, thus suggesting that may either encode not yet identified proteins, or correspond to untranslated regions of mRNA molecules. Four fragments exhibited significant sequence similarity with genes encoding novel proteins or ESTs derived from other vertebrates. The remaining genes are mainly involved in molecular pathways associated with processes such as membrane trafficking, signal transduction, cytoskeletal organization, cell proliferation and differentiation. Cadmium also affected the expression of factors actively involved in the regulation of the transcription machinery. Down-regulated genes are mainly associated with cellular metabolism and cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. All of these differentially expressed genes may represent candidates that function in cadmium responses. The present study leads to an increased understanding of genes and/or the biochemical pathways involved in perturbation of embryo development following cadmium exposure.",

     "abstract": "The weatherloach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, is a freshwater, facultative air-breathing fish that lives in streams and rice paddy fields, where it may experience drought and/or high environmental ammonia (HEA) conditions. The aim of this study was to determine what roles branchial Na+/K+-ATPase, H+-ATPase, and Rhcg have in ammonia tolerance and how the weatherloach copes with ammonia loading conditions. The loach's high ammonia tolerance was confirmed as was evident from its high 96\u00a0h LC50 value and high tissue tolerance to ammonia. The weatherloach does not appear to make use of Na+/NH4+-ATPase facilitated transport to excrete ammonia when exposed to HEA or to high environmental pH since no changes in activity were observed. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, distinct populations of vacuolar (V)-type H+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase immunoreactive cells were identified in branchial epithelia, with apical and basolateral staining patterns, respectively. Rhesus C glycoprotein (Rhcg1), an ammonia transport protein, immunoreactivity was also found in a similar pattern as H+-ATPase. Rhcg1 (Slc42a3) mRNA expression also increased significantly during aerial exposure, although not significantly under ammonia loading conditions. The colocalization of H+-ATPase and Rhcg1 to the similar non-Na+/K+-ATPase immunoreactive cell type would support a role for H+-ATPase in ammonia excretion via Rhcg by NH4+ trapping. The importance of gill boundary layer acidification in net ammonia excretion was confirmed in this fish; however, it was not associated with an increase in H+-ATPase expression, since tissue activity and protein levels did not increase with high environmental pH and/or HEA. However the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, did decrease net ammonia flux whereas other ion transport inhibitors (amiloride, SITS) had no effect. H+-ATPase inhibition also resulted in a consequent elevation in plasma ammonia levels and a decrease in the net acid flux. In gill, aerial exposure was also associated with a significant increase in membrane fluidity (or increase in permeability) which would presumably enhance NH3 permeation through the plasma membrane. Taken together, these results indicate the gill of the weatherloach is responsive to aerial conditions that would aid ammonia excretion.",

The time course using N-acetylglucosamine pentamer as a substrate exhibited a reduction of the rate constant of glycosidic cleavage and increase of binding free energy for subsites E and F, which proved the contribution for amino acids mentioned above for substrate binding at subsites E and F. Interestingly, the variable binding free energy values occurred on ASTL, may be contributed from substitutions at outside of subsites E and F.",

     "abstract": "Peptide fragments possessing antimicrobial activity were obtained by protease digestion of goose egg white lysozyme. Digested peptide purified from RP-HPLC which showed no lysozyme activity exhibited bactericidal activity toward Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. LC/MS\u2013MS and automated Edman degradation revealed the amino acid sequence to be Thr-Ala-Lys-Pro-Glu-Gly-Leu-Ser-Tyr. This sequence corresponds to amino acid positions 20\u201328, located at the N-terminal outer part of goose lysozyme. The peptide acted on bacterial membrane as shown by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanism of action could be explained from a helical structure that may be formed by the centered Pro residue and the terminal Lys residue after the peptide attaches to a cell membrane. This is the first study to report that a peptide derived from the protease digests of G-type lysozyme possesses antimicrobial activity with broad spectrum activity. Our result is comparative to the previous reports of Chicken lysozyme and T4 phage lysozyme, which showed antimicrobial activity after digestion with protease. These results might contribute to the usage of antimicrobial peptides engineered by genetic or chemical synthesis.",

In our study, a Fenneropenaeus chinensis thioredoxin (FcTRX) gene was identified from the Chinese white shrimp. The full length of FcTRX was 777\u00a0bp, including a 60\u00a0bp 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), a 318\u00a0bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 105 amino acids protein, and a 399\u00a0bp 3\u2032 UTR. FcTRX contained a TRX domain with a conserved motif of Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys (CGPC). No signal peptide was predicted by SMART analysis. The molecular mass and pI of FcTRX were 12\u00a0kDa and 4.62, respectively. FcTRX is a widely distributed gene, and its mRNA is detected in hemocytes, hearts, hepatopancreas, gills, stomach, and intestine from an unchallenged shrimp. The expression level of FcTRX was the highest in hepatopancreas, where it was down-regulated to the lowest level at 12\u00a0h white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge. In the gills, it went up to the highest level at 6\u00a0h. Western blot showed that FcTRX protein in hepatopancreas challenged with WSSV was down-regulated from 2\u00a0h to 12\u00a0h and then restored to the level similar to that of unchallenged shrimp at 24\u00a0h. In the gills challenged with WSSV, the FcTRX protein was up-regulated from 6\u00a0h to 24\u00a0h. Our research indicated its possible role in the anti-WSSV innate immunity of shrimps.",

In this study, we report cloning and expression of seven genes of the GST family of the pufferfish Takifugu obscurus together with mRNA tissue distribution pattern and time-course of expression in response to exposure to cadmium. At basal levels of tissue expression, GST-Mu is highly expressed in liver compared with other tissues. When fish were exposed to cadmium (5\u00a0mg/L for 96\u00a0h), expression of GST-MAPEG, GST-Mu, GST-Omega, and GST-Zeta was greatly increased, whereas GST-Alpha and GST-Kappa genes showed no significant response. These findings suggest that gene expression of a number of GST isoforms in T. obscurus is modulated in response to exposure to cadmium. We propose GST-Mu, GST-Theta, and GST-Zeta as candidate biomarkers for heavy metal exposure in this fish.",

Because the toxic effects of many PAHs are the result of metabolism by cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), it is important to investigate whether active forms of these enzymes can be identified in the mitochondria. In this study, we identified mitochondrial P450s with a monoclonal antibody against scup (Stenotomus chrysops) CYP1A in the isolated mitochondrial fraction of the liver from adult male mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) livers. The size of the protein in the mitochondria was similar to that of microsomal CYP1A. Fish dosed with 10\u00a0mg/kg BaP had increased EROD activity in the mitochondrial fraction compared to controls. In mummichog larvae dosed with 100\u00a0\u00b5g/L BaP and 100\u00a0\u00b5g/L benzo[k]fluoranthene, CYP1A protein levels as well as enzyme activity were elevated.

     "abstract": "Brown widow spider (BrWS) (Latrodectus geometricus) venom produces intense systemic reactions such as cramps, harsh muscle nociceptive, nauseas, vomiting and hypertension. The proposed pathogenic mechanisms resulting in these accidents have principally been damages occurring at the nervous system. However, it is suspected that there is also damage of the adrenal glands, as a result of the experimental animal's clinical manifestations, which developed symptoms compatible with acute adrenal insufficiency. We have currently found that the adrenal gland is damaged by this venom gland homogenates (VGH) producing severe alterations on cortex cells resulting in death by acute adrenal insufficiency. In general, the ultrastructural study on the glands of mice under transmission electronic microscopy observations showed alterations in the majority of the intracellular membranes within 3 to 24\u00a0h. BrWSVGH also showed specific actions on extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin, laminin and fibrinogen. In addition, zymogram experiments using gelatin as substrates detected gelatinolytic activity. The molecular exclusion fractionation of crude BrWSVGH resulted in 15 fractions, of which F1 and F2 presented \u03b1/\u03b2-fibrinogenase and fibronectinolytic activities. Fractions F6, F14 and F15 showed only \u03b1-fibrinogenase activity; in contrast, the gelatinolytic action was only observed in fraction F11. Only metalloproteinase inhibitors abolished all these proteolytic activities. Our results suggest that adrenal cortex lesions may be relevant in the etiopathogenesis of severe brown widow spider envenoming. To our knowledge, this is the first report on adrenal gland damages, fibrinogenolytic activity and interrelations with cell-matrix adhesion proteins caused by L.geometricus VGH. The venom of this spider could be inducing hemostatic system damages on envenomed patients.",

In the present study, we cloned cDNAs encoding the precursors of brevinin-2Oc, palustrin-2Oa, and ranatuerin-2Ob and -2Oe from skin total RNA preparations from adult R. ornativentris and established a semi-quantitative RT-PCR system to measure the concentrations of these mRNAs. The levels of preprobrevinin-2 and preproranatuerin-2 mRNAs in the skin specimens of developing R. ornativentris larva were detectable only at stages later than the onset of metamorphosis and reached peaks at the stage of metamorphic climax. In contrast, prepropalustrin-2 mRNA was detected prior to the onset of metamorphosis and levels peaked at stages earlier than those of the other two mRNAs. In adult animals, preprobrevinin-2 and preproranatuerin-2 gene transcripts were detected at low levels in the small intestine and skeletal muscle but not in the stomach, liver, or kidney, whereas prepropalustrin-2 gene transcripts were detected at relatively high concentrations in all tissues examined. These results indicate that the expression of amphibian AMP genes is correlated with metamorphosis but is subjected to differential regulation.",

     "abstract": "A thrombin-like enzyme, purpurase, was purified from the Cryptelytrops purpureomaculatus (mangrove pit viper) venom using high performance ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. The purified sample (termed purpurase) yielded a homogeneous band in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 35,000. The N-terminal sequence of purpurase was determined to be VVGGDECNINDHRSLVRIF and is homologous to many other venom thrombin-like enzymes. Purpurase exhibits both arginine ester hydrolase and amidase activities. Kinetic studies using tripeptide chromogenic anilide substrates showed that purpurase is not fastidious towards its substrate. The clotting times of fibrinogen by purpurase were concentration dependent, with optimum clotting activity at 3\u00a0mg fibronogen/mL. The clotting activity by purpurase was in the following decreasing order: cat fibrinogen\u00a0>\u00a0human fibrinogen\u00a0>\u00a0dog fibrinogen\u00a0>\u00a0goat fibrinogen\u00a0>>\u00a0rabbit fibrinogen. Reversed-phase HPLC analysis of the products of action of purpurase on bovine fibrinogen showed that only fibrinopeptide A was released. Indirect ELISA studies showed that anti-purpurase cross-reacted strongly with venoms of most crotalid venoms, indicating the snake venom thrombin-like enzymes generally possess similar epitopes. In the more specific double-sandwich ELISA, however, anti-purpurase cross-reacted only with venoms of certain species of the Trimeresurus complex, and the results support the recent proposed taxonomy changes concerning the Trimeresurus complex.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to CBZ on the antioxidant system in brain tissue of rainbow trout. Fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of CBZ (1.0\u00a0\u03bcg/L, 0.2\u00a0mg/L or 2.0\u00a0mg/L) for 7, 21, and 42\u00a0days. Oxidative stress indices (LPO and CP) and activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx and GR) in fish brain were measured. In addition, non-enzymatic antioxidant (GSH) was determined after 42\u00a0days exposure. Carbamazepine exposure at 0.2\u00a0mg/L led to significant increases (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of LPO and CP after 42\u00a0days and, at 2.0\u00a0mg/L, after 21\u00a0days. Activities of the antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, and GPx in CBZ-treated groups slightly increased during the first period (7\u00a0days). However, activities of all measured antioxidant enzymes were significantly inhibited (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 0.2\u00a0mg/L exposure after 42\u00a0days and after 21\u00a0days at 2.0\u00a0mg/L. After 42\u00a0days, the content of GSH in fish brain was significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in groups exposed to CBZ at 0.2\u00a0mg/L and 2.0\u00a0mg/L than in other groups. Prolonged exposure to CBZ resulted in excess reactive oxygen species formation, finally resulting in oxidative damage to lipids and proteins and inhibited antioxidant capacities in fish brain. In short, a low level of oxidative stress could induce the adaptive responses of antioxidant enzymes, but long-term exposure to CBZ could lead to serious oxidative damage in fish brain.",

Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl, H2O2 levels and total antioxidant capacity of the tissues elevated significantly at 35\u00a0ppt salinity except in abdominal muscle where H2O2 content was low. Ascorbic acid content of tissues was higher at 17\u00a0ppt salinity than at 10 and 35\u00a0ppt salinities.

While for hepatopancreas, an increase followed by a decrease in SOD and catalase, decrease in GPx and GR activities were noticed with increasing salinity. In the case of gills, a decrease followed by an increase in SOD, a decrease in catalase and GPx and an increase in GR activities were noted when the salinity increased from 10\u00a0ppt to 35\u00a0ppt.

     "abstract": "Apolipoproteins play important roles in lipid transport and uptake in vertebrates, and they are associated with pathogenesis of many cardiovascular diseases. However, the diverse apolipoproteins in individual fish species have not been extensively characterized. Partial cDNA sequences encoding ApoA-IV, ApoE, ApoM, ApoL, and ApoO, and full-length cDNA sequences encoding ApoA-I were cloned from rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus). Sequence analysis showed that these genes, as well as fragments of other known apolipoprotein genes (ApoC-I, ApoC-II, ApoB) of rare minnow had a high similarity (91\u201396%) to their orthologues in the spotted barbel Hemibarbus mylodon (Teleostei:Cypriniformes). The expression of these nine genes and their possible upstream genes, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, and HNF4\u03b1, were investigated in rare minnow after subacute exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) for 14\u00a0days. Results showed that the expression of mRNA for ApoA-I, ApoC-II, and ApoM was significantly downregulated in all PFOA-treated animals. Only fish receiving the highest dose of PFOA showed downregulation of the expression of ApoA-IV and ApoC-I, while fish treated with 10\u00a0mg PFOA/L showed upregulation of expression of ApoE. Expression of ApoB, ApoO, and ApoL was unchanged between control and treated groups. In addition, the expression of PPAR\u03b1 was increased in all dosed fish, while the mRNAs for PPAR\u03b3 and HNF4\u03b1 were significantly altered with 30 and 3\u00a0mg PFOA/L doses, respectively. Therefore, subacute exposure to PFOA resulted in alteration of expression of apolipoproteins and related genes. These changes in gene expression may further influence lipid metabolism or other physiological functions in fish.",
