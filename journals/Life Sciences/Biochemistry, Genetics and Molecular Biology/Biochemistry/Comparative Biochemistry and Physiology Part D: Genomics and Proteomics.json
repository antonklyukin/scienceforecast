     "abstract": "Planktonic copepods are a diverse and abundant group of small (~mm sized) aquatic animals that play a critical role in linking the base of the food chain with higher trophic levels. These invertebrates are a primary food source for marine fish larvae. Their ubiquitous presence is thus of vital importance for recruitment of fish stocks and also as promising live feed for finfish production in aquaculture. This paper reviews the application of molecular approaches to understanding copepod physiology, particularly in non-parasitic species. The review includes both targeted gene approaches and untargeted transcriptomic approaches, with suggestions for best practices in each case. Issues particularly relevant to studies of copepods include heterogeneity within species, morphologically cryptic species, experimental artifacts associated with sample handling, and limited annotation of copepod genes and transcripts. The emergence of high-throughput sequencing and associated increased availability of genomic and transcriptomic databases have presented a huge opportunity to advance knowledge of copepod physiology. The research community can leverage this opportunity through efforts to maintain or improve data accessibility, database annotation, and documentation of analytical pipelines.",

     "abstract": "Vertebrate freeze tolerance requires multiple adaptations underpinned by specialized biochemistry. Freezing of extracellular water leads to intracellular dehydration as pure water is incorporated into growing ice crystals and also results in the cessation of blood supply to tissues, creating an anoxic cellular environment. Hence, the freeze tolerant wood frog, Rana sylvatica, must endure both dehydration and anoxia stresses in addition to freezing. The metabolic responses to freezing, dehydration and anoxia involve both protein/enzyme adaptations and the production of metabolites with metabolic or osmotic functions, particularly glucose and urea. The present study uses a phosphoproteome analysis to examine the differential phosphorylation of metabolic enzymes involved in the production of these two metabolites in liver in response to freezing, anoxia, or dehydration exposures. Our results show stress-specific responses in the abundance of phosphopeptides retrieved from nine glycolytic enzymes and three urea cycle enzymes in liver of wood frogs exposed to 24\u202fh freezing, 24\u202fh anoxia, or dehydration to 40% of total body water loss, as compared with 5\u202f\u00b0C acclimated controls. Data show changes in the abundance of phosphopeptides belonging to glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK2) that were consistent with differential phosphorylation control of glycogenolysis and a metabolic block at PFK1 that can facilitate glucose synthesis as the cryoprotectant during freezing. Anoxia-exposed animals showed similar changes in GP phosphorylation but no changes to PFK2; changes that would facilitate mobilization of glycogen as a fermentative fuel for anaerobic glycolysis. Urea is commonly produced as a compatible osmolyte in response to amphibian dehydration. Selected urea cycle enzymes showed small changes in phosphopeptide abundance in response to dehydration, but during freezing differential phosphorylation occurred that may facilitate this ATP expensive process when energy resources are sparse. These results add to the growing body of literature demonstrating the importance and efficiency of reversible protein phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism allowing animals to rapidly respond to environmental stress.",

However, little is known about the possible molecular mechanism of hypotonic induction. In this study, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) based proteomic profiling was pursued to investigate the responses of zygotes of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to low salinity. A total of 2235 proteins were identified and 87 proteins were considered differentially expressed, of which 14 were up-regulated and 69 were down-regulated. Numerous functional proteins including ADP ribosylation factor 2, DNA repair protein Rad50, splicing factor 3B, tubulin-specific Chaperone D were significantly changed in abundance, and were involved in various biology processes including energy generation, vesicle trafficking, DNA/RNA/protein metabolism and cytoskeleton modification, indicating the prominent modulation of cell division and embryonic development. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analyses were carried out for validation of the expression levels of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), which indicated high reliability of the proteomic results. Our study not only demonstrated the proteomic alterations in oyster zygotes under low salinity, but also provided, in part, clues to the relatively lower hatching rate and higher mortality of induced larvae. Above all, this study presents a valuable foundation for further studies on mechanisms of hypotonic induction.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "The common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a carnivorous cetacean that thrives in marine environments, one of the apex predators of the marine food web. They are found in coastal and estuarine ecosystems, which are known to be sensitive to environmental impacts. Dolphins are considered sentinel organisms for monitoring the health of coastal marine ecosystems due to their role as predators that can bioaccumulate contaminants. Although recent studies have focused on capturing the circulating metabolomes of these mammals, and in the context of pollutants and exposures in the marine environment, skin and blubber are important surface and protective tissues that have not been adequately probed for metabolism. Using a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) based metabolomics approach, we quantified 51 metabolites belonging to 74 different metabolic pathways in the skin and blubber of stranded bottlenose dolphin (n\u202f=\u202f4) samples collected at different localities in the Southern Zone coast of Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Results indicate that metabolism of skin and blubber are quantitatively very different. These metabolite abundances could help discriminate the tissue-types using supervised partial least square regression discriminant analysis (PLSDA). Further, using hierarchical clustering analysis and random forest analysis of the metabolite abundances, the results pointed to unique metabolites that are important classifiers of the tissue-type. On one hand, the differential metabolic patterns, mainly linking fatty acid metabolism and ketogenic amino acids, seem to constitute a characteristic of blubber, thus pointing to fat synthesis and deposition. On the other hand, the skin showed several metabolites involved in gluconeogenic pathways, pointing towards an active anabolic energy-generating metabolism. The most notable pathways found in both tissues included: urea cycle, nucleotide metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glutathione metabolism among others. Our 1H NMR metabolomics analysis allowed the quantification of metabolites associated with these two organs, i.e., pyruvic acid, arginine, ornithine, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid, and acetic acid, as discriminatory and classifying metabolites. These results would lead to further understanding of the functional and physiological roles of dolphin skin and blubber metabolism for better efforts in their conservation, as well as useful target biopsy tissues for monitoring of dolphin health conditions in marine pollution and ecotoxicology studies.",

Chemosensory membrane proteins are believed to be crucial factors in direct interactions with odorants in the chemosensory process. However, there is much limited information on the chemosensory system in this pest. In this study, a total of 69 candidate chemosensory membrane protein genes, including 60 olfactory receptors (ORs), 6 ionotropic receptors (IRs) and 3 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), were identified for the first time from the antennal transcriptomes of O. asiaticus. Blastp match and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these chemosensory membrane proteins were the closest to their orthologous species, Locusta migratoria. The qRT-PCR analysis revealed that all tested 14 OR and two SNMP genes (OasiSNMP1 and OasiSNMP2a) were strongly expressed in adult antennae, and nearly all tested genes (15/16) displayed significant differences in the expression levels between both sexes. Moreover, two IR genes (OasiIR25a and OasiIR76b) had uniquely high expression levels in the antennae, labial palps and maxillary palps, while three IR genes (OasiIR1, OasiIR2 and OasiIR3) were highly expressed in most tested tissues (heads without antennae and mouthparts, labial palps, maxillary palps, labia without labial palps, thoraxes, tarsi, and abdomens) except for antennae, labra, and wings but OasiIR5a was just faintly expressed in the antennae, labia without labial palps, labial palps, maxillary palps and abdomen. Our results provide important molecular information for further investigation on the chemoreception mechanisms in O. asiaticus.",

     "abstract": "Bradysia odoriphaga is a serious pest of the Chinese chive; however, detailed information regarding the developmental stage-specific gene expression patterns of B. odoriphaga is not yet available. In this study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to determine the gene expression patterns of developmental stages including the eggs, second instar larvae, fourth instar larvae, pupae, and adults of B. odoriphaga. Analysis of 15 samples revealed an average of 89.56% of the clean reads could be mapped onto the assembled UniGene database. Cluster tree analysis showed that the expression patterns were stage-specific and that samples of the second and fourth instar larvae clustered in one group, while those of eggs, pupae, and adults clustered in another group. Differential expression unigenes (DEUs) for sequential developmental stages were between 3314 and 10,632. A total of 1910\u20137756 DEUs of sequential developmental stages were assigned into 45\u201356 gene ontology categories and 1165\u20133845 DEUs were mapped into Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The expression of DEUs related to growth and development showed that hormone receptors highly expressed in the pupal stage, while chitinases were highly expressed in the larval stage. The results of quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and RNA-seq expression agreed well for 12 growth- and development-related unigenes. This study identified DEUs for sequential developmental stages of B. odoriphaga. Gene Ontology classifications and KEGG pathway identification of DEUs not only provide information useful for understanding insect growth and development but also for exploring novel approaches to control B. odoriphaga.",

     "abstract": "We investigated if transcriptional responses are consistent with the arrest of synaptic activity in the anoxic turtle (Trachemys scripta) brain. Thirty-nine genes of key receptors, transporters, enzymes and regulatory proteins of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission were partially cloned and their expression in telencephalon of 21\u202f\u00b0C- and 5\u202f\u00b0C-acclimated normoxic, anoxic (24\u202fh at 21\u202f\u00b0C; 1 and 14\u202fdays at 5\u202f\u00b0C) and reoxygenated (24\u202fh at 21\u202f\u00b0C; 13\u202fdays at 5\u202f\u00b0C) turtles quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Gene expression was largely sustained with anoxia at 21\u202f\u00b0C and 5\u202f\u00b0C. However, the changes in gene expression that did occur were congruous with the decline in glutamatergic activity and the increase in GABAergic activity observed at cellular and whole organism levels. Moreover, at 21\u202f\u00b0C, the alterations in gene expression with anoxia induced a distinct gene expression pattern compared to normoxia and reoxygenation. Strikingly, acclimation from 21\u202f\u00b0C to 5\u202f\u00b0C in normoxia effectuated substantial transcriptional responses. Most prominently, 56% of the excitatory neurotransmission genes were down-regulated, including most of the ones encoding the subunits composing excitatory N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and 3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) glutamate receptors. By contrast, only 26% of the inhibitory neurotransmission genes were down-regulated. Consequently, the gene expression pattern of 5\u202f\u00b0C normoxic turtles was statistically distinct compared to that of 21\u202f\u00b0C normoxic turtles. Overall, this study highlights that key transcriptional responses are consonant with the synaptic arrest that occurs in the anoxic turtle brain. In addition, the findings reveal that transcriptional remodelling induced by decreased temperature may serve to precondition the turtle brain for winter anoxia.",

Currently, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) based biopesticides are being used for their control. However, the insects are known to develop resistance not only against chemical pesticides but also to Bt based biopesticides. In the present study, de novo transcriptome analysis was conducted to monitor the expression pattern of larval midgut genes in Achaea janata exposed to sublethal dose of Bt formulation. A total of 34,612 and 41,109 transcripts were identified in control and toxin-exposed larval midgut samples out of which 18,836 in control and 21,046 in toxin-exposed samples are annotated. Microarray data analysis employed to monitor the gene expression upon Cry toxin exposure revealed that 375 genes were upregulated and 579 genes were downregulated during all the time points (12\u201360\u202fh) of toxin exposure. The differentially expressed transcripts include i.e. Cry toxin receptors, gut proteases, arylphorin, REPATs, detoxification enzymes and aquaporins. Validation of microarray data was performed by real-time quantitative PCR using few randomly selected genes and the results obtained were in corroboration. This is the first study on transcriptome data from the castor semilooper and the results would provide valuable resources for the characterization of Bt toxin response in the pest.",

     "abstract": "Snake venoms are extremely active biological secretions composed primarily of various classes of enzymes. The genus Bothrops comprises various pit viper species that represent the most medically significant taxa in Central and South America, accounting for more human envenomations and fatalities than any other snakes in the region. Venom proteomes of many Bothrops species have been well-characterized but investigations have focused almost exclusively on proteins smaller than 100\u202fkDa despite expression of larger components being documented in several Bothrops venoms. This study sought to achieve detailed identification of major components in the high molecular mass subproteome of venoms from eight Bothrops species (B. brazili, B. cotiara, B. insularis, B. jararaca, B. jararacussu, B. leucurus, B. moojeni and B. neuwiedi). Enzymes such as metalloproteinases and L-amino acid oxidases were the most prominent components identified in the first size-exclusion chromatography fractions of these venoms. Minor components also identified in the first peaks included 5\u2032-nucleotidase, aminopeptidase, phosphodiesterase, and phospholipases A2 and B. Most of these components disappeared in electrophoretic profiles under reducing conditions, suggesting that they may be composed of more than one polypeptide chain. A significant shift in the molecular masses of these protein bands was observed following enzymatic N-deglycosylation, indicating that they may contain N-glycans. Furthermore, none of the identified high molecular mass proteins were shared by all eight species, revealing a high level of interspecific variability among these venom components.",

     "abstract": "The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka) is a valuable economic species in Southeast Asia. It has many fascinating behavioral characteristics, such as autolysis, aestivation, regeneration, and evisceration, thus it is a notable species for studies of special behaviors. Evisceration and autotomy are controlled by the neural network and involve a complicated physiological process. The occurrence of evisceration behavior in sea cucumbers is strongly related to their environment, and it negatively impacts their economic value. Evisceration behavior plays a pivotal role in the survival of A. japonicus, and when it is induced by dramatic changes in the coastal ecological environment and the aquaculture setting it can strongly affect the economic performance of this species. Although numerous studies have focused on intestinal regeneration of A. japonicus, less is known about evisceration behavior, especially its underlying molecular mechanisms. Thus, identification of genes that regulate evisceration in the sea cucumber likely will provide a scientific explanation for this significant specific behavior. In this study, Illumina sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed on A. japonicus specimens in three states: normal (TCQ), eviscerating (TCZ), and 3\u202fh after evisceration (TCH). In total, 129,905 unigenes were generated with an N50 length of 2651 base pairs, and 54,787 unigenes were annotated from seven functional databases (KEGG, KOG, GO, NR, NT, Interpro, and Swiss-Prot). Additionally, 190, 191, and 320 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the comparisons of TCQ vs. TCZ, TCZ vs. TCH, and TCQ vs. TCH, respectively. These DEGs mapped to 157, 113, and 190 signaling pathways in the KEGG database, respectively. KEGG analyses also revealed that potential DEGs enriched in the categories of \u201cenvironmental information processing,\u201d \u201corganismal system,\u201d \u201cmetabolism,\u201d and \u201ccellular processes,\u201d and they were involved in evisceration behavior in A. japonicus. These DEGs are related to muscle contraction, hormone and neurotransmitter secretion, nerve and muscle damage, energy support, cellular stress, and apoptosis. In conclusion, through our comparative analysis of A. japonicus in different stages, we identified many candidate evisceration-related genes and signaling pathways that likely are involved in evisceration behavior. These results should help further elucidate the mechanisms underlying evisceration behavior in sea cucumbers.",

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of the heat-stress response in the trout, we used label-free quantitative proteome techniques to identify differentially expressed proteins in the livers of rainbow trout exposed to heat stress. We identified 3362 proteins and 152 differentially expressed proteins (p\u202f<\u202f0.05; fold-change >2). Of these, 37 were uniquely expressed in the heat-stress group and 35 were uniquely expressed in the control group. In addition, 42 proteins were significantly upregulated (fold-change >2) and 38 proteins were significantly downregulated (fold-change >2). GO (Gene Ontology) analysis indicated that these differentially expressed proteins were primarily expressed in the nucleus, extracellular matrix, and cytoplasm, and were associated with a variety of functions, including protein binding/bridging and enzyme facilitation. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of the differentially expressed proteins showed that, during high temperature stress, many biological processes were extensively altered, particularly the estrogen signaling pathway, the complement and coagulation cascades, and the platelet activation pathway. Our study focused on the identification of a systematic approach for the characterization of regulatory networks.

The liver was selected as the target tissue for this analysis. A total of 243 and 88 genes were differentially expressed after 6 and 24\u202fh of heat stress, respectively. Of these, only 22 were common to both time points, and most of these common genes were molecular chaperones such as heat shock cognate 71\u202fkDa protein and heat shock protein 90-alpha. Genes such as activating transcription factor 6, calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase A3, and protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-eukaryotic initiation factor 2-alpha were only up-regulated after 6\u202fh of heat stress; most of these genes are involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. Indeed, endoplasmic reticulum stress was identified at 6\u202fh but not at 24\u202fh, suggesting that stress response plays an important role in the adaptation of Atlantic salmon to acute heat stress. Other up-regulated genes at 6\u202fh were related to the insulin and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptor signaling pathways, which directly eliminate misfolded proteins and sustain sugar and lipid homeostasis. At 24\u202fh, heat stress influenced the expression of steroid and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, which may influence the sexual development and differentiation of Atlantic salmon. Overall, our results elucidate the transcriptome mechanisms that contribute to short-term heat tolerance in the liver of Atlantic salmon.",

Phylogenetic analysis have clearly revealed that Brachionus spp. has only 2/5 and 3/6 subfamilies, and two novel Elovl classes have been revealed, namely Elovl9 and 10.

     "abstract": "The oriental armyworm Mythimna separata Walker is a serious migratory and polyphagous pest that damages major crops and some pastures from the family Gramineae. Temperature is a crucial abiotic factor that affects its survival, development and reproduction, but the thermal responses of this moth at the molecular level are largely unknown. In this research, we sequenced the transcriptomes of oriental armyworms that were reared at three temperatures (20\u202f\u00b0C, 25\u202f\u00b0C and 30\u202f\u00b0C) using an Illumina high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) method. We obtained 54.0 Gb of clean reads and 113,396 transcripts. From a total of 46,681 unigenes identified, 22,911 were annotated to the non-redundant (NR) database. We identified 333 downregulated and 1588 upregulated genes in 20\u202f\u00b0C versus 25\u202f\u00b0C, and 1096 downregulated and 875 upregulated genes at 30\u202f\u00b0C versus 25\u202f\u00b0C by differential expression of genes (DEGs). GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analyses revealed several functional terms related to carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and xenobiotics metabolism. DEGs involved in glycolysis, the citrate cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and the composition of myofilaments were significantly downregulated, while most heat shock protein genes (HSPs) and genes in the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway were upregulated at 30\u202f\u00b0C. Many cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (CYPs) in clan 3 were upregulated at 20\u202f\u00b0C, while two genes involved in ecdysteroid biosynthesis, CYP302A1 and CYP315A1, were upregulated at 30\u202f\u00b0C. These data may improve the understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms involved in the thermal responses of M. separata.",

     "abstract": "Skin ulceration syndrome (SUS) of sea cucumber is a common and serious disease that affects the stable development of Apostichopus japonicus in the culture industry. The part of sea cucumber that suffers from major injury and is directly observed is the body wall, in which protein variations should be the most direct evidence of the disease. To understand the response mechanisms of A. japonicus in SUS progression, we investigated protein changes in the body wall of diseased A. japonicus induced by Vibrio splendidus and individuals with natural diseases by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). About 119 proteins were identified in the two iTRAQ groups. A comparison of the protein expression profiles among two SUS conditions revealed that the mode of action induced by V. splendidus (Vs-SUS) was completely different from those in individuals with natural disease (ND-SUS). Most of the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (33 in 37 DEPs) were significantly depressed in the Vs-SUS group. Only 13 proteins in 27 DEPs showed similar trend to those in the ND-SUS group. Many important proteins involved in major intercellular signaling pathways associated with SUS disease were identified based on the KEGG and GO database search. Many proteins were located in the mitochondria and mainly involved in the oxidative stress pathway. Glutathione metabolism pathway was associated with reactive oxygen (ROS) production in the ND-SUS group. In the Vs-group, most of the proteins were concentrated in the cytoplasm and were related to immunity and extracellular matrix stability. In the ND-SUS group, the activity of key enzymes (CAT, GPx) that eliminate mitochondrial ROS production and structural stable protein (HSP60, HSP10) decreased, whereas those of complement proteins (C3, C3-2) that promoted ROS production was upregulated. This finding supported that oxidative damage caused by ROS might be the main effector for SUS in the ND-SUS group. The challenge with V. splendidus led to the breakdown of the defense capability of sea cucumber and suppressed the expression of immune-related proteins, such as C-type lectin, caspase, STAT, and cystatin. The downregulation of TIMP led to MMP1 overexpression. Members of the MMP family could directly degrade the extracellular matrix, which may be the main reason for the cell matrix degradation and induced SUS disease in the Vs-SUS group. Hence, ROS and extracellular matrix degradation enzymes could play important roles in the formation of SUS in sea cucumber. Results provide insights into the complex molecular mechanism of SUS in sea cucumber.",

     "abstract": "The oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis, is one of the most destructive pests worldwide. The frequent use of chemical insecticides has led B. dorsalis to develop resistance to many insecticides in recent decades. New high-throughput-sequenced transcriptomes, as well as genomes, have revealed a large number of reference genes for functional target identification. Here, we performed digital gene expression profiling of ovary and testis of B. dorsalis adults. Various genes were identified to be highly expressed in B. dorsalis ovary. The genes encoding components of eggshell, vitelline membrane proteins (Vmps) and chorion-related proteins, were identified to be tissue-specifically expressed in ovary. Five cytochrome P450 genes were also identified to be highly expressed in ovary. Three of them were ecdysone synthesis pathway genes indicating the ovary as a potential synthesis site of female. The up-regulated expression of Vmps by exogenous 20-hydroxyecdysone implied the hormonal regulation of eggshell formation during ovarian development. Many other genes with potential functions in ovarian development were also identified, including vitellogenin receptor, insulin receptor, NASP protein, and odorant binding protein. These findings should promote our understanding of the regulation of vitellogenesis and eggshell formation and enable exploration of potentially novel pest control targets.",

Many eukaryotic genes contain more than one PASs, termed as alternative polyadenylation (APA). As a crucial post-transcriptional regulation, polyadenylation affects various aspects of RNA metabolism such as mRNA stability, translocation, and translation. However, polyadenylation has been rarely studied in teleosts. Here we conducted polyadenylation analysis in channel catfish, a commercially important aquaculture species around the world. Using RNA-Seq data, we identified 20,320 PASs which were classified into 14,500 clusters by merging adjacent PASs. Most of the PASs were found in 3\u2032 UTRs, followed by intron regions based on the annotation of channel catfish reference genome. No apparent difference in PAS distribution was observed between the sense and antisense strand of the channel catfish genome. The sequence analysis of nucleotide composition and motif around PASs yielded a highly similar profile among various organisms, suggesting the conservation and importance of polyadenylation in evolution. Using APA genes with more than two PASs, gene ontology enrichment revealed genes particularly involved in RNA binding. Reactome pathway analysis showed the enrichment of the innate immune system, especially neutrophil degranulation.",

However, the role played by receptor diversity/complement in determining this functional flexibility is not clear. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, contains CPGs that are models for investigating peptidergic control of rhythmic behavior. Although many Cancer peptides have been identified, their peptide receptors are largely unknown. Thus, the extent to which receptor diversity/complement contributes to modulatory flexibility in this system remains unresolved. Here, a Cancer mixed nervous system transcriptome was used to determine the peptide receptor complement for the crab nervous system as a whole. Receptors for 27 peptide families, including multiple receptors for some groups, were identified. To increase confidence in the predicted sequences, receptors for allatostatin-A, allatostatin-B, and allatostatin-C were cloned, sequenced, and expressed in an insect cell line; as expected, all three receptors trafficked to the cell membrane. RT-PCR was used to determine whether each receptor was expressed in the Cancer STG. Transcripts for 36 of the 46 identified receptors were amplified; these included at least one for each peptide family except RYamide. Finally, two peptides untested on the crab STG were assessed for their influence on its motor outputs. Myosuppressin, for which STG receptors were identified, exhibited clear modulatory effects on the motor patterns of the ganglion, while a native RYamide, for which no STG receptors were found, elicited no consistent modulatory effects. These data support receptor diversity/complement as a major contributor to the functional flexibility of CPGs.",

In order to increase the number of molecular markers available for Elateroidea species and to propose a more accurate phylogeny, with high supported topology, we employed the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) methodology to perform the RNA-Seq analysis of luminescent (Elateridae, Phengodidae, Rhagophthalmidae, and Lampyridae) and non-luminescent (Cantharidae) species of Neotropical beetles. We used the RNA-Seq data to construct a calibrated phylogeny of Elateroidea superfamily using a large number of nuclear molecular markers. The results indicate Lampyridae and Phengodidae/Rhagophthalmidae as sister-groups, suggesting that the bioluminescence evolved later in Elateridae than other families (Lampyridae, Phengodidae, and Rhagophthalmidae), and indicating the Upper Cretaceous as the period for the main diversification of Elateroidea bioluminescent species.",

Phylogenetic analysis of ABC transporters revealed a close relationship between D. citri and Laodelphax striatellus. qPCR analyses showed that several DcitABC transporters were highly expressed in fat body, midgut and the hindgut with Malpighian tubules. In particular, DcitABCG11 and DcitABCG14 were most highly expressed in the hindgut. The transcript abundance of 11 DcitABC genes was significantly upregulated upon exposure to an LC50 concentration of imidacloprid. The expressions of three cytochrome P450 genes and one glutathione S-transferase gene were also significantly elevated.

To understand how geoduck production may be impacted by low pH associated with ocean acidification, multi-faceted environmental heterogeneity needs to be included to understand species and community responses. In this study, eelgrass habitats and environmental heterogeneity across four estuarine bays were leveraged to examine low pH effects on geoduck under different natural regimes, using targeted proteomics to assess physiology. Juvenile geoduck were deployed in eelgrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats for 30\u202fdays while pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity were monitored. Across the four bays, pH was lower in unvegetated habitats compared to eelgrass habitats. However this did not impact geoduck growth, survival, or proteomic abundance patterns in gill tissue. Temperature and dissolved oxygen differences across all locations corresponded to differences in growth and targeted protein abundance patterns. Specifically, three protein abundance levels (trifunctional-enzyme \u03b2-subunit, puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase, and heat shock protein 90-\u03b1) and shell growth positively correlated with dissolved oxygen variability and inversely correlated with mean temperature. These results demonstrate that geoduck may be resilient to low pH in a natural setting, but other abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, dissolved oxygen variability) may have a greater influence on geoduck physiology. In addition this study contributes to the understanding of how eelgrass patches influences water chemistry.",

The Pacific abalone, Haliotis discus hannai, is the most widely cultured abalone species in China, but suffering from \u201csummer mortality\u201d in which hypoxia has been one of the main reasons. The effect of hypoxia exposure on immune responses in H. discus hannai was investigated, including cellular immune response using flow cytometry and transcriptome profiles. The influence of hypoxia treatment on the total hemocyte count (THC) of H. discus hannai was rather limited but the hemocyte survival rate of abalone increased during 48\u202fh exposure. There was an initial rise in the production of phagocytes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) shortly (3\u202fh) after hypoxic stimulation, but finally decreased after 48\u202fh. This indicates that hypoxia inhibited redox activity of abalone. RNA-seq studies of gill tissues also revealed immune response mechanism in abalone after 24\u202fh of hypoxia. Totally 954 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected under different degrees of deoxygenation. Though oxidation-reduction turbulence was a result of both up- and down-regulated DEGs, cell death/apoptosis induction resulted from up-regulated DEGs, whilst DNA metabolic and immunity suppression resulted from down-regulated DEGs. In summary, our data provides evidence that deoxygenation greatly affects abalone immunity, probably making it more vulnerable.

To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA.

Metabolic processes in the liver were positively associated with body length, generally consistent with enhanced feeding opportunities. However, a notable exception to this metabolic pattern was for spring post-smolts sampled soon after entry into the ocean, which showed a pattern of gene expression more likely associated with depressed feeding or recent fasting. Overall, this study has revealed life stages that may be the most critical developmentally (fall post-smolt) and for survival (spring post-smolt) in the early marine environment. These life stages may warrant further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Some ectotherms can survive internal ice formation. In temperate regions, freeze tolerance is often induced by decreasing temperature and/or photoperiod during autumn. However, we have limited understanding of how seasonal changes in physiology contribute to freeze tolerance, and how these changes are regulated. During a six week autumn-like acclimation, late-instar juveniles of the spring field cricket Gryllus veletis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae) become freeze tolerant, which is correlated with accumulation of low molecular weight cryoprotectants, elevation of the temperature at which freezing begins, and metabolic rate suppression. We used RNA-Seq to assemble a de novo transcriptome of this emerging laboratory model for freeze tolerance research. We then focused on gene expression during acclimation in fat body tissue due to its role in cryoprotectant production and regulation of energetics. Acclimated G. veletis differentially expressed >3000 transcripts in fat body. This differential expression may contribute to metabolic suppression in acclimated G. veletis, but we did not detect changes in expression that would support cryoprotectant accumulation or enhanced control of ice formation, suggesting that these latter processes are regulated post-transcriptionally. Acclimated G. veletis differentially regulated transcripts that likely coordinate additional freeze tolerance mechanisms, including upregulation of enzymes that may promote membrane and cytoskeletal remodelling, cryoprotectant transporters, cytoprotective proteins, and antioxidants. Thus, while accumulation of cryoprotectants and controlling ice formation are commonly associated with insect freeze tolerance, our results support the hypothesis that many other systems contribute to surviving internal ice formation. Together, this information suggests new avenues for understanding the mechanisms underlying insect freeze tolerance.",

During the low tide period, M. varia individuals, located highest on the shore, may experience short time of aerial exposure and face a low availability of oxygen. Here we report a comparative metabolomic profiling of gill samples of M. varia obtained by both LC-QToF and APGC-QToF mass spectrometry, to analyze metabolic changes occurring during emersion in comparison with immersion. Scallops were grown in aquaria with a simulated intertidal environment mimicking short-duration air exposure that they might experience during extreme tides: alternating 2\u202fh emersion and 10\u202fh immersion. Our results show a switch from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism after only 2\u202fh of emersion, with the resort to different pathways: glucose-lactate, glucose-succinate and aspartate-succinate pathways. Furthermore, carnitine-conjugated metabolites were found to accumulate during emersion, as well as urate. The level of tyrosine on the contrary was found to decrease. These findings indicate a complex metabolic reprogramming that occurs after a two hour emersion period and upon re-immersion. Furthermore, M. varia is used as sentinel species in pollution biomonitoring, through the assay of biomarkers to evaluate the effects of pollutants. Here we show that emersion induces a significant decrease of superoxide dismutase activity, an enzyme developed by bivalves to face oxidative stress and used as biomarker. These findings have to be taken into account to normalize sampling during campaigns of environmental monitoring, by taking in situ, as far as possible only immersed individuals.",

A luciferase-like enzyme that displays weak luminescence activity in the presence of firefly D-luciferin and ATP was cloned from the tubules of Z. morio larvae. In order to better understand the molecular physiology of Malpighian tubules and fat body in Coleoptera larvae, and to investigate the occurrence and functions of AMP-CoA ligases in these tissues, we performed a comparative transcriptional analysis of these tissues using Z. morio giant-mealworms. As expected, the tubules displayed organic and inorganic transporters, xenobiotic metabolism enzymes, V-ATPases, channels, and pumps. The fat body showed proteins that are synthesized in this tissue and secreted to the hemolymph, as well as enzymes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. These tissues are also involved in common pathways, such as nitrogen metabolism to degradation/excretion, eye pigments biosynthesis, immunity, and detoxification. The presence of coumarate-CoA ligase-like enzymes in these tissues suggest their involvement in the degradation of coumaric acid derivatives obtained from the diet, or alternatively, in the biosynthesis of compounds structurally related to coumaric acids such as eye pigments.

Here, we report the first comprehensive transcript dataset of T. pyramis mantle tissue. From a total of 16,801,141 reads, 173,671 unique transcripts were assembled, which provides new genomic resources for the understanding of biomineralization in T. pyramis. The most abundant unique sequences of the top 30 most highly expressed genes were annotated as shematrin, while other highly expressed genes included glycine-rich protein and shematrin-1. Based on transcriptome annotation and Gene Ontology classification, 130 biomineralization-related genes were found including members of the BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins), calmodulin, perlucin, and shematrin families, as well as mantle genes, nacrein, and MSI60.

We characterized the microflora in nine samples by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. To assess the species diversity within the samples, effective tags were clustered at 97% similarity by default. Mycoplasma was the most abundant genus among the three groups, and the Proteobacteria phylum had the highest diversity. However, the microflora structure in the digestive tract was significantly different at different temperatures. The top five most abundant genera in the samples housed at 16\u202f\u00b0C were Mycoplasma, Phyllobacterium, Aliivibrio, Psychromonas, and Delftia, whereas those in the samples housed under 22\u202f\u00b0C were Mycoplasma, Phyllobacterium, Delftia, Spirochaeta_2, and Sphingomonas, and those in the samples housed at 28\u202f\u00b0C were Mycoplasma, Phyllobacterium, Vibrio, Delftia, and Aliivibrio.

Transcriptional studies on responses to heat stress have been conducted in catfish, one of the most important economic aquaculture species around the world. The molecular mechanisms underlying heat tolerance is still poorly understood, especially at the post-transcriptional level including regulation of alternative splicing. In this study, existing RNA-Seq datasets were utilized to characterize the change of alternative splicing in catfish following heat treatment. Heat-tolerant and -intolerant catfish were differentiated by the time to lost equilibrium after heat stress. With heat stress, alternative splicing was generally increased. In heat-intolerant fish, the thermal stress induced 29.2% increases in alternative splicing events and 25.8% increases in alternatively spliced genes. A total of 282, 189, and 44 differential alternative splicing (DAS) events were identified in control-intolerant, control-tolerant, and intolerant-tolerant comparisons, corresponding to 252, 171, and 42 genes, respectively. Gene ontology analyses showed that genes involved in the molecular function of RNA binding were significantly enriched in DAS gene sets after heat stress in both heat-intolerant and -tolerant catfish compared with the control group. Similar results were also observed in the DAS genes between heat-intolerant and -tolerant catfish, and the biological process of RNA splicing was also enriched in this comparison, indicating the involvement of RNA splicing-related genes underlying heat tolerance. This is the first comprehensive study of alternative splicing in response to heat stress in fish species, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of responses to the abiotic stress.",

In this study, changes in protein abundance in the YO were characterized over the course of a molt cycle induced by multiple leg autotomy in the blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis. In all, 457 distinct protein spots were detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, of which 230 (50%) changed significantly in abundance over the course of the molt cycle. Protein abundance differed most notably between intermolt and the three premolt stages, indicative of a biological \u2018on-off\u2019 switch. Changes in hemolymph proteins were correlated with stage-specific processes of sclerotization and melanization that facilitate cuticle hardening and support immune reactions. An abundance of cytoskeletal proteins were identified, which corresponded with glandular hypertrophy associated with synthesis and secretion of ecdysteroids. Many proteins involved in energetic pathways including glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, amino acid metabolism, and one\u2011carbon metabolism changed in abundance in response to increasing energy demands and the requirement for precursors of macromolecular synthesis. Several proteins involved in immune, proteostasis, and oxidative stress responses were correlated with the dynamic and demanding cellular changes associated with ecdysteroidogenesis. These changes in diverse physiological pathways represent the complexity involved with molecular regulation of the YO in decapod crustaceans.",

NHEs harbored a high proportion of \u03b1-helices (54.7% to 67.0%) and a low proportion of \u03b2-sheets (1.3%) and contained 9\u201313 transmembrane helices (TM). Results of tissue distribution detection revealed that L. maculatus NHE genes exhibited different expression profiles in a tissue-specific manner under normal physiological conditions. In the main osmoregulatory organ, gill, NHE2c and NHE3 showed significant higher expression comparing with other L. maculatus NHE genes. To gain insight into the potential function of L. maculatus NHE genes in response to salinity changes, we evaluated their expression variation after different salinity treatment (0\u202fppt, 12\u202fppt, 30\u202fppt, 45\u202fppt). During acute salinity stress experiment, L. maculatus NHE genes were regulated in a gene-specific and time-dependent manner. Most NHE genes were upregulated to different extent by low salinity (0\u202fppt) and exhibited the highest expression value in gills at 6\u202fh, while NHE2c and NHE3 were the most strongly induced genes, suggesting they may play crucial roles in salinity and osmotic regulation. In addition, the expressions of several NHE genes were regulated by isotonic or high salinity treatments, indicating their potential involvements in response to salinity challenge. Our findings in this study provide a foundation for future studies about NHE gene deciphering stress physiology correlated to salinity and osmotic regulation in teleosts.",

     "abstract": "In arthropods, the large majority of studies on olfaction have been mainly focused on insects, whereas little on Arachnida, even though olfaction is very important in arachnid behavior. Pardosa pseudoannulata is one of the most common wandering spiders in rice fields, as the important natural enemy against a range of pests. However, little is known about the potential chemosensory proteins involved in olfactory behavior of these spiders. Niemann-Pick proteins type C2 (NPC2) as a new class of binding and transport proteins for semiochemicals in arthropods especially ticks and mites has received more attention in recent years. In this study, six NPC2s namely PpseNPC1-6 were newly identified in the appendages of P. pseudoannulata based on transcriptome data. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that all of P. pseudoannulata NPC2s were clustered together forming one clade with high posterior probability values. In addition, the sequences shared the same subclade with the NPC2 sequences of ticks and scorpion. The motif-patterns indicated that PpseNPC2-5 had the common pattern with the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae and the ant Trachymyrmex cornetzi. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) measurements were conducted to evaluate the expression profile of these genes in various tissues of P. pseudoannulata. It was found that most NPC2s (PpseNPC2-1, PpseNPC2-2, PpseNPC2-5 and PpseNPC2-6) were highly expressed in adult pedipalps and chelicerae. Owing to the functional olfactory organs in Chelicerata of pedipalps, our results supported a putative role of NPC2s as new odorant carriers in P. pseudoannulata.",

     "abstract": "Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily from anthropogenic emissions, are resulting in increasing absorption of CO2 by the oceans, leading to a decline in oceanic pH in a process known as ocean acidification (OA). There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential effect of OA on the energetics/physiology and consequently life-history traits of commensally important marine organisms. However, despite this little is known of how fundamental metabolic pathways that underpin changes in organismal physiology are affected by OA. Consequently, a gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) based metabolic profiling approach was applied to examine the metabolic responses of Crassostrea gigas to elevated pCO2 levels, under otherwise natural field conditions. Oysters were exposed natural environmental pCO2 (~625.40\u202f\u03bcatm) and elevated pCO2 (~1432.94\u202f\u03bcatm) levels for 30\u202fdays. Results indicated that 36 differential metabolites were identified. Differential metabolites were mapped in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to search for the related metabolic pathways. Pathway enrichment analysis indicates that alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were the most statistically enriched pathways. Further analysis suggested that elevated pCO2 disturb the TCA cycle via succinate accumulation and C. gigas most likely adjust their energy metabolic via alanine and GABA accumulation accordingly to cope with elevated pCO2. These findings provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in modulating C. gigas metabolism under elevated pCO2.",

     "abstract": "The citrus leaf-mining beetle, Podagricomela weisei Heikertinger, is an important citrus pest that ingests the mesophyll and new shoots. The mechanism underlying the xenobiotic metabolism of P. weisei is not well understood, in part because of a lack of available genomic and transcriptomic data, which has hampered the development of novel pest management approaches [e.g., RNA interference (RNAi)]. In this study, we completed the deep sequencing of the P. weisei transcriptome to identify factors potentially involved in xenobiotic metabolism and the core RNAi machinery. The sequencing of the P. weisei transcriptome generated >27\u202fmillion\u202fclean\u202freads, ultimately yielding 90,410 unigenes with an N50 of 1065\u202fbp. The unigenes were used as queries to search the Nr database, which revealed that 21,847 unigenes were homologous to known genes in various species. Transcripts encoding genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism were identified, including genes encoding cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450, 47 unigenes), glutathione S-transferase (GST, 12 unigenes), esterase (EST, 25 unigenes), and the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC transporter, 32 unigenes). A parallel sequencing of small RNAs detected 30 conserved miRNAs, with the most abundant being Pwe-miR-1-3p, with an expression level reaching 517,996\u202freads in the prepared library, followed by Pwe-miR-8-3p (149,402\u202freads). Genes encoding components of the miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA pathways were also identified, and the results indicated that P. weisei possesses only one of each gene in all three pathways. In summary, this is the first detailed analysis of the transcriptome and small RNAs of P. weisei. The datasets presented herein may form the basis for future molecular characterizations of P. weisei as well as the development of enhanced pest control strategies.",

We used iTRAQ to conduct proteomic analysis of adult G. daurica at the pre-diapause (PD), diapause (D) and post-diapause (TD) stages during summer diapause. A total of 139 and 118 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected in D/PD and TD/D comparisons, respectively. Besides a large number of DEPs involved in metabolic process, stress response, cytoskeletal reorganization, and phagosome pathway, many new proteins related to diapause were found in this study, such as encapsulation-relating proteins, odorant binding proteins, chemosensory proteins and ribosomal proteins. KEGG analysis revealed that the phagosome pathway was the only common significantly enriched pathway in both D/PD and TD/D. In addition, juvenile hormone regulation and Ca2+ signaling may play an important role in the regulation of summer diapause in G. daurica. Our proteomic analysis provides a new insight into the mechanism of obligatory summer diapause, and lays a foundation for future molecular level studies.",

These responses are complex and systemic, and the molecular mechanisms involved remain undetermined. One of the most sensitive organs to environmental and homeostatic disruptions is the intestine, and since it plays several vital functions, understanding the molecular underpinnings of this organ under deleterious conditions is imperative for health improvement in aquaculture systems. This study aimed to understand how different stocking densities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) modulates the coding and non-coding RNAs profiling, that in turn, play key roles to maintain the fish homeostasis. For this, the intestine tissue of juvenile trout stocked for 30\u202fdays either at low (LD: 3\u202fkg\u202fm\u22123) or high density (HD: 40\u202fkg\u202fm\u22123) were sampled to isolate total RNA and then construct cDNA libraries for an illumina sequencing platform. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a generalized downregulation of transcripts, including coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Notably, significant differences in transcripts involved in metabolic pathways, as well as immune and epithelium integrity and stability related pathways were found. A high number of downregulated transcripts enriched these pathways, and a strong correlation was observed between the most differentially expressed transcripts and the highly expressed lncRNAs. This study suggests a cross-talk between coding and non-coding RNAs in the intestine of fish exposed to suboptimal conditions, providing new insights into the regulatory role of the lncRNAs on fish response to stressors.",

Short-term or long-term starvation events occur frequently owing to natural environment changes or manual management strategies in the life cycle of crustaceans. The result induced by starvation is that somatic growth of crustaceans will be retarded, while the immune mechanism is activated in this process. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the immune regulatory pathways are involved in the growth of crustaceans. Twelve muscle tissue transcriptomes of the oriental river prawn Macrobrachium nipponense were sequenced across four fasting stages lasting 0, 7, 14 and 21\u202fd. The results showed that three immune-related pathways were involved in the growth of M. nipponense by regulating actin expression inducing the chemokine signaling pathway, the leukocyte transendothelial migration pathway and the FcR-mediated phagocytosis pathway. Furthermore, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to further verify the effects that genes involved in the pathways had on regulating growth of M. nipponense. Comparative transcriptional analysis and RNA interference reveal that VASP and WAVE positively regulated the expression of actin; however, WASP negatively regulated the expression of actin. This is the first report that the immune regulatory pathways play key roles in the growth of crustaceans. Our results will not only provide an entirely new understanding of the immune mechanism of crustaceans from a unique angle but also further enrich and develop the theory of growth and developmental biology in crustaceans.",

To evaluate the potential negative effects of long-term and continuous dietary exposure to chlorpyrifos\u2011methyl in fish, we fed juvenile Atlantic salmon three concentrations (0.1, 1.0 and 8.0\u202fmg/kg) of the pesticide for about two months. Brain and liver tissues were collected after 30 and 67\u202fdays of exposure. Homogenized brain tissue was examined for effects on acetylcholinesterase, and brain and liver tissue from fish exposed to 8.0\u202fmg/kg were used for transcriptional analysis (RNA-seq). The results showed a transient accumulation of chlorpyrifos\u2011methyl in the brain with lower levels after 67\u202fdays of exposure compared to after 30\u202fdays of exposure. In contrast, the liver showed a time-dependent accumulation pattern. No effect on acetylcholinesterase activity, the primary target of chlorpyrifos\u2011methyl, was seen in the brain. However, after 30\u202fdays of exposure, 98 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found in brain tissue and 239 DEGs in liver tissue. After 67\u202fdays of exposure, two and 258 DEGs were found in brain and liver tissue, respectively. Continuous dietary exposure of chlorpyrifos\u2011methyl most profoundly affected mechanisms associated with protein degradation and lipid metabolism in both brain and liver. Specific for the brain, many of the significant DEGs encode proteins involved in neuron function.

To discover the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of the nervous system of female precocious crabs, eyestalk, brain, and thoracic ganglion transcriptome data were obtained in normal and precocious crabs via high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 81, 4276, and 22,684 differentially-expressed genes were obtained from the eyestalk, brain, and thoracic ganglion groups, respectively. Functional analysis showed that these genes were significantly enriched in the categories of nutrition metabolism, immunity, endocrine regulation, and circadian rhythm. In precocious eyestalk, the expression of vrille was up-regulated significantly and the ribosome endocrine function decreased, which may result in the decline of gonad-inhibiting hormone secretion. In precocious brains, the expression of period2 with the function of delaying clock phase was down-regulated significantly. In precocious thoracic ganglion, expression changes in circadian rhythm-related genes were very complex, and the precocity of female crabs may be the concrete reflex of integrated actions of many endocrine hormones such as estradiol, ecdysteroid, and juvenile hormone, among others. In addition, we found that the mRNA of vitellogenin was highly expressed in the thoracic ganglion. This study discovered some clock genes and related molecular regulatory mechanisms by the RNA-sequence, which would provide foundational information to further study precocity in female Chinese mitten crabs.",

Two experimental diets containing 10% LA-rich sunflower seed oil (diet LA) or 10% ALA-rich perilla oil (diet ALA) were used in the feeding trial. LA and ALA in diets were characteristically incorporated into fish tissues while no significant difference was observed in growth performance and body proximate composition between groups LA and ALA. Compared to LA, ALA up-regulated transcription of 49 unigenes and down-regulated those of 311 unigenes. Quantitative RT-PCR studies on eight lipid metabolism-related genes and seven randomly selected genes were conducted to validate the transcriptomic results. Lipid metabolism-related genes ApoA1, ApoA4, ApoE, FABP1, FABP3, FABP4, FATP6, and DGAT1, as well as ribosomal proteins L9e, L13e, and S4e, were transcriptionally down-regulated by ALA.

Investigations of the metabolic disruptions and biochemical responses associated with acute hypoxia stress in sea cucumbers can provide a theoretical basis and guidance for improving aquaculture. A metabolomics approach to characterize changes in the profiles of endogenous small molecules in response to acute hypoxia can help to identify the main underlying causes of metabolic damage and potentially suggest solutions to alleviate to improve viability. The current study uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and multivariate analysis methods to evaluate the metabolic profile of longitudinal muscles from A. japonicus exposed to acute hypoxia stress (by bubbling the aquaria water with nitrogen aeration to decrease dissolved oxygen to 2\u202fmg/L in 2\u202fmin) for 6 or 24\u202fh (experimental groups EG6 or EG24) and control group (CG, n\u202f=\u202f10, respectively). The results showed that 29 and 62 metabolites were influenced significantly in EG6 and EG24, respectively, mainly including lipids, glycosides and their derivatives. Levels of most lipids (fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sterols) were elevated in both experimental groups, and increased with elongation of hypoxia, implying that the homeostasis of synthesis and degradation of lipids and their derivatives was strongly affected by hypoxia stress. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed to further assess the importance of differential metabolite expression to the development of the A. japonicus response to hypoxia, showing that 4 (fatty acid biosynthesis, d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism) and 2 (steroid biosynthesis, longevity regulating pathway) pathways were markedly enriched in EG6 and EG24, respectively. These results suggested that fatty acid synthesis was strengthened significantly in both treatment groups, and the degree was higher in EG24 than in EG6, providing valuable information towards understanding the special adaptive mechanism of A. japonicus to hypoxia stress.",

By virtue of its functional diversity and importance, the Wnt gene family has received substantial research interests in a variety of animal species, from invertebrates to vertebrates. However, for bivalve molluscs, one of the ancient bilaterian groups with high morphological diversity, systematic identification and analysis of the Wnt gene family remain lacking. To shed some light on the evolutionary dynamics of this gene family and obtain a more comprehensive understanding, we analyzed the characteristics of the Wnt gene family in three bivalve molluscs, with both genome and extensive transcriptomic resources. Investigation of genomic signatures, functional domains as well as phylogenetic relationships was conducted, and 12, 11, 12 subfamilies were identified in Yesso scallop, Zhikong scallop and Pacific oyster respectively. Spatiotemporal expression profiling suggested that, some bivalve Wnts might coordinate and participate in adult organ/tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis as well as early embryonic development. The transcriptional regulation of oyster Wnt genes showed dynamic and responsive patterns under different environmental stresses, indicating that Wnts may play a role in coping with challenging intertidal environments in bivalves. To our best knowledge, this study presents the first genome-wide study of Wnt gene family in bivalves, and our findings would assist in better understanding of Wnt function and evolution in bivalve molluscs.",

Understanding the impact of thermal stress on physiological processes of fish is crucial for better cultivation and fisheries management. However, the metabolic mechanism of cold water fish to thermal stress is still not completely clear. In this study, a NMR-based metabonomic strategy in combination with high-throughput RNA-Seq was employed to investigate global metabolic changes of plasma and liver in a typical cold water fish species lenok (Brachymystax lenok) subjected to a sub-lethal high temperature. Our results showed that thermal stress caused multiple dynamic metabolic alterations of the lenok with prolonged stress, including repression of energy metabolism, shifts in lipid metabolism, alterations in amino acid metabolism, changes in choline and nucleotide metabolisms. Specifically, thermal stress induced an activation of glutamate metabolism, indicating that glutamate could be an important biomarker associated with thermal stress. Evidence from Hsp 70 gene expression, blood biochemistry and histology confirmed that high temperature exposure had negative effects on health of the lenok. These findings imply that thermal stress has a severe adverse effect on fish health and demonstrate that the integrated analyses combining NMR-based metabonomics and transcriptome strategy is a powerful approach to enhance our understanding of metabolic mechanisms of fish to thermal stress.",

Studies focused on the regulation of gonadal development and gametogenesis of spotted knifejaw are still insufficient. As a key post-transcriptional regulator, miRNAs have been shown to play important roles in development and reproduction systems. In this study, small RNA deep sequencing in ovary and testis of spotted knifejaw were performed to screen miRNA expression patterns. After sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, a total of 247 conserved known miRNAs and 41 novel miRNAs were identified in spotted knifejaw gonads for the first time. In addition, 36 miRNAs were differentially expressed between testis and ovary. The putative target genes of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were significantly enriched in several pathways related to sexual differentiation and gonadal development, such as steroid hormone biosynthesis. Sequencing data was validated through qRT-PCR analysis of selected DE miRNAs. Dual-luciferase reporter analyses of filtered miRNA-target gene pairs confirmed that opu-miR-27b-3p targeted in piwi2 and mov10l1 3\u2032 UTRs and down-regulated their expressions in spotted knifejaw. The notion that mov10l1 and piwi2 enhance germ cells proliferation and regulate gonadal development and gametogenesis suggests that opu-miR-27b-3p may attenuated this process in the gonads of spotted knifejaw. These findings provided insights into regulatory roles of gonadal miRNAs and supplied fundamental resources for further studies on miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation in reproductive system of spotted knifejaw.",

Sertoli-Sertoli and Sertoli-spermatogenic junctions are important for the maturity and release of sperms. These junctions, which are related to male infertility, have been reported in mammals but are unclear in teleost species. In this study, the RNAs in the gonads of 1.5-year-old Japanese flounders were sequenced using Illumina. The miRNA expression profiles in the mature gonads of males and females were characterized. A total of 277 mature miRNAs were screened in both gonads. Among them, 25 miRNAs were expressed differently in the ovary and testis. Afterward, miR-1388 was selected for its high expression level in the ovary. Gene ontology analysis revealed that the target genes of miR-1388 were highly involved in cell-cell adhesion. Nectin2l, the target of miR-1388, is a Ca-independent cell adhesion molecule that was demonstrated to be testis-biased via quantitative real-time PCR and located in Sertoli cells and spermatocytes via in situ hybridization. Our present study predicted the potential functions of sex-biased miRNA and indicated that miR-1388 regulates cell junctions by inhibiting nectin2l, which may have an important role in the later development of testes.

Complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), the first and largest enzyme complex of the OXPHOS system, includes both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded proteins. However, the patterns of natural selection and phylogenetic implications of complex I in birds still remain unclear. In this study, we combined transcriptomic and phylogenetic analyses to comprehensively determine the evolution of avian complex I. The transcriptomes of three Passerida species (Leiothrix lutea, Spodiopsar sericeus, and Passer montanus) were obtained using the Illumina HiSeq\u2122 2500 system. More than 192,000,000 clean reads were assembled in a total of 828,267 transcripts. Evolutionary selection analysis suggested that six genes of the core subunits in avian complex I may have undergone putative positive selection. Notably, we found that the mean dN/dS (\u03c9) ratio for mitochondrial genes of core subunits was significantly lower than that for nuclear genes of non-core subunits within complex I. The constructed maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, and Bayesian inference phylogenetic trees were based on 44 complex I genes. We verified that the family Paridae (represented by Parus major and Pseudopodoces humilis) was clustered with Musicicapoidea.

     "abstract": "A transcriptome of the Gecarcinus lateralis molting gland (Y-organ or YO) contained 48,590 contiguous sequences (contigs) from intermolt (IM), early premolt (EP), mid premolt (MP), late premolt (LP), and postmolt (PM) stages. The YO is kept in the basal state in IM by molt-inhibiting hormone (MIH)/cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling. YO activation in EP requires down-regulation of MIH signaling and activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent protein synthesis. Transition of the YO to the committed state in MP requires activin/transforming growth factor-beta (TGF\u03b2) signaling. YO repression occurs at the end of LP. A total of 28,179 contigs (58%) showed molt stage-specific changes in gene expression. The largest number of differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were at the IM/EP (16,142 contigs), LP/PM (18,161 contigs), and PM/IM (8290 contigs) transitions. By contrast, the numbers of DEGs were 372 and 1502 contigs for the EP/MP and MP/LP transitions, respectively. DEG analysis of 23 signal transduction pathways showed significant changes in MIH, mTOR, activin/TGF\u03b2, Notch, MAP kinase, and Wnt signaling. Down-regulation of MIH signaling genes in premolt is consistent with reduced MIH sensitivity in MP and LP. Up-regulation of mTOR signaling genes in IM and premolt stages is consistent with its role in YO activation and sustained ecdysteroidogenesis. Up-regulation of activin/TGF\u03b2 signaling genes in EP and MP is consistent with the role of a myostatin/activin-like factor in YO commitment. Notch, MAP kinase, and Wnt DEG analysis may indicate possible crosstalk with the MIH, mTOR, and activin/TGF\u03b2 pathways to integrate other inputs to control YO ecdysteroidogenesis.",

Holotrichia parallela is a worldwide pest on many crops and particularly on peanuts in China. In the present study, we produced Illumina-based transcriptomes from male and female antennae and ultimately identified 47 candidate ORs, 15 GRs and 27 IRs. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the relatedness with other species and possible functions of chemosensory genes were predicted and analyzed, such as the putative OR co-receptor (HparOR40), IR co-receptors (HparIR1 and HparIR27), carbon dioxide receptors (HparGR5 and HparGR14) and sugar receptors (HparGR8, HparGR11 and HparGR13). The differences in expression between genes and between sexes were analyzed using FPKM values and visualized in heat maps. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR results of 26 candidate genes were assessed to validate the differential expression analyses between sexes and between olfactory and non-olfactory tissues. Thirteen genes were more highly expressed in female than in male antennae, whereas four genes had higher expression in male than in female antennae. Twelve genes were predominantly expressed in the antennae as olfactory organs compared with expression in non-olfactory tissues. Our study was the first to annotate the chemosensory receptors of H. parallela, and it will provide a strong foundation for future work on physiology and ecology at the molecular level.",

Here, the transcriptional response of the yellow drum to cold stress (7.5\u202f\u00b0C) was investigated with RNA-Seq analysis. We compared brain and muscle transcriptomes among cold-tolerant (Tol) fish that survived the cold treatment, cold-sensitive (Sen) fish that were killed by the cold treatment, and control (Con) fish that were not subjected to cold. Our analysis recovered 233,245 unigenes.

These pathways were all associated with biological functions relevant to cold adaptation in the yellow drum, including transduction of stress signals, energy metabolism, and stress-induced cell membrane changes.

Here, we performed RNA-sequencing and subsequent confirmation with quantitative-PCR in the telencephalon, optic tectum, and hindbrain of the cichlid and identified five genes (pkd1b, ntn1b, ansn, pde6g, and rbp4l1) that were differentially expressed between the hemispheres regardless of the laterality.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was used to characterize the larvae proteome profile. From 380 protein spots analyzed, 174 were identified by LC-MS/MS and homology search against the Hymenoptera subset of the NCBInr protein database using the Mascot search engine. Peptide de novo sequencing and homology-based alignment allowed the identification of 36 additional protein spots. Identified proteins were classified by cellular location, molecular function, and biological process according to the Gene Ontology annotation. Immunity- and defense-related proteins were identified including PPIases, FK506, PEBP, and chitinases. Several hexamerin proteoforms were identified and the cDNA of the most abundant protein detected in the 2-DE map was isolated and characterized. L. apiculatum hexamerin (LaHEX, GeneBank accession no.

We found that the OBPs were separated into two groups, Classic OBPs and Plus-C OBPs, according to their motifs. Based on sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, we found five Orcos in OR family. However, no pheromone receptor was identified, which may be related to that cicadas are sound-producing insects and acoustic signals other than pheromones play most important role in sexual communication.

Most Ea-CYP genes were significantly down- and/or up-regulated (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in response to B[\u03b1]P, suggesting that Ea-CYP genes are likely involved in detoxification (mainly in biotransformation of xenobiotics) with particular genes, demonstrating significant upregulation or downregulation compared to others, as shown in other copepod model species (e.g. Tigriopus japonicus and Paracyclopina nana). This study will provide insight into the potential role of E. affinis in response to various toxic or xenobiotic chemicals in the marine environment.",

     "abstract": "Pigmentation processes provide a traceable and relevant trait for understanding key issues in evolutionary biology such as adaptation, speciation and the maintenance of balanced polymorphisms. The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus, which has nutritive and medical properties, is considered the most valuable commercial species in many parts of Asia. Compared with the green morph, the purple morph is rare and has great appeal to consumers. However, little is currently known about the molecular mechanism of body color formation in A. japonicus, even in echinoderm. Here, we employ illumina sequencing to examine expression patterns of the gene network underlying body wall development in purple and green morphs of A. japonicus. Overall, the number of down-regulated genes in the green morph was significantly more than in the purple morph during the pigmentation stage. We observed dynamic expression patterns of a large number of pigment, regulation and growth genes from the \u201cMelanogenesis\u201d, \u201cMelanoma\u201d, \u201cWnt signaling pathway\u201d, \u201cNotch signaling pathway\u201d, \u201cepithelium development\u201d, \u201cepidermal growth factor receptor binding\u201d,\u201cgrowth factor activity\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d, including contrasting expression patterns of these genes in green and purple morph. This study provides comprehensive lists of differentially expressed genes during body wall development in the green and purple morphs, revealing potential candidate genes that may be involved in regulating body color formation and polymorphism. These data will provide valuable information for future genetic studies on sea cucumbers elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying pigmentation, and may support the culture of desirable color morphs.",

To perform a systematic study of HSP70/110s in sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus, 15 HSP70/110 genes, including 13 HSP70s and two HSP110s, were identified and characterized from the transcriptome and genome of sea cucumber. Moderate expansion and conserved structure were found by the phylogenetic and syntenic analysis. Differential expression patterns of HSP70/110s were observed in adult individuals during aestivation, with the comparison of juvenile individuals without aestivation in chronic heat stress. Tissue-specific expression profiles were found both in adult and juvenile individuals, which might indicate that the functional tissues (intestine and respiratory tree) could be restored to normal physiological activity prior to protecting and sporting tissues (body wall and muscle). Differential expression profiles were also observed between the adult and juvenile individuals, which was mainly due to the hypometabolism in aestivation. Taken together, tissue-specific pattern and individual-specific pattern were observed in the HSP70/110 expression profiles in sea cucumber during aestivation.

Among the four rotifers, B. rotundiformis was found with the least number of GST genes (total 19 GST genes), whereas the other three species shared 23 to 24 GST genes. Among the identified GST genes, belonging to the cytosolic GST superfamily, the expansion of GST sigma classes mainly occurs through tandem duplication, resulting in tandem-arrayed gene clusters on the chromosomes. Overall, the number of genes discovered in this study was highest in the sigma class, zeta, alpha, and omega in descending order. With integration of phylogenetic analysis and xenobiotic-mediated GST mRNA expression patterns along with previous enzymatic activities, the functional divergence among species-specific GST genes was clearly observed.

A total of 18, 43, and 66 DEMs were obtained from skin tissues covered with initial, developing, and mature scales (IS, DS, and MS) compared with scale-uncovered skin. The target genes of these DEMs were significantly enriched in a sole biomineralization-related sphingolipid signaling pathway. Seven DEMs (dre-miR-124-3p, dre-miR-133a-2-5p, dre-miR-184, dre-miR-206-3p, novel_33, novel_56 and novel_75) were common in IS, DS, and MS. Dre-miR-124-3p, dre-miR-206-3p, and novel_33 were predicted to be able to target biomineralization-related genes. Stem-loop real-time quantitative PCR further confirmed that the common DEMs had higher expression levels in scale-covered skin tissues than that in the gill, intestine, and brain, except for dre-miR-133a-2-5p.

GmAFPIV includes 689 bases with a complete open reading frame encoding 125 amino acids. Sequence alignment of GmAFPIV showed 30% to 50% similarity with that of other species except Gadus sp. Expression levels of GmAFPIV were found in a decreasing manner in liver, intestine, gill, brain and gonad. Heterologously expression of the GmAFPIV protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to immunize New Zealand rabbits.

Currently, monitoring and control methods of L. botrana are based on its main sex pheromone component, being effective for low population densities. In order to improve control methods, antennal olfactory proteins in moths, such as odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and odorant receptors (ORs) have been studied as promising targets for the discovery of new potent semiochemicals, which have not been reported for L. botrana. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the repertoire of proteins related to chemoreception in L. botrana by antennal transcriptome and analyze the relative expression of OBPs and CSPs in male and female antennae. Through next-generation sequencing of the antennal transcriptome by Ilumina HiSeq2500 we identified a total of 118 chemoreceptors, from which 61, 42 and 15 transcripts are related to ORs, ionotropic receptors (IRs) and gustatory receptors (GRs), respectively. Furthermore, RNA-Seq data revealed 35 transcripts for OBPs and 18 for chemosensory proteins (CSPs). Analysis by qRT-PCR showed 20 OBPs significantly expressed in female antennae, while 5 were more expressed in males. Similarly, most of the CSPs were significantly expressed in female than male antennae. All the olfactory-related sequences were compared with homologs and their phylogenetic relationships elucidated. Finally, our findings in relation to the improvement of L. botrana management are discussed.",

Channel catfish is a dominant aquaculture species in the United States. As channel catfish can hear sounds of relatively high frequency, it serves as a good model for study auditory mechanisms. In catfishes, Weberian ossicles connect the swimbladder to the inner ear to transfer the forced vibrations and improve hearing ability. In this study, we examined the transcriptional profiles of channel catfish swimbladder and other four tissues (gill, liver, skin, and intestine). We identified a total of 1777 genes that exhibited preferential expression pattern in swimbladder of channel catfish. Based on Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, many of swimbladder-enriched genes were categorized into sensory perception of sound, auditory behavior, response to auditory stimulus, or detection of mechanical stimulus involved in sensory perception of sound, such as coch, kcnq4, sptbn1, sptbn4, dnm1, ush2a, and col11a1. Six signaling pathways associated with hearing (Glutamatergic synapse, GABAergic synapse pathways, Axon guidance, cAMP signaling pathway, Ionotropic glutamate receptor pathway, and Metabotropic glutamate receptor group III pathway) were over-represented in KEGG and PANTHER databases. Protein interaction prediction revealed an interactive relationship among the swimbladder-enriched genes and genes involved in sensory perception of sound. This study identified a set of genes and signaling pathways associated with auditory system in the swimbladder of channel catfish and provide resources for further study on the biological and physiological roles in catfish swimbladder.",

The functions of these two cell types have been well characterized in cattle, but they remain unclear in chickens. To clarify this issue, a comparison of small yellow follicles (SYFs) in chickens and cattle at different follicular development stages was done by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The modules obtained from WGCNA were used for further identification of the key genes associated with CYP19A1 expression. Module preservation analysis showed high similarity between cow_D (the follicular phase before the LH surge) and chicken_SYF (small yellow follicle between 6 and 8\u202fmm in diameter) datasets, and 10 top hub genes highly associated with CYP19A1 expression in chicken SYFs were identified in each module. A comparison of the transcriptomes of theca and granulosa cells (TCs and GCs) between chicken SYFs and cattle follicles at the differentiation stage, as well as the aforementioned hub genes, revealed that ESR2 is a potential regulator of CYP19A1 expression in the theca cells of chicken SYFs.

     "abstract": "Allospecific mtDNA can occasionally be beneficial for the fitness of populations. It is, however, difficult to assess the effect of mtDNA in natural conditions due to genetic and/or environmental interactions. In the fish Chrosomus eos, the transfer of C. neogaeus mitochondria occurs in a single generation and results in natural cybrids. For a few lakes in Quebec, C. eos can harbor either a C. eos mtDNA (wild types) or a C. neogaeus mtDNA (cybrids). Moreover, mtDNA of cybrids originated either from Mississippian or Atlantic glacial refuges. Such diversity provides a useful system for in situ assessment of allospecific mtDNA effects. We determined genetic, epigenetic and transcriptomic variation as well as mitochondrial enzymatic activity (complex IV) changes among wild types and cybrids either in sympatry or allopatry. Wild types and cybrids did not segregate spatially within a lake. Moreover, no significant genetic differentiation was detected among wild types and cybrids indicating sustained gene flow. Mitochondrial complex IV activity was higher for cybrids in both sympatry and allopatry while no difference was detected among cybrid haplotypes. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analyses revealed only subtle differences between sympatric wild types and cybrids compared to differences between sites. Altogether, these results indicate a limited influence of allospecific mtDNA in nuclear gene expression when controlling for genetic and environmental effects. The absence of a reproductive barrier between wild types and cybrids results in random association of either C. eos or C. neogaeus mtDNA with C. eos nDNA at each generation, and prevents mitonuclear co-adaptation in sympatry.",

Our results highlight the complexity of limb regeneration and its regulation through cooperation of various biological processes including cytoskeletal changes, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling and ECM-receptor interactions, protein synthesis, signal recognition and transduction, energy production and conversion, and substance transport and metabolism. Additionally, real-time PCR confirmed that mRNA levels of differentially expressed genes were correlated with protein levels. Our results provide a basis for studying the regulatory mechanisms associated with crab limb regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Previous hibernation studies demonstrated that such a natural model of skeletal muscle disuse causes limited muscle atrophy and a significant fast-to-slow fiber type shift. However, the underlying mechanism as defined in a large-scale analysis remains unclarified. Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) based quantitative analysis were used to examine proteomic changes in the fast extensor digitorum longus muscles (EDL) of Daurian ground squirrels (Spermophilus dauricus). Although the wet weights and fiber cross-sectional area of the EDL muscle showed no significant decrease, the percentage of slow type fiber was 61% greater (P\u202f<\u202f0.01) in the hibernation group. Proteomics analysis identified 264 proteins that were significantly changed (ratio\u202f<\u202f0.83 or >1.2-fold and P\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the hibernation group, of which 23 proteins were categorized into energy production and conversion and translation and 22 proteins were categorized into ribosomal structure and biogenesis. Along with the validation by western blot, MAPKAP kinase 2, ATP5D, ACADSB, calcineurin, CSTB and EIF2S were up-regulated in the hibernation group, whereas PDK4, COX II and EIF3C were down-regulated in the hibernation group. MAPKAP kinase 2 and PDK4 were associated with glycolysis, COX II and ATP5D were associated with oxidative phosphorylation, ACADSB was associated with fatty acid metabolism, calcineurin and CSTB were associated with catabolism, and EIF2S and EIF3C were associated with anabolism. Moreover, the total proteolysis rate of EDL in the hibernation group was significantly inhibited compared with that in the pre-hibernation group. These distinct energy and protein metabolism characteristics may be involved in myofiber type conversion and resistance to atrophy in the EDL of hibernating Daurian ground squirrels.",

     "abstract": "The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamarck 1819) is a popular shellfish commonly included in human diet and is routinely used as bioindicator in environmental monitoring programmes worldwide. Recently, metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool both in food research and ecotoxicology for monitoring mussels' freshness and assessing the effects of environmental changes. However, there is still a paucity of data on complete metabolic baseline of mussel tissues. To mitigate this knowledge gap, similarities and differences in metabolite profile of digestive gland (DG), gills (G), and posterior adductor muscle (PAM) of aquaculture-farmed M. galloprovincialis were herein investigated by a proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR)-based metabolomic approach and discussed considering their physiological role. A total of 44 metabolites were identified in mussel tissues and grouped in amino acids, energy metabolites, osmolytes, neurotransmitters, nucleotides, alkaloids, and miscellaneous metabolites. A PCA showed that mussel tissues clustered separately from each other, suggesting a clear differentiation in their metabolic profiles. A Venn diagram revealed that mussel DG, G and PAM shared 27 (61.36%) common metabolites, though with different concentrations. Osmolytes were found to dominate the metabolome of all tissues. The DG exhibited higher level of glutathione and carbohydrates. The G showed greater level of osmolytes and the exclusive presence of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine and serotonin. In PAM higher levels of energetics-related metabolites were found. Overall, findings from this study are helpful for a better understanding of mussel tissue-specific physiological functions as well as for future NMR-based metabolomic investigations of marine mussel health and safety.",

Reproduction, movement, and metabolism in cnidarians have all been shown to be regulated by diurnal lighting, but the molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for these phenotypes remain largely unknown. The starlet sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, has oscillating patterns of locomotion and respiration, as well as the molecular components of a putative circadian clock that may provide a mechanism for these light-induced responses. Here, we compare transcriptomic responses of N. vectensis when cultured under a diurnal lighting condition (12\u202fh light: 12\u202fh dark) with sea anemones cultured under constant darkness for 20\u202fdays. More than 3,000 genes (~13% of transcripts) had significant differences in expression between light and dark, with most genes having higher expression in the photoperiod. Following removal of the light cue 678 genes lost differential expression, suggesting that light-entrained gene expression by the circadian clock has temporal limits. Grouping of genes differentially expressed in light:dark conditions showed that cell cycle and transcription maintained diel expression in the absence of light, while many of the genes related to metabolism, antioxidants, immunity, and signal transduction lost differential expression without a light cue. Our data highlight the importance of diel light cycles on circadian mechanisms in this species, prompting new hypotheses for the role of photoreception in major biological processes, e.g., metabolism, immunity.",

In this study, we investigated the regulatory proteins and pathways affecting male sexual development of M. nipponense, by analyzing the proteomes of their androgenic glands during their reproductive and nonreproductive seasons using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). A total of 13 sex-related protein homologs out of 999 total proteins were identified in the proteome of M. nipponense based on comparisons with the published literature. A total of 32 proteins were differentially expressed in the androgenic gland between the reproductive and nonreproductive seasons of M. nipponense. However, only 10 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were annotated in the Nr, COG, GO, and KEGG databases. Other non-annotated DEPs may also play vital roles in the male sexual development of M. nipponense. The qPCR analysis indicated that the mRNA expression patterns of the 10 annotated DEPs were consistent with that determined by iTRAQ analysis. Additional qPCR analysis of the 10 DEPs in testes, ovaries, and androgenic glands showed that Gem, Ferritin, and Rev3 were highly expressed in the androgenic gland, implying importance in male sexual development, given the important role of the androgenic gland in male differentiation and development in many crustacean species.

Until recently, there is no safe and effective chemical method to control this pest due to the lack of sufficient knowledge on the molecular basis of its olfactory genes, moreover, the evolutionary history of the olfactory gene family in subfamily Lamiinae is still fully unknown. Our RNA sequencing of the antennae of S. populnea identified 43 odorant binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 56 odorant receptors (ORs) and 24 inotropic receptors (IRs) in S. populnea. The RT-PCR results showed several genes were expressed in a sex specific manner, suggesting that these genes might play key role in their olfactory-sensing and sex-related behaviors. Further evolutionary studies were performed on these olfactory genes, overall comparison of the Ka/Ks values of orthologous genes in S. populnea and two other Lamiinae species showed three main conclusions: 1. olfactory genes have evolved more rapidly than the non-olfactory genes in the tested long horn beetles; 2. the IR gene family are under a strong purifying selection; 3. the OBPs of Monochamus alternatus evolved more rapidly than the other two species, which is speculated to be correlated with differentiation of selective pressure in different geographic origins. Detailed evolutionary studies on each olfactory genes showed that several OBPs and ORs are under significantly purifying/relaxed selective pressure, and several positive selection sites were also detected, modeling of SpopOR14 and SpopOBP4/5 showed that most of the positive selection sites were distributed at the N-terminus of SpopOR14, while the positive selection sites in SpopOBP4/5 were located in H-bond donors, results suggest that these sites are more likely to be linked with the selectivity of modeled olfactory genes. The research provided a better understanding of the molecular basis and evolutionary history of the olfactory genes in Lamiinae, through elaborating the mechanism whereby amino structural evolution affects specific variants in OBPs and ORs.",

Although its conservation and the development of successful artificial breeding technologies have recently received considerable attention, there are currently no available data regarding the molecular mechanisms in controlling reproduction. In this study, we performed transcriptome sequencing of the testis, ovary, female and male eyestalks and the androgenic gland of O. oratoria, and compared the expression pattern of transcripts from the testis and ovary libraries to identify genes involved in gonadal development. A total of 147,130,937 clean reads were retrieved after removing the adapters in reads and filtering out low-quality data. All the reads were assembled into 94,990 unigenes (23,133 in testis and ovary) with an average length of 783 base pairs (bp) and N50 of 1502 bp. A search of all-unigenes against COG, GO, KEGG, KOG, Pfam, Swiss-Prot and Nr databases resulted in a total of 19,404 annotated unigenes. Comparison of the sequences in the ovary and testis libraries revealed that 1188 unigenes were up-regulated in the ovary and 2732 were up-regulated in the testis. Twenty ovary-up-regulated and 21 testis-up-regulated unigenes were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, 13,437 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and 275,799 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified. The important functional genes and pathways identified here provide a valuable dataset for understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling gonad development in O. oratoria, and the numerous (13,437 SSRs and 275,799 SNPs) molecular markers obtained here will provide fundamental basis for functional genomic and population genetic studies of O. oratoria.",

However, the specific functions of ABC gene families in insects is unclear. We report a genome-wide identification, phylogenetic, and transcriptional analysis of the ABC genes in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). We identified a total of 47 ABC genes (BdABCs) from the transcriptomic and genomic databases of B. dorsalis and classified these genes into eight subfamilies (A-H), including 7 ABCAs, 7 ABCBs, 9 ABCCs, 2 ABCDs, 1 ABCE, 3 ABCFs, 15 ABCGs, and 3 ABCHs. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the ABCs suggests an orthologous relationship between B. dorsalis and other insect species in which these genes have been related to pesticide resistance and essential biological processes. Comparison of transcriptome and relative expression patterns of BdABCs indicated diverse multifunctions within different B. dorsalis tissues. The expression of 4, 10, and 14 BdABCs from 18 BdABCs was significantly upregulated after exposure to LD50s of malathion, avermectin, and beta-cypermethrin, respectively. The maximum expression level of most BdABCs (including BdABCFs, BdABCGs, and BdABCHs) occurred at 48\u00a0h post exposures, whereas BdABCEs peaked at 24\u00a0h after treatment. Furthermore, RNA interference-mediated suppression of BdABCB7 resulted in increased toxicity of malathion against B. dorsalis. These data suggest that ABC transporter genes might play key roles in xenobiotic metabolism and biosynthesis in B. dorsalis.",

Much work has been focused on the role of whole genome duplications (WGD) in the architecture of extant vertebrate genomes, particularly those of teleost fishes which underwent a WGD early in the teleost radiation >\u00a0230 million years ago (mya). Our past work has focused on the fate of duplicated copies of a multigene family coding for the intracellular lipid-binding protein (iLBP) genes in the teleost fishes. To define the evolutionary processes that determined the fate of duplicated genes and generated the structure of extant fish genomes, however, requires comparative genomic analysis with a fish lineage that diverged before the teleost WGD, such as the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), an ancient, air-breathing, ray-finned fish. Here, we describe the genomic organization, chromosomal location and tissue-specific expression of a subfamily of the iLBP genes that code for fatty acid-binding proteins (Fabps) in spotted gar. Based on this work, we have defined the minimum suite of fabp genes prior to their duplication in the teleost lineages ~\u00a0230\u2013400 mya. Spotted gar, therefore, serves as an appropriate outgroup, or ancestral/ancient fish, that did not undergo the teleost-specific WGD. As such, analyses of the spatio-temporal regulation of spotted gar genes provides a foundation to determine whether the duplicated fabp genes have been retained in teleost genomes owing to either sub- or neofunctionalization.",

Decapod species from the family Alvinocarididae have colonized and successfully adapted to this extremely harsh environment. Mitochondria plays a vital role in oxygen usage and energy metabolism, thus it may be under selection in the adaptive evolution of the hydrothermal vent shrimps. In this study, the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of alvinocaridid shrimp Shinkaicaris leurokolos (Kikuchi & Hashimoto, 2000) was determined through Illumina sequencing. The mitogenome of S. leurokolos was 15,903\u00a0bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs. The gene order and orientation were identical to those of sequenced alvinocaridids. It has the longest concatenated sequences of protein-coding genes, tRNAs and shortest pooled rRNAs among the alvinocaridids. The control regions (CRs) of alvinocaridid were significantly longer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than those of the other caridaen. The alignment of the alvinocaridid CRs revealed two conserved sequence blocks (CSBs), and each of the CSBs included a noncanonical open reading frame (ORF), which may be involved in adjusting mitochondrial energy metabolism to adapt to the hydrothermal environment. Phylogenetic analysis supported that the deep-sea hydrothermal vent shrimps may have originated from those living in shallow area. Positive selection analysis reveals the evidence of adaptive change in the mitogenome of Alvinocarididae. Thirty potentially important adaptive residues were identified, which were located in atp6, cox1, cox3, cytb and nad1\u20135. This study explores the mitochondrial genetic basis of hydrothermal vent adaptation in alvinocaridid for the first time, and provides valuable clues regarding the adaptation.",

We performed a candidate gene analysis to look for evidence of selection on 33 insulin superfamily ligand-receptor genes and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (Igfbp's) in stickleback. Using genotype data from 11 marine and 10 FW populations, we calculated the number of SNPs per site in regulatory and intronic regions, the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations in coding regions, Wright's fixation index (Fst), and performed t-tests to identify SNPs with divergent genotype frequencies between marine/FW versus Atlantic/Pacific populations. Next, we analysed genome-wide transcriptome data from eight tissues to assess differential gene expression. Two Igfbp's (Igfbp2a and Igfbp5a) show evidence of divergent adaptation between life-history types, and a cluster of nonsynonymous mutations in Igfbp5a exhibit high Fst in exons apparently alternatively spliced in gill. We find evidence of selection on the relaxin family ligand-receptor gene pair, Insl3-Rxfp2, known to be involved in male spermatogenesis and bone metabolism, and in the 5\u2032 regulatory region of Igf2. We also confirmed the gene and coding sequence of two unannotated relaxin family ligands.

Transcriptome of the three mixed stages revealed a total of 80 transcripts encoding chemosensory-related proteins comprising 45 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 12 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 20 receptor proteins [9 odorant receptors (ORs), 8 gustatory receptors (GRs) and 3 ionotropic receptors (IRs)] and 3 sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). As many as 38 full-length sequences were acquired with a combination of transcriptomic analysis and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) strategy. Phylogenetic analysis showed that T. yunnanensis OBPs were clustered into four sub-groups: 27 Minus-C OBPs, 5 antennal binding proteins (ABPIIs), 10 Classic OBPs and one Plus-C OBP; meanwhile, the ORs were grouped into four clades (1, 2, 7b and Orco). Expression profiles revealed that 66 of 80 genes were detected in the three DGE libraries, and 15 soluble olfactory proteins were antennae-predominant, possibly guiding olfactory-associated behaviors of this beetle. Taken together, our study has provided valuable data for further functional studies of this beetle and will facilitate the identification of potential molecular targets associated with chemosensory reception for use in biocontrol strategies.",

We evaluated the proteomic and immune responses of Eurasian perch to chronic corticosteroid treatments. We implanted immature perch with cortisol (80\u00a0mg/kg) or DOC (4\u00a0mg/kg) and measured the proportions of blood leucocytes, immune indices in the plasma, spleen and liver (complement and lysozyme activity, total immunoglobulin and immune gene expression in the tissues) and differential proteome expression (corticosteroid versus control) in the liver and the spleen on days 2, 4 and 14 post-treatment. Implantation of cortisol decreased the ratio of blood leucocytes and depressed Ig levels in both organs while DOC modulated the proportion of leucocyte sub-populations (increase in lymphocytes and decrease in granulocytes). In contrast, the innate humoral immunity was not strongly influenced by any of corticosteroid implants. The only immune parameter that was significantly affected was lysozyme, after DOC treatment. A number of proteins were differentially regulated by these hormones and some were identified in the liver (21 for cortisol and 8 for DOC) and in the spleen (10 for cortisol and 10 for DOC). None of the proteins was directly linked to immunity, except the natural killer enhancing factor, which was repressed by cortisol in the spleen. Our results also confirm that the proteins involved in energetic and glucose metabolism are affected by corticosteroids. Furthermore, these corticosteroids differently regulate immune status in Eurasian perch and they primarily impact leucocytes, as opposed to innate immune function.",

The objective of this study was to investigate how adverse effects of chronic exposure to non-toxic levels of essential and non-essential metals in early life stage zebrafish may be explained by changes in the transcriptome. We therefore studied the effects of three different metals at low concentrations in zebrafish embryos by transcriptomics analysis. The study design compared exposure effects caused by different metals at different developmental stages (pre-hatch and post-hatch). Wild-type embryos were exposed to solutions of low concentrations of copper (CuSO4), cadmium (CdCl2) and cobalt (CoSO4) until 96\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf) and microarray experiments were carried out to determine transcriptome profiles at 48 and 96\u00a0hpf. We found that the toxic metal cadmium affected the expression of more genes at 96\u00a0hpf than 48\u00a0hpf. The opposite effect was observed for the essential metals cobalt and copper, which also showed enrichment of different GO terms. Genes involved in neuromast and motor neuron development were significantly enriched, agreeing with our previous results showing motor neuron and neuromast damage in the embryos. Our data provide evidence that the response of the transcriptome of fish embryos to metal exposure differs for essential and non-essential metals.",

     "abstract": "In the face of ongoing climate change, it is imperative to understand better the effects of temperature on immune function in freshwater teleosts. It is unclear whether previously observed changes were caused by temperature per se. We studied changes in the gill transcriptome of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) at low temperature to understand better the effects of temperature on immune function. De novo assembly of the transcriptome using Trinity software resulted in 73,378 assembled contigs. Annotation using the Trinotate package yielded 58,952 Blastx hits (accessions). Expression of 194 unique mRNA transcripts changed in gill tissue of fathead minnows acclimatized to 5\u00b0 compared to controls at 22\u202f\u00b0C. At 5\u202f\u00b0C mRNAs coding for proteins involved in innate immune responses were up-regulated. Those included proteins that block early-stage viral replication and macrophage activation. Expression of mRNAs coding for pro-inflammatory molecules and mucus secretion were also enhanced. Messenger RNAs coding for proteins associated with adaptive immune responses were down-regulated at 5\u202f\u00b0C. Those included antigen-presenting proteins and proteins involved in immunoglobin production. Messenger RNAs coding for proteins that stimulate the cell cycle were also down-regulated at 5\u202f\u00b0C. Histological comparison revealed that gills of cold acclimated fish had fewer mucus cells but cells contained larger mucus droplets. We conclude that decreased temperature modifies the immune systems of freshwater teleosts, leading to genome-wide upregulation of innate immunity and down regulation of adaptive immunity. Such acclimation likely evolved as an adaptive strategy against seasonal changes in infectious insults.",

After screening 53,029 contigs with high cutoff values (fold change\u00a0>\u00a0|\u00a010\u00a0|; P-value\u00a0<\u00a00.05; RPKM\u00a0>\u00a01), we were able to identify 105 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), of which 100 were up-regulated and five were down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that many DEGs were involved in the synthetic pathways for glycerol and trehalose, which are known to function as the major protectants under conditions of low temperature and osmotic stress in arthropods. Additional analysis of the other DEGs enabled us to classify them in four categories: immunity; cellular trafficking; transcriptional regulation; molting and maturation. Many DEGs were involved in immunity and stress responses, in particular the proPO activation system, which is the major immune and wound-healing system in arthropods. In addition to immunity and stress responses, we were also able to identify DEGs involved in molting and maturation processes (e.g., group I chitinase), as well as those involved in hormone metabolism and trafficking. Collectively, based on the transcriptomic analysis, ESA causes not only stress and immune responses, but also molting and maturation in L. vannamei. The DEGs identified in this study could be useful markers to understand the physiological responses that ESA induces in shrimp, such as molting, maturation, and immunity.",

We obtained approximately 80.2 million 150\u00a0bp reads that were assembled into 61,038 unigenes with an average length of 890\u00a0bp. Among the transcripts, 70% of the unigenes were annotated.

Then, quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed to investigate the expression patterns of 32 putative chemosensory genes. The results showed that these genes were highly expressed in olfactory organs (antennae) and might play a key role in the olfaction-related behaviours in H. oblita. Based on the results of our phylogenetic analysis and the detailed tissue and sex-biased expression characteristics, the different roles of the receptor proteins in the olfactory system were also indicated. The results of this study will provide the foundation for further understanding of the olfactory odorant receptors of H. oblita at the molecular level and ultimately help to develop novel targets for manipulating this pest.",

To determine the mechanisms involved in temperature acclimation of fish, the fast skeletal muscle tissues of medaka underwent global gene expression analysis using next-generation sequencing. Ten individuals were placed into two aquariums at 24\u00a0\u00b0C. While the water temperature of one aquarium was decreased to 10\u00a0\u00b0C, that of the other aquarium was increased to 30\u00a0\u00b0C; these temperatures were subsequently maintained for 5\u00a0weeks. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses revealed that 11 genes involved in energy metabolism and muscle atrophy were significantly highly expressed in the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish. Meanwhile, significantly higher expression levels were observed for 20 genes encoding myofibrillar proteins and heat shock proteins in the 30\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish. Moreover, 1103 genes had at least fourfold differential expression between the acclimation groups. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses provided important information: although the expression of genes related to metabolic processes were activated, muscle atrophy occurred in the 10\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish, and muscle cells divided actively in the 30\u00a0\u00b0C-acclimated fish and avoided thermal stress by expressing heat shock proteins. Therefore, RNA-Seq analyses with the available genome database will be useful for better understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the temperature acclimation of fish.",

Particularly concentration dependence of gene expression effects is unclear. Focusing on this matter, zebrafish embryo toxicity tests were used in combination with transcriptomics. Embryos were exposed to three concentrations of copper (CuSO4), cadmium (CdCl2) and cobalt (CoSO4) from just after fertilization until the end of the 48\u00a0hpf pre- and 96\u00a0hpf post-hatch stage. The RNA was then analyzed on Agilent's Zebrafish (V3, 4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a044K) arrays. Enrichment for GO terms of biological processes illustrated for cadmium that most affected GO terms were represented in all three concentrations, while for cobalt and copper most GO terms were represented in the lowest test concentration only. This suggested a different response to the non-essential cadmium than cobalt and copper. In cobalt and copper treated embryos, many developmental and cellular processes as well as the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, were found significantly enriched. Also, different exposure concentrations affected varied functional networks. In contrast, the largest clusters of enriched GO terms for all three concentrations of cadmium included responses to cadmium ion, metal ion, xenobiotic stimulus, stress and chemicals. However, concentration dependence of mRNA levels was evident for several genes in all metal exposures. Some of these genes may be indicative of the mechanisms of action of the individual metals in zebrafish embryos.

To increase the P utilization in fish, molecular techniques should be explored given the remarkable development of these techniques. Thus, to identify the candidate genes related to P utilization and molecular alterations following administration of a P-deficient diet in seabass Lateolabrax japonicus, we assessed the de novo pituitary, gill, intestine, liver, kidney, scales and vertebra transcriptomes, and we compared the expression of hepatic genes with three diets varying in P and Ca levels: diet I (0.4% P, 0.3% Ca), diet II (0.8% P, 0.3% Ca), and diet III (0.8% P, 3% Ca). In total, we identified 99,392 unigenes, and 37,086 (37.31%) unigenes were annotated. The results showed that 48 unigenes were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) up-regulated, while 55 genes were significantly down-regulated in the liver of group I compared with group II. Offering the P-sufficient and high Ca diet, diet III significantly up-regulated 24 unigenes and down-regulated 46 genes in the liver. There were significant differences in the regulation of 8 unigenes (3 up-regulated and 5 down-regulated) between groups II and III. Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of differently expressed genes were performed for each pair of groups. The GO analysis showed that a large number of biological processes were significantly altered between P-deficient and P-sufficient treatments (I vs II and I vs III). Comparing group I and group II, seven KEGG terms were enriched significantly: glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, one carbon pool by folate, arginine and proline metabolism, the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, fatty acid elongation, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, and fatty acid metabolism. There was no significantly enriched KEGG pathway between groups II and III. In conclusion, our study revealed that a P-deficient diet could increase catabolism and decrease anabolism of protein, as highlighted by low protein efficiency in fish fed the P-deficient diet. Furthermore, P-deficiency could motivate the biosynthesis of fatty acids. However, the dietary Ca level had no significant effect on the growth and expression of hepatic genes in L. japonicus.",

In the present study, we sequenced the transcriptome of bivoltine silkworm Qiufeng's ovaries resulted in laying of diapause destined or non-diapause eggs, using high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. Differential expression analyses identified 183 genes with higher expression, and 106 with lower expression under diapause-inducing conditions.

Differential expression of genes related to actin cytoskeleton implies the occurrence of shifts in cellular structure and composition between diapause-inducing and non-diapause-inducing groups.

Sequence similarity analysis, functional domain prediction and phylogenetic analysis supported their annotation and orthologies. By examining the gene copy number of TLR genes across several vertebrates, gene duplications and losses were observed. The expression patterns of TLR genes were examined during early developmental stages and in various healthy tissues, and the results showed that TLR genes were ubiquitously expressed, indicating a likely role in maintaining homeostasis. Moreover, the differential expression of TLRs was examined after Aeromons hydrophila infection, and showed that most TLR genes were induced, with diverse patterns.

The RNA sequencing generated a total of 61,655,525 paired-end reads from control and stressed conditions. De novo assembly using the CLC Genomic Workbench produced 86,840 transcripts and created a reference transcriptome with a N50 of 1426\u00a0bp.

Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of the biological processes, like response to stress, response to biotic stimulus, and immune response. Conversely, a significant down-regulation of biological processes is associated with metabolic processes. These results were validated by RT-qPCR analysis for nine candidate genes involved in the immune response.

     "abstract": "Artemia diapause has been extensively studied in embryonic biology for a long time. It has been demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can increase the hatching rate in the development and diapause termination of Artemia cysts. This study used an untargeted 1H NMR-based metabolomic approach to explore the physiological regulation of H2O2 in initiating the development and terminating the diapause of Artemia cysts. This experiment was divided into two parts. In the first part, we analyzed three groups with or without H2O2 as control-0\u00a0h, control-5\u00a0h and H2O2 (180\u00a0\u03bcM)-5\u00a0h; in the second part, after 7-d incubation, the non-hatching cysts were treated with different H2O2 concentrations as low as 180\u00a0\u03bcM and as high 1800\u00a0\u03bcM. The results showed that arginine and proline metabolism were up-regulated after 5\u00a0h, and H2O2 up-regulated valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis in the development of cysts. In the second part, low H2O2 (180\u00a0\u03bcM) showed alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, but high H2O2 (1800\u00a0\u03bcM) also up-regulated arginine and proline metabolism, as in the control group without H2O2 stimulus. These results suggest that enough H2O2 can catalyze cell transcription and translation in Artemia cysts, and it improves the cell growth rate, thus allowing embryo cells to grow again.",

     "abstract": "Inefficient control of temperate abalone spawning prevents pair-wise breeding and production of abalone with highly marketable traits. Traditionally, abalone farmers have used a combination of UV irradiation and application of temperature gradients to the tank water to artificially induce spawning. Proteins are known to regulate crucial processes such as respiration, muscle contraction, feeding, growth and reproduction. Spawning as a pre-requisite of abalone reproduction is likely to be regulated, in part, by endogenous proteins. A first step in elucidating the mechanisms that regulate spawning is to identify which proteins are directly involved during spawning. The present study examined protein expression following traditional spawning induction in the Haliotis laevigata female. Gonads were collected from abalone in the following physiological states: (1) spawning; (2) post-spawning; and (3) failed-to-spawn. Differential protein abundance was initially assessed using two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry for protein identification. A number of reproductive proteins such as vitellogenin, vitelline envelope zona pellucida domain 29 and prohibitin, and metabolic proteins such as thioredoxin peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and heat shock proteins were identified. Differences in protein abundance levels between physiological states were further assessed using scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. Positive associations were observed between the abundance of specific proteins, such as heat shock cognate 70 and peroxiredoxin 6, and the propensity or failure to spawn in abalone. These findings have contributed to better understand both the effects of oxidative and heat stress over abalone physiology and their influence on abalone spawning.",

In insects, olfaction is very important throughout their lifetime. There are two groups of small soluble proteins, named odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs), which are suggested to participate in the initial biochemical recognition steps of insect olfactory signal transduction. In this study, a total of 16 OBPs (12 classical OBPs and 4 plus-C OBPs) and 8 CSPs, were identified in the antennal transcriptome of A. suturalis. The sex- and tissue-specific profiles of these binding protein genes showed that 13 of the 16 OBP transcripts were highly expressed in the antennae of both sexes, and 4 OBPs (AsutOBP1, 4, 5 and 9) were expressed higher in the male antennae compared to the female antennae. Three CSPs (AsutCSP1, 4 and 5) were expressed specifically in the antennae of both sexes, and AsutCSP1 was expressed higher in the male antennae than in the female antennae. Our findings identify several novel OBP and CSP genes for further investigation of the olfactory system of A. suturalis at the molecular level.",

The spill resulted in substantial shoreline oiling, potentially exposing coastal organisms to polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and dispersant contaminants. To investigate molecular effects in fish following exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of DWH oil and dispersants, we exposed adult sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus) to two concentrations of high-energy water-accommodated fraction (HEWAF), chemically enhanced water-accommodated fraction (CEWAF) or Corexit 9500\u2122 for 7 and 14\u00a0days. Resulting changes in hepatic gene expression were measured using 8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0K microarrays. Analytical chemistry confirmed PAH concentrations in HEWAF and CEWAF treatments were low (ranging from 0.26 to 5.98\u00a0\u03bcg/L), and likely representative of post-spill environmental concentrations. We observed significant changes to gene expression in all treatments (relative to controls), with Corexit and CEWAF having a greater effect on expression patterns in the liver than HEWAF treatments. Sub-network enrichment analysis of biological pathways revealed that the greatest number of altered pathways in high dose HEWAF and CEWAF treatments occurred following a 7-day exposure. Pathways related to immunity comprised the majority of pathways affected in each treatment, followed by pathways related to blood and circulation processes. Our results indicate that oil composition, concentration, and exposure duration all affect molecular responses in exposed fish, and suggest that low-concentration exposures may result in sub-lethal adverse effects.",

Correlation studies indicated that S. nudus with larger diameter have a prolonged marketing time and better palatability owing to their precocious gonads and extended maturation process. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still unknown. Here, transcriptome sequencing was applied to study the ovaries of adult S. nudus with different shell diameters to explore the possible mechanism. In this study, four independent cDNA libraries were constructed, including two from the big size urchins and two from the small ones using a HiSeq\u21222500 platform. A total of 88,581 unigenes were acquired with a mean length of 1354\u00a0bp, of which 66,331 (74.88%) unigenes could be annotated using six major publicly available databases.

Of these, 20 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected to confirm the accuracy of RNA-seq data by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Furthermore, gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed to find the putative genes and pathways related to ovarian maturity.

Here, we identified the entire repertoire of CYP genes (n\u00a0=\u00a052) from whole genome and transcriptome sequences of the benthic copepod Tigriopus japonicus, including a tandem duplication (CYP3026A3, CYP3026A4, CYP3026A5), and examined patterns of gene expression over various developmental stages and in response to benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P) exposure.

Developmental stage and gender-specific expression patterns of the 52 T. japonicus CYPs were analyzed. CYP3022A1 was constitutively expressed during all developmental stages. CYP genes in clans 2 and 3 were induced in response to B[\u03b1]P, suggesting that these differentially modulated CYP transcripts are likely involved in defense against exposure to B[\u03b1]P and other pollutants.

Furthermore, gene expression differences between the unfertilized egg and the gastrula embryo were analysed using Illumina RNA-Seq with single-read sequencing technology, and 24,837 differentially and specifically expressed transcripts were identified and included 5,286 annotated transcripts and 19,569 non-annotated transcripts. All of the expressed transcripts in the unfertilized egg and gastrula embryo were further classified as maternal, zygotic, or maternal-zygotic transcripts, which may help us to understand the roles of these transcripts during the embryonic development of the Japanese flounder. Thus, the results will contribute to an improved understanding of the gene expression patterns and signalling pathways that control the molecular mechanisms of early embryonic development.",

     "abstract": "There is currently renewed interest in farming triploid Atlantic salmon. Improving farming requires identifying triploid specific phenotypic and physiological traits that are uniquely derived from ploidy per se and developed under optimal growing conditions. This study investigated firstly, the impact of ploidy on growth performance and whole body composition of Atlantic salmon at different early freshwater stages [34\u00a0dph (days post-hatching) alevin, 109\u00a0dph fry, and 162\u00a0dph parr] and secondly, whether phenotypic differences at these stages were reflected in protein samples collected from whole fish, white muscle or liver tissue. Female diploid and triploid Atlantic salmon (n\u00a0=\u00a03) were first fed at 35\u00a0dph and then maintained by feeding to satiation on commercial feeds. Triploids were significantly lower in weight at the late alevin and fry stages but matched diploid weight at the parr stage. The whole-body lipid content was significantly higher for triploids at the parr stage, while the whole-body lipid class profile was broadly similar and was largely not affected by ploidy. Comparative label-free shotgun proteomic analysis did not detect significant alterations in protein expression between diploids and triploids at any growth stage. The present results indicate that ploidy under optimal growing conditions and during early freshwater stages only result in small phenotypic differences in weight and whole body lipid content that were not reflected at the proteome level. These findings suggest that optimal husbandry conditions for freshwater Atlantic salmon are similar between ploidies, at least for all-female populations.",

     "abstract": "Harmonia axyridis is an important predatory lady beetle that is a natural enemy of agricultural and forestry pests. In this research, the cold hardiness induced genes and their expression changes in H. axyridis were screened and detected by the way of the transcriptome and qualitative real-time PCR under normal and low temperatures, using high-throughput transcriptome and digital gene-expression-tag technologies. We obtained a 10\u00a0Gb transcriptome and an 8\u00a0Mb gene expression tag pool using Illumina deep sequencing technology and RNA-Seq analysis (accession number SRX540102). Of the 46,980 non-redundant unigenes identified, 28,037 (59.7%) were matched to known genes in GenBank, 21,604 (46.0%) in Swiss-Prot, 19,482 (41.5%) in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and 13,193 (28.1%) in Gene Ontology databases. Seventy-five percent of the unigene sequences had top matches with gene sequences from Tribolium castaneum. Results indicated that 60 genes regulated the entire cold-acclimation response, and, of these, seven genes were always up-regulated and five genes always down-regulated. Further screening revealed that six cold-resistant genes, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, transketolase, trehalase, serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2, glycerol kinase and sugar transporter SWEET1-like, play key roles in the response. Expression from a number of the differentially expressed genes was confirmed with quantitative real-time PCR (HaCS_Trans). The paper attempted to identify cold-resistance response genes, and study the potential mechanism by which cold acclimation enhances the insect's cold endurance. Information on these cold-resistance response genes will improve the development of low-temperature storage technology of natural enemy insects for future use in biological control.",

     "abstract": "One of the most important functions of plasma proteins in vertebrates is their participation in osmotic homeostasis in the organism. Modern concepts about plasma proteins and their capillary filtration are based on a model of large monomeric proteins that are able to penetrate the interstitial space. At the same time, it was revealed that a considerable amount of oligomeric complexes are present in the low-molecular-weight (LM) protein fraction in the extracellular fluids of fishes. The functions of these complexes are unknown. In the present study, we investigated the LM-fraction proteins in the plasma and interstitial fluid (IF) of redfins of the genus Tribolodon. This fish alternatively spends parts of its life cycle in saline and fresh waters. We identified the protein Wap65, serpins and apolipoproteins in this fraction. By combining the methods of 2D-E under native and denaturing conditions with MALDI, we demonstrated that only apolipoproteins formed complexes. We showed that serum apolipoproteins (\u0410\u0440\u043e\u0410-I, \u0410\u0440\u043e-14) were present in the form of homooligomeric complexes that were dissociated with the release of monomeric forms of proteins in the course of capillary filtration to IF. Dissociation of homooligomers is not directly correlated with the change in salinity but is correlated with seasonal dynamics. We found that there was a significant decrease in the total protein concentration in IF relative to plasma. Therefore, we suggested that dissociation of homooligomeric complexes from various apolipoproteins supports the isoosmoticity of extracellular fluids relative to capillary wall stabilization through a fluid medium in fish.",

It contains calponin homology domain, five calponin family repeats and possesses similar biochemical properties as vertebrate smooth muscle calponin. In this paper, we report a full-length cDNA sequence of CaP-40, study its expression pattern on mRNA and protein levels, evaluate CaP-40 post-translational modifications and perform protein-protein interaction analysis.The full-length sequence of CaP-40 consists of 398 amino acids and has high similarity to calponins among molluscan species. CaP-40 gene is widely expressed in mussel tissues, with the highest expression in adductor and mantle. Comparison of these data with protein content established by mass-spectrometry analysis revealed that the high mRNA content is mirrored by high protein levels for adductor smooth muscles. To provide unbiased insight into the function of CaP-40 and effect of its over-expression in adductor smooth muscle, we built protein-protein interaction network of identified Crenomytilus grayanus proteome. In addition, we showed that CaP-40 is subjected to post-translational N- and C-terminal acetylation at N127, G229 and G349 sites which potentially regulates its function in vivo.",

In this study, a total of 54 DExD/H-box RNA helicase genes including 37 DDX (DEAD-box) and 17 DHX (DEAH-box) genes were characterized in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and annotated through phylogenetic and syntenic analyses. All the catfish RNA helicases contained conserved helicase signature motifs, demonstrating that the RNA helicase gene family was highly conserved. Analysis of the relative rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions revealed that the RNA helicase genes were subjected to strong negative (purifying) selection. Meta-analysis was conducted to determine expression of the RNA helicase genes during the critical period (90\u2013110\u00a0days post-fertilization, dpf) of male gonad differentiation. At 90\u00a0dpf, 24 RNA helicase genes were highly differentially expressed in the gonad tissues between the males and females; similarly, 24 and 18 RNA helicase genes were found highly differentially expressed in the gonad tissues between the males and females at 100 and 110\u00a0dpf, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In general, the vast majority of the RNA helicase genes (31) were expressed at higher levels in females than in males. In the male gonad, a set of 8 RNA helicases were expressed at a significantly higher level at 110\u00a0dpf than at 90\u00a0dpf.

     "abstract": "The life history of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla, L.) is characterized by a series of metamorphoses and transitions that provoke drastic morphological changes. Most of these changes go along with the catadromous life cycle in eels, involving extensive physiologically adaptations. In this study it was investigated whether these drastic changes have an epigenetic basis by analyzing global methylation patterns in liver, gill and brain tissue from glass eels caught at the British coast as well as yellow and silver eels from River Rhine using methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphisms (MSAP). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) on MSAP data derived from liver tissue revealed only minor differences in methylation patterns between glass, yellow and silver eels, reflecting uniform functioning of the liver throughout the investigated lifespan. In brain and gill tissue, however, marked differences in methylation patterns were found. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed yellow eels being partially clustered with silver eels and a more distinct cluster of glass eels based on the methylation patterns in the brain. According to results found in the gills, glass eels were more similar to silver eels whereas yellow eels were found to be clustered separately. From these results it can be concluded that epigenetic changes in gill tissue most likely reflect and are linked with adaptation towards salt- and freshwater conditions. The observed differences in brain methylation patterns, however, might be linked to morphological and physiological changes during metamorphosis and transitions within the life history of European eels potentially affecting subsequent differential gene expression patterns required for such changes.",

It has been suggested that micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are involved in microbial pathogenesis.

Thirty-six down-regulated and 9 up-regulated miRNAs belonging to 31 miRNA families were detected at 3\u00a0days post-infection, whereas 50 down-regulated and 18 up-regulated miRNAs belonging to 41 miRNA families were found at 10\u00a0days post-infection. The 45 and 68 differentially expressed miRNAs at 3 and 10\u00a0days target 6280 and 7181 genes, respectively. In this study, 8 candidate novel chicken miRNAs were identified. Analyses via GO, KEGG, miRNA-GO-network, path-net and gene-net showed that these altered miRNAs might be involved in regulating the host response to MG infection by targeting genes in many pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, focal adhesion, Wnt pathway, endocytosis, Jak/STAT pathway, phosphatidylinositol pathway, adherens junctions, regulation of actin cytoskeleton among others. These analyses indicate that the MAPK pathway may be a key regulatory route. Also, the miR-8 family, miR-499 family, miR-17 family, and PIK3 family genes, as well as the MAP2K1 and RAC1 genes, might be important in MG infection. miR-20 of the miR-17 family was further confirmed by RT-qPCR.

Swimming performance is impacted in juvenile sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) exposed to dilbit; therefore biomarkers of dilbit exposure will be valuable for monitoring at-risk salmon stocks. This study characterized changes in the serum proteome of sockeye exposed to a sub-lethal and environmentally relevant concentration of dilbit using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ), and included a range of experimental conditions to permit identification of biomarkers that are robust across time (1 and 4\u00a0wk) and exercise level (at rest and following a swim test). Over 500 proteins were identified and quantified in sockeye serum, with dilbit exposure significantly altering the abundance of 24 proteins irrespective of time and exercise, including proteins associated with immune and inflammatory responses, coagulation, and iron homeostasis. An increase in creatine kinase (CK) activity in serum of dilbit-exposed salmon confirmed the higher CK protein abundance measured using iTRAQ. The combination of 4\u00a0wk dilbit exposure and a swim test had a greater effect on the serum proteome than either treatment alone, including a marked increase in tissue leakage proteins, suggesting that aerobic exercise exacerbates the serum proteome response to dilbit, and the increased cellular damage could impede exercise recovery. This study provides a foundation for the development of bio-monitoring tools for salmon stock assessments, and offers new insights into the sub-lethal toxicity of crude oil exposure in fish.",

Important genomic resources are available for most of these species including whole genome sequencing projects, genetic maps and transcriptomes. In this work, we integrate all available genomic information of these species within a common framework, taking as reference the whole assembled genomes of turbot and tongue sole (>\u00a0210\u00a0\u00d7 coverage). New insights related to the genetic basis of productive traits and new data useful to understand the evolutionary origin and diversification of this group were obtained. Despite a general 1:1 chromosome syntenic relationship between species, the comparison of turbot and tongue sole genomes showed huge intrachromosomic reorganizations. The integration of available mapping information supported specific chromosome fusions along flatfish evolution and facilitated the comparison between species of previously reported genetic associations for productive traits.

However, this factor's function in mature chicken ovary is unclear. To explore the function of FOXL2 in chicken granulosa cells, we performed RNA-seq to compare the transcriptomes of pre-hierarchical (phGCs) and pre-ovulatory granulosa cells (poGCs) by FOXL2 overexpression. We observed that focal adhesion might be one of the key pathways activated during the differentiation of granulosa cells, and FOXL2 might be involved in follicle selection by regulating the expression of cytokines and the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Interestingly, we observed that FOXL2 played different roles in phGCs and poGCs, which might contribute to homeostasis in the chicken follicle by inducing differentiation of granulosa cells in pre-hierarchal follicles and preventing premature ovulation in pre-ovulatory follicles. Taken together, the results of our study establish a framework for understanding the potential functions of FOXL2 in the chicken granulosa cell.",

     "abstract": "The winged pearl oyster Pteria penguin is a commercially important marine pearl oyster species, with pearls that are quite different from those of other pearl oysters. Among such species, mantle tissue is the main organ responsible for shell and pearl formation, a biomineralization process that is regulated by a series of genes, most of which remain unknown. In this study, we sequenced and characterized the transcriptome of P. penguin mantle tissue using the HiSeq 2000 sequencing platform. A total of 93,204 unique transcripts were assembled from 51,580,076 quality reads, with a mean length of 608\u00a0bp, and 40,974 unigenes were annotated. The sequence data enabled the identification of 79,702 potential single nucleotide polymorphism loci and 4345 putative simple sequence repeat loci. A total of 71 unique transcripts were identified homologous to known biomineralization genes, including mantle gene, nacrein, pearlin, pif, chitinase, and shematrin, of which only 3 were previously reported in P. penguin. qPCR analysis indicated that 10 randomly selected biomineralization genes were much more highly expressed in mantle tissue than in the other tissues. In addition, 30 unique sequences were identified as highly expressed, with FPKM values of >\u00a03000, and most of these were biomineralization-related genes, including shematrin family genes, a jacalin-related lectin synthesis gene, calponin-2, and paramyosin. These findings will be useful for future studies of biomineralization in P. penguin, as well as in other Pteria species.",

We identified 103,774 unigenes of which 37,959, 12,890, and 17,699 were annotated in the PANM (Protostome DB), Unigene, and COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) databases, respectively. In addition, 14,451 unigenes were predicted under Gene Ontology functional categories, with 4581 assigned to a single category. Furthermore, 3369 sequences with 646 having Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were mapped to 122 pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway database. The prominent protein domains included the Zinc finger (C2H2-like), Reverse Transcriptase, Thioredoxin-like fold, and RNA recognition motif domain. Many unigenes with homology to immunity, defense, and reproduction-related genes were screened in the transcriptome. We also detected 3120 putative simple sequence repeats (SSRs) encompassing dinucleotide to hexanucleotide repeat motifs from >\u00a01\u00a0kb unigene sequences. A list of PCR primers of SSR loci have been identified to study the genetic polymorphisms.

Whole blood provides significant advantages, allowing large scale and non-invasive sampling. However, generation of gene expression data from the blood of non-mammalian species remains a challenge, notably due to the nucleated red blood cells, hindering the use of well-established protocols. The aim of this study was to analyze the relevance of using whole blood cells (WB) to find biomarkers, instead of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC), usually chosen for immune challenges. RNA sources from WB and PBMC was characterized by microarray analysis. Our results show that the quality and quantity of RNA obtained from WB was suitable for further analyses, although the quality was lower than that from PBMC. The transcriptome profiling comparison revealed that the majority of genes were expressed in both WB and PBMC. Hemoglobin subunits were the major transcripts in WB, whereas the most enriched biological process was related to protein catabolic process. Most of the over-represented transcripts in PBMC were implicated in functions specific to thrombocytes, like coagulation and platelet activation, probably due to the large proportion of this nucleated cell type in chicken PBMC. Functions related to B and T cells and to other immune functions were also enriched in the PBMC subset. We conclude that WB is more suitable for large scale immunity oriented studies and other biological processes that have been poorly investigated so far.",

     "abstract": "Rainbow trout represent an important teleost research model and aquaculture species. As such, rainbow trout are employed in diverse areas of biological research, including basic biological disciplines such as comparative physiology, toxicology, and, since rainbow trout have undergone both teleost- and salmonid-specific rounds of genome duplication, molecular evolution. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs, small non-protein coding RNAs) have emerged as important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in animals. Given the increasingly recognized importance of miRNAs as an additional layer in the regulation of gene expression and hence biological function, recent efforts using RNA- and genome sequencing approaches have resulted in the creation of several resources for the construction of a comprehensive repertoire of rainbow trout miRNAs and isomiRs (variant miRNA sequences that all appear to derive from the same gene but vary in sequence due to post-transcriptional processing). Importantly, through the recent publication of the rainbow trout genome (Berthelot et al., 2014), mRNA 3\u2032UTR information has become available, allowing for the first time the genome-wide prediction of miRNA-target RNA relationships in this species. We here report the creation of the microtrout database, a comprehensive resource for rainbow trout miRNA and annotated 3\u2032UTRs. The comprehensive database was used to implement an algorithm to predict genome-wide rainbow trout-specific miRNA-mRNA target relationships, generating an improved predictive framework over previously published approaches. This work will serve as a useful framework and sequence resource to experimentally address the role of miRNAs in several research areas using the rainbow trout model, examples of which are discussed.",

However, little is known of the metabolic and respiration adaptations caused by temperature fluctuations in these animals. Therefore we used the African burrowing scorpion Opistophthalmus latimanus to measure the effect of temperature on its metabolism and respiration.Radioactive d-glucose was injected into the ventral sinus of the circulatory system and metabolites of d-glucose were determined after six hour incubation at four temperatures (7, 17, 25 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C). The oxygen consumption rate (\u1e40O2) and carbon dioxide production rate (\u1e40CO2) were measured simultaneously at 17, 25 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The metabolomics investigation included LC-MS, GC\u2013MS and NMR analytical platforms.The average radioactivity recovered after the carbon-14 d-glucose injection, glycogen precipitation and column fractionation at the four temperatures was between 92.4% and 95.0%. Strong acids, CO2 and neutral compounds all increased with temperature, while glycogen and neutral sugars decreased as the temperature increased. Weak acids initially increased with temperature, then decreased again as the temperature was increased to 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Respiration also gradually increased as the temperature was increased. Metabolomics identified 23 metabolites that were significantly influenced by temperature. Pathway analysis of these metabolites indicated numerous metabolic pathways that were affected by temperature, clearly demonstrating that the scorpion uses proteins, lipids and carbohydrates at higher temperatures to generate energy. However, protein catabolism seems to be the main source of energy at higher temperatures in these animals, although this needs to be confirmed in a more targeted metabolomics study.",

Samples corresponding respectively to eyed embryos and fry stages were also taken on days 18 and 76 post-fertilization. Based on two-dimensional electrophoresis, all spots that were found to differ significantly in abundance between the untreated and heat-shock treated groups were selected for identification using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Out of 19 protein spots showing altered abundance in the present study, 13 spots were successfully identified. Of the spots that were shown to change in abundance in the fertilized eggs with heat-shock treatment, three were identified as vitellogenin (spots 1, 2 and 3); while the others were creatine kinase (spot 5) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (spot 6). All of the proteins identified in the embryos were related to vitellogenin (spots 8, 12 and 13). Among the identified spots from the fry muscle extracts, two were identified as beta-globin (spots 14 and 17); while the others were parvalbumin (spots 15 and 16) and creatine kinase (spot 19).

Its longest IGN is 652\u00a0bp in size locating between trnL1 and trnQ, which is regarded as putative control region (CR) considering its high similarity with the same superfamily species, Conchoecetes artificiosus and Takedromia cristatipes. Compared with the gene order of putative ancestors of insects and crustaceans, D. pilumnoides mitogenome exhibits rearrangements with positional translocation of three genes (trnQ, CR and trnH).

The lengths of CR in these two Homoloidea crabs are 1242\u00a0bp and 1037\u00a0bp, respectively. The occurrence of tandem repeat sequences (TRS) in control region is shared by the three Homoloidea crabs (besides Homologenus malayens), but is not found in the other reported brachyuran crabs. Moreover, the repeat units in H. orientalis and H. malayens show the high level of sequence identity with stable secondary structure. The phylogenetic analyses indicate that Dromioidea and Homoloidea form the most basal assemblage within Brachyura, followed by Raninoidea.",

Phenotypic assessments and global gene expression profiles showed a significant disruption of homeostasis in copepodid L. salmonis exposed to cypermethrin. Multiple degradative enzymes were overexpressed in cypermethrin-treated lice including five trypsin-like serine proteases and three cytochrome p450s CYP3a24 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, fold change (FC)\u00a0=\u00a03.8; GenBank accession no.

These enzymes represent preliminary markers for understanding the physiological response of L. salmonis to cypermethrin exposure. A general stress response was also observed in cypermethrin-treated lice which included differential expression of cell signaling genes involved in the induction of cell growth, solute transport, and metabolism. Lastly, a consensus-based analysis was completed with two previously published L. salmonis transcriptome studies revealing genes that respond to cypermethrin, emamectin benzoate (another delousing agent) and hyposalinity. This included concordant differential expression of heat shock beta-1, ammonium transporter Rh types B, and 72\u00a0kDa type IV collagenase across different L. salmonis studies.

For intra-cluster relationships, we applied mathematical optimisation to enhance the tree search produced by the neighbour joining method (NJ) and compared it with maximum likelihood (ML) method. To infer inter-clusters relationships, we used Needleman\u2013Wunsch analysis (NW), HHsearch, ancestral sequence reconstruction and phylogenetic network analysis. Using this workflow, we were able to identify key evolutionary events in the rhodopsin-like family receptors.

SOG (somatostatin, opioid, galanin) receptors formed the most ancient members of the \u03b3 group.

     "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to characterize the pattern of gene expression at the last stage of ovarian maturation in Chlamys farreri. Dynamic transcriptomic analysis of ovaries was performed at four time points prior to ovulation, using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 174,928 unigenes were obtained, among which 42,534 were annotated according to bioinformatics databases, such as NT, NR, Swiss-Prot, KOG, GO, and KEGG. Results from the transcriptome analysis revealed a time-dependent pattern of global transcriptional responses. When compared to the 0 d library, 99, 152, and 3248 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained in the 3, 10, and 21 d libraries, respectively. Those three libraries shared only 10 DEGs, the majority of which were time-specific. Pairwise comparisons of each profile demonstrated that DEGs were related to hormone metabolism and receptors, cell division, gametogenesis, and vitellogenesis pathways. Notably, when adjacent sampling time point groups were compared, the only DEG throughout the experimental period was related to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. The present study provides the first dynamic transcriptomic analysis of C. farreri for evaluation of the molecular basis of gonadal maturation.",

A detailed analysis identified the differentially expressed transcripts included some olfactory receptors (OR, TAAR and V2R-like) and transcripts related with the control of reproduction such as the brain aromatase cytochrome P450 and tachykinin-3. Also a wide set of genes related with lipid sensing, metabolism and transport were differentially expressed and these transcripts were often down-regulated in cultured fish. Furthermore, cultured males presented a higher expression of genes related with goblet cells and mucin production that modulates innate and adaptive immune responses. All these changes in gene expression could be explained by different nutritional status and diet preference. The different expression of transcripts related to olfaction, reproduction, nutrient sensing and immune system demonstrate distinct differences in functionalities between cultured and wild soles providing new clues about the sexual dysfunction in this species.",

     "abstract": "Many migratory traits are heritable, but there is a paucity of evidence identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation in alternative migratory tactics, or in linking variation in gene expression to migratory behaviors. To that end, we examined differential gene expression in the brain transcriptome between young steelhead trout that had undergone the smoltification process, and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from Sashin Creek, Alaska. Samples were sequenced from two time points: immediately before (at 20\u00a0months of age) and during (2\u00a0years of age) the presumed peak of smoltification. Smolt and resident individuals came from two genetic crosses, one where both parents were migratory, and another where both parents were residents. A total of 533 (1.9%) genes were differentially expressed between crosses, or between smolt and resident samples. These genes include some candidate migratory genes (such as POMC), as well as genes with no previous known involvement in the migratory process. Progeny from resident parents showed more upregulated genes than progeny from migrant parents at both time points. Pathway analysis showed enrichment in 227 biological pathways between cross type, and 171 biological pathways were enriched between residents and smolts. Enriched pathways had connections to many biofunctions, and most were only enriched in one contrast. However, pathways connected to phototransduction were enriched between both cross type and migratory tactics in 11 out of 12 contrasts, suggesting there are fundamental differences in how smolts and residents process light in the brain. The genes and pathways described herein constitute an a priori candidate list for future studies of migration in other populations of O. mykiss, and other migratory species.",

     "abstract": "Aphis gossypii is one of the most economically important insect pests for agriculture worldwide. Aphids have developed symbiotic associations with bacterial species, which has led to morphological and molecular differences, such as body color and insecticide resistance. Adults and 3rd instar nymphs of a laboratory-selected spirotetramat-resistant strain of cotton aphid presented 579-fold and 15-fold higher resistance to spirotetramat, respectively, than a susceptible strain (Pan et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016). In this study, we found that antibiotics, especially ampicillin and tetracycline, increased spirotetramat toxicity in resistant aphids. We also characterized all of the bacterial endosymbionts in these two clones by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes of the endosymbiont. The total reads could be clustered into 3534 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that showed 97% similarity and belonged to six abundant phyla. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes dominated in the two strains, and the most abundant families were Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Rhodobiaceae. The genera Arsenophonus, Anderseniella, Buchnera and Lactobacillus were most abundant in the susceptible strain, whereas a significant decrease in abundance of Anderseniella and a great increase in abundance of Arsenophonus and Lactobacillus were observed in the resistant strain. Certain identified species had low sequence similarity to the reported species, which indicates the possibility of novel taxa. The type and abundance of different bacterial groups varied significantly between the two strains. The insecticide selection pressure could be the reason for the observed shift in the bacteria groups. These results increase our understanding of the symbiotic relationships between bacteria and their hosts under insecticide stress and provide clues for the development of potential control techniques against this cotton aphid.",

Triploidy was induced through the application of heat shock of 28\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min to eggs 10-min post fertilization in an aquarium equipped with a heater. Percentage of skeletal deformity in heat-shocked larvae (2.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0S.E.) was significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) greater than that of the diploids (0.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24). At five days after hatching, proteins of normal and deformed specimens of deyolked larvae were subjected to proteomic analysis using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Among the identified protein spots from diploids, creatine kinase was found to be increased in larvae with skeletal deformities, while apolipoprotein A-I-2, apolipoprotein A-II and calmodulin were found to be decreased in deformed fish. Among the five protein spots that were identified in heat-shocked fish, apolipoprotein A-I-2, apolipoprotein A-II, parvalbumin, myosin light chain 1-1 and nucleoside diphosphate kinase were found to be decreased in deformed larvae. The identification of nine protein spots showing altered expression in deformed fish allows us to reach a preliminary view of the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the development of skeletal malformations in diploid and triploid fish.",

Sequence analysis suggests that these nes transcripts are likely a result of alternative splicing. We next applied a multiple-antigenic peptide strategy to generate a goldfish-specific nestin antibody. Western blotting with this antibody together with mass spectrometry verified the presence of major nestin protein isoforms with differing molecular weights (~\u00a070, 40 and 30\u00a0kDa). We further examined expression patterns of these nestin protein isoforms in different parts of the goldfish brain and pituitary and found the telencephalon to express all three isoforms at a distinct level and abundance. We report that multiple nestin isoforms are present indicating another level of complexity for the regulation of intermediate filaments in comparison to mammals. Studying the differential roles and regulation of these nestins could lead to a better understanding of cellular remodeling during neurogenesis and the unparalleled regenerative abilities after damage in the teleost CNS.",

Consistent with data derived from comparison of nucleotide sequences of mitochrondrial and nuclear genes, cladistic analyses based upon the primary structures of the host-defense peptides provide support for an evolutionary scenario in which X. ruwenzoriensis arose from an allopolyploidization event involving an octoploid ancestor of the present-day frogs belonging to the Xenopus amieti species group and a tetraploid ancestor of Xenopus pygmaeus.",

     "abstract": "The state of metabolic dormancy has fascinated people for hundreds of years, leading to research exploring the identity of natural molecular components that may induce and maintain this state. Many animals lower their metabolism in response to high temperatures and/or arid conditions, a phenomenon called aestivation. The biological significance for this is clear; by strongly suppressing metabolic rate to low levels, animals minimize their exposure to stressful conditions. Understanding blood or hemolymph metabolite changes that occur between active and aestivated animals can provide valuable insights relating to those molecular components that regulate hypometabolism in animals, and how they afford adaptation to their different environmental conditions. In this study, we have investigated the hemolymph metabolite composition from the land snail Theba pisana, a remarkably resilient mollusc that displays an annual aestivation period. Using LC-MS-based metabolomics analysis, we have identified those hemolymph metabolites that show significant changes in relative abundance between active and aestivated states. We show that certain metabolites, including some phospholipids [e.g. LysoPC(14:0)], and amino acids such as l-arginine and l-tyrosine, are present at high levels within aestivated snails. Further investigation of our T. pisana RNA-sequencing data elucidated the entire repertoire of phospholipid-synthesis genes in the snail digestive gland, as a precursor towards future comparative investigation between the genetic components of aestivating and non-aestivating species. In summary, we have identified a large number of metabolites that are elevated in the hemolymph of aestivating snails, supporting their role in protecting against heat or desiccation.",

However, prior studies have failed to consider the entire transcriptomic response of the gill \u2013 the primary organ responsible for ion transport \u2013 to changing salinity. Moreover, the molecular genetic differences between non-osmoregulatory and osmoregulatory gill types, as well as the hormonal basis of osmoregulation, remain underexplored. Here, we identified and characterized differentially expressed genes (DEGs) via RNA-Seq in anterior (non-osmoregulatory) and posterior (osmoregulatory) gills during high to low salinity transfer in the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, a well-studied model for crustacean osmoregulation. Overall, we confirmed previous expression patterns for individual ion transport genes and identified novel ones with salinity-mediated expression. Notable, novel DEGs among salinities and gill types for C. sapidus included anterior gills having higher expression of structural genes such as actin and cuticle proteins while posterior gills exhibit elevated expression of ion transport and energy-related genes, with the latter likely linked to ion transport. Potential targets among recovered DEGs for hormonal regulation of ion transport between salinities and gill types included neuropeptide Y and a KCTD16-like protein. Using publically available sequence data, constituents for a \u201ccore\u201d gill transcriptome among decapods are presented, comprising genes involved in ion transport and energy conversion and consistent with salinity transfer experiments.

Homologous transcripts were discovered for one circadian clock input gene, five core genes, 22 accessory genes, and two possible output pathways. Alignments and functional domain analyses showed generally high conservation between the putative L. polyphemus clock genes and homologs from Drosophila melanogaster and Daphnia pulex.

RNA-seq identified differentially expressed stress responsive transcripts upon thermal stress in the gill tissues of C. gigas. The primary effect of heat stress appears to be significantly induced transcription of molecular chaperones, including members of the heat shock protein (hsp) families, while genes typically associated with protein metabolism, such as those involved in protein degradation (e.g. ATP-dependent proteolysis pathway) and biosynthesis (e.g. ribosomal protein genes), were repressed. In particular, several hsp70 isoforms and a small hsp20 maintained prolonged mRNA expressions for 72\u00a0h.

A total of 3920 proteins were identified from the intestine of sea cucumber. Among them, 630 proteins showed significant differential expression when comparing three conditions of sea cucumbers: non-aestivating (active), deep-aestivation (at least 15\u00a0days of continuous aestivation), and arousal after aestivation (renewed moving and feeding). Sea cucumbers in deep aestivation showed substantial differentially expressed proteins (143 up-regulated and 267 down-regulated proteins compared with non-aestivating controls). These differentially expressed proteins suggested that protein and phospholipid probably are major fuel sources during hypometabolism and a general attenuation of carbohydrate metabolism was observed during deep aestivation. Differentially expressed proteins also provided the first global picture of a shift in protein synthesis, protein folding, DNA binding, apoptosis, cellular transport and signaling, and cytoskeletal proteins during deep aestivation in sea cucumbers. A comparison of arousal from aestivation with deep aestivation, revealed a general reversal of the changes that occurred in aestivation for most proteins. Western blot detection further validated the significant up-regulation of HSP70 and down-regulation of methyltransferase-like protein 7A-like in deep-aestivation. Our results suggest that there is substantial post-transcriptional regulation of proteins during the aestivation-arousal cycle in sea cucumbers.",

Male zebrafish in both treatments of chlorothalonil showed a decrease in liversomatic index. A commercial D. rerio microarray (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a044\u00a0K) was used to determine gene expression profiles in male zebrafish liver following a 96\u00a0h toxicological assay.

     "abstract": "Rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) is a widely used experimental fish in risk assessments of aquatic pollutants in China. Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most toxic heavy metals in the world; however, few studies have used fish gills, a multi-functional organ. In this study, we characterized the differential expression of adult female rare minnow gills after sub-chronic waterborne Cd (75\u00a0\u03bcg/L CdCl2) exposure for 35\u00a0d. A total of 452 genes (209 up-regulated and 243 down-regulated) were identified by gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq before and after treatment. Of these differentially expressed genes, 75, 21, and 54 differentially expressed genes are related to ion transport, oxidation-reduction processes, and the immune response, respectively. The results of GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, together with the altered transcript levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules and the significant increases in the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL1\u03b2) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), indicated a disruption of the immune system, particularly the induction of inflammation and autoimmunity. The significant down-regulation of coagulation factor XIII A1 polypeptide (F13A1), tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21), and Golgi-associated plant pathogenesis-related protein (GAPr) during both acute (\u2264\u00a096\u00a0h) and sub-chronic (35\u00a0d) waterborne Cd exposure, as well as their dosage dependence, suggested that these three genes could be used as sensitive biomarkers for aquatic Cd risk assessment.",

This study investigated whether fish with high body burden levels of PFASs in the Twin Cities Metro Areas showed any evidence of adverse effects at the level of the transcriptome. We hypothesized that fish with higher body burden levels of PFASs would exhibit molecular responses in the liver and testis that were suggestive of oxidative and general stress, as well as impaired reproduction. Concentrations of PFASs in largemouth bass varied significantly across the sampled lakes, with the lowest concentrations of PFASs found in fish from Steiger and Upper Prior Lakes and the highest concentrations found in fish from Calhoun and Twin Lakes. Largemouth bass with high PFAS concentrations exhibited changes in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, energy production, RNA processing, protein production/degradation and contaminant detoxification, all of which are consistent with biomarker responses observed in other studies with PFASs. However, given the wide range of genes that were differentially expressed across the lakes and the variability observed in the mechanisms through which biological processes were affected, it is unlikely that PFASs are the only stressors affecting largemouth bass in the Twin Cities Metro Areas lakes. Indeed, Twin Lake is affected by the Joslyn superfund site which contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pentachlorophenol, polychlorinated biphenyls, and dioxins. These compounds are also expected to drive the transcriptomics responses observed, but to what degree is difficult to ascertain at this time.",

This study assessed reproductive endpoints in Florida largemouth bass (LMB) (Micropterus salmoides floridanus) after placement into experimental ponds adjacent to Lake Apopka. LMB collected from a clean reference site (DeLeon Springs) were stocked at two periods of time into ponds constructed in former farm fields on the north shore of the lake. LMB were stocked during early and late oogenesis to determine if there were different effects of contamination on LMB that may be attributed to their reproductive stage. LMB inhabiting the ponds for ~\u00a04\u00a0months had anywhere from 2 to 800 times higher contaminant load for a number of organochlorine pesticides (e.g. p, p\u2032-DDE, methoxychlor) compared to control animals. Gonadosomatic index and plasma vitellogenin were not different between reproductively-stage matched LMB collected at reference sites compared to those inhabiting the ponds. However, plasma 17\u03b2-estradiol was lower in LMB inhabiting the Apopka ponds compared to ovary stage-matched LMB from the St. Johns River, a site used as a reference site. Sub-network enrichment analysis revealed that genes related to reproduction (granulosa function, oocyte development), endocrine function (steroid metabolism, hormone biosynthesis), and immune function (T cell suppression, leukocyte accumulation) were differentially expressed in the ovaries of LMB placed into the ponds. These data suggest that (1) LMB inhabiting the Apopka ponds showed disrupted reproduction and immune responses and that (2) gene expression profiles provided site-specific information by discriminating LMB from different macro-habitats.",

     "abstract": "Characterizing factors that contribute to transcript variability is necessary before molecular endpoints are widely adopted as biomarkers for environmental monitoring programs and risk assessment. Here, we employed a meta-analysis approach to understand how reproductive stage, breeding strategy, and tissue type influence transcript variability in multiple fish species. Transcript abundance from the scientific literature was examined by method of quantification (qPCR or microarray), and the extracted data were used to calculate the coefficient of variation (CoV) for each transcript. Based on qPCR data, variability in the abundance of estrogen receptor 1 and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3b was dependent upon reproductive stage and/or breeding strategy in the female ovaries. The variability of other transcripts in the steroid biosynthesis pathway as well as other steroid receptors did not depend upon sex, breeding strategy, or reproductive stage. Variability estimates were used to determine sample size requirements for detecting specific critical effects in molecular endpoints. It was estimated that only 37.8% of published studies used in the qPCR meta-analysis had sufficient experimental power (0.8) to detect a 2-fold expression difference in a transcript. To build upon these analyses, microarray data were used to measure overall variability of the transcriptome, and it was determined that the vitellogenic reproductive stage had the lowest transcriptomic variability compared to other reproductive stages. This variability was lower in a single-spawning species (largemouth bass) compared to a multiple-spawner (fathead minnow). Following this, a meta-analysis of 777 microarrays for multiple fish species was performed to determine the influence of breeding strategy and tissue type on transcriptomic variability. In this analysis, single-spawning fish showed lower gonadal and hepatic transcriptome variability compared to multiple-spawning species. Thus, these species may be more appropriate for sampling molecular endpoints in monitoring programs. Transcript variability was lowest in the brain, followed by the gonads and liver, which may reflect fewer morphological changes relative to these tissues. The results of this study should be used in conjunction with other experimental and sampling recommendations to optimize the use of molecular endpoints in regulatory ecotoxicology and environmental monitoring programs.",

     "abstract": "The diverse biological effects of xenoestrogens may be explained by their ability to differentially recruit co-regulatory proteins to the estrogen receptor (ER). We employed high-throughput receptor affinity binding and co-regulatory protein recruitment screening assays based on fluorescence polarization and time resolved florescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET), respectively, to assess xenoestrogen-specific binding and co-regulatory protein recruitment to the ER. Then we used a functional proteomic assay based on co-immunoprecipitation of ER-bound proteins to isolate and identify intact co-regulatory proteins recruited to a ligand-activated ER. Through these approaches, we revealed differential binding affinity of bisphenol-A (BPA) and genistein (GEN) to the human ER\u03b1 (ESR1) and ligand-dependent recruitment of SRC-1 and SRC-3 peptides. Recruitment profiles were variable for each ligand and in some cases were distinct compared to 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2). For example, E2 and GEN recruited both SRC-1 and -3 peptides whereas BPA recruited only SRC-1 peptides. Results of the functional proteomic assay showed differential recruitment between ligands where E2 recruited the greatest number of proteins followed by BPA then GEN. A number of proteins share previously identified relationships with ESR1 as determined by STRING analysis. Although there was limited overlap in proteins identified between treatments, all ligands recruited proteins involved in cell growth as determined by subnetwork enrichment analysis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A comparative, in silico analysis revealed that fewer interactions exist between zebrafish (Danio rerio) esr1 and zebrafish orthologs of proteins identified in our functional proteomic analysis. Taken together these results identify recruitment of known and previously unknown co-regulatory proteins to ESR1 and highlight new methods to assay recruitment of low abundant and intact, endogenous co-regulatory proteins to ESR1 or other nuclear receptors, in both human and aquatic species.",

The core biological functions of plasma proteins that were common to both sampling years for males and females from each location were also estimated separately (based on Ingenuity's Knowledge Base). PCA revealed site-specific differences in the functional characteristics of the plasma proteome from white sucker sampled from downstream of oil sands extraction facilities compared with fish from upstream. Plasma proteins that were unique to fish downstream of oil sands extraction were related to lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, vitamin and mineral metabolism, endocrine system disorders, skeletal and muscular development and function, neoplasia, carcinomas, and gastrointestinal disease.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we sought to identify candidate markers of exposure to anti-androgens by analyzing endogenous metabolite profiles in the urine of male fathead minnows (mFHM, Pimephales promelas). Based on earlier work, we hypothesized that unidentified lipids in the urine of mFHM were selectively responsive to exposure to androgen receptor antagonists, which is otherwise difficult to confirm using established fish toxicity assays. A second goal was to evaluate the feasibility of non-lethally and repeatedly sampling urine from individual mFHMs over the time course of response to a chemical exposure. Accordingly, we exposed mFHM to the model anti-androgens vinclozolin or flutamide. Urine was collected from each fish at 48\u00a0hour intervals over the course of a 14\u00a0day exposure. Parallel experiments were conducted with mFHM exposed to bisphenol A or control water. The frequent handling/sampling regime did not cause apparent adverse effects on the fish. Endogenous metabolite profiling was conducted with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS), which exhibited lower variation for the urinary metabolome than was found in earlier work with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Specifically, for inter- and intra-individual variations, the median spectrum-wide relative standard deviation (RSD) was 32.6% and 33.3%, respectively, for GC\u2013MS analysis of urine from unexposed mFHM. These results compared favorably with similar measurements of urine from other model species, including the Sprague Dawley rat. In addition, GC\u2013MS allowed us to identify several lipids (e.g., certain saturated fatty acids) in mFHM urine as candidate markers of exposure to androgen receptor antagonists.",

Previously, we determined that hybrid striped bass reared under conditions of chronic hypoxia exhibited reduced feed intake, lower lipid and nutrient retention, and poor growth. To better understand the molecular mechanisms governing these phenotypes, in the present study, we examined the transcriptomic profiles of hepatic tissue in hybrid striped bass exposed to chronic hypoxia (90\u00a0days at 25% oxygen saturation) and acute hypoxia (6\u00a0h at 25% oxygen saturation). Using high-throughput RNA-seq, we found that over 1400 genes were differentially expressed under disparate oxygen conditions, with the vast majority of transcriptional changes occurring in the acute hypoxia treatment. Gene pathway and bioenergetics analyses revealed hypoxia-mediated perturbation of genes and gene networks related to lipid metabolism, cell death, and changes in hepatic mitochondrial content and cellular respiration. This study offers a more comprehensive view of the temporal and tissue-specific transcriptional changes that occur during hypoxia, and reveals new and shared mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in teleosts.",

Here we analyze teleost genome sequences to show that two genes encoding inducible hsp70s (hsp70-1 and hsp70-2) are likely present in all teleost fish. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses indicate that hsp70-1 and hsp70-2 are distinct paralogs that originated prior to the diversification of the teleosts. The promoters of both genes contain a TATA box and conserved heat shock elements (HSEs), but unlike mammalian HSP70s, both genes contain an intron in the 5\u2032 UTR. The hsp70-2 gene has undergone tandem duplication in several species. In addition, many other teleost genome assemblies have multiple copies of hsp70-2 present on separate, small, genomic scaffolds. To verify that these represent poorly assembled tandem duplicates, we cloned the genomic region surrounding hsp70-2 in Fundulus heteroclitus and showed that the hsp70-2 gene copies that are on separate scaffolds in the genome assembly are arranged as tandem duplicates. Real-time quantitative PCR of F. heteroclitus genomic DNA indicates that four copies of the hsp70-2 gene are likely present in the F. heteroclitus genome. Comparison of expression patterns in F. heteroclitus and Gasterosteus aculeatus demonstrates that hsp70-2 has a higher fold increase than hsp70-1 following heat shock in gill but not in muscle tissue, revealing a conserved difference in expression patterns between isoforms and tissues. These data indicate that ecological and toxicological studies using hsp70 as a biomarker in teleosts should take this complexity into account.",

Classically, T4 is 5\u2032-deiodinated to the active hormone, T3, in target tissues which then binds nuclear TH receptors (TRs) and regulates gene transcription. However, it is possible that T4 acts directly on target tissues. Frog metamorphosis is a powerful TR-dependent model for studying TH action. Premetamorphic Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana tadpoles were injected with 0.1\u201350 T3 or 0.5\u2013250\u00a0T4\u00a0pmol/g\u00a0body\u00a0weight to account for their 5-fold difference in biological activity and the mRNA profiles in six tissues from well-characterized TH-responsive genes were evaluated after 48\u00a0h using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. 5\u2032-deiodinase-poor tissues should produce superimposable dose\u2013response curves if T4 does not require conversion to T3. This was the case in lung and tail fin; the latter tissue recapitulating these responses in organ culture. 5\u2032-deiodinase-rich tissues should convert T4 to T3. Because T3 has a higher affinity to TRs, a 5-fold higher T4 dose compared to T3 should produce greater transcript induction. This was observed in the brain and for most intestinal transcripts. However, some gene transcripts in the intestine and all transcripts in the back skin produced superimposable response curves suggesting that a direct mode of T4 action is plausible in these tissues. While the liver showed results consistent with its 5\u2032-deiodinase-poor status, we found evidence of an alternate, non-genomic mechanism for two gene transcripts. Therefore, mechanisms not requiring T4 conversion to T3 may play a far greater role than previously thought.",

Target gene prediction revealed a significant enrichment of functional groups (88 GO terms) and 18 KEGG pathways (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and suggested that there are interactions between sex-biased miRNAs and 25 putative gametogenesis-related targets.

     "abstract": "Transferrins have been identified in animals and green algae, and they consist of a family of evolutionarily related proteins that play a central role in iron transport, immunity, growth and differentiation. This study assessed the transferrin genes among 100 genomes from a wide range of animal and plant kingdoms. The results showed that putative transferrins were widespread in animals, but their gene quantity and type differ greatly between animal groups. Generally, Mammalia possess abundant transferrin genes, whereas Trematoda contain few ones. Melanotransferrin and serotransferrin are widely distributed in vertebrates, while melanotransferrin-like and transferrin-like 1 are frequent in invertebrates. However, only a few plant species detected putative transferrins, and a novel transferrin member was first uncovered in Angiospermae and Pteridophyta. The structural comparison among transferrin family members revealed seven very well-repeated and conserved characteristic motifs, despite a considerable variation in the overall sequences. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that gene duplication, gene loss and horizontal transfer contributed to the diversification of transferrin family members, and their inferred evolutionary scenario was proposed. These findings help to the understanding of transferrin distribution, characteristic motifs and residues, and evolutionary process.",

     "abstract": "Avian migration is an exceptionally high-energy-demanding process, which is met by the accumulation and utilization of fuel stores as well as the alterations in muscle physiology prior to their flight. Pre-migratory fattening coupled with changes in flight muscle metabolic enzymes and proteome is required to provide the necessary fuel and muscle performance required for migration. We studied how the serum metabolites (urea, uric acid, and creatinine), pectoralis muscle metabolites (glycogen, glucose, and cholesterol), muscle metabolic enzymes (CPT, HOAD, CS, MDH, CCO, CK, LDH, PFK, MLPL, and PK), liver lipogenic enzyme (FAS), and pectoralis muscle proteins get altered in pre-migratory and non-migratory buntings. Significantly increased pectoralis muscle fatty acid oxidation (CPT and HOAD activity), aerobic/anaerobic capacity (CS, CCO, and MDH activity), glycolytic capacity (PFK and PK activity), lipolysis (muscle LPL), and burst power (CK activity) were observed prior to the spring migration in pre-migratory buntings, whereas significantly increased pectoralis muscle anaerobic capacity (LDH activity) was observed in non-migratory buntings. Significant increase in the liver FAS showed profound lipogenesis prior to the spring migration. In this study, we have also investigated whether muscle has differential protein content during the pre-migratory and non-migratory phases of the annual migratory cycle. Twenty-nine proteins are identified and well characterized varying in expression significantly during the pre-migratory and non-migratory phases.These findings indicate that significant pre-migratory fattening and alterations in flight (pectoralis) muscle biochemistry and proteome in between the non- and pre-migratory phases may play a significant role in pre-migratory flight muscle preparation in these long-route migrants.",

These hormones are synthesized and released from a pair of molting glands called the Y-organs (YO). Cyclic nucleotide, mTOR, and TGF\u03b2/Smad signaling pathways mediate molt cycle-dependent phase transitions in the YO. To further identify the genes involved in the regulation of molting, a YO transcriptome was generated from three biological replicates of intermolt blackback land crab, Gecarcinus lateralis. Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries generated 227,811,829 100-base pair (bp) paired-end reads; following trimming, 90% of the reads were used for further analyses. The trimmed reads were assembled de novo using Trinity software to generate 288,673 contigs with a mean length of 872\u00a0bp and a median length of 1842\u00a0bp. Redundancy among contig sequences was reduced by CD-HIT-EST, and the output constituted the baseline transcriptome database. Using Bowtie2, 92% to 93% of the reads were mapped back to the transcriptome. Individual contigs were annotated using BLAST, HMMER, TMHMM, SignalP, and Trinotate, resulting in assignments of 20% of the contigs. Functional and pathway annotations were carried out via gene ontology (GO) and KEGG orthology (KO) analyses; 58% and 44% of the contigs with BLASTx hits were assigned to GO and KO terms, respectively. The gene expression profile was similar to a crayfish YO transcriptome database, and the relative abundance of each contig was highly correlated among the three G. lateralis replicates. Signal transduction pathway orthologs were well represented, including those in the mTOR, TGF\u03b2, cyclic nucleotide, MAP kinase, calcium, VEGF, phosphatidylinositol, ErbB, Wnt, Hedgehog, Jak-STAT, and Notch pathways.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are important effectors in regulating gene expression through posttranscriptional mechanisms. They are key elements in the response to hypoxia. The oriental river prawn (Macrobrachium nipponense) is an important commercial aquaculture species, and is sensitive to hypoxia. To date, there are no reports describing M. nipponense miRNAs. In this study, Solexa deep sequencing technology was used for high-throughput analysis of miRNAs in a small RNA library isolated from four M. nipponense tissues (gill, hepatopancreas, muscle and hemocytes). In total, 9,227,356 reads were obtained, 4,293,155 of which were related to 267 unique miRNAs, including 203 conserved and 64 prawn-specific miRNAs. Furthermore, miRNA features including length distribution and end variations were characterized. Annotation of targets revealed a broad range of biological processes and signal transduction pathways regulated by M. nipponense miRNAs. In addition, 880 co-expressed and 39 specific (25 normoxia-specific and 14 hypoxia-specific) miRNAs that may be involved in the response to hypoxia were confirmed using miRNA microarray analysis from the four prawn tissues combined. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of eight miRNAs in the normoxia and hypoxia groups showed good concordance between the sequencing and qPCR data. This study provides the first large-scale identification and characterization of M. nipponense miRNAs and their potential targets, and represents a foundation for further characterization of their roles in the regulation of the diversity of hypoxia processes.",

Larval development, especially metamorphosis, influences the natural population and industrial breeding. However, there are few studies on the early development of R. venosa, and our understanding is further limited by a lack of genomic information. In this study, de novo sequencing was performed to obtain a comprehensive transcriptome profile during early development. A Hi-seq 2500 sequencing run produced 148,737,902 raw reads that were assembled into 1,137,556 unigenes (average length of 619 nucleotides, of which 49,673 could be annotated). The unigenes were assigned to biological processes and functions after annotation in Gene Ontology, eukaryotic Ortholog Groups and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We also identified 93,196 simple sequence repeats among the unigenes. Six unique sequences associated with neuroendocrine function were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our data represent the first comprehensive transcriptomic resource for R. venosa. Functional annotation of the unigenes involved in various biological processes could stimulate research on the mechanisms of early development in this species. Understanding the mechanism of early development and metamorphosis would benefit antifouling research and aquaculture of R. venosa.",

     "abstract": "Environmental temperature modulates thyroid hormone (TH)-dependent metamorphosis in some amphibian species. The North American bullfrog - Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana - tadpole is naturally adapted to a wide range of temperatures over multiple seasons. Cold temperatures delay while warmer temperatures accelerate metamorphosis. Exogenous TH exposure of premetamorphic tadpoles results in a rapid precocious induction of metamorphosis at warm temperatures (20-25\u00b0C). The same exposure at cold temperatures (4-5\u00b0C) does not elicit an overt metamorphic response. However, a molecular memory of TH exposure is established such that cold, TH-exposed tadpoles returned to permissive warm temperatures will rapidly execute TH-induced genetic programs. Previous mRNA profiling has identified TH-regulated transcription factors encoded by thra, thrb, thibz, klf9, and cebp1 as components of the molecular memory after one week post-exposure. However, a further hierarchy may exist within the initiation phase since many gene transcripts demonstrated tissue-specific patterns. Whether the molecular memory is organ autonomous or requires additional modulating factors is unknown. Herein we examine tail fin and back skin and determine that thibz is the only transcript that is TH-responsive after 2 days post-exposure at low temperature in both tissues in the intact animal. In back skin, cebp1 is also TH-responsive under these conditions. Serum-free tail fin organ culture (C-Fin) reveals that the thibz response is organ autonomous whereas cultured back skin (C-Skin) results suggest that thibz and cebp1 require an additional factor for induction from elsewhere within the intact animal. Subsequent investigations are now possible to identify endogenous factors that modulate the molecular memory in intact animals.",

     "abstract": "Thecosome pteropods, a group of calcifying holoplanktonic mollusks, have recently become a research focus due to their potential sensitivity to increased levels of anthropogenic dissolved CO2 in seawater and the accompanying ocean acidification. Some populations, however, already experience high CO2 in their natural distribution during diel vertical migrations. To achieve a better understanding of the mechanisms of pteropod calcification and physiological response to this sort of short duration CO2 exposure, we characterized the gene complement of Clio pyramidata, a cosmopolitan diel migratory thecosome, and investigated its transcriptomic response to experimentally manipulated CO2 conditions. Individuals were sampled from the Northwest Atlantic in the fall of 2011 and exposed to ambient conditions (~\u00a0380\u00a0ppm) and elevated CO2 (~\u00a0800\u00a0ppm, similar to levels experienced during a diel vertical migration) for ~\u00a010\u00a0h. Following this exposure the respiration rate of the individuals was measured. We then performed RNA-seq analysis, assembled the C. pyramidata transcriptome de novo, annotated the genes, and assessed the differential gene expression patterns in response to exposure to elevated CO2. Within the transcriptome, we identified homologs of genes with known roles in biomineralization in other mollusks, including perlucin, calmodulin, dermatopontin, calponin, and chitin synthases. Respiration rate was not affected by short-term exposure to CO2. Gene expression varied greatly among individuals, and comparison between treatments indicated that C. pyramidata down-regulated a small number of genes associated with aerobic metabolism and up-regulated genes that may be associated with biomineralization, particularly collagens and C-type lectins. These results provide initial insight into the effects of short term CO2 exposure on these important planktonic open-ocean calcifiers, pairing respiration rate and the gene expression level of response, and reveal candidate genes for future ecophysiological, biomaterial and phylogenetic studies.",

     "abstract": "The European eel Anguilla anguilla has a complex life cycle that includes freshwater, seawater and morphologically distinct stages as well as two extreme long distance migrations. Eels do not feed as they migrate across the Atlantic to the Sargasso Sea but nevertheless reach sexual maturity before spawning. It is not yet clear how existing energy stores are used to reach the appropriate developmental state for reproduction. Since the liver is involved in energy metabolism, protein biosynthesis and endocrine regulation it is expected to play a key role in the regulation of reproductive development. We therefore used microarrays to identify genes that may be involved in this process. Using this approach, we identified 231 genes that were expressed at higher and 111 genes that were expressed at lower levels in sexually mature compared with immature males. The up-regulated set includes genes involved in lipid metabolism, fatty acid synthesis and transport, mitochondrial function, steroid transport and bile acid metabolism. Several genes with putative enzyme functions were also expressed at higher levels at sexual maturity while genes involved in immune system processes and protein biosynthesis tended to be down-regulated at this stage. By using a high-throughput approach, we have identified a subset of genes that may be linked with the mobilization of energy stores for sexual maturation and migration. These results contribute to an improved understanding of eel reproductive biology and provide insight into the role of the liver in other teleosts with a long distance spawning migrations.",

     "abstract": "The production of carnivorous fish such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is dependent on the availability of high quality proteins for feed formulations. For a number of nutritional, strategic and economic reasons, the use of plant proteins has steadily increased over the years, however a major limitation is associated with the presence of anti-nutritional factors and the nutritional profile of the protein concentrate. Investigating novel raw materials involves understanding the physiological consequences associated with the dietary inclusion of protein concentrates. The primary aim of the present study was to assess the metabolic response of salmon to increasing inclusion of air-classified faba bean protein concentrate (BPC) in feeds as a replacement for soy protein concentrate (SPC). Specifically, we tested treatments with identical contents of fishmeal (222.4\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01) and progressively higher inclusion of BPC (0\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01, 111.8\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01, 223.6\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01, 335.4\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01, 447.2\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01) substituting SPC. This study demonstrated a dose-dependent metabolic response to a plant ingredient and was the first to compare the nutrigenomic transcriptional responses after substitution of terrestrial feed ingredients such as BPC and SPC without withdrawal of marine ingredients. It was found that after eight weeks a major physiological response in liver was only evident above 335.4\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01 BPC and included decreased expression of metabolic pathways, and increased expression of genes regulating transcription and translation processes and the innate immune response. Furthermore, we showed that the nutritional stress caused by BPC resembled, at least at hepatic transcriptional level, that caused by soybean meal (included as a positive control in our experimental design). The outcomes of the present study suggested that Atlantic salmon parr might efficiently utilize moderate substitution of dietary SPC with BPC, with the optimum inclusion level being around 120\u00a0g\u00a0kg-\u00a01in the type of feeds tested here.",

     "abstract": "It is commonly known that the nature of the diet has diverse consequences on larval performance and longevity, however it is still unclear which genes have critical impacts on bivalve development and which pathways are of particular importance in their vulnerability or resistance. First we show that a diet deficient in essential fatty acid (EFA) produces higher larval mortality rates, a reduced shell growth, and lower postlarval performance, all of which are positively correlated with a decline in arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids levels, two EFAs known as eicosanoid precursors. Eicosanoids affect the cell inflammatory reactions and are synthesized from long-chain EFAs. Second, we show for the first time that a deficiency in eicosanoid precursors is associated with a network of 29 genes. Their differential regulation can lead to slower growth and higher mortality of Mytilus edulis larvae. Some of these genes are specific to bivalves and others are implicated at the same time in lipid metabolism and defense. Several genes are expressed only during pre-metamorphosis where they are essential for muscle or neurone development and biomineralization, but only in stress-induced larvae. Finally, we discuss how our networks of differentially expressed genes might dynamically alter the development of marine bivalves, especially under dietary influence.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrial (mt) genome is a significant tool for investigating the evolutionary history of metazoan animals. The family Arcidae belongs to the superfamily Arcacea in the bivalve order Arcoida, comprising about 260 species. Currently, three complete mitochondrial genomes are available in GenBank, representing 1 subfamily and 2 genera. Here we present the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Anadara vellicata (Bivalvia: Arcidae), the first report of complete mitogenome from Anadara, Arcidae, and compared its sequence with other available Arcidae mitogenomes. The A. vellicata mitogenome is 34,147\u00a0bp in length, including 12 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 25 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), 2 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes and non-coding regions (NCR) (20,722\u00a0bp). The nucleotide composition of the genome is A\u00a0+\u00a0T biased, accounting for 61.03%, with negative AT skew (\u2212\u00a00.12) and positive GC skew (0.41). We report the evidence of alloacceptor tRNA gene recruitment (trnY-trnL2). A conserved 23\u00a0bp-long sequence was used as the basis to infer the 3\u2032 terminus of rrnS. Most of the non-coding sequences (16,112\u00a0bp) are observed within one segment. In the NCR, the tandem repeat (TR) region is 1143\u00a0bp, comprising six tandem repeats with 189\u00a0bp to 192\u00a0bp in length.

The gene order and transcriptional polarity of the protein-coding genes is identical to other Arcidae species. tRNA genes are rearranged, making the gene order unique. The results support that mt gene arrangement among Arcidae species is not random, but correlated with their evolutionary relationships.",

     "abstract": "miRNA clusters define a group of related miRNAs closely localized in the genome with an evolution that remains poorly understood. The miR-302/367 cluster represents a single polycistronic transcript that produces five precursor miRNAs. The cluster is highly expressed and essential for maintenance of human embryonic stem cells. We found the cluster to be highly conserved and present in most mammals. In primates, seed sequence and miRNA structure are conserved, but inter-precursor sequences are evolving. Insertions of new miRNAs, deletions of individual miRNAs, and a cluster duplication observed in different species suggest an actively evolving cluster. Core transcriptional machinery consisting of NANOG and OCT-4 transcription factors that define stem cells are present upstream of the miR-302/367 cluster. Interestingly, we found the miR-302/367 cluster flanking region to be enriched as a target site of other miRNAs suggesting a mechanism for feedback control. Analysis of miR-302 and miR-367 targets demonstrated concordance of gene set enrichment groups at high gene ontology levels. This cluster also expresses isomiRs providing another means of establishing sequence diversity. Finally, using three different kidney tumor datasets, we observed consistent expression of miR-302 family members in normal tissue while adjacent tumor tissue showed a significant lack of expression. Clustering expression levels of miR-302 validated target genes showed a significant correlation between miR-302/367 cluster miRNAs and a subset of validated gene targets in healthy and adjacent tumor tissues. Taken together, our data show a highly conserved and still evolving miRNA cluster that may have additional unrecognized functions.",

Such change in environment involves lung maturation in preparation for breathing air. However, little is known regarding the underlying molecular events and the role of THs in this process. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated Rana (Lithobates) catesbeiana lung mRNA transcripts representing key elements of TH and oxidative stress signaling pathways during natural and TH-induced precocious metamorphosis. TH induction was evaluated in two ways: 1) in vivo through interperitoneal injection of 10\u00a0pmol/g body weight of 3,3\u2032, 5-triiodothyronine (T3) into premetamorphic tadpoles and analysis after 48\u00a0h, and 2) in serum-free organ culture in the presence of 10\u00a0nM T3 after 48\u00a0h. Abundance of transcripts encoding the transcriptional regulators TH receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2, TH-induced bZip protein, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein 1 was increased during postembryonic development and following administration of exogenous THs to premetamorphic tadpoles in vivo and culture. In contrast, mRNA representing Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 9 and cold-inducible RNA binding protein revealed differential effects between natural and precocious metamorphosis. Elevated levels of catalase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase mRNA were observed at the end of metamorphosis with transcript levels displaying minimal TH-dependency. No change in stress-responsive heat shock protein 30 mRNA abundance was noted. The results support a role for TH-dependent reprogramming of the lung transcriptome during frog development and reveal a requirement for increased antioxidant capacity following anuran metamorphosis.",

Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) was used as the model species. The nutritional stress was induced by inclusion of dietary defatted soybean meal (SBM), as this ingredient had been previously demonstrated to induce enteropathy in the distal intestine and reduce growth in salmon. Triplicate groups of Atlantic salmon were fed concentrations of 0, 100, 200 and 300\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 SBM for 12\u00a0weeks and reduced growth performance was used as the indicator of nutritional stress. The transcriptome was analyzed in two tissues, liver and distal intestine, with the hypothesis being that the liver transcriptome would be characterized by gene expression responses related to overall growth and health performance, whereas intestinal gene expression would be dominated by specific responses to SBM. A set of 133 genes was differentially expressed in liver including 44 genes in common with the intestinal response. The liver-specific response included up-regulation of genes involved in protein digestion, energy metabolism and immune functions, whereas genes in other metabolic pathways were generally anabolic and down-regulated. These responses may be more related to general nutritional stress than to SBM per se. The transcriptomic profile in the distal intestine was consistent with the enteritis response as described previously. This study provides a comprehensive report on the profiles of liver and distal intestine transcriptomes, specifically highlighting the role of the liver in fish undergoing SBM-induced nutritional stress.",

Considering numbers of sequences and enzymes involved in the pathways, particularly attention was paid to genes potentially involved in xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism. With regard to xenobiotics metabolism, various xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as oxidases, dehydrogenases, and transferases were obtained from the annotated transcripts.

Aiming to investigate the transcriptome profiling of gonads induced by MT and to understand the molecular mechanism by which MT causes adverse effects in fish, transcriptome profiling of gonads, gonadal histology and the sex steroid hormones in response to MT were analyzed in Gobiocypris rarus. Eight libraries, 4 from the ovary and 4 from the testis, were constructed and sequenced and then a total number of clean reads per sample ranging from 7.03 to 9.99 million were obtained. In females, a total of 191 transcripts were differentially regulated by MT, consisting of 102 up-regulated transcripts and 89 down-regulated transcripts. In males, 268 differentially expressed genes with 108 up-regulated and 160 down-regulated were detected upon MT exposure. Testosterone serves as the major sex steroid hormone content in G. rarus of both sexes. The concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol, testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone were significantly increased in females and decreased in males after MT exposure. Interestingly, MT caused a decreased number of vitellogenic oocytes in the ovary and spermatozoa in the testis. After MT exposure, four differentially expressed genes (ndufa4, slc1a3a, caskin-2 and rpt3) were found in G. rarus of both sexes. Overall, we suggest that MT seemed to affect genes involved in pathways related to physiological processes in the gonads of G. rarus. These processes include the electron transfer of Complex IV, endothelial cell activation, axon growth and guidance, and proteasome assembly and glutamate transport metabolic.",

Obtaining olfactory genes is a research priority for investigating the olfactory system in this species. However, no olfaction sequence information is available for C. sinica. Consequently, we sequenced female- and male-antennae transcriptome of C. sinica. Many candidate chemosensory genes were identified, including 12 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 19 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 37 odorant receptors (ORs), and 64 ionotropic receptors from C. sinica. The expression patterns of 12 OBPs, 19 CSPs and 37 ORs were determined by RT-PCR, and demonstrated antennae-dominantly expression of most OBP and OR genes.

RTKs are not only key regulators of normal cellular processes, but are also involved in the progression of many types of tumors, and responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Catfish is a primary aquaculture species in the United States, while its industry is drastically hindered by several major diseases including enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC) that is caused by Edwardsiella ictaluri. Disease outbreaks are often accompanied by hypoxic stress, which affects the performance and survival of fish by reducing disease resistance. In this study, we identified 26 RTK oncogenes in the channel catfish genome, and determined their expression profiles after ESC infection and hypoxic stress. The 26 RTK genes were divided into four subfamilies according to phylogenetic analysis, including TIE (2 genes), ErbB (6 genes), EPH (14 genes), and INSR (4 genes). All identified RTKs possess a similar molecular architecture including ligand-binding domains, a single transmembrane helix and a cytoplasmic region, which suggests that these genes could play conserved biological roles. The expression analysis revealed that eight RTKs were significantly regulated after bacterial infection, with dramatic induction of insulin receptor genes including INSRb, IGF1Ra, and IGF1Rb. Upon hypoxic stress, EPHB3a, EGFR, ErbB4b, and IGF1Rb were expressed at higher levels in the tolerant catfish, while EPHA2a, EPHA2, TIE1 and INSRa were expressed at higher levels in the intolerant catfish. These results suggested the involvement of RTKs in immune responses and hypoxic tolerance.",

     "abstract": "The increased use of plant oil as a dietary supplement with the resultant high dietary lipid loads challenges the lipid transport, metabolism and storage mechanisms in economically important aquaculture species, such as rainbow trout. Fatty acid-binding proteins (Fabp), ubiquitous in tissues highly active in fatty acid metabolism, participate in lipid uptake and transport, and overall lipid homeostasis. In the present study, searches of nucleotide sequence databases identified mRNA transcripts coded by 14 different fatty acid-binding protein (fabp) genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which include the complete minimal suite of seven distinct fabp genes (fabp1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10 and 11) discovered thus far in teleost fishes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that many of these extant fabp genes in rainbow trout exist as duplicates, which putatively arose owing to the teleost-specific whole genome duplication (WGD); three pairs of duplicated fabp genes (fabp2a.1/fabp2a.2, fabp7b.1/fabp7b.2 and fabp10a.1/fabp10a.2) most likely were generated by the salmonid-specific WGD subsequent to the teleost-specific WGD; and fabp3 and fabp6 exist as single copy genes in the rainbow trout genome. Assay of the steady-state levels of fabp gene transcripts by RT-qPCR revealed: (1) steady-state transcript levels differ substantially between fabp genes and, in some instances, by as much as 30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104-fold; (2) some fabp transcripts are widely distributed in many tissues, whereas others are restricted to one or a few tissues; and (3) divergence of regulatory mechanisms that control spatial transcription of duplicated fabp genes in rainbow trout appears related to length of time since their duplication. The suite of fabp genes described here provides the foundation to investigate the role(s) of fatty acid-binding proteins in the uptake, mobilization and storage of fatty acids in cultured fish fed diets differing in lipid content, especially the use of plant oil as a dietary supplement. These nutritional dietary supplements may well lead to high lipid loads with the resultant challenges to lipid homeostasis and, thus, health of cultivated fish which may be mediated by appropriate transcriptional control of fabp genes.",

We used GC\u2013MS metabolomics approach to investigate the biochemical adaptation of Mongolian gerbils from xeric (desert), transition (desert steppe) and mesic (typical steppe) environments. Gerbils in desert population had lower resting metabolic rate (RMR) and total evaporative water loss (TEWL) than mesic population. Serum metabolomics revealed that concentrations of five tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (citrate, cis-aconitate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate and malate) were lower in desert population than mesic population. Gastrocnemius metabolomics and citrate synthase activity analysis showed a lower concentration of citrate and lower citrate synthase activity in desert population. These findings suggest that desert dwelling gerbils decrease RMR and TEWL via down-regulation of aerobic respiration. Gastrocnemius metabolomics also revealed that there were higher concentrations of glucose and glycolytic intermediates, but lower concentrations of lipids, amino acids and urea in desert population than mesic population. This geographic variation in metabolic substrates may enhance metabolic water production per oxygen molecule for desert population while constraining aerobic respiration to reduce RMR and TEWL.",

Illumina sequencing of pooled samples of flounder from contrasting degraded sites and less impacted sites was used to guide our choice of targets for qPCR analysis. 253 transcripts of >\u00a0100\u00a0bp were differentially expressed, with 60% showing strong homology to mostly teleost sequences within the NCBI database. Based on these data, transcripts representing nine genes of interest associated with contaminant exposure, immune response and glucose and glycogen metabolism were examined by qPCR in individual flounder from each site. Statistically significant site-specific differences were observed in expression of all but one gene, although patterns in expression were complex with only one (vitellogenin), demonstrating a west to east gradient consistent with known loadings of municipal sewage effluent. Principal components analysis (PCA) identified relationships among the genes evaluated.

     "abstract": "A thiamethoxam-resistant strain of cotton aphid (ThR) strain displayed a 19.35-fold greater resistance to thiamethoxam compared to a susceptible cotton aphid (SS) strain. Solexa sequencing technology was used to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cotton aphids in the context of thiamethoxam resistance. A total of 22,569,311 and 21,317,732 clean reads were obtained from the ThR and SS transcriptomes, respectively, and assembled into 35,222 non-redundant (Nr) consensus sequences. The expression of 620 unigenes changed significantly in the ThR libraries compared to the SS strain; 349 genes were up-regulated, and 271 genes were down-regulated (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Expression levels of ribosomal proteins, ATP synthase, cytochrome c oxidase, ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase and esterase were up-regulated significantly in the ThR strain compared to the SS strain. The genes of cuticle proteins, salivary proteins, and fibroin heavy chain decreased dramatically. One nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) \u03b1 subunit was down-regulated in the ThR strain. The expression levels of 10 differentially expressed unigenes were confirmed using real-time RT-PCR, and the observed trends in gene expression matched the Solexa expression profiles. Specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nAChRs that cause amino acid substitution were found from the ThR and SS stains respectively. These data illustrate that genetic changes in nAChR genes and up-regulated ribosomal proteins, ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferase, cytochrome c oxidase, esterase and peroxidase may confer the tolerance of resistant cotton aphids to thiamethoxam.",

In the current study, the impact of exposure to elevated pCO2 condition was investigated in mantle tissue of Crassostrea gigas by an integrated metabolomic and proteomic approach. Analysis of metabolome and proteome revealed that elevated pCO2 could affect energy metabolism in oyster C. gigas, marked by differentially altered ATP, succinate, MDH, PEPCK and ALDH levels. Moreover, the up-regulated calponin-2, tropomyosins and myosin light chains indicated that elevated pCO2 probably caused disturbances in cytoskeleton structure in mantle tissue of oyster C. gigas. This work demonstrated that a combination of proteomics and metabolomics could provide important insights into the effects of OA at molecular levels.",

     "abstract": "In the field of biomineralization, the past decade has been marked by the increasing use of high throughput techniques, i.e. proteomics, for identifying in one shot the protein content of complex macromolecular mixtures extracted from mineralized tissues. Although crowned with success, this approach has been restricted so far to a limited set of key-organisms, such as the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the pearl oyster or the abalone, leaving in the shadow non-model organisms. As a consequence, it is still unknown to what extent the calcifying repertoire varies, from group to group, at high (phylum, class), median (order, family) or low (genus, species) taxonomic rank.The present paper shows the first biochemical and proteomic characterization of the test matrix of the Mediterranean black sea urchin Arbacia lixula (Arbacioida). Our work suggests that the skeletal repertoire of A. lixula exhibits some similarities but also several differences with that of the few sea urchin species (S. purpuratus, Paracentrotus lividus), for which molecular data are already available. The differences may be attributable to the taxonomic position of the species considered: A. lixula belongs to an order \u2013 Arbacioida \u2013 that diverged more than one hundred million years ago from the Camarodonta, which includes the two species S. purpuratus and P. lividus. For the echinoid class, we suggest that large-scale proteomic screening should be performed in order to understand which molecular functions related to calcification are conserved and which ones have been co-opted for biomineralization in particular lineages.",

Osmotic regulation in fish is conducted mainly in the gills, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The mechanisms involved in ion and water transport through the GIT is not well-characterized, with only a few described complexes. Comparing the transcriptome of the anterior and posterior intestinal sections of a freshwater and saltwater adapted fish by deep-sequencing, we examined the salinity adaptation of two tilapia species: the high salinity-tolerant Oreochromis mossambicus (Mozambique tilapia), and the less salinity-tolerant Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia). This comparative analysis revealed high similarity in gene expression response to salinity change between species in the posterior intestine and large differences in the anterior intestine. Furthermore, in the anterior intestine 68 genes were saltwater up-regulated in one species and down-regulated in the other species (47 genes up-regulated in O. niloticus and down-regulated in O. mossambicus, with 21 genes showing the reverse pattern). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed a high proportion of transporter and ion channel function among these genes. The results of this study point to a group of genes that differed in their salinity-dependent regulation pattern in the anterior intestine as potentially having a role in the differential salinity tolerance of these two closely related species.",

BLASTX best hit results indicated that these chemosensory genes were most identical to their respective orthologs from Tribolium castaneum. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed that the T. molitor OBPs and CSPs are closely related to those of T. castaneum. Real-time quantitative PCR assays showed that eight TmolOBP genes were antennae-specific. Of these, TmolOBP5, TmolOBP7 and TmolOBP16 were found to be predominantly expressed in male antennae, while TmolOBP17 was expressed mainly in the legs of males.

     "abstract": "Atlantic salmon Salmo salar undergo months-long inappetence during spawning, but it is not known whether this inappetence is a pathological state or one for which the fish are adapted. Recent work has shown that inappetent whale sharks can exhibit circulating metabolite profiles similar to ketosis known to occur in humans during starvation. In this work, metabolite profiling was used to explore differences in analyte profiles between a cohort of inappetent spawning run Atlantic salmon and captively reared animals that were fed up to and through the time of sampling. The two classes of animals were easily distinguished by their metabolite profiles. The sea-run fish had elevated \u0277-9 fatty acids relative to the domestic feeding animals, while other fatty acid concentrations were reduced. Sugar alcohols were generally elevated in inappetent animals, suggesting potentially novel metabolic responses or pathways in fish that feature these compounds. Compounds expected to indicate a pathological catabolic state were not more abundant in the sea-run fish, suggesting that the animals, while inappetent, were not stressed in an unnatural way. These findings demonstrate the power of discovery-based metabolomics for exploring biochemistry in poorly understood animal models.",

Claudin genes were significantly down-regulated in the intestine at 3\u00a0h post-infection, indicating that pathogens may disrupt the mucosal barrier by suppressing the expression of claudin genes. A total of six claudin genes were significantly regulated in the gill after hypoxia stress.

In this study, the M. chinensis mitochondrial genomic features are analyzed. The genome has 34 genes on the same strand, lacking atp8 and both trnS (trnS1 and trnS2) as compared with the typical gene content of metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The A\u00a0+\u00a0T content of M. chinensis mitochondrial genome is 63.72%, which is slightly lower than that of M. veneriformis (67.59%) and Coelomactra antiquata (64.33% and 64.14% for the samples from Ri Zhao, Shandong Province, and Zhang Zhou, Fujian Province, China, respectively) in the same family. There are 22 NCRs in the M. chinensis mitochondrial genome, accounting for 12.91% of the genome length. The longest NCR (1,075\u00a0bp in length) is located between trnT and trnQ. A TRS (127\u00a0bp\u00a0\u00d7\u00a08.15) accounts for 96.3% (1,035/1,075) of this NCR. The occurrence of TRS in NCR is shared by the two Mactra mitochondrial genomes, but is not found in the two Coelomactra mitochondrial genomes. A phylogenetic tree constructed based on 12 PCGs of 25 bivalve mitochondrial genomes shows that all seven genera (Mactra, Coelomactra, Paphia, Meretrix, Solen, Mytilus, and Crassostrea) constitute monophyletic groups with very high support values. Pairwise genetic distance analyses indicate that the genetic distance of C. antiquata from the two localities is 0.084, which is greater than values between congeneric species, such as those in Mactra, Mytilus, Meretrix, and Crassostrea. The results show that the C. antiquata from the two localities represent cryptic species.",

Dynein, tubulin, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, adenosylhomocysteinase, NKEF-B, brain type creatine kinase, mitochondrial ATP synthase, and valosin containing enzyme represent high abundance proteins in carp spermatozoa. These proteins are functionally related to sperm motility and energy production as well as the protection of sperm against oxidative injury and stress. Moreover, carp spermatozoa are equipped with functionally diverse proteins involved in signal transduction, transcription, translation, protein turnover and transport. About 15% of proteins from carp spermatozoa identified here were also detected in seminal plasma which may be a result of leakage from spermatozoa into seminal plasma, adsorption of seminal plasma proteins on spermatozoa surface, and expression in both spermatozoa and cells secreting seminal plasma proteins. The availability of a catalog of carp sperm proteins provides substantial advances for an understanding of sperm function and for future development of molecular diagnostic tests of carp sperm quality, the evaluation of which is currently limited to certain parameters such as sperm count, morphology and motility or viability.

     "abstract": "Copepods of the genus Tigriopus have been proposed as marine models for investigations of environmental perturbation. One rapidly increasing anthropogenic stressor for intertidal organisms is light pollution. Given the sensitivity of circadian rhythms to exogenous light, the genes/proteins of a Tigriopus circadian pacemaker represent a potential system for investigating the influences of artificial light sources on circadian behavior in an intertidal species. Here, the molecular components of a putative Tigriopus californicus circadian clock were identified using publicly accessible transcriptome data; the recently deduced circadian proteins of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus were used as a reference. Transcripts encoding homologs of all commonly recognized ancestral arthropod core clock proteins were identified (i.e. CLOCK, CRYPTOCHROME 2, CYCLE, PERIOD and TIMELESS), as were ones encoding proteins likely to modulate the core clock (i.e. CASEIN KINASE II, CLOCKWORK ORANGE, DOUBLETIME, PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 1, PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A, SHAGGY, SUPERNUMERARY LIMBS and VRILLE) or to act as inputs to it (i.e. CRYPTOCHROME 1). PAR DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 was the only circadian-associated protein not identified in Tigriopus; it appears absent in Calanus too. These data represent just the third full set of molecular components for a crustacean circadian pacemaker (Daphnia pulex and C. finmarchicus previously), and only the second obtained from transcribed sequences (C. finmarchicus previously). Given Tigriopus' proposed status as a model for investigating the influences of anthropogenic stressors in the marine environment, these data provide the first suite of gene/protein targets for understanding how light pollution may influence circadian physiology and behavior in an intertidal organism.",

Eight mussels brought into captivity from the wild were isolated for 18\u00a0days without a food source. Hemolymph samples were taken prior to, and 9 and 18\u00a0days after the start of the experiment; these samples were analyzed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry.

Fasting resulted in severe metabolite depletion. Captive (but fed) mussels experienced changes similar to (albeit less severe than) fasting mussels, suggesting that mussels may experience nutritional deficiency under common captive conditions. A. plicata responded to food limitation stress by preferentially using energy reserves for maintenance rather than growth. Carbohydrate and energy metabolism exhibited down-regulation in captive, food-limited, and wild mussels. Lipid metabolism was up-regulated in captive/food-limited mussels and unchanged in wild mussels. Amino acid metabolism was up-regulated in wild mussels and down-regulated in captive/food-limited mussels. Nucleotide metabolism was up-regulated in the wild mussels, down-regulated in food-limited mussels, and unchanged in captive mussels.

Lipid class and fatty acid (FA) profiles, histological characterization of intestine, liver and pancreas and expression patterns using RNA-seq were determined. Discriminant analysis results showed that larvae could be clearly differentiated on the basis of their FA profile as a function of the diet supplied until 9\u00a0dph although no difference in growth was observed. RNA-seq analysis showed that larvae fed HTAG activated coordinately the transcription of apolipoproteins (apob, apoa4, apoc2, apoe, and apobec2) and other related transcripts involved in chylomicron formation, likely to facilitate proper lipid absorption and delivery. In contrast, larvae fed LTAG showed higher mRNA levels of several pancreatic enzymes (try1a, try2, cela1, cela3, cela4, chym1, chym2, amy2a and pnlip) and appetite modulators (agrp1) and some intra- and extracellular lipases. Moreover, KEGG analysis also showed that several transcripts related to lipid metabolism and glycolysis were differentially expressed with a higher abundance in larvae fed LTAG diet. All these data suggest that early larvae were able to establish compensatory mechanisms for energy homeostasis regulating key molecules for FA and TAG biosynthesis, FA uptake and intracellular management of TAG and FA to warrant optimal growth rates.",

The PII-SVMP sequence code for RGD-disintegrins and all the expressed PIII-sequences have the ECD adhesive motif. A cDNA sequence coding for an ALT-C homolog was completely sequenced and characterized. Comparative sequence and structural analyses suggested new features that distinguish SVMP classes such as two prolyl endopetidase cleavage sites.

In contrast, PmRacgap1 was more abundantly expressed in gonads than in several non-reproductive tissues (e.g. subcuticular epithelium, hepatopancreas, intestine, pleopods, stomach and thoracic ganglion). The expression levels of PmTmsb and PmRacgap1 in ovaries of wild adult broodstock were significantly greater than those in ovaries of juveniles (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, their expression levels did not vary significantly during ovarian development stages in intact broodstock. However, eyestalk ablation resulted in a significant reduction in PmTmsb expression at stages I and III ovaries (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), although it did not affect PmRacgap1 transcription significantly at these stages. On the other hand, use of polyclonal antibodies derived from recombinant PmTmsb and PmRacgap1 revealed that levels of both proteins decreased at the late stage (IV) of ovarian development. Our results suggested that PmTmsb and PmRacgap1 may act as negative effectors during ovarian development in P. monodon.",

     "abstract": "The primary structures of host-defense peptides have proved useful in elucidating the evolution history of frogs. Peptidomic analysis was used to compare the diversity of host-defense peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from the octoploid frogs, Xenopus vestitus (Kivu clawed frog) and Xenopus wittei (De Witte's clawed frog) in the family Pipidae. Structural characterization demonstrated that the X. vestitus peptides belong to the magainin (3 peptides), peptide glycine\u2013leucine\u2013amide (PGLa; 4 peptides), xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF; 1 peptide), and caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF; 5 peptides) families. The X. wittei peptides comprise magainin (4 peptides), PGLa (1 peptide), XPF (2 peptides), and CPF (7 peptides). In addition, secretions from both species contain caerulein, identical to the peptide from Xenopus laevis, but X. wittei secretions contains the novel peptide [R4K]xenopsin. The variability in the numbers of paralogs in each peptide family indicates a selective silencing of the host-defense peptide genes following the polyploidization events. The primary structures of the peptides provide insight into phylogenetic relationships among the octoploid Xenopus frogs. The data support a sister-group relationship between X. vestitus and Xenopus lenduensis, suggestive of bifurcating speciation after allopolyploidization, whereas X. wittei is more closely related to the Xenopus amieti\u2013Xenopus andrei group suggesting a common tetraploid ancestor. Consistent with previous data, the CPF peptides showed the highest growth inhibitory activity against bacteria with CPF-W6 (GIGSLLAKAAKLAAGLV.NH2) combining high antimicrobial potency against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC\u00a0=\u00a04\u00a0\u03bcM) with relatively low hemolytic activity (LC50\u00a0=\u00a0190\u00a0\u03bcM).",

The proteins were identified by comparing mass spectrometry data with the invertebrate EST database, allowing us to establish the mussel haemolymph serum proteome. Extrapallial protein (EP) precursor represents the most abundant serum protein; astacin and CuZn superoxide dismutase were also detected. Slight contamination from muscle proteins, due to the sampling method, was also found. No differences were observed in the profiles obtained for male and female serum proteins. One aspect of interest was the previously reported finding that alkali-labile phosphate (ALP) from haemolymph serum may be representative of vitellogenin (vtg)-like protein content in the circulatory fluid of molluscs. In our analysis of mussel haemolymph serum, vitellogenin-like proteins were never found. To confirm these data, a typical methyl-tert-butyl-ether (MTBE) extraction, which is specific for vtg-like proteins, was performed, and the results of the electrophoretic analyses were compared with those obtained by acetonic precipitation. The results showed that the electrophoretic profiles are similar and that vtg-like proteins cannot be identified. Moreover, the main phosphoprotein present in female and male extracts is EP protein precursor. In addition, agarose gel electrophoresis demonstrates that high-molecular-weight forms of vtg-like proteins are not detectable.",

Its diets change continually in this period, and a high mortality of larvae also occurs in this period. Since there is a close relationship between diets and digestive enzymes, a comprehensive investigation about the types and expression patterns of all digestive enzyme genes during early development of L. vannamei is of considerable significance for shrimp diets and larvae culture. Using RNA-Seq data, the types and expression characteristics of the digestive enzyme genes were analyzed during five different development stages (embryo, nauplius, zoea, mysis and postlarvae) in L. vannamei. Among the obtained 66,815 unigenes, 296 were annotated as 16 different digestive enzymes including five types of carbohydrase, seven types of peptidase and four types of lipase. Such a diverse suite of enzymes illustrated the capacity of L. vannamei to exploit varied diets to fit their nutritional requirements. The analysis of their dynamic expression patterns during development also indicated the importance of transcriptional regulation to adapt to the diet transition. Our study revealed the diverse and dynamic features of digestive enzymes during early development of L. vannamei. These results would provide support to better understand the physiological changes during diet transition.",

We conducted a global gene expression study using embryos from zebrafish fed a commercial (Lab), an E\u00a0+ or an E\u00a0\u2212 diet. To capture differentially expressed transcripts prior to onset of overt malformations observed in E\u00a0\u2212 embryos at 48\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf), embryos were collected from each group at 36\u00a0hpf. Lab embryos differentially expressed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) 946 transcripts compared with the E\u00a0+ embryos, and 2656 transcripts compared with the E\u00a0\u2212 embryos. The differences in protein, fat and micronutrient intakes in zebrafish fed the Lab compared with the E\u00a0+ diet demonstrate that despite overt morphologic consistency, significant differences in gene expression occurred. Moreover, functional analysis of the significant transcripts in the E\u00a0\u2212 embryos suggested perturbed energy metabolism, leading to overt malformations and mortality. Thus, these findings demonstrate that parental zebrafish diet has a direct impact on the embryonic transcriptome.",

This species is a good candidate model organism for studies of environmentally-induced aestivation in marine invertebrates. Previous studies have examined various aspects of aestivation of A. japonicus, however, knowledge of the molecular regulation underpinning these events is still fragmentary. In the present study, we constructed a global gene expression profile of the intestine tissue of A. japonicus using RNA-seq to identify transcriptional responses associated with transitions between different states: non-aestivation (NA), deep-aestivation (DA), and arousal from aestivation (AA). The analysis identified 1245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DA vs. NA states, 1338 DEGs between AA vs. DA, and 1321 DEGs between AA vs. NA using the criteria |Log2Ratio|\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 and FDR\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001. Of these, 25 of the most significant DEGs were verified by real-time PCR, showing trends in expression patterns that were almost in full concordance between the two techniques. GO analysis revealed that for DA vs. NA, 24 metabolic associated processes were highly enriched (corrected p value\u00a0<\u00a00.05) whereas for AA vs. NA, 12 transport and metabolism associated processes were significantly enriched (corrected p value\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Pathways associated with aestivation were also mined, and indicated that most DEGs were enriched in metabolic and signal transduction pathways in the deep aestivation stage. Two up pathways were significantly enriched at the arousal stage (ribosome and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 pathway). A set of key DEGs was identified that may play vital roles in aestivation; these involved metabolism, detoxification and tissue protection, and energy-expensive processes.

The culture industry now however, faces some significant challenges, especially related to climate change impacts notably from predicted extensive saltwater intrusion into many low topographical coastal provinces across the Mekong Delta. This problem highlights a need for development of culture stocks that can tolerate more saline culture environments as a response to expansion of saline water-intruded land. While a traditional artificial selection program can potentially address this need, understanding the genomic basis of salinity tolerance can assist development of more productive culture lines. The current study applied a transcriptomic approach using Ion PGM technology to generate expressed sequence tag (EST) resources from the intestine and swim bladder from striped catfish reared at a salinity level of 9\u00a0ppt which showed best growth performance. Total sequence data generated was 467.8\u00a0Mbp, consisting of 4,116,424 reads with an average length of 112\u00a0bp. De novo assembly was employed that generated 51,188 contigs, and allowed identification of 16,116 putative genes based on the GenBank non-redundant database. GO annotation, KEGG pathway mapping, and functional annotation of the EST sequences recovered with a wide diversity of biological functions and processes. In addition, more than 11,600 simple sequence repeats were also detected. This is the first comprehensive analysis of a striped catfish transcriptome, and provides a valuable genomic resource for future selective breeding programs and functional or evolutionary studies of genes that influence salinity tolerance in this important culture species.",

The objectives of the present study were to characterize the gene expression patterns throughout oocyte growth in cod and compare them to changes previously identified in coho salmon. A quantitative PCR survey was conducted using 50 genes at six ovarian stages, ranging from the onset of primary growth (oocyte differentiation) to late vitellogenesis. Most expression patterns could be grouped into three major clusters, consisting of oocyte-derived (cluster 1) and likely follicle cell (clusters 2 and 3) genes. Oocyte genes were elevated during primary growth, while many follicle cell transcripts were abundant during oocyte differentiation and vitellogenesis. Few expression changes identified in coho salmon were evident in cod, which is likely due to differences in reproductive strategies. These results demonstrate that dynamic changes in gene expression occur during oocyte growth in teleost fish.",

Mussels were exposed to a mixture of dl-PCBs, and to perform a more in-depth evaluation, we chose to investigate the role of gender in the proteome response by analysing male and female mussels separately. The results revealed significant modulation of the gill tissue proteome: glycolysis and Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis appear to be the main pathways targeted by dl-PCBs.

Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing yielded 51.1, 61.2 and 54.0 million reads from wild-type controls, ahr-1(ia03) and ahr-1(ju145) mutants, respectively, providing detection of over 18,000 transcripts in each sample. Fourteen transcripts were over-expressed and 125 under-expressed in both ahr-1 mutants when compared to wild-type. Under-expressed genes included soluble guanylate cyclase (gcy) family genes, some of which were previously demonstrated to be regulated by AHR-1. A neuropeptide-like protein gene, nlp-20, and a F-box domain protein gene fbxa-192 and its pseudogenes fbxa-191 and fbxa-193 were also under-expressed. Conserved xenobiotic response elements were identified in the 5\u2032 flanking regions of some but not all of the gcy, nlp-20, and fbxa genes. These results extend previous studies demonstrating control of gcy family gene expression by AHR-1, and furthermore suggest a role of AHR-1 in regulation of a neuropeptide gene as well as pseudogenes.",

     "abstract": "The primary structures of host-defense peptides present in frog skin secretions constitute useful molecular markers for establishing taxonomic classifications and investigating phylogenetic relationships between species within a particular genus. Peptidomic analysis has led to the characterization of multiple host-defense peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of three species of frogs from the family Ranidae: Lithobates forreri (Boulenger, 1883), Hylarana luctuosa (Peters, 1871), and Hylarana signata (G\u00fcnther, 1872). The L. forreri secretions contain ranatuerin-2 (2 peptides), brevinin-1 (4 peptides), and temporin (1 peptide). The H. luctuosa secretions contain brevinin-2 (4 peptides), esculentin-1 (1 peptide), esculentin-2 (1 peptide), palustrin-2 (2 peptides), and temporin (2 peptides). The H. signata secretions contain brevinin-2 (4 peptides), brevinin-1 (5 peptides), palustrin-2 (1 peptide), and temporin (2 peptides). Cladistic analysis based upon the primary structures of 44 ranatuerin-2 peptides from 20 Lithobates species indicates a close phylogenetic relationship between L. forreri, Lithobates onca, and Lithobates yavapaiensis. A similar cladistic analysis based upon the primary structures of 27 brevinin-2 peptides from 8 Hylarana species provides support for a close phylogenetic relationship between H. signata and Hylarana picturata, while showing that the species are not conspecific, with H. luctuosa more distantly related.",

     "abstract": "The herbicide linuron (LIN) is an endocrine disruptor with an anti-androgenic mode of action. The objectives of this study were to (1) improve knowledge of androgen and anti-androgen signaling in the teleostean ovary and to (2) assess the ability of gene networks and machine learning to classify LIN as an anti-androgen using transcriptomic data. Ovarian explants from vitellogenic fathead minnows (FHMs) were exposed to three concentrations of either 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), flutamide (FLUT), or LIN for 12\u00a0h. Ovaries exposed to DHT showed a significant increase in 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) production while FLUT and LIN had no effect on E2. To improve understanding of androgen receptor signaling in the ovary, a reciprocal gene expression network was constructed for DHT and FLUT using pathway analysis and these data suggested that steroid metabolism, translation, and DNA replication are processes regulated through AR signaling in the ovary. Sub-network enrichment analysis revealed that FLUT and LIN shared more regulated gene networks in common compared to DHT. Using transcriptomic datasets from different fish species, machine learning algorithms classified LIN successfully with other anti-androgens. This study advances knowledge regarding molecular signaling cascades in the ovary that are responsive to androgens and anti-androgens and provides proof of concept that gene network analysis and machine learning can classify priority chemicals using experimental transcriptomic data collected from different fish species.",

A novel sequence of 1097\u00a0bp, located between CaP_ZP2 and CaP_ZP3.2, was inserted into the modified pAcGFP1-1 vector in the forward and reverse directions. Results showed that individual sequence served as promoters utilizing common regulatory elements in the forward and reverse directions for both CaP_ZP2 and CaP_ZP3.2 gene expressions. In situ hybridization against CaP_ZP2 confirmed that a strong positive signal was detected in the early development oocytes.

     "abstract": "Transcriptomics is increasingly used to assess biological responses to environmental stimuli and stressors such as aquatic pollutants. However, fundamental studies characterizing individual variability in mRNA levels are lacking, which currently limits the use of transcriptomics in environmental monitoring assessments. To address individual variability in transcript abundance, we performed a meta-analysis on 231 microarrays that were conducted in the fathead minnow (FHM), a widely used toxicological model. The mean variability for gene probes was ranked from most to least variable based upon the coefficient of variation. Transcripts that were the most variable in individual tissues included NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1, GTPase IMAP family member 7-like and v-set domain-containing T-cell activation inhibitor 1-like while genes encoding ribosomal proteins (rpl24 and rpl36), basic transcription factor 3, and nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha subunit were the least variable in individuals across a range of microarray experiments. Gene networks that showed high variability (based upon the variation in expression of individual members within the network) included cell proliferation, metabolism (steroid, lipids, and glucose), cell adhesion, vascularization, and regeneration while those that showed low variability (more stability) included mRNA and rRNA processing, regulation of translational fidelity, RNA splicing, and ribosome biogenesis. Real-time PCR was conducted on a subset of genes for comparison of variability collected from the microarrays. There was a significant positive relationship between the two methods when measuring individual variability, suggesting that variability detected in microarray data can be used to guide decisions on sample sizes for measuring transcripts in real-time PCR experiments. A power analysis revealed that measuring estrogen receptor ba (esrba) requires fewer biological replicates than that of estrogen receptor bb (esrbb) in the gonad and samples sizes required to detect a 50% change for reproductive-related transcripts is between 12 and 20. Characterizing individual variability at the molecular level will prove necessary as efforts are made toward integrating molecular tools into environmental risk assessments.",

In order to develop a structure based phylogeny, predict functionally important regions and to define stability changes upon single site mutations, the 3D structure of MIH for the crustaceans were built by using homology modeling based on the known structure of MIH from M. japonicus (1J0T). Structure based phylogeny showed a close relationship between P. bouvieri and C. japonica. ConSurf server analysis showed that the residues Cys8, Arg15, Cys25, Asp27, Cys28, Asn30, Arg33, Cys41, Cys45, Phe51, and Cys54 may be functionally significant among the MIH of crustaceans. Single amino acid substitutions \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018G\u2019 at the positions 71 and 72 of the MIH C-terminal region showed an alteration in the stability indicating that a change in this region may alter the function of MIH.

     "abstract": "Agricultural pesticide runoff has been suspected as the cause of numerous fish kills in rivers throughout Prince Edward Island but the impact on the surrounding marine environment is unknown. Endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide, is a potent neurotoxin and molt inhibitor used to combat the Colorado potato beetle however it has the potential to affect non-target organisms including the American lobster (Homarus americanus). Metamorphosis is a critical stage of development and the effects of contaminant exposure during this time are largely unknown in lobster. A 14\u00a0day endosulfan exposure was performed to identify the effects on survival, development and gene expression in lobster larvae during metamorphosis; all of which were predicted to be negatively impacted. The higher endosulfan concentrations resulted in greater mortality and a significant increase in the number of days required to reach metamorphosis in surviving animals. A custom made H. americanus microarray was used for monitoring the changes in expression of 14,592 genes at the termination of the exposure. Genes with >\u00a01.5 fold change and identified as being significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 using one-way ANOVA were selected for further analysis. A total of 707 genes were identified as being significantly differentiated, however with only ~\u00a040% annotation of the array, the majority of these genes were unknown. Annotated genes of interest were involved in many processes: development, metabolism, immunity and oxidative stress response and gene regulation. Nine genes of interest (histone H1, farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase, cuticle protein, glutathione S-transferase, thioredoxin, NADH dehydrogenase, ecdysone nuclear receptor Fushi tarazu F1 (FTZ-F1), ferritin and ecdysone inducible protein E75 (EIP-E75)) were selected for RT-qPCR validation of the microarray results. The RT-qPCR method was more sensitive than the microarray yet detected similar expression patterns. The two highest endosulfan concentrations resulted in increased mortalities, developmental delays in reaching metamorphosis and significant changes in gene expression. This research provides a foundation for using microarray gene expression profiles as screening tools for exploring the impact of environmental contaminants on lobster.",

     "abstract": "Grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, are widely used for ecological and toxicological research. They commonly experience cyclic hypoxia in their natural habitats. The response of grass shrimp to laboratory-controlled cyclic hypoxia has been studied in detail, but little is known about how field acclimatized grass shrimp regulate the gene expression and response to cyclic hypoxia. In this study we examined morphometric parameters, relative fecundity and gene expression of grass shrimp collected from two areas in Weeks Bay (Mobile, Alabama). One is a traditionally normoxic location (WBM), and the other is a traditionally cyclic hypoxic location (WC). In the week preceding grass shrimp collection dissolved oxygen (DO) at the field sites was measured continuously. DO was <\u00a02 (mg/L DO) and between 2 and 3 (mg/L DO) for 0 and 255\u00a0min at WBM, and for 285 and 1035\u00a0min at WC, respectively. Weight and length of WBM grass shrimp were significantly greater than weight and length of WC shrimp. WBM shrimp had more eggs than WC shrimp, but the difference was not significant. Shrimp from WC had a significant higher number of parasites than those from WBM. A cDNA microarray was utilized to investigate the changes in gene expression in grass shrimp hepatopancreas. Five genes, previously identified as hypoxia/cyclic hypoxia-responsive genes in laboratory exposure studies, were significantly up-regulated in WC shrimp relative to WBM. A total of 5 genes were significantly down-regulated in the field study. Only one of those genes, vitellogenin, has been previously found in chronic and cyclic hypoxic studies. Up and down-regulation of 7 selected genes was confirmed by qPCR. The overall pattern of gene expression in wild shrimp from cyclic DO sites in Weeks Bay showed only weak correlations with gene expression in shrimp from chronic and cyclic hypoxic laboratory studies. It appears therefore that transcriptome profiles of laboratory acclimated animals are of limited utility for understanding responses in field acclimatized animals that are exposed to a broader array of environmental variables.",

Biological confinement of GHTg Atlantic salmon may be achieved through the induction of triploidy (3N). The growth rates of triploid GH transgenic (3NGHTg) Atlantic salmon juveniles were found to significantly vary between families in the AquaBounty breeding program. In order to characterize gene expression associated with enhanced growth in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon, a functional genomics approach (32K cDNA microarray hybridizations followed by QPCR) was used to identify and validate liver transcripts that were differentially expressed between two fast-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon families (AS11, AS26) and a slow-growing 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon family (AS25); juvenile growth rate was evaluated over a 45-day period. Of 687 microarray-identified differentially expressed features, 143 (116 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 27 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS11 vs. AS25 microarray study, while 544 (442 more highly expressed in fast-growing and 102 more highly expressed in slow-growing juveniles) were identified in the AS26 vs. AS25 microarray study. Forty microarray features (39 putatively associated with fast growth and 1 putatively associated with slow growth) were present in both microarray experiment gene lists. The expression levels of 15 microarray-identified transcripts were studied using QPCR with individual RNA samples to validate microarray results and to study biological variability of transcript expression. The QPCR results agreed with the microarray results for 12 of 13 putative fast-growth associated transcripts, but QPCR did not validate the microarray results for 2 putative slow-growth associated transcripts. Many of the 39 microarray-identified genes putatively associated at the transcript expression level with fast-growing 3NGHTg salmon juveniles (including APOA1, APOA4, B2M, FADSD6, FTM, and GAPDH) are involved in metabolism, iron homeostasis and oxygen transport, and immune- or stress-related responses. The results of this study increase our knowledge of family-specific impacts on growth rate and hepatic gene expression in juvenile 3NGHTg Atlantic salmon. In addition, this study provides a suite of putative rapid growth rate-associated transcripts that may contribute to the development of molecular markers [e.g. intronic, exonic or regulatory region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] for the selection of GHTg Atlantic salmon broodstock that can be utilized to produce sterile triploids of desired growth performance for future commercial applications.",

     "abstract": "Prior studies of the elasmobranch rectal gland have demonstrated that feeding induces profound and rapid up regulation of the gland's ability to secrete concentrated NaCl solutions and the metabolic capacity to support this highly ATP consuming process. We undertook the current study to attempt to determine the degree to which up regulation of mRNA transcription was involved in the gland's activation. cDNA libraries were created from mRNA isolated from rectal glands of fasted (7\u00a0days post-feeding) and fed (6\u00a0h and 22\u00a0h post-feeding) spiny dogfish sharks (Squalus acanthias), and the libraries were subjected to suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) analysis. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) was also used to ascertain the mRNA expression of several genes revealed by the SSH analysis. In total the treatments changed the abundance of 170 transcripts, with 103 up regulated by feeding, and 67 up regulated by fasting. While many of the changes took place in \u2018expected\u2019 Gene Ontology (GO) categories (e.g., metabolism, transport, structural proteins, DNA and RNA turnover, etc.), KEGG analysis revealed a number of categories which identify oxidative stress as a topic of interest for the gland. GO analysis also revealed that branched chain essential amino acids (e.g., valine, leucine, isoleucine) are potential metabolic fuels for the rectal gland. In addition, up regulation of transcripts for many genes in the anticipated GO categories did not agree (i.e., fasting down regulated in feeding treatments) with previously observed increases in their respective proteins/enzyme activities. These results suggest an \u2018anticipatory\u2019 storage of selected mRNAs which presumably supports the rapid translation of proteins upon feeding activation of the gland.",

However, genomic data are currently available for few taxa only, thus excluding physiological model species from this approach. In this study we report the transcriptome of the model organism Hyas araneus from Spitsbergen (Arctic). We generated 20,479 transcripts, using the 454 GS FLX sequencing technology in combination with an Illumina HiSeq sequencing approach. Annotation by Blastx revealed 7159 blast hits in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. The comparison between the spider crab H. araneus transcriptome and EST libraries of the European lobster Homarus americanus and the porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes yielded 3229/2581 sequences with a significant hit, respectively. The clustering by the Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) revealed a common core of 1710 clusters present in all three species and 5903 unique clusters for H. araneus. The combined sequencing approaches generated transcripts that will greatly expand the limited genomic data available for crustaceans. We introduce the MCL clustering for transcriptome comparisons as a simple approach to estimate similarities between transcriptomic libraries of different size and quality and to analyze homologies within the selected group of species.

Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from Pseudhymenochirus merlini Chabanaud, 1920, the single species within the genus Pseudhymenochirus, led to identification of 13 host-defense peptides with antimicrobial activity. Two peptides (hymenochirin-1Pa and -1Pb) show structural similarity to hymenochirin-1B from Hymenochirus boettgeri and eight peptides (hymenochirin-5Pa, -5Pb, -5Pc, -5Pd, -5Pe, -5Pf, 5Pg and -5Ph) are structurally similar to each other and to hymenochirin-5B from H. boettgeri. Two peptides differing by a single amino acid (IKIPSFFRNILKKVGKEAVSLM/I AGALKQS), termed pseudhymenochirin-1Pa and -1Pb, and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa (GIFPIFAKLLGKVIKVASSLISKGRTE) do not resemble host-defense peptides previously isolated from pipid frogs. Hymenochirin-5Pe was the most abundant peptide in the secretions and hymenochirin-1Pa the most potent against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0\u03bcM) and Escherichia coli (MIC\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0\u03bcM).

In this review, we present the current knowledge associated with physiological and biochemical adaptations at low temperatures.

     "abstract": "Diel vertical migration and seasonal diapause are critical life history events for the copepod Calanus finmarchicus. While much is known about these behaviors phenomenologically, little is known about their molecular underpinnings. Recent studies in insects suggest that some circadian genes/proteins also contribute to the establishment of seasonal diapause. Thus, it is possible that in Calanus these distinct timing regimes share some genetic components. To begin to address this possibility, we used the well-established Drosophila melanogaster circadian system as a reference for mining clock transcripts from a 200,000\u00a0+ sequence Calanus transcriptome; the proteins encoded by the identified transcripts were also deduced and characterized. Sequences encoding homologs of the Drosophila core clock proteins CLOCK, CYCLE, PERIOD and TIMELESS were identified, as was one encoding CRYPTOCHROME 2, a core clock protein in ancestral insect systems, but absent in Drosophila. Calanus transcripts encoding proteins known to modulate the Drosophila core clock were also identified and characterized, e.g. CLOCKWORK ORANGE, DOUBLETIME, SHAGGY and VRILLE. Alignment and structural analyses of the deduced Calanus proteins with their Drosophila counterparts revealed extensive sequence conservation, particularly in functional domains. Interestingly, reverse BLAST analyses of these sequences against all arthropod proteins typically revealed non-Drosophila isoforms to be most similar to the Calanus queries. This, in combination with the presence of both CRYPTOCHROME 1 (a clock input pathway protein) and CRYPTOCHROME 2 in Calanus, suggests that the organization of the copepod circadian system is an ancestral one, more similar to that of insects like Danaus plexippus than to that of Drosophila.",

In 2003, Corallium was split into two genera, Corallium and Paracorallium, and seven species were moved to this newly identified genus on the bases of morphological features. Previously, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of two precious corals Paracorallium japonicum and Corallium konojoi, in order to clarify their systematic positions. The two genomes showed high nucleotide sequence identity, but their gene order arrangements were not identical. Here, we determined three complete mitochondrial genome sequences from the one specimen of Mediterranean Corallium rubrum and two specimens of Corallium elatius coming from Kagoshima (South Japan). The circular mitochondrial genomes of C. rubrum and C. elatius are 18,915\u00a0bp and 18,969\u201318,970\u00a0bp in length, respectively, and encode 14 typical octocorallian protein-coding genes (nad1\u20136, nad4L, cox1\u20133, cob, atp6, atp8, and mtMutS, which is an octocoral-specific mismatch repair gene homologue), two ribosomal RNA genes (rns and rnl), and one transfer RNA (trnM). The overall nucleotide differences between C. konojoi and each C. elatius haplotype (T2007 and I2011) are only 10 and 11 nucleotides, respectively; this degree of similarity indicates that C. elatius and C. konojoi are very closely related species. Notably, the C. rubrum mitochondrial genome shows more nucleotide sequence identity to P. japonicum (99.5%) than to its congeneric species C. konojoi (95.3%) and C. elatius (95.3%). Moreover, the gene order arrangement of C. rubrum was the same as that of P. japonicum, while that of C. elatius was the same as C. konojoi. Phylogenetic analysis based on three mitochondrial genes from 24 scleraxonian species shows that the family Coralliidae is separated into two distinct groups, recovering Corallium as a paraphyletic genus. Our results indicate that the currently accepted generic classification of Coralliidae should be reconsidered.",

One hypothesis for the evolution of moonlighting proteins is that regions of a structure under relatively weak negative selection could gain new functions without interfering with the primary function. To test this hypothesis, we investigated sequence conservation and dN/dS, which reflects the selection acting on a coding sequence, in SMN and a related protein, splicing factor 30 (SPF30), which is not currently known to be multifunctional. We found very different patterns of evolution in the two genes, with SPF30 characterized by strong sequence conservation and negative selection in most animal taxa investigated, and SMN with much lower sequence conservation, and much weaker negative selection at many sites. Evidence was found of positive selection acting on some sites in primate genes for SMN. SMN was also found to have been duplicated in a number of species, and with patterns that indicate reduced negative selection following some of these duplications. There were also several animal species lacking an SMN gene.",

     "abstract": "Short linear motifs confer evolutionary flexibility on proteins as they can be added with relative ease allowing the acquisition of new functions. Such motifs may mediate a variety of signalling functions. The adhesion-mediating Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE) motif is enriched in laminin beta 2, and has been observed in other proteins, including members of the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase family. It acts as a stop signal for growing axons in the developing neuromuscular junction, binding to the voltage-gated calcium channel. In this bioinformatic analysis, we have investigated the presence of the motif in proteins of the neuromuscular junction, and have also examined its structural position and potential for ligand interaction, as well as phylogenetic conservation, in the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase family. The motif was observed to occur with a significantly higher frequency than expected in the UniProt/Swiss-Prot database, as well as in four individual species (human, mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster). Examination of its presence in neuromuscular junction proteins showed it to be enriched in certain proteins of the synaptic basement membrane, including laminin, agrin, acetylcholinesterase and tenascin. A highly significant enrichment was observed in cytoskeletal proteins, particularly intermediate filament proteins and members of the spectrin family. In the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase family, the motif was observed in four conserved positions in the protein structure. It is present in the majority of mammalian acetylcholinesterases, as well as acetylcholinesterases from electric fish and a number of invertebrates. In insects, it is present in the ace-2, rather than in the synaptic ace-1, enzyme. It is also observed in the cholinesterase-like adhesion molecules (neuroligins, neurotactin and glutactin). It is never seen in butyrylcholinesterases, which do not mediate cell adhesion. In conclusion, the significant enrichment of the motif in certain classes of protein, as well as its conserved presence and structural positioning in one protein family, suggests that it has specific functions both in cell adhesion in the neuromuscular junction and in maintaining the structural integrity of the cytoskeleton.",

A cDNA library of O. melastigma was constructed, and 2304 clones were amplified from the library to fabricate a cDNA microarray. Sequences of these genes were assembled into 1800 sequences using Geneious, a bioinformatics software. Corresponding expressed sequence tags were blasted against the National Centre for Biotechnology Information non-redundant database and further classified into various biological categories according to the Gene Ontology project.

     "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular techniques have allowed gene expression in euryhaline animals to be quantified during salinity transfers. As these investigations transition from studying single genes to utilizing genomics-based methodologies, it is an appropriate time to summarize single gene studies. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed on 59 published studies that used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to examine expression of osmoregulatory genes (the Na+/K+\u2013ATPase, NKA; the Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter, NKCC; carbonic anhydrase, CA; the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, CFTR; and the H+\u2013ATPase, HAT) in response to salinity transfer. Based on 887 calculated effect sizes, NKA, NKCC, CA, and HAT are up-regulated after salinity transfer, while surprisingly, CFTR is unchanged. Meta-analysis also identified influential factors contributing to these changes. For example, expression was highest: 1) during transfers from higher to lower salinities comprising a physiological transition from osmoconformity to osmoregulation, 2) 1\u20133\u00a0days following transfer, 3) during dissimilar transfers, and 4) in crustaceans rather than teleosts. Methodological characteristics (e.g., types of controls) were not important. Experiments lacking in the current literature were also identified. Meta-analyses are powerful tools for quantitatively synthesizing a large body of literature, and this report serves as a template for their application in other areas of comparative physiology.",

     "abstract": "Northern elephant seals endure prolonged periods of food deprivation at multiple life-history stages and simultaneous with energetically costly activities\u2014including reproduction and development. Most mammals decrease their energy expenditure while fasting, with simultaneous reductions in gluconeogenesis and circulating glucose concentration. Paradoxically, elephant seals maintain high rates of both energy expenditure and gluconeogenesis, and high blood glucose concentrations throughout fasting. We therefore characterized the suite of changes that occur in carbohydrate metabolites during fasting in northern elephant seals. Using a broad-based metabolomics platform we investigated fasting during two states\u2014lactation in adult females and the post-weaning developmental period in pups. A total of 227 metabolites were detected in seal plasma; 31 associated with carbohydrate metabolism were analyzed in the present study. Several compounds showed similar responses during lactation and the post-weaning fast (e.g. glycerol and mesaconate) whereas other compounds displayed quite different abundances between groups (e.g. citrate and pyruvate). This work found that, while the changes that occur with fasting were frequently similar in lactating females and developing pups, the relative abundance of compounds often varied markedly. These differences suggest that the metabolic strategies used to endure prolonged fasts are influenced by life-history or nutrient constraints.",

     "abstract": "Helicoverpa armigera is an insect that causes important economic losses in crops. To reduce this loss, pyrethroids have been commonly used against H. armigera in farming areas. However, excess and continuous usage of pyrethroids cause resistance in H. armigera. Therefore, expressions of midgut proteins of two H. armigera field populations were compared to those of a susceptible strain by 2-D PAGE and MALDI-ToF-MS. Our results indicate that H. armigera reacts to pyrethroid-induced stress mainly by increasing the expression of energy metabolism-related proteins, such as ATP synthase and arginine kinase. NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, also up-regulated, could play a role in detoxification of toxic pyrethroid metabolites, such as 3-phenoxybenzaldehyde. Interestingly, while GSTs were not found up-regulated in the comparative proteome analysis, biochemical assays showed significant increases of enzyme activities in both field populations as compared to the susceptible strain. Similarly, although esterases were not found differentially expressed, biochemical assays showed significant increases of esterase activities in both field populations. Thus, esterases are also proposed to be involved in metabolic responses towards pyrethroid insecticide-induced stress. In conclusion, we suggest increased energy metabolism in the midgut tissue of H. armigera as a general prerequisite for compensating the costs of energy-consuming detoxification processes.",

     "abstract": "Estuarine organisms often experience periods of cyclic hypoxia characterized by hypoxia in the early morning and normoxia in the afternoon. Here we examine the genomic responses of grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, exposed to cyclic hypoxia in the laboratory. Differentially expressed genes in the hepatopancreas were determined in cyclic hypoxic vs. normoxic control groups after 1, 2, 5 and 10\u00a0days of exposure to cyclic hypoxia using microarrays printed with 661 annotated transcripts obtained from multiple EST (expressed sequence tag) libraries. Sampling on each day was conducted at two different time series, one in the morning (representing low concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO), designated C-AM) and one in the afternoon (representing high DO concentration, designated C-PM). Distinct differences were observed between the number and identity of specific genes that were significantly down- or up-regulated in shrimp collected at the low DO and high DO points of the cyclic DO cycle. However, cluster analysis showed that the overall response patterns of high (C-PM) and low DO (C-AM) exposures were in the same cluster at 1, 2, and 5\u00a0days. In contrast, the response patterns on different days were in different clusters. Day 1 was characterized by up-regulation of 17 unknown genes in the morning and a transient down-regulation of several hemocyanin genes, which returned to normoxic control levels in the afternoon. Days 2 and 5 showed significant down-regulation of 10 (C-AM) and 15 (C-PM) unknown genes, respectively. On day 10 the high DO samples showed a dramatic increase in the number of up-regulated genes, including several distinct hemocyanin genes, and this profile did not cluster with any of the other treatment groups. Vitellogenin, cathepsin L, cytochrome c oxidase subunit III, and fatty acid binding protein 10 were the signature down-regulated genes at day 10 (C-AM). According to GO annotation, the most abundant group of genes for both cyclic low (C-AM) and high (C-PM) DO exposure was associated with transport, defense response, and metabolic process. The differentially expressed genes were mapped to KEGG metabolic and regulatory pathways according to the gene distribution in Drosophila pathway database. Cyclic high (C-PM) DO affected a broad range of pathways compared to cyclic low (C-AM) DO.",

     "abstract": "In recent years RNA-Seq technology has been used not only to quantify differences in gene expression but also to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to these differences. Nucleotide sequence variation arising through evolution may differentially affect the expression profiles of divergent species. RNA-Seq technology, combined with techniques to differentiate parental alleles and quantify their abundance, have recently become popular methods for allele specific gene expression (ASGE) analyses. However, analysis of gene expression within interspecies hybrids may be difficult when one of the two parental genomes represented in the hybrid does not have robust genomic resources or available transcriptome data. Herein, we compare two strategies for analyzing allele specific expression within interspecies hybrids produced from crossing two Xiphophorus fish species. The first strategy relies upon a robust reference transcriptome assembly from one species followed by identification of SNPs and creation of an in silico reference transcriptome for the second species. The second strategy employs de novo assembly of reference transcriptomes for both parental species followed by identification of homologous transcripts prior to mapping hybrid reads to a combined hybrid reference. Our results show that, although both methods are able to achieve balanced allelic distribution upon read mapping of F1 hybrid fish transcriptomes, the second \u201cde novo\u201d assembly approach is superior for ASGE analyses and leads to results more consistent with those found from quantitative real time PCR assessment of gene expression. In addition, our analysis indicates that indels between the two parental alleles are the major cause of the differences in results observed when employing these two methods.",

This work reports the complete mitochondrial genome of the marine gastropod Concholepas concholepas, obtained by 454 pryosequencing, and an analysis of mitochondrial transcripts of two populations 1000\u00a0km apart along the Chilean coast. The mitochondrion of C. concholepas is 15,495 base pairs (bp) in size and contains the 37 subunits characteristic of metazoans, as well as a non-coding region of 330\u00a0bp. In silico analysis of mitochondrial gene variability showed significant differences among populations. In terms of levels of relative abundance of transcripts associated with mitochondrion in the two populations (assessed by qPCR), the genes associated with complexes III and IV of the mitochondrial genome had the highest levels of expression in the northern population while transcripts associated with the ATP synthase complex had the highest levels of expression in the southern population. Moreover, fifteen polymorphic SNPs were identified in silico between the mitogenomes of the two populations. Four of these markers implied different amino acid substitutions (non-synonymous SNPs).

     "abstract": "Couch potato (CPO) is an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of nervous system development and adult diapause in insects. Within insects, this protein is highly conserved, yet it has not been identified in another large arthropod group, the Crustacea. Here, functional genomics was used to identify putative CPO homologs in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, a planktonic crustacean that undergoes seasonal diapause. In silico mining of expressed sequence tag (EST) and 454 pyrosequencing data resulted in the identification of two full-length CPO proteins, each 205 amino acids long. The two C. finmarchicus CPOs (Calfi-CPO I and II) are identical in sequence with the exception of three amino acids, and are predicted to possess a single RNA recognition motif (RRM). Sequence comparison of the two Calfi-CPOs with those of insects shows high levels of amino acid conservation, particularly in their RRMs. Using the C. finmarchicus sequences as queries, ESTs encoding partial CPOs were identified from two other crustaceans, the parasitic copepod Lernaeocera branchialis and shrimp Penaeus monodon. Surprisingly, no convincing CPO-encoding transcripts were identified from crustacean species with very large (>\u00a0100,000) EST datasets (e.g. Litopenaeus vannamei, Daphnia pulex and Lepeophtheirus salmonis), suggesting that CPO transcript/protein may be expressed at very low levels or absent in some crustaceans. RNA-Seq data suggested stage-specific expression of CPO in C. finmarchicus, with few transcripts present in eggs (which represent mixed embryonic stages) and adults, and high levels in nauplii and copepodites; stages exhibiting high CPO expression are consistent with a role for it in neuronal development.",

Previous investigations into the effect of starvation on the intestinal epithelia of teleost fishes have focused primarily on changes in morphological characteristics and targeted molecular analysis of specific enzymes. The goal of this study was to use a comprehensive approach to help reveal how the intestinal epithelia of carnivorous teleost fishes acclimate to short-term nutrient deprivation. We utilized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) to conduct the proteomic analysis of the mucosal and epithelial layer of the anterior gut intestinal tract (GIT) from satiation fed vs. 4\u00a0week starved rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). A total of 40 proteins were determined to be differentially expressed and were subsequently picked for in-gel trypsin digestion. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis was conducted using matrix assisted laser desorption time-of-flight/time-of-flight. Nine of the 11 positively identified proteins were directly related to innate immunity. The expression of \u03b1-1 proteinase inhibitor decreased in starved vs. fed fish. Also, the concentration of one leukocyte elastase inhibitor (LEI) isomer decreased in starved fish, though the concentration of another LEI isomer increased in due to starvation. In addition, starvation promoted an increased concentration of the important xenobiotic-transporter p-glycoprotein. Finally, starvation resulted in a significant increase in type II keratin E2. Overall, our results indicate that starvation promoted a reduced capacity to inhibit enzymatic stress but increased xenobiotic resistance and paracellular permeability of epithelial cells in the anterior intestine of rainbow trout.",

Luciferase genes were especially abundant, representing ca 2% of the products. Gene products involved with cysteine and sulfur metabolism such as the cystathionine \u03b2-lyase and the S-adenosylmethionine synthetase were abundant. Noteworthy, an abundance of proteins involved with hormone metabolism was found, suggesting a possible link between bioluminescence and hormone metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Ionic calcium (Ca2\u00a0+) supports essential functions within physiological systems, and consequently its concentration is homeostatically regulated within narrow bounds in the body fluids of animals through endocrine effects at ion-transporting osmoregulatory tissues. In vertebrates, extracellular Ca2\u00a0+ is detected at the cell surface by the extracellular calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Interestingly, the taxonomic distribution of CaSRs is restricted to vertebrates, with some CaSR-like receptors apparently present in non-vertebrate chordates. Since bone is a known Ca2\u00a0+ storage site and is characteristically restricted to the vertebrate lineage, we hypothesized a functional association of CaSR with vertebrate skeleton that may have an ancient origin. Protein sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate CaSRs and related GPCRs of the glutamate receptor-like family expose similarities and indel differences among these receptors, and reveal the evolutionary history of CaSRs. Evolutionary selection was tested statistically by evaluating the relationship between non-synonymous (replacement, dN) versus synonymous (silent, dS) amino acid substitution rates (as dN/dS) of protein-coding DNA sequences among branches of the estimated protein phylogeny. On a background of strong purifying selection (dN/dS\u00a0<\u00a01) in the CaSR phylogeny, statistical evidence for adaptive evolution (dN/dS\u00a0>\u00a01) was detected on some branches to major clades in the CaSR phylogeny, especially to the tetrapod vertebrate CaSRs and chordate CaSR-like branches. Testing also revealed overall purifying selection at the codon level. At some sites relaxation from strong purifying selection was seen, but evidence for adaptive evolution was not detected for individual sites. The results suggest purifying selection of CaSRs, and of adaptive evolution among some major vertebrate clades, reflecting clade specific differences in natural history and organismal biology, including skeletal involvement in calcium homeostasis.",

The fabp6a and fabp6b genes from medaka and three-spined stickleback encode polypeptides of 125\u2013127 amino acids, which share highest sequence identity with their orthologs in teleost fishes and tetrapods. All Fabp6a and Fabp6b from different species cluster together in a distinct clade in phylogenetic analysis and the topology of the tree suggests that fabp6a and fabp6b from medaka and three-spined stickleback are most likely duplicated genes of an ancestral FABP6 owing to teleost-specific whole-genome duplication. However, the topology of an alternate phylogenetic tree revealed that the duplication of the ancestral FABP6 that gave rise to the extant fabp6a and fabp6b possibly occurred before the divergence of tetrapods and fishes. Conserved gene synteny was evident between the teleost fabp6a and fabp6b genes and the human FABP6 gene. The tissue-specific distribution of fabp6a transcripts suggests the retention of ancestral function(s) of the fabp6a gene in medaka and three-spined stickleback with acquisition of new function(s) in different tissues. However, the tissue-specific regulation of the fabp6b gene has diverged markedly in medaka and three-spined stickleback since the duplication of the fabp6 gene.",

Subjecting data to principal component analysis showed that there was no grouping of the data according to the residual feed intake. In contrast, data were clearly grouped according to feeding level. Identification of the metabolites responsible for this grouping showed that the plasma level of metabolites related to mobilisation of energy was high during restrictive feeding, e.g. betaine, carnitine, and creatine. During ad libitum feeding the plasma level of metabolites that can be characterised as biomarkers of meat intake (creatinine, carnosine, 1- and 3 methylhistidine) was high.

Recently next-generation sequencing techniques have greatly facilitated such evolutionary studies in species otherwise depauperate of genomic resources. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys sp.) serve as exemplars of adaptation in that they inhabit extremely arid environments, yet require no drinking water because of ultra-efficient kidney function and osmoregulation. As a basis for identifying water conservation genes in kangaroo rats, we conducted a priori bioinformatics searches in model rodents (Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus) to identify candidate genes with known or suspected osmoregulatory function. We then obtained 446,758 reads via 454 pyrosequencing to characterize genes expressed in the kidney of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis). We also determined candidates a posteriori by identifying genes that were overexpressed in the kidney. The kangaroo rat sequences revealed nine different a priori candidate genes predicted from our Mus and Rattus searches, as well as 32 a posteriori candidate genes that were overexpressed in kidney. Mutations in two of these genes, Slc12a1 and Slc12a3, cause human renal diseases that result in the inability to concentrate urine. These genes are likely key determinants of physiological water conservation in desert rodents.",

In humans, two genes (GXIIA PLA2 and GXIIB PLA2) have been characterised. GXIIA PLA2 is enzymatically active whereas GXIIB PLA2 is devoid of catalytic activity. Recently, putative homologues of the vertebrate GXII PLA2s were described in non-vertebrates. In the current study a total of 170 GXII PLA2 sequences were identified in vertebrates, invertebrates, non-metazoan eukaryotes, fungi and bacteria. GXIIB PLA2 was found only in vertebrates and the searches failed to identify putative GXII PLA2 homologues in Archaea. Comparisons of the predicted functional domains of GXII PLA2s revealed considerable structural identity within the Ca2\u00a0+-binding and the catalytic sites among the various organisms suggesting that functional conservation may have been retained across evolution. The preservation of GXII PLA2 family members from bacteria to human indicates that they have emerged early in evolution and evolved via gene/genome duplication events prior to Eubacteria. Gene duplicates were identified in some invertebrate taxa suggesting that species-specific duplications occurred. The analysis of the GXII PLA2 homologue genome environment revealed that gene synteny and gene order are preserved in vertebrates. Conservation of GXII PLA2s indicates that important functional roles involved in species survival and were maintained across evolution and may be dependent on or independent of the enzyme's phospholipolytic activity.",

Smolts had higher levels of gill Na+/K+-ATPase activity, plasma cortisol and plasma thyroid hormones relative to parr. Across all five tissues, stringent microarray analyses identified 48 features that were differentially expressed in smolts compared to parr. Using a less stringent method we found 477 features that were differentially expressed at least 1.2-fold in smolts, including 172 features in the gill. Smolts had higher mRNA levels of genes involved in transcription, protein biosynthesis and folding, electron transport, oxygen transport, and sensory perception and lower mRNA levels for genes involved in proteolysis. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression in select genes identified by microarray analyses and to quantify expression of other genes known to be involved in smolting.

All venoms hydrolyzed acetylthiocholine at low levels, and only TblV showed phospholipase A2 activity. 1D and 2D SDS-PAGE profile comparisons demonstrated species-specific components as well as several shared components. Size exclusion chromatograms from the three Philodryas venoms and HttV were similar, but TblV showed a notably different pattern. MALDI-TOF MS of crude venoms revealed as many as 49 distinct protein masses, assigned to six protein families. MALDI-TOF/TOF MS analysis of tryptic peptides confirmed the presence of cysteine-rich secretory proteins in all venoms, as well as a phospholipase A2 and a three-finger toxin in TblV.

Using a porcine whole-genome microarray a total of 632 differentially expressed genes in the liver of lactating compared to non-lactating sows could be identified. Enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in fatty acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, glutathione metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, citrate cycle, glycerophospholipid metabolism, PPAR signaling, and focal adhesion. The most striking observation with respect to intermediary metabolism was that genes involved in fatty acid catabolism, the catabolism of gluconeogenic amino acids, the citrate cycle and the respiratory chain were up-regulated in the liver of sows during lactation. With respect to immune response, it could be demonstrated that genes encoding acute phase proteins and genes involved in tissue repair were up-regulated and genes encoding adhesion molecules were down-regulated in the liver of sows during lactation. The results indicate that energy-generating pathways and pathways involved in the delivery of gluconeogenic substrates are induced in sow liver during lactation. The alterations of expression of genes encoding proteins involved in immune response suggest that lactation in sows may cause an adaptive immune response that possibly counteracts hepatic inflammation.",

In this study we used a combination of heterologous group 3 LEA antibodies to demonstrate that the heat-soluble proteome of the cysts contains up to 12 distinct putative group 3 LEA proteins that complement the group 1 LEA proteins found previously. Most antibody-positive, heat-soluble proteins were larger than 50\u00a0kDa although antibody positive proteins of 20\u201338\u00a0kDa were also detected. Both nuclei and mitochondria had distinct complements of the putative group 3 LEA proteins.

The expression of group 3 LEA proteins, unlike members of group 1, was not restricted to encysted diapause embryos. Three to five putative group 3 LEA proteins were expressed in gravid females and in larvae. Cysts of different species from various geographic locations had distinct complements of group 3 LEA proteins suggesting rapid evolution of the LEA proteins or differences in the type of group 3 Lea genes expressed.

Sexual precocity is a serious problem because of genetic retrogression, which has negative effects on product quality and dramatically affects price. Culture of all-male populations of this species would be economically advantageous, as the males grow faster and reach a much larger size than females. Developing such a culture scheme will require discovery of sex- or reproduction-related genes that affect sexual maturity and sex determination. In this study, a high-quality normalized testis cDNA library was constructed to identify novel transcripts. Of the 5280 successful sequencing reaction yields, 5202 expressed tagged sequences (ESTs) with an average length of 954 bp. Ultimately, 3677 unique sequences, including 891 contigs and 2786 singletons, were identified based on cluster and assembly analyses. Sixteen hundred (43.5%) genes were novel based on the NCBI protein database, thus these unidentified genes may improve basic molecular knowledge about M. nipponense. Of the novel unigenes, 34.4% (715/2077) were homologous to insects, such as Tribolium castaneum, Drosophila spp. and Apis mellifera. Fifty-two genes were identified as sex- or reproduction-related based on Gene Ontology classification and sequence comparison with data from other publications. These genes can be classified into groups based on different functions, including 10 sex-determination related genes, 8 male-reproductive genes, 5 cathepsin-related genes, 20 ubiquitin-related genes, 5 ferritin-related genes, and 4 LRR genes.

     "abstract": "Peptidomic analysis was used to compare the distribution of host-defense peptides in norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from laboratory-generated female F1 hybrids of the common clawed frog Xenopus laevis (Daudin, 1802) and Mueller's clawed frog Xenopus muelleri (Peters, 1844) with the corresponding distribution in skin secretions from the parent species. A total of 18 peptides were identified in secretions from the hybrid frogs. Eleven peptides (magainin-1, magainin-2, CPF-1, CPF-3, CPF-4, CPF-5, CPF-6, CPF-7, XPF-1, XPF-2, and PGLa) were identified in secretions of both the hybrids and X. laevis. Four peptides (magainin-M1, XPF-M1, CPF-M1, and tigerinin-M1) were previously found in skin secretions of X. muelleri but magainin-M2 and CPF-M2 from X. muelleri were not detected. Three previously undescribed peptides (magainin-LM1, PGLa-LM1, and CPF-LM1) were purified from the secretions of the hybrid frogs that were not detected in secretions from either X. laevis or X. muelleri. Magainin-LM1 differs from magainin-2 from X. laevis by a single amino acid substitution (Gly13\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Ala) but PGLa-LM1 and CPF-LM1 differ appreciably in structure from orthologs in the parent species. CPF-LM1 shows potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is hemolytic. The data indicate that hybridization increases the multiplicity of skin host-defense peptides in skin secretions. As the female F1 hybrids are fertile, hybridization may represent an adaptive strategy among Xenopus species to increase protection against pathogenic microorganisms in the environment.",

     "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) acts as a weak acid in water and the increasing level of CO2 in the atmosphere leads to ocean acidification. In addition, possible leakage from sub-seabed storage of anthropogenic CO2 may pose a threat to the marine environment. 1H NMR spectroscopy was applied to extracts of hemolymph, gills and leg muscle from shore crabs (Carcinus maenas) to examine the metabolic response to elevated levels of CO2. Crabs were exposed to different levels of CO2\u2010acidified seawater with pHNBS 7.4, 6.6 and 6.3 (pCO2\u00a0~\u00a02600, 16,000 and 30,000\u00a0\u03bcatm, respectively) for two weeks (level-dependent exposure). In addition, the metabolic response was followed for up to 4\u00a0weeks of exposure to seawater pHNBS 6.9 (pCO2\u00a0~\u00a07600\u00a0\u03bcatm). Partial least squares regression analysis of data showed an increased differentiation between metabolic fingerprints of controls and exposed groups for all sample types with increasing CO2 levels. Difference between controls and animals subjected to time-dependent exposure appeared after 4\u00a0weeks in the hemolymph and gills, and after 48\u00a0h of exposure in the leg muscle. Changes in metabolic profiles were mainly due to a reduced level of important intracellular osmolytes such as amino acids (glycine, proline), while the level of other metabolites varied between the different sample types. The results are similar to what is observed in animals exposed to hypo-osmotic stress and may suggest disturbances in intracellular iso-osmotic regulation. The results may also reflect increased catabolism of amino acids to supply the body fluids with proton-buffering ammonia (NH3). Alternatively, the findings may reflect an exhaustive effect of CO2 exposure.",

In contrast to the non-ruminant response, fluxes through gluconeogenic and ketogenic pathways decrease during food restriction. Transcriptional regulation responsible for these unique food restriction responses has not been established. To determine the hepatic transcriptional response of ruminants to an acute drop in dietary nutrient supply, 102 yearling heifers were assigned to either ad libitum feeding or 24\u00a0h of food withdrawal in a randomized block design. Liver biopsies were obtained for microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses of gene expression. Plasma concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids were higher in food restricted heifers, while levels of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, triacylglycerol, and glucose were decreased. Despite a decline in substrate supply and a lower hepatic production of glucose, expression of the key gluconeogenic enzymes pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase was upregulated as in non-ruminants. Downregulation of cholesterolgenic genes and upregulation of fatty acid oxidative genes were consistent with SREBP-2 and PPAR\u03b1 control, respectively. Ketogenesis from short-chain fatty acids was downregulated, contrary to the non-ruminant response to food restriction. Short-chain fatty acids may exert transcriptional control in the ruminant liver similar to that demonstrated in the large intestine of non-ruminants.",

Comparative structural analysis of these enzymes is thus important. The invertebrate deuterostomes (phyla Echinodermata and Hemichordata and subphyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata) lie in the transition zone between invertebrates and vertebrates, and are thus of interest to the study of evolution. Here we have investigated the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase gene family in the sequenced genomes of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Echinodermata), Saccoglossus kowalevskii (Hemichordata), Ciona intestinalis (Urochordata) and Branchiostoma floridae (Cephalochordata), using sequence analysis of the catalytic apparatus and oligomerisation domains, and phylogenetic analysis. All four genomes show blurring of structural boundaries between cholinesterases and carboxylesterases, with many intermediate enzymes. Non-enzymatic proteins are well represented. The Saccoglossus and Branchiostoma genomes show evidence of extensive gene duplication and retention. There is also evidence of domain shuffling, resulting in multidomain proteins consisting either of multiple carboxylesterase domains, or of carboxylesterase/cholinesterase domains linked to other domains, including RING finger, chitin-binding, immunoglobulin, fibronectin type 3, CUB, cysteine-rich-Frizzled, caspase activation and 7tm-1, amongst others. Such gene duplication and domain shuffling in the carboxylesterase/cholinesterase family appears to be unique to the invertebrate deuterostomes, and we hypothesise that these factors may have contributed to the evolution of the morphological complexity, particularly of the nervous system and neural crest, of the vertebrates.",

Here we use SOLiD sequencing to examine gene expression patterns in Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) populations exposed to varying degrees of anthropogenic impact. Novel transcripts were identified and RNA-Seq analysis revealed several hundred differentially expressed genes. Gene enrichment analysis determined that in addition to biological processes predicted to be associated with anthropogenic influences (e.g. immune response), other processes play important roles including cell recognition and cell adhesion. To evaluate the effectiveness of restricting characterization solely to short read sequences, mapping and RNA-Seq analysis were also performed using publicly available transcriptome sequence data as a scaffold. This study demonstrates that ultra-short read sequencing technologies can effectively generate novel transcriptome information, identify differentially expressed genes, and will be important for examining environmental physiology of non-model organisms.",

Salmon from two susceptible (Salmo salar, Oncorhynchus keta) and one resistant (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) species were exposed to adult L. salmonis. After 24 and 48\u00a0h, skin samples directly below the attachment site and at non-attachment sites were assessed for transcriptomic profiles of select innate defense genes. Abrasion of the skin permitted comparisons between abrasion-associated injury and louse-associated injury. Infection responses were consistently higher than those caused by abrasion. Temporal patterns of expression were evident in all species for the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP-\u03b2), the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the enzyme prostaglandin D synthase (PGDS) at attachment sites. O. gorbuscha was the highest responder in a number of genes while there was an absence of C-reactive protein (CRP) gene expression in S. salar and O. keta, indicating an altered acute-phase response. Moreover, O. keta displayed distinct interleukin-8 (IL-8) and serum amyloid P (SAP) responses. Impaired genetic expression or over-expression in these pathways may be evidence for species-specific pathways of susceptibility to the parasite. At L. salmonis attachment sites, reduced expression compared to non-attachment sites was observed for C/EBP-\u03b2 (S. salar), CRP (S. salar), SAP (S. salar, O. gorbuscha, O. keta), PGDS (S. salar, O. gorbuscha, O. keta), and major histocompatibility class II (MH class II, S. salar), suggesting local immunodepression.",

Because of recent changes in the geographic distribution of this species, there are questions as to how this organism responds physiologically to environmental cues. Molecular techniques allow for examination and new understanding of these physiological changes. Here, we describe the development of a microarray for high-throughput studies of the physiological ecology of C. finmarchicus. An EST database was generated for this species using a normalized cDNA library derived from adult and sub-adult individuals. Sequence data were clustered into contigs and annotated using Blastx. Target transcripts were selected, and unique, 50 base-pair, oligomer probes were generated for 995 genes. Blast2GO processing provided detailed information on gene function. The selected targets included broad representation of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. The microarray was tested in two sets of comparisons: adult females maintained at different food concentrations and field-caught sub-adults showing differences in lipid storage. Up-regulated and down-regulated transcripts were identified for both comparisons. Only a small subset of the genes up-regulated in low food individuals were also up-regulated in lipid-poor animals; no overlap was seen between the genes down-regulated in the two comparisons.",

While much is known about the physiological roles played by these molecules in crustaceans, little is known about them at the molecular level. Here, we have mined the genome of Daphnia pulex for genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes, receptors and transporters necessary for establishing each of these transmitter systems. The biosynthetic enzyme genes identified included nitric oxide synthase, heme oxygenase, choline acetyltransferase, glutaminase and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Genes encoding several transporters (e.g. vesicular acetylcholine transporter) were also characterized, as were ones involved in transmitter degradation/recycling (e.g. acetylcholine esterase); genes encoding receptors for NO and CO (i.e. soluble guanylyl cyclase), and for each small molecule transmitter (both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors for each compound) were identified.

Selection for divergent post-stress cortisol levels in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has yielded low- (LR) and high responsive (HR) lines. Recent reports show low behavioral flexibility in LR compared to HR fish and we hypothesize that this divergence is caused by differences in neural plasticity. Genes involved in neural plasticity and neurogenesis were investigated by quantitative PCR in brains of LR and HR fish at baseline conditions and in response to two different stress paradigms: short-term confinement (STC) and long-term social (LTS) stress. Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), neurogenic differentiation factor (NeuroD) and doublecortin (DCX) was generally higher in HR compared to LR fish. STC stress led to increased expression of PCNA and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in both lines, whereas LTS stress generally suppressed PCNA and NeuroD expression while leaving BDNF expression unaltered. These results indicate that the transcription of neuroplasticity-related genes is associated with variation in coping style, while also being affected by STC \u2013 and LTS stress in a biphasic manner. A higher degree of neural plasticity in HR fish may provide the substrate for enhanced behavioral flexibility.",

The mitochondrial genome of C. antiquata is of 17,384\u00a0bp in length, and encodes 35 genes, including 12 protein-coding, 21 transfer RNA, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes.

The largest non-coding region contains one section of tandem repeats (99 bp\u00a0\u00d7\u00a011), which is the second largest tandem repeats found in the mitochondrial genomes from Veneroida. The phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial genomes support the monophyly of Veneridae and Lucinidae, and the relationship at the family level: ((Veneridae\u00a0+\u00a0Mactridae)\u00a0+\u00a0(Cardiidae\u00a0+\u00a0Solecurtidae))\u00a0+\u00a0Lucinidae.

Using this method, a comparison of female and male mantle tissues containing mature gonad, revealed significant differences in glycerophosphatidylcholine (PC) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) metabolites. A number of other unidentified metabolites, including those putatively identified as conjugated sterols, were also differentially expressed between male and female mantle/gonadal tissue.",

Fish were exposed to the Flemish water quality standard for surface waters, being 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L, for 3\u00a0days. Sampled gill tissue was subjected to a 2D-Dige and an iTRAQ analysis. While gibel carp showed more positive responses such as increased apolipoprotein A-I, transferrin and heat shock protein 70, common carp's gill tissue on the other hand displayed a changed actin cytoskeleton, and indications of a changed metabolism. These last two traits were evident in rainbow trout as well, together with decreased expressions of transferrin and albumin. urthermore, the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis of rainbow trout data revealed a network of 98 proteins related to Cu accumulation in gill, of which the occurrence of proteins related to oxidative stress, such as superoxide dismutase and cytochrome c were promising. Additionally, the outcome of the different proteomics techniques demonstrates the usefulness of iTRAQ analysis compared to 2D-Dige and the need for fully annotated genomes.",

The goal of this study was to identify genes for which expression levels differ between dealated precopulatory females (virgins) and egg-laying queens of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki. We constructed a normalized polyphenic expressed sequence tag (EST) library that represents genomic material from most of the castes and life stages of the Formosan subterranean termite. Microarrays were designed using probes from this EST library and public genomic resources. Virgin females and queens were competitively hybridized to these microarrays and differentially expressed candidate genes were identified. Differential expression of eight genes was subsequently confirmed via reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-QPCR). When compared to virgins, queens had higher expression of genes coding for proteins related to immunity (gram negative binding protein), nutrition (e.g., termite-derived endo-beta-1,4-glucanase), protein storage, regulation of caste differentiation and reproduction (hexamerin, juvenile hormone binding protein). Queens also had higher transcript levels for genes involved in metabolism of xenobiotics, fat, and juvenile hormone (glutathione-S-transferase-like proteins, and cytochrome P450), among others. In particular, hexamerin, juvenile hormone binding protein, and a cytochrome P450 from the 4C subfamily are likely to be involved in initiating the inactive period during the reproductive cycle of the queen. Vice versa, virgins had higher expression than queens of genes related to respiration, probably due to recent flight activity, and several genes of unknown function.",

The GSTs were separated by 2D SDS-PAGE and characterised by MALDI-TOF analysis of tryptic peptides. The mass fragments were then matched against the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica sequences. GSTs were identified as coming from only the Sigma and Delta classes. The multiple Delta zones appear all to be derived from the Lucilia GSTD1 isoform. The distribution of these GST proteins has been studied during different developmental stages of the insect. Delta isoforms were present in all developmental stages of L. cuprina. The Sigma GST was not detectable in the egg, was just detectable in the larval and pupal stages and was the major GST isolated in the adult. Sigma and Delta isoforms were both found in all body segments of the insect. Both isoforms appear to undergo extensive post-translational modification.

Here, we expand this investigation, mining the D. pulex genome for proteins necessary for dopamine, octopamine and serotonin signaling. Using known Drosophila protein sequences, the D. pulex database was queried for genes encoding homologs of amine biosynthetic enzymes, receptors and transporters.

Additionally, the suitability of total RNA as well as mRNA from \u03b2-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and cyclophilin A (PPIA) for normalizing gene expression data was assessed, as compared to the use of an external RNA control. Measurements of HSP90 and HSC70 mRNA expression revealed that anoxia and reoxygenation have tissue- and gene-specific effects. By and large, the alterations support previous investigations on HSP protein abundance in the anoxic turtle heart and brain, as well as the hypothesized roles of HSP90 and HSC70 during stress and non-stress conditions. However, more prominent was a substantially increased HSP90 and HSC70 mRNA expression in the cardiac chambers with cold acclimation. The finding provides support for the notion that cold temperature induces a number of adaptations in tissues of anoxia-tolerant vertebrates that precondition them for winter anoxia. \u03b2-actin, GAPDH and PPIA mRNA expression and total RNA also varied with oxygenation state and acclimation temperature in a tissue- and gene-specific manner, as well as among tissue types, thus disqualifying them as suitable for real-time RT-PCR normalization.

To investigate the molecular-level responses of marine organisms exposed to oxygen depletion stress and to explore the differentially expressed genes induced or repressed by hypoxia, differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) was used with mRNAs from the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, under oxygen depletion and normal oxygen conditions. In total, 107 cDNA clones were differentially expressed under hypoxic conditions relative to the control mussel group. The differentially expressed genes were analyzed to determine the effects of hypoxia. They were classified into five functional categories: information storage and processing, cellular processes and signaling, metabolism, predicted general function only, and function unknown. The differentially expressed genes were predominantly associated with cellular processing and signaling, and they were particularly related to the signal transduction mechanism, posttranslational modification, and chaperone functions.

Antioxidant activities were measured as general stress markers. In clean context, emersion generated several over-expressions of proteins mainly involved in cytoskeleton, chaperoning, energetic metabolism and transcription regulation. Mussels exposed to PAHs showed equivalent accumulation levels of contaminants in both physiological conditions but an increased GST activity specifically in intertidal context, highlighting the high degree of stress underwent in this group, as well as over-expressions of Cu/Zn SOD and stress proteins in subtidal context. Presence of contaminants partly impacted the response to emersion: cytoskeletal rearrangements and energetic adjustments were mostly maintained whereas stress response was dramatically altered. These findings highlight the potential adverse effects of toxicants on physiological adjustments linked to air-exposure, thus suggesting to take into account in the evaluation of environmental risk the multiplicity of stresses that wild animals are likely to encounter.",

These transcripts encode for JmjC domain containing proteins JMJD6 and JMJD2C. JMJD6 transcription has not earlier been characterized to change in hypoxia.

In this study, we developed an oligo microarray platform using all available I. multifiliis expressed sequence tag (EST) information as well as probes designed through comparative genomics to other protozoa. Gene expression profiling for developmental and virulence factors was conducted using this platform. For the developmental study, the microarray was used to examine gene expression profiles between the three major life stages of Ich: infective theront, parasitic trophont, and reproductive tomont. A total of 135 putative I. multifiliis genes were found to be differentially expressed among all three life-stages. Examples of differentially expressed transcripts among life stages include immobilization antigens and epiplasmin, as well as various other transcripts involved in developmental regulation and host-parasite interactions. I. multifiliis has been shown to lose infectivity at later cell divisions potentially due to cellular senescence. Therefore, the microarray was also used to explore expression of senescence-associated genes as related to the passage number of the parasite. In this regard, comparison between tomont early and late passages yielded 493 differently expressed genes; 1478 differentially expressed genes were identified between trophont early and late passages. The EST-derived oligo microarray represents a first generation array of this ciliate and provided reproducible expression data as validated by quantitative RT-PCR.",

How the oxygen cascade from the external environment to the mitochondria may affect MMR has been the subject of much interest, but little is known about the metabolic profiles that underpin variation in MMR. We tested how seven generations of artificial selection for high mass-independent MMR affected metabolite profiles of two skeletal muscles (gastrocnemius and plantaris) and the liver. MMR was 12.3% higher in mass selected for high MMR than in controls. Basal metabolic rate was 3.5% higher in selected mice than in controls. Artificial selection did not lead to detectable changes in the metabolic profiles from plantaris muscle, but in the liver amino acids and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) metabolites were lower in high-MMR mice than in controls. In gastrocnemius, amino acids and TCA cycle metabolites were higher in high-MMR mice than in controls, indicating elevated amino acid and energy metabolism. Moreover, in gastrocnemius free fatty acids and triacylglycerol fatty acids were lower in high-MMR mice than in controls. Because selection for high MMR was associated with changes in the resting metabolic profile of both liver and gastrocnemius, the result suggests a possible mechanistic link between resting metabolism and MMR. In addition, it is well established that diet and exercise affect the composition of fatty acids in muscle. The differences that we found between control lines and lines selected for high MMR demonstrate that the composition of fatty acids in muscle is also affected by genetic factors.",

After quality assessment, the assembled expressed sequence tag (EST) translations were compared with the GenBank non-redundant (nr) amino acid sequence database using BLASTX. In the assembly stage 1, both 59,732 transcripts in liver and 103,526 transcripts in ovary were obtained. To identify the differently expressed genes in the ovary and liver tissues, all transcripts were sorted out with an expected value threshold of 1.00E-05. Consequently, 7168 contigs of ovary ESTs and 3855 contigs of liver ESTs were not overlapped for expression in both tissues, whereas 3763 contigs were commonly found in both tissues. Subsequently, we described the most highly represented genes in the liver and ovary of K. marmoratus. Isoforms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and receptor-related genes showed tissue-preferential expressed patterns. To identify the potential biomarkers in this species, ovary and liver ESTs were assembled and annotated with the nr amino acid sequence database using BLASTX.

The enzyme, although present in representatives of all living kingdoms, does not have a universal distribution. With the exception of \u03b5-proteobacteria, the enzyme was found in all eubacterial groups. In contrast with the known presence of the NDH-2 in Archaea, the alternative oxidase (AOX) is absent in this group. With regard to the Eukarya domain, the NDH-2 was found in representatives of Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia. In the latter, however, the presence of the enzyme was restricted to some primitive Metazoa (Placozoa and Cnidaria), and two members of the Deuterostomate lineage of the Bilateria (Echinodermata and Urochordata). No evidence for the presence of the NDH-2 was found in any representative of the Protostomate branch of the Bilateria, contrasting with the existence of the AOX in this same group. It is worth mentioning that those animal species containing the NDH-2 also have an AOX. The actual distribution of the NDH-2 in the various living kingdoms is discussed within the framework of the endosymbiotic theory; in addition, a hypothesis is proposed to explain the disappearance of the alternative NDH-2 and AOX from the majority of the animals.",

     "abstract": "Roxarsone is a commonly used additive in chicken (Gallus gallus) industry. However, little is known on the intrinsic molecular mechanism via which the growth performance of birds improves. This study was therefore performed to investigate the expression profiles of genes induced by roxarsone. Fifty-six broiler chickens were divided into two groups, namely treated and untreated with roxarsone. The treated group was provided a diet of 45.4\u00a0mg/kg roxarsone medication and the other group acted as control. Data analysis showed that roxarsone consistently and significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased chicken growth performance. In addition to this a significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase of arsenic residue in liver has been seen. Microarray expression analysis of 8935 genes in liver showed that 22 genes (10 up- and 12 down-regulated) had altered expression throughout the experimental periods. Two novel genes (GenBank accession no. GU724343 and GU724344) were cloned through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Gene GU724343 was predicted to encode an unidentified protein and the second gene GU724344 was presumed to encode a new member of immunoglobulin-like receptor (CHIR) family. Our results suggested for the first time that the role of roxarsone could be mainly to modify the expression levels of cell growth, immunity/defense and energy metabolism associated genes, as a result promoting animal growth. Further research on these genes should help to increase the knowledge of improving animal productivity safely and effectively.",

     "abstract": "In this study, gene transcription profiling in combination with the assessment of systemic parameters at individual and population levels were applied to study the (toxic) effects induced through temperature stress in the presence or the absence of an additional chemical stressor (nickel) in Daphnia magna. It was illustrated that lower temperatures were mainly characterized by a reduction of growth and lipid content, while higher temperatures caused an increase of both endpoints. Many of the differentially regulated transcripts could be correlated with processes affected at higher hierarchical levels of biological organization. Gene clusters with probable roles in producing offspring (peak expression at 22\u00a0\u00b0C), enhancing the metabolic rate (temperature related expression) and translational processes (increased expression at 14\u00a0\u00b0C) were identified. However, it was not possible to pinpoint a specific subset of genes, exclusively responding to temperature or nickel and allowing a retrospective identification of the particular stressor. Overall, extreme temperatures caused a higher level of stress in the organisms in comparison to nickel exposure. Moreover, organisms subjected to the natural stressor appeared to be less capable of dealing with the additional chemical stressor and as a result activate or repress more gene pathways.",

The genome of Daphnia pulex, the only crustacean genome available for public use, provides a unique resource for identifying putative circadian proteins in this species. Here, the Daphnia genome was mined for putative circadian protein genes using Drosophila melanogaster queries. The sequences of core clock (e.g. CLOCK, CYCLE, PERIOD, TIMELESS and CRYPTOCHROME 2), clock input (CRYPTOCHROME 1) and clock output (PIGMENT DISPERSING HORMONE RECEPTOR) proteins were deduced. Structural analyses and alignment of the Daphnia proteins with their Drosophila counterparts revealed extensive sequence conservation, particularly in functional domains. Comparisons of the Daphnia proteins with other sequences showed that they are, in most cases, more similar to homologs from other species, including vertebrates, than they are to those of Drosophila. The presence of both CRYPTOCHROME 1 and 2 in Daphnia suggests the organization of its clock may be more similar to that of the butterfly Danaus plexippus than to that of Drosophila (which possesses CRYPTOCHROME 1 but not CRYPTOCHROME 2). These data represent the first description of a putative circadian system from any crustacean, and provide a foundation for future molecular, anatomical and physiological investigations of circadian signaling in Daphnia.",

Anthropogenic ocean acidification (OA) is postulated to affect larval metamorphic success through an altered protein expression pattern (proteome structure) and post-translational modifications. To test this hypothesis, larvae of an economically and ecologically important barnacle species Balanus amphitrite, were cultured from nauplius to the cyprid stage in the present (control) and in the projected elevated concentrations of CO2 for the year 2100 (the OA treatment). Cyprid response to OA was analyzed at the total proteome level as well as two protein post-translational modification (phosphorylation and glycosylation) levels using a 2-DE based proteomic approach. The cyprid proteome showed OA-driven changes. Proteins that were differentially up or down regulated by OA come from three major groups, namely those related to energy-metabolism, respiration, and molecular chaperones, illustrating a potential strategy that the barnacle larvae may employ to tolerate OA stress. The differentially expressed proteins were tentatively identified as OA-responsive, effectively creating unique protein expression signatures for OA scenario of 2100. This study showed the promise of using a sentinel and non-model species to examine the impact of OA at the proteome level.",

Ciona intestinalis is more widespread with a cosmopolitan distribution ranging from tropical to sub-arctic zones, while Ciona savignyi is limited to temperate-latitudes of the northern Pacific Ocean. To compare the heat stress response between congeners, we quantified changes in protein expression using proteomics. Animals were exposed to 22\u00a0\u00b0C, 25\u00a0\u00b0C, and 28\u00a0\u00b0C for 6\u00a0h, then recovered at a control temperature (13\u00a0\u00b0C) for 16\u00a0h (high heat stress experiment).

A quantitative analysis, using 2D gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry (with a 69% and 93% identification rate for Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi, respectively), showed changes in a number of protein functional groups, including molecular chaperones, extracellular matrix proteins, calcium-binding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism. Our results indicate that C. intestinalis maintains higher constitutive levels of molecular chaperones than C. savignyi, suggesting that it is prepared to respond faster to thermal stress. Systematic discrepancies between estimated versus predicted molecular masses of identified proteins differed between protein families and were more pronounced under high heat conditions, suggesting that thermal sensitivities are lower for cytoskeletal proteins and ATP-synthase than for any other protein group represented on 2D gels.",

     "abstract": "Oxygen homeostasis is crucial for development, survival and normal function of all metazoans. A family of transcription factors called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) is critical in mediating the adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. The HIF transcription factor consists of a constitutively expressed \u03b2 subunit and an oxygen-dependent \u03b1 subunit; the abundance of the latter determines the activity of HIF and is regulated by a family of O2- and Fe2+-dependent enzymes prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Currently very little is known about the function of this important pathway and the molecular structure of its key players in hypoxia-tolerant intertidal mollusks including oysters, which are among the animal champions of anoxic and hypoxic tolerance and thus can serve as excellent models to study the role of HIF cascade in adaptations to oxygen deficiency. We have isolated transcripts of two key components of the oxygen sensing pathway \u2013 the oxygen-regulated HIF-\u03b1 subunit and PHD \u2013 from an intertidal mollusk, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, and determined the transcriptional responses of these two genes to anoxia, hypoxia and cadmium (Cd) stress. HIF-\u03b1 and PHD homologs from eastern oysters C. virginica show significant sequence similarity and share key functional domains with the earlier described isoforms from vertebrates and invertebrates. Phylogenetic analysis shows that genetic diversification of HIF and PHD isoforms occurred within the vertebrate lineage indicating functional diversification and specialization of the oxygen-sensing pathways in this group, which parallels situation observed for many other important genes. HIF-\u03b1 and PHD homologs are broadly expressed at the mRNA level in different oyster tissues and show transcriptional responses to prolonged hypoxia in the gills consistent with their putative role in oxygen sensing and the adaptive response to hypoxia. Similarity in amino acid sequence, domain structure and transcriptional responses between HIF-\u03b1 and PHD homologs from oysters and other invertebrate and vertebrate species implies the highly conserved functions of these genes throughout the evolutionary history of animals, in accordance with their critical role in oxygen sensing and homeostasis.",

A 4462-feature oligonucleotide microarray was used to analyze changes in transcript abundance in posterior ion-transporting gills at 8 time periods following transfer of animals from 32 to 10 or 15\u00a0ppt salinity. Transcripts encoding Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b1-subunit and cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase were upregulated with significant changes between 6 and 24\u00a0h post-transfer. Other transport proteins showing similar transcriptional upregulation were an organic cation transporter, a sodium/glucose cotransporter, an endomembrane protein associated with regulating plasma membrane protein composition, and a voltage-gated calcium channel. Transport proteins showing little transcriptional response included Na+/H+ exchanger, Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter, and V-type H+-ATPase B subunit, all of which have been implicated in osmoregulatory ion transport across crustacean gill. Interestingly, there was little affect of salinity dilution on transcriptional expression of stress proteins, suggesting that salinity acclimation is part of normal physiology for C. maenas. Expression of transcripts encoding a variety of mitochondrial proteins was significantly upregulated between 4\u00a0days and 7\u00a0days post-transfer, consistent with the proliferation of mitochondria-rich cells previously observed at this time.",

For instance, LR fish display prolonged retention of a fear response and of previously learnt routines, compared to HR fish. This study aims at investigating putative central nervous system mechanisms controlling behaviour and memory retention. The stress hormone cortisol is known to affect several aspects of cognition, including memory retention. Cortisol acts through glucocorticoid receptors 1 and 2 (GR1 and 2) and a mineralcorticoid receptor (MR), all of which are abundantly expressed in the salmonid brain. We hypothesized that different expressions of MR and GRs in LR and HR trout brains could be involved in the observed differences in cognition. We quantified the mRNA expression of GR1, GR2 and MR in different brain regions of stressed and non-stressed LR and HR trout. The expression of MR was higher in LR than in HR fish in all brain parts investigated. This could be associated with reduced anxiety and enhanced memory retention in LR fish. MR and GR1 expression was also subject to negative regulation by stress in a site-specific manner.",

Similar biological processes were altered by feed deprivation in these two sites, although twice as many genes were differentially expressed in the omental than in the perirenal adipose tissue. Taken together, the transcriptional changes involved in lipid metabolism (decreased lipid synthesis and triglyceride storage capacity as well as increased fatty acid oxidation) were consistent with reduced energy deposition in goat adipose tissues in response to a 48-h fast.

It is characterized by cycles between multi-day periods of torpor with low body temperature (Tb), and short periods of rapid, spontaneous rewarming. The ability to retain cellular integrity and function throughout torpor and rewarming is a key attribute of hibernation. Livers from winter hibernators are resistant to cellular damage induced by cold storage followed by warm reperfusion. Identifying proteins that differ between the summer-sensitive and winter-protected phenotypic states is one useful approach that may elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underlie this protection. Here we employ a novel quantitative proteomics screening strategy whereby a newly-weaned 13-lined ground squirrel was metabolically labeled by ingesting heavy-isotope substituted (15N) Spirulina. The liver protein extract from this animal provided a common reference for quantitative evaluation of protein differences by its addition to extracts from pooled samples of summer active (SA) or winter entrance (Ent) phase hibernating ground squirrels. We identified 61 significantly different proteins between the two groups and compared them to proteins identified previously in the same samples using 2D gels. Of the 20 proteins common to the two datasets, the direction and magnitude of their differences were perfectly concordant for 18, providing confidence that both sets of altered proteins reflect bona fide differences between the two physiological states. Furthermore, the 41 novel proteins recovered in this study included many new enzymes in pathways identified previously: specifically, additional enzymes belonging to the urea cycle, amino acid and carbohydrate degradation, and lipid biosynthetic pathways were decreased, whereas enzymes involved in ketone body synthesis, fatty acid utilization, protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis were increased in the samples from entrance hibernators compared to summer active animals, providing additional specific evidence for the importance of these pathways in the hibernating phenotype.",

Lys availability may thus limit protein synthesis and accretion, and growth of fish. Metabolic effects of dietary Lys imbalance were examined by 2D-proteomics using zebrafish as model. The Control diet (Lys: 2.47\u00a0g kg\u2212\u00a01) was based on zebrafish carcass AA profiles previously obtained. Two other experimental diets were deficient in Lys [Lys(\u2212); 1.34\u00a0g kg\u2212\u00a01] and Lys added in excess [Lys(+); 4.63\u00a0g kg\u2212\u00a01]. Fish growth was monitored from 33 to 49\u00a0days post-fertilization and the whole body proteome screened by means of two-dimension gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Growth rate was negatively affected in group Lys(\u2212). Comparative proteomic analysis showed 45 spots differentially expressed among groups. Twenty-nine of these proteins were identified revealing proteins involved in muscle growth, energy and lipid metabolism, eye lens differentiation, chaperone activity and apoptosis. Lys deficiency is accompanied by a down-regulation of muscle proteins and up-regulation of proteins affected by fasting, energy deficit, growth arrest and apoptosis. Excess Lys was accompanied by an up-regulation of proteins related to glycolysis, steroidogenesis and sexual maturation.",

     "abstract": "Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) catalyses the formation of carbamoyl phosphate from glutamine or ammonia, bicarbonate and ATP. There are three different isoforms of CPS that play vital roles in two metabolic pathways, pyrimidine biosynthesis (CPS II) and arginine/urea biosynthesis (CPS I and CPS III). Gene duplication has been proposed as the evolutionary mechanism creating this gene family with CPS II likely giving rise to the CPS I/III clade. In the evolutionary history of this gene family it is still undetermined when CPS I diverged from CPS III on the path to terrestriality in the vertebrates. Transitional organisms such as lungfishes are of particular interest because they are capable of respiring via gills and with lungs and therefore can be found in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Notably, enzymatic characterization of the mitochondrial CPS isoforms in this transitional group has not led to clear conclusions. In order to determine which CPS isoform is present in transitional animals, we examined partial sequences for liver CPS amplified from five species of lungfish, and a larger fragment of CPS from one lungfish species (Protopterus annectens) and compared them to CPS isoforms from other fish and mammals. Enzyme activities for P. annectens liver were also examined. While enzyme activities did not yield a clear distinction between isoforms (virtually equal activities were obtained for either CPS I or III), CPS sequences from the lungfishes formed a monophyletic clade within the CPS I clade and separate from the CPS III clade of other vertebrates. This finding implies that the mitochondrial isoform of CPS in lungfish is derived from CPS I and is likely to have a physiological function similar to CPS I. This finding is important because it supports the hypothesis that lungfish employ a urea cycle similar to terrestrial air-breathing vertebrates.",

In this study 454 cDNA sequencing method was used to characterize transcriptome in Apostichopus japonicus in order to investigate genes that are active in regeneration. Based on sequence similarity with known genes, our analysis identified 6590 genes expressed in the early stages of regeneration of the intestine and body wall. Assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and gene ontology terms. The transcription of genes associated with structural molecule activity was abundant during regeneration compared with the control sample (based on tissues from an uninjured animal). Many important genes involved in major intercellular signaling pathways associated with regeneration were identified, based on a KEGG database search. Our investigation also indicated the expression profiles of many genes associated with development, muscle dedifferentiation, ECM remolding and epigenetic reprogramming. During the early stages of regeneration we found that 324 genes were significantly up-regulated and 80 genes were significantly down-regulated. The top 25 genes that demonstrated the most significant differential expression during regeneration were verified using real-time PCR, which identified 90% consistency between these two approaches. The new candidate gene sequences, discovered for the first time in this study, will greatly enable future research \u2013 using the sea cucumber model \u2013 into the molecular mechanisms associated with intestine and body wall regeneration.",

Peptidomic analysis of norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of S. paratropicalis and X. andrei led to identification of multiple peptides with growth-inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Structural characterization demonstrated that the S. paratropicalis components comprised three peptides belonging to the caerulein-precursor fragment family (CPF-SP1, -SP2 and -SP3), two peptides from the xenopsin-precursor fragment family (XPF-SP1 and -SP2), and one peptide orthologous to peptide glycine\u2013leucine-amide (PGLa-SP1). The CPF peptides showed potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The X. andrei components comprised two peptides from the magainin family, (magainin-AN1 and -AN2), two from the XPF family (XPF-AN1 and -AN2), two from the PGLa family(PGLa-AN1 and -AN2), and one caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF-AN1).The primary structures of these peptides indicate a close phylogenetic relationship between X. andrei and the octoploid frog X. amieti. Under the same experimental conditions, seven orthologous antimicrobial peptides were previously isolated from the diploid frog S. tropicalis, nine from the tetraploid frog X. borealis, and five from the tetraploid frog X. clivii. The data indicate, therefore, that nonfunctionalization (gene deletion) has been the most common fate of duplicated antimicrobial peptide genes following polyploidization events in the Silurana and Xenopus lineages.",

Juvenile pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) migrate from natal freshwater systems to the ocean at a young age relative to other Pacific salmon, and require rapid development of appropriate defenses against marine pathogens. We analyzed the early transcriptomic responses of na\u00efve juvenile pink salmon of sizes 0.3\u00a0g (no scales), 0.7\u00a0g (mid-scale development) and 2.4\u00a0g (scales fully developed) six days after a low-level laboratory exposure to L. salmonis copepodids. All infected size groups exhibited unique transcriptional profiles. Inflammation and inhibition of cell proliferation was identified in the smallest size class (0.3\u00a0g), while increased glucose absorption and retention was identified in the middle size class (0.7\u00a0g). Tissue-remodeling genes were also up-regulated in both the 0.3\u00a0g and 0.7\u00a0g size groups. Profiles of the 2.4\u00a0g size class indicated cell-mediated immunity and possibly parasite-induced growth augmentation. Understanding a size-based threshold of resistance to L. salmonis is important for fisheries management. This work characterizes molecular responses reflecting the gradual development of innate immunity to L. salmonis between the susceptible (0.3\u00a0g) and refractory (2.4\u00a0g) pink salmon size classes.",

Comparative LPL amino acid sequences and protein structures and LPL gene locations were examined using data from several vertebrate genome projects. Mammalian LPL genes usually contained 9 coding exons on the positive strand. Vertebrate LPL sequences shared 58\u201399% identity as compared with 33\u201349% sequence identities with other vascular triglyceride lipases, hepatic lipase (HL) and endothelial lipase (EL). Two human LPL N-glycosylation sites were conserved among seven predicted sites for the vertebrate LPL sequences examined. Sequence alignments, key amino acid residues and conserved predicted secondary and tertiary structures were also studied. A CpG island was identified within the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the human LPL gene which may contribute to the higher than average (\u00d74.5 times) level of expression reported. Phylogenetic analyses examined the relationships and potential evolutionary origins of vertebrate lipase genes, LPL, LIPG (encoding EL) and LIPC (encoding HL) which suggested that these have been derived from gene duplication events of an ancestral neutral lipase gene, prior to the appearance of fish during vertebrate evolution. Comparative divergence rates for these vertebrate sequences indicated that LPL is evolving more slowly (2\u20133 times) than for LIPC and LIPG genes and proteins.",

The Atlantic cod is also under potential threat from various environmental changes such as pollution and climate change, but the biological impact of such changes are not well known, in particular when it comes to sublethal effects that can be difficult to assert. Modern molecular and genomic approaches have revolutionized biological research during the last decade, and offer new avenues to study biological functions and e.g. the impact of anthropogenic activities at different life-stages for a given organism. In order to develop genomic data and genomic tools for Atlantic cod we conducted a program were we constructed 20 cDNA libraries, and produced and analyzed 44006 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from these. Several tissues are represented in the multiple cDNA libraries, that differ in either sexual maturation or immulogical stimulation. This approach allowed us to identify genes that are expressed in particular tissues, life-stages or in response to specific stimuli, and also gives us information about potential functions of the transcripts. The ESTs were used to construct a 16\u00a0k cDNA microarray to further investigate the cod transcriptome. Microarray analyses were preformed on pylorus, pituitary gland, spleen and testis of sexually maturing male cod. The four different tissues displayed tissue specific transcriptomes demonstrating that the cDNA array is working as expected and will prove to be a powerful tool in further experiments.",

This paper describes the development and assessment of ONM platforms for Atlantic salmon. The process started with the establishment of a bioinformatic system, selection of a low redundancy set of nucleotide sequences providing coverage of transcriptomes of several fish species, their identification by protein products and annotations. Pilot experiments were performed to address issues that are essential for development of ONM: gene composition, quality assessment, hybridization success of homologous and heterologous probes, optimum numbers of spot replicates and processing, management and mining of gene expression data. Performance of microarrays was evaluated in two experiments with Atlantic salmon. Comparison of peripheral blood leukocytes with a mixture of other tissues was conducted for characterization of the leukocyte transcriptome. Analyses of salmon infected with different viral diseases identified virus-responsive genes that can be used as markers for diagnostics of infected status of fish.

EST-based microarray chips were constructed for cultured fish and shellfish species including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Using the flounder microarray chip, the efficacy of two DNA vaccines derived from pathogenic viruses [hirame rhabdovirus (HRV) and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV)] was evaluated through gene expression profiles.

Their often potent properties and widespread prevalence in fish suggests that designing means of manipulating their levels has considerable potential for maintaining or improving fish health. There is evidence that a number of chronic stresses lead to significant downregulation of AMPPs and thus their monitoring could be a highly sensitive measure of health status and risk of an infectious disease outbreak. Conversely, upregulation of AMPP expression could be used to enhance disease resistance in stressful environments, as well as improve the efficacy of traditional antimicrobial drugs. However, further work is required in linking levels of a number of AMPPs to physiological function since, while a number of studies have documented the down- or upregulation of AMPPs via gene expression, relatively few studies have quantitatively examined changes in protein expression. In addition, not all AMPPs appear to be expressed at microbicidal levels in vivo, suggesting that at least some may have functions other than being directly protective. Nonetheless, in fish, there is evidence that some constitutively expressed AMPPs, such as piscidins and histone-like proteins, are expressed at microbicidal levels and that they decline with stress. Furthermore, certain AMPPs derived from hemoglobin-\u03b2 are upregulated to microbicidal levels after experimental challenge. The likely widespread distribution of these three AMPP groups in fish provides the opportunity to design strategies to greatly improve the health of cultured fish populations.",

The transplanted trout spermatogonia migrated towards the gonadal anlagen of the recipient salmon, into which they were subsequently incorporated. We confirmed that the donor-derived spermatogonia resumed gametogenesis, and produced sperm and eggs in male and female recipient salmon, respectively. Fertilization of the resultant eggs and sperm produced only rainbow trout in the first filial (F1) generation, suggesting that the sterile triploid recipient salmon produced functional eggs and sperm derived from the trout donors.

The main human dietary source for n\u2212\u00a03LC-PUFA is fish and seafood, and over 50% of global fish production is currently supplied by aquaculture. However, increasing pressure to include vegetable oils, which are devoid of n\u2212\u00a03LC-PUFA, in aquaculture feeds reduces their content in farmed fish flesh. The aim of this study was to measure the heritability and infer mechanisms determining flesh n\u2212\u00a03LC-PUFA content in Atlantic salmon. This was achieved by analysing flesh lipid parameters in 48 families of Atlantic salmon and by measuring differences, by high density microarray, in hepatic mRNA expression in families with high and low flesh n\u2212\u00a03LC-PUFA. The results show that flesh n\u2212\u00a03LC-PUFA composition is a highly heritable trait (h2\u00a0=\u00a00.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14).

A total of 20,779 SNPs were identified over the 1469 gene loci and intergenic space analysed. Within chromosomes the occurrence of SNPs was the lowest in exons and higher in introns and intergenic regions, which may be explained by the fact, that coding regions are under strong selective pressure to maintain their biological function. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous mutations was smaller than one for all the chromosomes, suggesting that most of deleterious nonsynonymous mutations were eliminated by negative selection. SNPs were not uniformly distributed over the chromosomes. Two chromosomes exhibited large regions with extremely low SNP density, which might represent homozygous regions in the diploid genome. The results of this study show how SNP detection can take profit from sequencing a single diploid individual, but also uncover the limits of such an approach.

Furthermore, the expression of TLR7 mRNA was investigated in normal tissues of carp by semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis. Carp TLR7 expression was exhibited in healthy tissues (kidney, brain, spleen, skin, intestine, muscle, liver, gills and heart) and though the expression level in each tissue varied among healthy fish. Carp TLR7 expression was significantly increased in head kidney stimulated with TLR7 agonist, imiquimod, at 8, 24 and 48\u00a0h in vitro when compared to expression in the control group. Moreover, carp head kidney leukocytes produced elevated levels of pro-inflammatory and type 1 interferon cytokine mRNA in response to imiquimod stimulation.",

     "abstract": "The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the clam Meretrix lusoria (Bivalvia: Veneridae) was determined. It comprises 20,268 base pairs (bp) and contains 13 protein-coding genes, including ATPase subunit 8 (atp8), two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs, and a non-coding control region. The atp8 encodes a protein of 39 amino acids. All genes are encoded on the same strand. A putative control region (CR or D-loop) was identified in the major non-coding region (NCR) between the tRNAGly and tRNAGln. A 1087\u00a0bp tandem repeat fragment was identified that comprises nearly 11 copies of a 101\u00a0bp motif and accounts for approximately 41% of the NCR. The 101\u00a0bp tandem repeat motif of the NCR can be folded into a stem\u2013loop secondary structure. Samples of eight individuals from Hainan and Fujian provinces were collected and their NCR regions were successfully amplified and sequenced. The data revealed a highly polymorphic VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) associated with high levels of heteroplasmy in the D-loop region. The size of the CR ranged from 1942 to 3354\u00a0bp depending upon the copy number of the repeat sequence.",

Several metabolites varied and allowed differentiation between hibernators and spring squirrels, and between torpid and euthermic squirrels. Methionine and the short-chain carnitine esters of propionate and butyryate/isobutyrate were reduced in LT compared with the euthermic groups. Pantothenic acid and several lysophosphatidylcholines were elevated in LT relative to the euthermic groups, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamines were elevated during IBA compared to LT and spring animals. Two regulatory lipids varied among the groups: sphingosine 1-phosphate was lower in LT vs. euthermic groups, whereas cholesterol sulfate was elevated in IBA compared to spring squirrels. Levels of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and total NEFA tended to be elevated in hibernators relative to spring squirrels. Three long-chain acylcarnitines were reduced in LT relative to IBA; free carnitine was also lower in LT vs. IBA. Our results identified several biochemical changes not previously observed in the seasonal hibernation cycle, including some that may provide insight into the metabolic limitations of mammalian torpor.",

Despite those well-documented changes in cattle fed HC diets, there is currently a paucity of data describing the molecular events regulating the ruminal environment. Our objective was to gain an understanding of which genes are differentially expressed in ruminal tissue from Holstein cows fed a HC comparing to low concentrate (LC) diet using microarray analysis using a bovine 24\u00a0k microarray. A total of 5,200 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were detected for cows fed HC relative to LC. The DEG were firstly annotated with gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), indicating that the DEG were associated with catalytic activity and MAPK pathway, respectively. Further characterization using GeneCodis identified patterns of interrelated annotations for the DEG to elucidate the relationships among annotation groups revealed that a cAMP-dependent protein kinase A catalytic subunit beta (PRKACB), may be associated with ruminal tissue maintenance. The results contributed to understanding of the regulatory mechanisms at the mRNA level for Holstein cows fed at different concentrate ratio diets.",

ANOVA analysis revealed 2175 genes differentially expressed in inhibitor-treated larvae compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), including genes related to proteases that were mostly up-regulated, namely cathepsins B and L, chymotrypsins, and nonproteolytic cysteine cathepsin or serine protease homologs.

Three isoforms (neuronal, inducible and endothelial), encoded by different loci, have been described in vertebrates, although the endothelial isoform seems to be restricted to tetrapods. In invertebrates, a variety of NOS isoforms have been variably annotated as \u201cinducible\u201d or \u201cneuronal\u201d, while others lack precise annotation. We have performed an exhaustive collection of the available NOS amino-acid sequences in order to perform a phylogenetic analysis. We hypothesized that the NOS isoforms reported in vertebrates derive from 1) different invertebrate NOS, 2) a single invertebrate ancestral gene, through an event related to the double whole genomic duplication that occurred at the origin of vertebrates, and 3) the endothelial form of NOS appeared late in the evolution of vertebrates, after the split of tetrapods and fishes. Our molecular evolution analysis strongly supports the second scenario, the three vertebrate NOS isoforms derived from a single ancestral invertebrate gene. Thus, the diverse NOS isoforms in invertebrates can be explained by events of gene duplication, but their characterization as \u201cinducible\u201d or \u201cneuronal\u201d should only be justified by physiological features, since they are evolutionarily unrelated to the homonym isoforms of vertebrates.",

Proteins from leukocyte extracts were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the major bands were excised, digested and analyzed by on-line nano-LC MS/MS to generate peptide sequences. The sequences generated were used to identify proteins and characterize their functions. The protein identity and characterization of the protein function were based on matching two or more peptides to the same protein by searching against the NCBI database using MASCOT and Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). For those proteins with only one peptide matching, the phylum of the matched protein was considered. Forty-three proteins were identified that exhibit sequence similarities to proteins from other vertebrates. Proteins related to the cytoskeletal system were the most abundant proteins identified. These proteins are known to regulate cell mobility and phagocytosis. Several other peptides were matched to proteins that potentially have immune-related function.",

Docking scores calculated for these ligands showed reasonably good binding interactions to C. pugilator RXR. Furthermore, RXR is the receptor that mediates the different activities of neurotransmitters and opioid against naloxone in crustaceans and possibly other species.

These also results suggest a 3-D model of C. pugilator RXR that describes the binding of ligands at a single RXR receptor binding site and offers further insight into the binding of structurally diverse ligands to this receptor. Further, computational studies showed that crustacean RXRs might be closer to vertebrate RXR than to insect RXR.

From these lines cDNA libraries were derived and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated. From the SAE cell line 4303 unique transcripts were identified, with 1848 of these representing unknown sequences (showing no BLASTX identification). From the LEE-1 cell line, 3660 unique transcripts were identified, and unknown, unique sequences totaled 1333. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation showed that GO assignments for the two cell lines were in general similar. These results suggest that the procedures used to derive the cell lines led to isolation of cell types of the same general embryonic origin from both species. The LEE-1 transcripts included GO categories \u201cenvelope\u201d and \u201coxidoreductase activity\u201d but the SAE transcripts did not. GO analysis of SAE transcripts identified the category \u201canatomical structure formation\u201d that was not present in LEE-1 cells. Increased organelle compartments may exist within LEE-1 cells compared to SAE cells, and the higher oxidoreductase activity in LEE-1 cells may indicate a role for these cells in responses associated with innate immunity or in steroidogenesis. These EST libraries from elasmobranch cell lines provide information for assembly of genomic sequences and are useful in revealing gene diversity, new genes and molecular markers, as well as in providing means for elucidation of full-length cDNAs and probes for gene array analyses.

In this study, in silico methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, secondary and tertiary structures, and gene locations for acid lipase genes and encoded proteins using data from several mammalian genome projects. Mammalian acid lipase genes were located within a gene cluster for each of the 8 mammalian genomes examined, including human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pons troglodytes), rhesus monkey (Macacca mulatta), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), cow (Bos taurus), horse (Equus caballus) and dog (Canis familaris), with each containing 9 coding exons. Human and mouse acid lipases shared 44\u201387% sequence identity and exhibited sequence alignments and identities for key amino acid residues and conservation of predicted secondary and tertiary structures with those previously reported for human gastric lipase (LIPF) (Roussel et al., 1999). Evidence for a new family of acid lipase genes is reported for mouse and rat genomes, designated as Lipo. Mouse acid lipase genes are subject to differential mRNA tissue expression, with Lipa showing wide tissue expression, while others have a more restricted tissue expression in the digestive tract (Lipf), salivary gland (Lipo) and epidermal tissues (Lipk, Lipm and Lipn).

On the one hand, shrimp were exposed for 7\u00a0days to the antibiotics enrofloxacin or furazolidone via feed (4\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121) under laboratory conditions. On the other hand, shrimp were submitted to enrofloxacin directly in field conditions in Vietnam, for which two different culture systems were distinguished (intensive and improved extensive). No significant different protein abundance pattern was induced by antibiotics under laboratory conditions, while only one protein spot displayed a 1.53-fold reduction in intensity after exposure to enrofloxacin in improved extensive ponds. When we compared the proteome of shrimp bred either in intensive or in improved extensive system, we observed 9 protein spots displaying significant difference in abundance. Among them, 3 spots of hemocyanin were under-expressed in shrimp from improved extensive ponds. At the opposite 2 spots corresponding to Sarcoplasmic Calcium-binding Protein (SCP) were less abundant in hemolymph of shrimp from intensive ponds. These results demonstrate that the very subtle effects of tested antibiotics on patterns of hemolymph protein expression are overwhelmed by the effects of conditions encountered in different production management systems, such as different oxygen and nitric concentrations.",

Many studies have successfully exploited the adipocyte differentiation, but most of them were not related to depot-specificity, particularly using freshly isolated primary preadipocytes. Using 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with sequencing mass spectrometry, we searched and compared the proteins differentially expressed in undifferentiated and differentiated preadipocytes from bovine omental, subcutaneous and intramuscular adipose depots. Our proteome mapping strategy to identify differentially expressed intracellular proteins during adipogenic conversion revealed 65 different proteins that were found to be common for the three depots. Further, we validated the differential expression for a subset of proteins by immunoblotting analyses. The results demonstrated that many structural proteins were down-regulated during differentiation of preadipocytes from all the depots. Most up-regulated proteins like Ubiquinol\u2013cytochrome-c reductase complex core protein I (UQCRC1), ATP synthase D chain, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), Sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1), Carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2) and Heat-shock protein beta 1 (HSPB1) across the three depots were found to be associated with lipid metabolism and metabolic activity.

In order to have an overview of the molecular diversity of the O. huwena venom, the datasets of all the transcripts, peptides and proteins known so far were analyzed. A comparison of the data obtained through a proteomic versus a transcriptomic approach, revealed that only 15 putative cystine knot toxins (CKTs) were identified by both approaches, 29 transcripts coding for CKTs were found in the transcriptome but not as translated peptides in the venom proteome. However, no cellular protein with identical molecular weight was identified by both approaches.

Therefore triploid shrimp ovary is possible to be taken as a model to understand the mechanism of ovary development of shrimp compared to that of the ovary of diploid shrimp at the same age. In the present study, a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) technique was applied to identify differentially expressed genes in the ovary between diploid and triploid shrimp. For the forward library (RNA from the ovary of triploid shrimp as the tester), 54 genes were identified. For the reverse library (RNA from the ovary of diploid shrimp as the tester), 16 genes were identified. The identified genes encoded proteins with multiple functions, including extracellular matrix components, cytoskeleton, cell growth and death, metabolism, genetic information processing, signal transduction/transport or immunity related proteins. Eleven differentially expressed genes were selected to be confirmed in the ovaries of triploid and diploid shrimp by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Genes encoding spermatogonial stem-cell renewal factor, cytochrome c oxidase subunits I and II, clottable protein, antimicrobial peptide and transposase showed up-regulated expressions in the ovary of triploid shrimp. Genes encoding tubulin, cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein, farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase, thrombospondin and heat shock protein 90 genes showed higher expressions in the ovary of diploid shrimp. The differential expressions of the above genes are suggested to be related to the ovary development of shrimp.

The latter can be involved in replication and termination processes. The total length of the pooled protein-coding, rRNA, and tRNA genes is shorter than those of other crustaceans. In addition, the intergenic spacers of the O. nanseni mitogenome are considerably shorter in length than those of other crustaceans. Fourteen adjacent genes overlap, resulting in a compact mitogenomic structure. In the O. nanseni mitogenome, the AT composition is elevated, particularly in the control regions (78.9% AT), as has been demonstrated for two other amphipods. The tRNA order is highly rearranged compared to other arthropod mitogenomes, but the order of protein-coding genes and rRNAs is largely conserved. The gene cluster between the CO1 and CO3 genes is completely conserved among all amphipods compared.

Here, we attempt to study the effect of energy balance in ovine G6PD transcript expression, trying simultaneously to find out any potential physiological role of the oG6PDB transcript. Changes of energy balance that lead to synergistic changes in the expression of both transcripts, but in opposite directions and not in a proportional way. Negative energy balance favours the presence of the oG6PDB transcript leading to a significant increase of its expression, compared to oG6PDA expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast, positive energy balance leads to a significant increase of oG6PDA compared to oG6PDB expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In either condition oG6PDB expression is unchanged.

     "abstract": "A comparative proteomic approach was used to assess the protein expression profile in the liver of 34\u00a0days old pikeperch larvae fed from day 10 post hatching, with three isoproteic and isolipidic formulated diets varying by their phospholipid (PL) contents (% dry diet weight): 1.4% (PL1), 4.7% (PL5) and 9.5% (PL9). Using 2D-DIGE minimal labelling of liver extracts, we were able to show 56 protein spots with a differential intensity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) depending on the dietary PL content. Among these spots, 11 proteins were unambiguously identified using nanoLC-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry. In the PL9 larvae, our results indicate that the glycolytic pathway could be down-regulated due to the under-expression of the fructose biphosphate aldolase B and the phosphoglucomutase 1. Meanwhile, propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase (a gluconeogenic enzyme) was under-expressed. In addition, another gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, was identified in 3 different spots as being under-expressed in fish fed with the intermediate PL level (PL5). A high PL content increased the expression of sarcosine dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in methionine metabolism, along with vinculin, a structural protein. Moreover, several stress proteins (glutathione S-transferase M, glucose regulated protein 75 and peroxiredoxin-1) were modulated in response to the dietary PL level and fatty acid composition. In the larvae fed with the lowest dietary PL content (PL1), over-expression of both GSTM and GRP75 might indicate a cellular stress in this experimental treatment, while the under-expression of Prx1 might indicate a lower defence against oxidative stress. In conclusion, this nutriproteomic approach showed significant modifications of protein expression in the liver of pikeperch larvae fed different PL contents, highlighting the importance of these nutrients and their influence on metabolism processes and on stress response.",

A significant number (497) of ESTs did not match existing Aplysia ESTs and are thus potentially novel sequences for Aplysia.

The gastroliths are deposits of calcium carbonate derived from the digested cuticle contributing the mineral to the newly formed exoskeleton at postmolt. The late premolt stage was characterized by a dramatic general up-regulation of genes in the gastrolith disk. This phenomenon is explained by the gastrolith disk function rapid formation of the relatively large gastrolith during a short period of time. Besides genes of general importance for this dramatic change, three genes related to the chitin\u2013protein\u2013mineral structure were identified. The cDNA and the deduced protein of the novel one of them, the chitin deacetylase 1 (Cq-CDA1) was fully characterized and its resemblance to already characterized structural proteins of the gastrolith matrix was described.

Skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from 3 horses suffering from acute tying-up and 3 healthy horses. We performed 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry for identification of proteins that are differentially expressed in tying-up. 2D gel electrophoresis of skeletal muscle sequential extracts yielded more than 350 protein spots on each gel, of which 14 were differentially expressed more than two-fold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In-gel digestion followed by peptide mass fingerprinting enabled identification of three significantly increased proteins: alpha actin, tropomyosin alpha chain and creatine kinase M chain (CKM). CKM was represented by multiple spots probably due to posttranslational modification, one of which appeared to be unique for tying-up. Since changes in the rates of synthesis and degradation of proteins are likely to lead to pathological conditions, identification of differentially expressed proteins in acute tying-up might result in the finding of more specific diagnostic markers and in new hypotheses for the common mechanisms that result in this condition.

In order to better understand these coordinated events, microarray analysis was used to compare gene expression in chondrocytes isolated from the proliferative and hypertrophic zones of the avian growth plate. RT-PCR was used to confirm the identity of a select number of genes. The expression of 745 genes was found to differ 3-fold or greater at the 0.05 level of probability. Transferrin was the most highly up-regulated (321-fold) gene associated with chondrocyte hypertrophy. Immunohistochemistry localized this peptide adjacent to the penetrating blood vessels in the growth plate of 3-week-old chicks. Fibulin, OC-116, DMP-1 and PHEX were among the expanded number of genes associated with extracellular matrix metabolism. The presence of NELL2, ATOH8 and PLEXIN suggests a neuronal involvement in growth plate physiology. In addition, the expression of a large number of genes associated with angiogenesis and cellular stress was up-regulated. These processes are important to the physiology and survival of chondrocytes in the unique and stressful environment of the epiphyseal growth plate.",

     "abstract": "Phosphorus (P)-responsive genes and how they regulate renal adaptation to phosphorous-deficient diets in animals, including fish, are not well understood. RNA abundance profiling using cDNA microarrays is an efficient approach to study nutrient\u2013gene interactions and identify these dietary P-responsive genes. To test the hypothesis that dietary P-responsive genes are differentially expressed in fish fed varying P levels, rainbow trout were fed a practical high-P diet (R20: 0.96% P) or a low-P diet (R0: 0.38% P) for 7\u00a0weeks. The differentially-expressed genes between dietary groups were identified and compared from the kidney by combining suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) with cDNA microarray analysis. A number of genes were confirmed by real-time PCR, and correlated with plasma and bone P concentrations. Approximately 54 genes were identified as potential dietary P-responsive after 7\u00a0weeks on a diet deficient in P according to cDNA microarray analysis. Of 18 selected genes, 13 genes were confirmed to be P-responsive at 7\u00a0weeks by real-time PCR analysis, including: iNOS, cytochrome b, cytochrome c oxidase subunit II , \u03b1-globin I, \u03b2-globin, ATP synthase, hyperosmotic protein 21, COL1A3, Nkef, NDPK, glucose phosphate isomerase 1, Na+/H+ exchange protein and GDP dissociation inhibitor 2. Many of these dietary P-responsive genes responded in a moderate way (R0/R20 ratio: <\u00a02\u20133 or >\u00a00.5) and in a transient manner to dietary P limitation. In summary, renal adaptation to dietary P deficiency in trout involves changes in the expression of several genes, suggesting a profile of metabolic stress, since many of these differentially-expressed candidates are associated with the cellular adaptative responses.",

     "abstract": "The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence of the Australian fresh water isopod Eophreatoicus sp.-14 has been determined. The new species is a member of the taxon Phreatoicidea, a clade of particular interest, as it is often regarded as the sister group to all other Isopoda. Although the overall genome organization of Eophreatoicus sp.-14 conforms to the typical state of Metazoa\u2014it is a circular ring of DNA hosting the usual 37 genes and one major non-coding region\u2014it bears a number of derived characters that fall within the scope of \u201cgenome morphology\u201d. Earlier studies have indicated that the isopod mitochondrial gene order is not as conserved as that of other crustaceans. Indeed, the mt genome of Eophreatoicus sp.-14 shows an inversion of seven genes (including cox1), which is as far as we know unique. Even more interesting is the derived arrangement of nad1, trnL(CUN), rrnS, control region, cob, trnT, nad5 and trnF that is shared by nearly all available isopod mt genomes. A striking feature is the close proximity of the rearranged genes to the mt control region. Inferable gene translocation events are, however, more suitable to trace the evolution of mt genomes. Genes like nad1/trnL(CUN) and nad5/trnF, which retained their adjacent position after being rearranged, were most likely translocated together. A very good example for the need to understand the mechanisms of translocations is the remolding of trnL(UUR) to trnL(CUN). Both tRNA genes are adjacent and have a high sequence similarity, probably the result of a gene duplication and subsequent anticodon mutation. Modified secondary structures were found in three tRNAs of Eophreatoicus sp.-14, which are all characterized by the loss of the DHU-arm. This is common to crustaceans for tRNA Serine(AGY), while the arm-loss in tRNA Cysteine within Malacostraca is only shared by other isopods. Modification of the third tRNA, Isoleucine, is not known from any other related species. Nucleotide frequencies of genes have been found to be indirectly correlated to the orientation of the mitochondrial replication process. In Eophreatoicus sp.-14 and in other Isopoda the associated nucleotide bias is inversed to the state of other Malacostraca. This is a strong indication for an inversion of the control region that most likely evolved in the isopod ancestor.",

     "abstract": "BLAT (BLAST-Like Alignment Tool) analyses of the opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) genomes were undertaken using amino acid sequences of the acylglycerol acyltransferase (AGAT) superfamily. Evidence is reported for 8 opossum monoacylglycerol acyltransferase-like (MGAT) (E.C. 2.3.1.22) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase-like (DGAT) (E.C. 2.3.1.20) genes and proteins, including DGAT1, DGAT2, DGAT2L6 (DGAT2-like protein 6), AWAT1 (acyl CoA wax alcohol acyltransferase 1), AWAT2, MGAT1, MGAT2 and MGAT3. Three of these genes (AWAT1, AWAT2 and DGAT2L6) are closely localized on the opossum X chromosome. Evidence is also reported for six zebrafish MGAT- and DGAT-like genes, including two DGAT1-like genes, as well as DGAT2-, MGAT1-, MGAT2- and MGAT3-like genes and proteins. Predicted primary, secondary and transmembrane structures for the opossum and zebrafish MGAT-, AWAT- and DGAT-like subunits and the intron\u2013exon boundaries for genes encoding these enzymes showed a high degree of similarity with other members of the AGAT superfamily, which play major roles in triacylglyceride (DGAT), diacylglyceride (MGAT) and wax ester (AWAT) biosynthesis. Alignments of predicted opossum, zebrafish and other vertebrate DGAT1, DGAT2, other DGAT2-like and MGAT-like amino acid sequences with known human and mouse enzymes demonstrated conservation of residues which are likely to play key roles in catalysis, lipid binding or in maintaining structure. Phylogeny studies of the human, mouse, opossum, zebrafish and pufferfish MGAT- and DGAT-like enzymes indicated that the common ancestors for these genes predated the appearance of bony fish during vertebrate evolution whereas the AWAT- and DGAT2L6-like genes may have appeared more recently prior to the appearance of marsupial and eutherian mammals.",

     "abstract": "The major aim of the present study was to investigate the proteome of standardbred horses at different stages of training and intensified training. We searched for biomarkers using small skeletal muscle biopsies of live animals. 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were successfully applied to investigate training-induced differential expression of equine muscle biopsy proteins. Despite the poor resolution of the equine genome and proteome, we were able to identify the proteins of 20 differential spots representing 16 different proteins. Evaluation of those proteins complies with adaptation of the skeletal muscle after normal training involving structural changes towards a higher oxidative capacity, an increased capacity to take up long-chain fatty acids, and to store energy in the form of glycogen. Intensified training leads to additional changed spots. Alpha-1-antitrypsin was found increased after intensified training but not after normal training. This protein may thus be considered as a marker for overtraining in horses and also linked to overtraining in human athletes.",

     "abstract": "The complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genomes were determined for the three pelagic chaetognaths, Sagitta nagae, Sagitta decipiens, and Sagitta enflata. The mitochondrial genomes of these species which were 11,459, 11,121, and 12,631\u00a0bp in length, respectively, contained 14 genes (11 protein-coding genes, one transfer RNA gene, and two ribosomal RNA genes), and were found to have lost 23 genes that are present in the typical metazoan mitochondrial genome. The same mitochondrial genome contents have been reported from the benthic chaetognaths belonging to the family Spadellidae, Paraspadella gotoi and Spadella cephaloptera. Within the phylum Chaetognatha, Sagitta and Spadellidae are distantly related, suggesting that the gene loss occurred in the ancestral species of the phylum. The gene orders of the three Sagitta species are markedly different from those of the other non-Chaetognatha metazoans. In contrast to the region with frequent gene rearrangements, no gene rearrangements were observed in the gene cluster encoding COII\u2013III, ND1\u20133, srRNA, and tRNAmet. Within this conserved gene cluster, gene rearrangements were not observed in the three Sagitta species or between the Sagitta and Spadellidae species. The gene order of this cluster was also assumed to be the ancestral state of the phylum.",

     "abstract": "ApoC-I, the smallest of the soluble apolipoproteins, associates with both TG-rich lipoproteins and HDL. Mass spectral analyses of human apoC-I previously had demonstrated that in the circulation there are two forms, either a 57 amino acid protein or a 55 amino acid protein, due to the loss of two amino acids from the N-terminus. In our analyses of the apolipoproteins of the other great apes by mass spectrometry, four forms of apoC-I were detected. Two of these showed a high degree of identity to the mature and truncated forms of human apoC-I. The other two were homologous to the virtual protein and its truncated form that are encoded by a human pseudogene. In humans, the genes for apoC-I and its pseudogene are located on chromosome 19, the pseudogene being 2.5\u00a0kb downstream from the apoC-I gene. Based on the similarity between the apoC-I gene and the pseudogene, it has been concluded that the latter arose from the former as a result of gene duplication approximately 35\u00a0Mya. Interestingly, the virtual protein encoded by the pseudogene is acidic, not basic like apoC-I. In the chimpanzee, there also are two genes for apoC-I, the one upstream encodes a basic protein and the downstream gene, rather than being a pseudogene, encodes an acidic protein (P86336). In addition to reporting on the molecular masses of great ape apoC-I, we were able to clearly demonstrate by \u201cTop-down\u201d sequencing that the acidic form arose from a separate gene. In our analyses, we have measured the molecular masses of apoC-I associated with the HDL of the following great apes: bonobo (Pan paniscus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii). Genomic variations in chromosome 19 among great apes, baboons and macaques as they relate to both genes for apoC-I and the pseudogene are compared and discussed.",
