     "abstract": "Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are multipotent mesenchymal stem cells that have the ability to differentiate into several cell types, including chondrocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and neural cells. Given their easy accessibility and abundance, they became an attractive source of mesenchymal stem cells, as well as candidates for developing new treatments for reconstructive medicine and tissue engineering. Our study identifies a new signaling pathway that promotes ADSCs osteogenic differentiation and links the lipid signaling enzyme phospholipase C (PLC)-\u03b21 to the expression of the cell cycle protein cyclin E. During osteogenic differentiation, PLC-\u03b21 expression varies concomitantly with cyclin E expression and the two proteins interact. These findings contribute to clarify the pathways involved in osteogenic differentiation and provide evidence to develop therapeutic strategies for bone regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLC\u03b2) is a membrane-associated enzyme activated by membrane receptors, especially G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

In pancreatic \u03b2-cells, PLC\u03b2-mediated signaling activated by various factors, such as free fatty acids and neuronal and hormonal ligands, has been confirmed as being involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, and PLC\u03b2s have been regarded as essential mediators for augmenting insulin secretion.

Recent advances in the field of human iPSCs have opened the way to a better understanding of the biology of human diseases.Disease-specific iPSCs provide an unparalleled opportunity to establish novel human cell-based disease models, with the potential to enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying human malignancies, and to accelerate the identification of effective new drugs. When combined with genome editing technologies, iPSCs represent a new approach to study single or multiple disease-causing mutations and model specific diseases in vitro. In addition, genetically corrected patient-specific iPSCs could potentially be used for stem cell based therapy. Furthermore, the reprogrammed cells share patient-specific genetic background, offering a new platform to develop personalized therapy/medicine for patients.In this review we discuss the recent advances in iPSC research technology and their potential applications in hematological diseases. Somatic cell reprogramming has presented new routes for generating patient-derived iPSCs, which can be differentiated to hematopoietic stem cells and the various downstream hematopoietic lineages. iPSC technology shows promise in the modeling of both inherited and acquired hematological disorders. A direct reprogramming and differentiation strategy is able to recapitulate hematological disorder progression and capture the earliest molecular alterations that underlie the initiation of hematological malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Malonyl-CoA is a central metabolite in fatty acid biochemistry. It is the rate-determining intermediate in fatty acid synthesis but is also an allosteric inhibitor of the rate-setting step in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. While these canonical cytoplasmic roles of malonyl-CoA have been well described, malonyl-CoA can also be generated within the mitochondrial matrix by an alternative pathway: the ATP-dependent ligation of malonate to Coenzyme A by the malonyl-CoA synthetase ACSF3. Malonate, a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase of the TCA cycle, is a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. A major role for ACSF3 is to provide a metabolic pathway for the clearance of malonate by the generation of malonyl-CoA, which can then be decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase. Additionally, ACSF3-derived malonyl-CoA can be used to malonylate lysine residues on proteins within the matrix of mitochondria, possibly adding another regulatory layer to post-translational control of mitochondrial metabolism. The discovery of ACSF3-mediated generation of malonyl-CoA defines a new mitochondrial metabolic pathway and raises new questions about how the metabolic fates of this multifunctional metabolite intersect with mitochondrial metabolism.",

     "abstract": "The microenvironment within the bone marrow (BM) contains support cells that promote leukemia cell survival and suppress host anti-tumor defenses. Galectins are a family of beta-galactoside binding proteins that are critical components in the tumor microenvironment. Galectin 1 (LGALS1) and Galectin 3 (LGALS3) as regulators of RAS signaling intracellularly and as inhibitors of immune cells extracellularly are perhaps the best studied members for their role in leukemia biology. Interest in Galectin 9 (LGALS9) is growing as this galectin has been identified as an immune checkpoint molecule. LGALS9 also supports leukemia stem cells (LSCs) though a mechanism of action is not clear. LGALS1 and LGALS3 each participate in a diverse number of survival pathways that promote drug resistance by supporting pro-tumor molecules such BCL2, MCL-1, and MYC and blocking tumor suppressors like p53. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have protein signatures that differ from healthy donor MSC. Elevated LGALS3 protein in AML MSC is associated with refractory disease/relapse demonstrating that MSC derived galectin impacts patient survival. LGALS3 is a critical determining factor whether MSC differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts so the galectin influences the cellular composition of the leukemia niche. Both LGALS3 and LGALS1 when secreted can suppress immune function. Both galectins can induce apoptosis of T cells. LGALS3 also modulates T cell receptor endocytosis and impairs interferon mediated chemokine production by binding glycosylated interferon. LGALS3 as a TIM3 binding partner acts to suppress T cell function. Galectins also impact leukemia cell mobilization and may participate in homing mechanisms. LGALS3 participates in transport mechanism of integrins, receptors, and other molecules that control cell adhesion and cell:cell interactions. The diversity of these various functions demonstrate the importance of these galectins in the leukemia niche. This review will cover the role of LGALS1, LGALS3, and LGALS9 in the various processes that are critical for maintaining leukemia cells in the tumor microenvironment.",

     "abstract": "Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are haematopoietic stem cell-derived clonal disorders characterised by proliferation of some or all myeloid lineages, depending on the subtype. MPNs are classically categorized into three disease subgroups; essential thrombocythaemia (ET), polycythaemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The majority (>85%) of patients carry a disease-initiating or driver mutation, the most prevalent occurring in the janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2 V617F), followed by calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukaemia virus (MPL) genes. Although these diseases are characterised by shared clinical, pathological and molecular features, one of the most challenging aspects of these disorders is the diverse clinical features which occur in each disease type, with marked variability in risks of disease complications and progression to leukaemia. A remarkable aspect of MPN biology is that the JAK2 V617F mutation, often occurring in the absence of additional mutations, generates a spectrum of phenotypes from asymptomatic ET through to aggressive MF, associated with a poor outcome. The mechanisms promoting MPN heterogeneity remain incompletely understood, but contributing factors are broad and include patient characteristics (gender, age, comorbidities and environmental exposures), additional somatic mutations, target disease-initiating cell, bone marrow microenvironment and germline genetic associations. In this review, we will address these in detail and discuss their role in heterogeneity of MPN disease phenotypes. Tailoring patient management according to the multiple different factors that influence disease phenotype may prove to be the most effective approach to modify the natural history of the disease and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.",

     "abstract": "Sulforaphane (SFN) is a naturally occurring isothiocyanate derived from cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli. It has been reported to inhibit the growth of a variety of cancers, such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, gastric or bladder cancer. SFN is supposed to act primarily as an antioxidant due to the activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. This enhances the activity of phase II detoxifying enzymes and the trapping of free radicals. Finally, SFN induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of tumor cells. Here, we discuss effects of SFN on the immune defense system. In contrast to the situation in tumor cells, SFN acts pro-oxidatively in primary human T cells. It increases intracellular ROS levels and decreases GSH, resulting in inhibition of T cell activation and T cell effector functions. Regarding the use of SFN as an \"anticancer agent\" we conclude that SFN could act as a double-edged sword. On the one hand it reduces carcinogenesis, on the other hand it blocks the T cell-mediated immune response, the latter being important for immune surveillance of tumors. Thus, SFN could also interfere with the successful application of immunotherapy by immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g. CTLA-4 antibodies and PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies) or CAR T cells. Therefore, a combination of SFN with T cell-mediated cancer immunotherapies does not seem advisable.",

In their absence, severe combined immunodeficiency occurs. By contrast, excessive IL-7/IL-7R-mediated signaling can drive lymphoid leukemia development, disease acceleration and resistance to chemotherapy. IL-7 and IL-7R activate three main pathways: STAT5, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MEK/Erk, ultimately leading to the promotion of leukemia cell viability, cell cycle progression and growth. However, the contribution of each of these pathways towards particular functional outcomes is still not completely known and appears to differ between normal and malignant states. For example, IL-7 upregulates Bcl-2 in a PI3K/Akt/mTOR-dependent and STAT5-independent manner in T-ALL cells. This is a \u2018symmetric image\u2019 of what apparently happens in normal lymphoid cells, where PI3K/Akt/mTOR does not impact on Bcl-2 and regulates proliferation rather than survival.

Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). Despite the critical role in lipid biosynthesis, both DAG and PtdOH have been shown as bioactive lipids mediating a number of signaling pathways. Although there is increasing recognition of their role in signaling systems, our understanding of the key enzyme which regulate the balance of these two lipid messages remain limited. Solved structures provide a wealth of information for understanding the function and regulation of these enzymes. Solving the structures of mammalian DGKs by traditional NMR and X-ray crystallography approaches have been challenging and so far, there are still no three-dimensional structures of these DGKs. Despite this, some insights may be gained by examining the similarities and differences between prokaryotic DGKs and other mammalian lipid kinases. This review focuses on summarizing and comparing the structure of prokaryotic and mammalian DGKs as well as two other lipid kinases: sphingosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase. How these known lipid kinases structures relate to mammalian DGKs will also be discussed.",

A comparative structural analysis of these different kinase sub-classes is a portal to a greater understanding of reaction mechanisms, enzyme regulation, inhibitor-development strategies, and superfamily-level evolutionary relationships. To serve such advances, we review structural elements of the protein kinase fold that are conserved in the subfamily of inositol phosphate kinases (InsPKs) that share a PxxxDxKxG catalytic signature: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate kinase (IP3K), inositol hexakisphosphate kinase (IP6K), and inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK). We describe conservation of the fundamental two-lobe kinase architecture: an N-lobe constructed upon an anti-parallel \u03b2-strand scaffold, which is coupled to a largely helical C-lobe by a single, adenine-binding hinge. This equivalency also includes a G-loop that embraces the \u03b2/\u03b3-phosphates of ATP, a transition-state stabilizing residue (Lys/His), and a Mg-positioning aspartate residue within a catalytic triad. Furthermore, we expand this list of conserved structural features to include some not previously identified in InsPKs: a \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 residue in the N-lobe, and an \u2018\u03b1F\u2019-like helix in the C-lobe that anchors two structurally-stabilizing, hydrophobic spines, formed from non-consecutive residues that span the two lobes.

SGs are postulated to support cells during periods of stress and provide a protective effect, allowing survival. Gle1 is a highly conserved, essential modulator of RNA-dependent DEAD-box proteins that exists as at least two distinct isoforms in human cells. Gle1A is required for proper SG formation, whereas Gle1B functions in mRNA export at the nuclear pore complex. Since Gle1A is required for SG function, we hypothesized that SG-dependent survival responses would also be Gle1-dependent. We describe here an experimental system for quantifying and testing the SG-associated survival response to sodium arsenite stress in HeLa cells. Gle1A was required for the sodium arsenite survival response, and overexpression of Gle1A supported the survival response. Overexpression of the SG-component G3BP also enabled the response. Next, we analyzed whether cells undergoing multiple rounds of stress yield a subpopulation with a higher propensity for SG formation and an increased resistance to undergoing apoptosis. After ten doses of sodium arsenite treatment, cells became resistant to sodium arsenite and to diclofenac sodium (another SG-inducing drug). The sodium arsenite-resistant cells exhibited changes in SG biology and had an increased survival response that was conferred in a paracrine manner. Changes in secreted factors occurred including a significantly lower level of MCP-1, a known regulator of stress granules and stress-induced apoptosis. This study supports models wherein SGs play a role in cell evasion of apoptosis and further reveal Gle1A and SG functions as targets for clinical approaches directed at chemoresistant/refractory cells.",

In the following manuscript, we discuss the abilities of BBR and certain chemically-modified BBRs (NAX compounds) to suppress growth of pancreatic cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "The lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in biological fluids is primarily produced by cleavage of lysophospholipids by the lysophospholipase D enzyme Autotaxin (ATX). LPA has been identified and abundantly detected in the culture medium of various cancer cell types, tumor effusates, and ascites fluid of cancer patients. Our current understanding of the physiological role of LPA established its role in fundamental biological responses that include cell proliferation, metabolism, neuronal differentiation, angiogenesis, cell migration, hematopoiesis, inflammation, immunity, wound healing, regulation of cell excitability, and the promotion of cell survival by protecting against apoptotic death. These essential biological responses elicited by LPA are seemingly hijacked by cancer cells in many ways; transcriptional upregulation of ATX leading to increased LPA levels, enhanced expression of multiple LPA GPCR subtypes, and the downregulation of its metabolic breakdown. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of ATX and LPA GPCR can lead to malignant transformation, enhanced proliferation of cancer stem cells, increased invasion and metastasis, reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment and the metastatic niche, and development of resistance to chemo-, immuno-, and radiation-therapy of cancer. The fundamental role of LPA in cancer progression and the therapeutic inhibition of the ATX-LPA axis, although highly appealing, remains unexploited as drug development to these targets has not reached into the clinic yet. The purpose of this brief review is to highlight some unique signaling mechanisms engaged by the ATX-LPA axis and emphasize the therapeutic potential that lies in blocking the molecular targets of the LPA system.",

     "abstract": "Fine-tuned regulation of new proteins synthesis is key to the fast adaptation of cells to their changing environment and their response to external cues. Protein synthesis regulation is particularly refined and important in the case of highly polarized cells like neurons where translation occurs in the subcellular dendritic compartment to produce long-lasting changes that enable the formation, strengthening and weakening of inter-neuronal connection, constituting synaptic plasticity. The changes in local synaptic proteome of neurons underlie several aspects of synaptic plasticity and new protein synthesis is necessary for long-term memory formation. Details of how neuronal translation is locally controlled only start to be unraveled. A generally accepted view is that mRNAs are transported in a repressed state and are translated locally upon externally cued triggering signaling cascades that derepress or activate translation machinery at specific sites. Some important yet poorly considered intermediates in these cascades of events are signaling lipids such as diacylglycerol and its balancing partner phosphatidic acid. A link between these signaling lipids and the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability, Fragile X syndrome, is emphasizing the important role of these secondary messages in synaptically controlled translation.",

Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) facilitate FAs transport to different cell organelles, modulating their metabolism along with mediating other physiological activities. FABP7, brain-typed FABP, is thought to be an important molecule for cell proliferation in healthy as well as diseased organisms. Several studies on human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines put FABP7 in the center of tumorigenesis, and its high expression level has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in different tumor types. Several types of FABP7-expressing tumors have shown an up-regulation of cell signaling activity, but molecular mechanisms of FABP7 involvement in tumorigenesis still remain elusive.

We also discovered that miR-15/16 are negative regulators of the BCL2 oncogene. Thus the loss of the two negative regulators causes BCL2 overexpression and leukemia. A corollary of this is that CLL is very sensitive to the anti BCL2 drug venetoclax that can induce complete remission in CLL patients. Since leukemia patients may carry billions of leukemia cells, it is quite likely that some (few) of the leukemic cells are resistant to venetoclax. Thus, since microRNAs have multiple targets, we looked for other proteins that may be overexpressed in CLL because of the low of miR-15/16. We discovered that ROR1 an embryonal antigen expressed on most (\u223c 90%) CLL, but not on normal B cell, is also regulated by miR-15/16. Thus CLL cells are also sensitive to monoclonal antibodies against ROR1. Venetoclax and monoclonal antibodies against ROR1 act synergistically in killing CLL cells.",

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids comprise a diverse family of lipids that perform multiple functions in both structure of cellular membranes and intra- and inter-cellular signaling. The diversity of this family is generated by an array of enzymes that produce individual classes and molecular species of family members and enzymes which catabolize those lipids for recycling pathways. However, all of these lipids begin their lives with a single step, the condensation of an amino acid, almost always serine, and a fatty acyl-CoA, almost always the 16-carbon, saturated fatty acid, palmitate. The enzyme complex that accomplishes this condensation is serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), a membrane-bound component of the endoplasmic reticulum. This places SPT in the unique position of regulating the production of the entire sphingolipid pool. Understanding how SPT activity is regulated is currently a central focus in the field of sphingolipid biology. In this review we examine the regulation of SPT activity by a set of small, membrane-bound proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, the Orms (in yeast) and ORMDLs (in vertebrates). We discuss what is known about how these proteins act as homeostatic regulators by monitoring cellular levels of sphingolipid, but also how the Orms/ORMDLs regulate SPT in response to other stimuli. Finally, we discuss the intriguing connection between one of the mammalian ORMDL isoforms, ORMDL3, and the pervasive pulmonary disease, asthma, in humans.",

Two major pathways for ceramide generation, the de novo pathway and the sphingomyelinase pathway are activated in the course of both, the non-alcoholic and the alcoholic, forms of fatty liver disease. The mechanisms of activation of these two pathways are distinct and reflect the different disease etiology in each case; at the same time, common processes impacted by the resulting ceramide overproduction involve lipotoxocity, ER/mitochondrial stress, inflammation, and de-regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism.

With the advent of recognizing ceramide and its derivative, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), as key players in lipid cell signaling and regulation of cell death and survival, research focus shifted toward these two sphingolipids. Ceramide and S1P are invoked in a plethora of cell biological processes participating in neurodegeneration such as ER stress, autophagy, dysregulation of protein and lipid transport, exosome secretion and neurotoxic protein spreading, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Hence, it is timely to discuss various functions of ceramide and S1P in neurodegenerative disease and to define sphingolipid metabolism and cell signaling pathways as potential targets for therapy.",

This comprises a new frontier of research that may provide us with important clues regarding their involvement in neurological health and disease. This paper explores various neurological diseases and conditions which result when the metabolism of sphingoid bases and some of their derivatives, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate and psychosine, becomes compromised due to the inhibition or mutation of key enzymes.

While cholesterol is widely acknowledged as the principal storage lipid in NPC, multiple species of sphingolipids accumulate as well. This accumulation of sphingolipids led to the initial assumption that NPC disease was caused by a deficiency in a sphingolipid catabolism enzyme, similar to sphingomyelinase deficiencies with which it shares a family name. It took about half a century to determine that NPC was in fact caused by a cholesterol trafficking defect, and still as we approach a century after the initial identification of the disease, the mechanisms by which sphingolipids accumulate remain poorly understood. Here we focus on the defects of sphingolipid catabolism in the endolysosomal compartment and how they contribute to the biology and pathology observed in NPC disease.

Hematopoiesis, or the formation of the ten different types of blood and marrow cells, is a complex process involving hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cytokine growth factors and cell surface adhesion molecules, and both specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. The marrow micro-environmental niche is defined as the site at which HSCs reside and are nurtured, receiving the signals that lead to their survival, replication and/or differentiation. Using microscopic, biochemical and molecular methods many different cells and the signals responsible for niche function have been identified. Early studies suggested two distinct anatomical sites for the niche, perivascular and periosteal, but the preponderance of evidence now favors the former. Within the \u201cvascular niche\u201d much evidence exists for important contributions by vascular endothelial cells (ECs), CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells and mesenchymal stromal cells, through their elaboration of chemokines, cytokines and cell surface adhesion molecules. In a series of studies we have found, and will present the evidence that megakaryocytes (MKs), the precursors of blood platelets, must be added to this list.In addition to normal blood cell development, numerous studies have implicated the perivascular niche as contributing to the pathogenesis of a variety of hematological malignancies. Our laboratory focuses on the Ph (Crane et al., 2017)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). These diseases are characterized by clonal expansion of HSCs and one or more mature blood cell types, hypermetabolism, a propensity to disorders of hemostasis (thrombosis\u202f>\u202fbleeding) and in some, evolution to acute leukemia. While a variety of therapies can control the abnormal expansion of the progeny of the malignant HSC, the only curative therapy is myeloablation with conditioning therapy or immunological means, followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), a procedure that is often inadequate due to relapse of the malignant clone. While the three disorders were postulated by Dameshek in the 1950s to be related to one another, proof came in 2005 when an acquired mutation in the signaling kinase Janus kinase 2 (Jak2V617F) was identified in virtually all patients with PV, and \u223c50% of patients with ET and PMF. Since that time a number of other mutations have been identified that account for the \u201cJak2V617F negative\u201d MPNs, including the thrombopoietin receptor, c-MPL, other mutations of Jak2, calreticulin and a variety of epigenetic modifier genes (e.g. TET2). Using a cell-specific Cre recombinase and SCT techniques we can introduce Jak2V617F into murine megakaryocytes and platelets, hematopoietic stem cells, and endothelial cells, alone or in combination, in order to probe the role of the mutant kinase in various cells on several aspects of the MPNs. Using these tools we have found that the expression of Jak2V617F in HSCs and ECs drives a MPN characterized by neutrophilia, thrombocytosis and splenomegaly, eventually evolving into myelosclerosis. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that Jak2V617F-bearing ECs were required for many features of the MPN, such as enhancing the growth of Jak2V617F-bearing HSCs over that of wild type HSCs, its characteristic radioresistance, and a hemostatic defect. Altogether, our studies suggest that the malignant vascular niche is a critical element in the pathogenesis of MPNs, and a more thorough understanding of the molecular basis for these findings could lead to improved treatment for patients with these disorders.",

However, TP53-independent effects of nutlin-3a were observed upon treatment with either a proteasomal or a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor.

The effects of p53, NF-\u03baB and the androgen receptor (AR) on the expression of NGAL was examined in four prostate cancer cell lines. Prostate cancer cell lines that are AR negative and expressed either mutant or no p53 (DU145 and PC3) displayed higher levels of NGAL expression compared to the prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv-1) which are AR positive and express wild type (WT) p53. Introduction of WT-p53 into the PC3 prostate cancer cell line, resulted in reduction of the levels of NGAL expression. Conversely, introduction of dominant negative (DN) p53 or a retroviral construct expressing NF-\u03baB into LNCaP cells increased NGAL expression. NGAL expression had functional effects on the ability of the cells to form colonies in soft agar. Whereas suppression of WT-53 in LNCaP cells increased NGAL expression, the introduction of WT-p53 suppressed NGAL transcription activity in PC3 prostate cells which normally express high level of NGAL. NF-\u03baB and p53 were determined to regulate NGAL expression by positive and negative mechanisms, respectively.

Survival of AML cells may depend on mechanisms that elude conventional drugs action and/or on the presence of leukemia initiating cells at diagnosis, and their persistence after therapy. MDR1 gene is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump known to be a risk factor for the emergence of resistance, when combined to unstable cytogenetic profile of AML patients.In the present study, we analyzed the sensitivity to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs of 26 samples of primary blasts collected from AML patients at diagnosis. Detection of cell viability and apoptosis allowed to identify two group of samples, one resistant and one sensitive to in vitro treatment. The cells were then analyzed for the presence and the activity of P-glycoprotein. A comparative analysis showed that resistant samples exhibited a high level of MDR1 mRNA as well as of P-glycoprotein content and activity. Moreover, they also displayed high PI3K signaling. Therefore, we checked whether the association with signaling inhibitors might resensitize resistant samples to chemo-drugs. The combination showed a very potent cytotoxic effect, possibly through down modulation of MDR1, which was maintained also when primary blasts were co-cultured with human stromal cells. Remarkably, dual PI3K/mTOR inactivation was cytotoxic also to leukemia initiating cells. All together, our findings indicate that signaling activation profiling associated to gene expression can be very useful to stratify patients and improve therapy.",

PDAC patients have poor prognosis with a five-year survival of only 5\u201310% after diagnosis and treatment. Pancreatic cancer has been associated with type II diabetes as the frequency of recently diagnosed diabetics that develop pancreatic cancer within a 10-year period of initial diagnosis of diabetes in increased in comparison to non-diabetic patients. Metformin is a very frequently prescribed drug used to treat type II diabetes. Metformin acts in part by stimulating AMP-kinase (AMPK) and results in the suppression of mTORC1 activity and the induction of autophagy. In the following studies, we have examined the effects of metformin in the presence of various chemotherapeutic drugs, signal transduction inhibitors and natural products on the growth of three different PDAC lines. Metformin, by itself, was not effective at suppressing growth of the pancreatic cancer cell lines at concentration less than 1000\u202fnM, however, in certain PDAC lines, a suboptimal dose of metformin (250\u202fnM) potentiated the effects of various chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat pancreatic cancer (e.g., gemcitabine, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) and other cancer types (e.g., doxorubicin, docetaxel). Furthermore, metformin could increase anti-proliferative effects of mTORC1 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors as well as natural products such as berberine and the anti-malarial drug chloroquine in certain PDAC lines. Thus, metformin can enhance the effects of certain drugs and signal transduction inhibitors which are used to treat pancreatic and various other cancers.",

     "abstract": "Accumulating evidence has indicated that the inflammatory response is important for tumor promotion. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of the inflammatory response in cancer tissues and how it promotes tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. We constructed several mouse models that develop inflammation-associated gastric and intestinal tumors and examined the in vivo mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Of note, the activation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) pathway and Toll-like receptor (TLR)/MyD88 signaling cooperatively induced the generation of an inflammatory microenvironment, which is required for early-stage tumorigenesis. The inflammatory response in the stroma induces TNF-\u03b1 signaling in tumor cells, and the NOX1/ROS signaling pathway is activated downstream. In addition, the inflammatory pathway induces the expression of TLR2 in tumor epithelial cells. Both the NOX1/ROS and TLR2 pathways in tumor cells contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of stemness, which is an important tumor-promoting mechanism stimulated by inflammation. We also found that inflammation promotes malignant processes, like submucosal invasion, of TGF-\u03b2 signaling-suppressed tumor cells through the activation of MMP2 protease. Moreover, we showed that mutant p53 induces innate immune and inflammatory signaling in the tumor stroma by a gain-of-function mechanism of mutant p53, which may explain the \u201ccancer-induced inflammation\u201d mechanism. These results indicate that the regulation of the inflammatory microenvironment via the inhibition of the COX-2/PGE2 and TLR/MyD88 pathways in combination will be an effective preventive or therapeutic strategy against gastrointestinal cancer development and malignant progression, especially those carrying p53 gain-of-function mutations.",

     "abstract": "Cancer development is usually driven by multiple genetic and molecular alterations rather than by a single defect. In the human colorectal cancer (CRC), series of mutations of genes are involved in the different stages of tumorigenesis. For example, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and KRAS mutations have been known to play roles in the initiation and progression of the tumorigenesis, respectively. However, many studies indicate that mutations of these two genes, which play roles in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS-extra-cellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, respectively, cooperatively interact in the tumorigenesis in several different cancer types including CRC. Both Apc and Kras mutations critically increase number and growth rate of tumors although single mutation of these genes does not significantly enhance the small intestinal tumorigenesis of mice. Both APC and KRAS mutations even result in the liver metastasis with inductions of the cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers in a mice xenograft model. In this review, we are going to describe the history for interaction between the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and RAS/ERK pathways especially related with CRC, and provide the mechanical basis for the cross-talk between the two pathways. The highlight of the crosstalk involving the stability regulation of RAS protein via the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling which is directly related with the cellular proliferation and transformation will be discussed. Activation status of GSK3\u03b2, a key enzyme involving both \u03b2-catenin and RAS degradations, is regulated by the status of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling dependent upon extracellular stimuli or intracellular abnormalities of the signaling components. The levels of both \u03b2-catenin and RAS proteins are co-regulated by the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, and these proteins are overexpressed with a positive correlation in the tumor tissues of CRC patients. These results indicate that the elevation of both \u03b2-catenin and RAS proteins is pathologically significant in CRC. In this review, we also will discuss further involvement of the increments of both \u03b2-catenin and RAS especially mutant KRAS in the activation of CSCs and metastasis. Overall, the increments of \u03b2-catenin and RAS especially mutant KRAS by APC loss play important roles in the cooperative tumorigenesis of CRC.",

     "abstract": "The calcium ion (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous intracellular signaling molecule that regulates diverse physiological and pathological processes, including cancer. Increasing evidence indicates that oncogenes and tumor suppressors regulate the Ca2+ transport systems. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) are IP3-activated Ca2+ release channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They play pivotal roles in the regulation of cell death and survival by controlling Ca2+ transfer from the ER to mitochondria through mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). Optimal levels of Ca2+ mobilization to mitochondria are necessary for mitochondrial bioenergetics, whereas excessive Ca2+ flux into mitochondria causes loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity and apoptotic cell death. In addition to well-known functions on outer mitochondrial membranes, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins are localized on the ER and regulate IP3Rs to control Ca2+ transfer into mitochondria. Another regulatory protein of IP3R, IP3R-binding protein released with IP3 (IRBIT), cooperates with or counteracts the Bcl-2 family member depending on cellular states. Furthermore, several oncogenes and tumor suppressors, including Akt, K-Ras, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), BRCA1, and BRCA1 associated protein 1 (BAP1), are localized on the ER or at MAMs and negatively or positively regulate apoptotic cell death through interactions with IP3Rs and regulation of Ca2+ dynamics. The remodeling of Ca2+ signaling by oncogenes and tumor suppressors that interact with IP3Rs has fundamental roles in the pathology of cancers.",

PLD is involved in promoting breast cancer cell growth, proliferation, and metastasis and both gene and protein expression are upregulated in breast carcinoma human samples. In spite of all this, the ultimate reason as to why PLD expression is high in cancer cells vs. their normal counterparts remains largely unknown. Until we understand this and the associated signaling pathways, it will be difficult to establish PLD as a bona fide target to explore new potential cancer therapeutic approaches. Recently, our lab has identified several molecular mechanisms by which PLD expression is high in breast cancer cells and they all involve post-transcriptional control of its mRNA. First, PA, a mitogen, functions as a protein and mRNA stabilizer that counteracts natural decay and degradation. Second, there is a repertoire of microRNAs (miRs) that keep PLD mRNA translation at low levels in normal cells, but their effects change with starvation and during endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells. Third, there is a novel way of post-transcriptional regulation of PLD involving 3\u2032-exonucleases, specifically the deadenylase, Poly(A)-specific Ribonuclease (PARN), which tags mRNA for mRNA for degradation. This would enable PLD accumulation and ultimately breast cancer cell growth. We review in depth the emerging field of post-transcriptional regulation of PLD, which is only recently beginning to be understood. Since, surprisingly, so little is known about post-transcriptional regulation of PLD and related phospholipases (PLC or PLA), this new knowledge could help our understanding of how post-transcriptional deregulation of a lipid enzyme expression impacts tumor growth.",

We find that in unsynchronized cells, PLC\u03b2 primarily binds cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)16 whose activity plays a key role in cell proliferation. In vitro studies show a direct association between the two proteins that result in loss in CDK16 activity. When cells are arrested in the G2/M phase, a large population of PLC\u03b2 is bound to Ago2 in a complex that contains C3PO and proteins commonly found in stress granules. Additionally, another population of PLC\u03b2 complexes with CDK18 and cyclin B1.

In exponentially growing yeast, a diverse set of membrane lipids are synthesized from the precursor phosphatidate via the liponucleotide intermediate CDP-diacylglycerol. As cells exhaust nutrients and progress into the stationary phase, phosphatidate is channeled via diacylglycerol to the synthesis of triacylglycerol. The CHO1-encoded phosphatidylserine synthase, which catalyzes the committed step in membrane phospholipid synthesis via CDP-diacylglycerol, and the PAH1-encoded phosphatidate phosphatase, which catalyzes the committed step in triacylglycerol synthesis are regulated throughout cell growth by genetic and biochemical mechanisms to control the balanced synthesis of membrane phospholipids and triacylglycerol. The loss of phosphatidate phosphatase activity (e.g., pah1\u0394 mutation) increases the level of phosphatidate and its conversion to membrane phospholipids by inducing Cho1 expression and phosphatidylserine synthase activity. The regulation of the CHO1 expression is mediated through the inositol-sensitive upstream activation sequence (UASINO), a cis-acting element for the phosphatidate-controlled Henry (Ino2\u2013Ino4/Opi1) regulatory circuit. Consequently, phosphatidate phosphatase activity regulates phospholipid synthesis through the transcriptional regulation of the phosphatidylserine synthase enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Blood platelets are the first line of defense against hemorrhages and are also strongly involved in the processes of arterial thrombosis, a leading cause of death worldwide. Besides their well-established roles in hemostasis, vascular wall repair and thrombosis, platelets are now recognized as important players in other processes such as inflammation, healing, lymphangiogenesis, neoangiogenesis or cancer. Evidence is accumulating they are key effector cells in immune and inflammatory responses to host infection. To perform their different functions platelets express a wide variety of membrane receptors triggering specific intracellular signaling pathways and largely use lipid signaling systems. Lipid metabolism is highly active in stimulated platelets including the phosphoinositide metabolism with the phospholipase C (PLC) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways but also other enzymatic systems producing phosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidic acid, platelet activating factor, sphingosine 1-phosphate and a number of eicosanoids. While several of these bioactive lipids regulate intracellular platelet signaling mechanisms others are released by activated platelets acting as autocrine and/or paracrine factors modulating neighboring cells such as endothelial and immune cells. These bioactive lipids have been shown to play important roles in hemostasis and thrombosis but also in vessel integrity and dynamics, inflammation, tissue remodeling and wound healing. In this review, we will discuss some important aspects of platelet lipid signaling in thrombosis and during sepsis that is an important cause of death in intensive care unit. We will particularly focus on the implication of the different isoforms of PI3Ks and on the generation of eicosanoids released by activated platelets.",

     "abstract": "Inositol polyphosphates are a diverse and multifaceted class of intracellular messengers omnipresent in eukaryotic cells. These water-soluble molecules regulate many aspects of fundamental cell physiology. Removing this metabolic pathway is deleterious: inositol phosphate kinase null mutations can result in lethality or substantial growth phenotypes. Inositol polyphosphate synthesis occurs through the actions of a set of kinases that phosphorylate phospholipase-generated IP3 to higher phosphorylated forms, such as the fully phosphorylated IP6 and the inositol pyrophosphates IP7 and IP8. Unicellular organisms have a reduced array of the kinases for synthesis of higher phosphorylated inositol polyphosphates, while human cells possess two metabolic routes to IP6. The enzymes responsible for inositol polyphosphate synthesis have been identified in all eukaryote genomes, although their amino acid sequence homology is often barely detectable by common search algorithms. Homology between human and microbial inositol phosphate kinases is restricted to a few catalytically important residues. Recent studies of the inositol phosphate metabolic pathways in pathogenic fungi (Cryptococcus neoformans) and protozoa (Trypanosome brucei) have revealed the importance of the highly phosphorylated inositol polyphosphates to the fitness and thus virulence of these pathogens. Given this, identification of inositol kinase inhibitors specifically targeting the kinases of pathogenic microorganisms is desirable and achievable.",

The DGK family metabolizes lipidic second messenger diacylglycerol to produce phosphatidic acid. Our earlier studies showed that one isozyme, DGK\u03b6, is involved in the regulatory mechanism of p53. In a cellular model of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage, overexpression of wild-type DGK\u03b6 suppresses p53 protein induction and reduces apoptosis, whereas knockdown of DGK\u03b6 upregulates p53 protein level and promotes apoptosis. Further examination reveals that DGK\u03b6 facilitates p53 degradation via ubiquitin-proteasome system in the cytoplasm. However, it remains undetermined whether the regulatory mechanism of DGK\u03b6 on p53 function found in cell-based experiments is also functional at the animal level. This study was conducted to elucidate this point using an experiment with DGK\u03b6-KO mice under DNA damage induced by whole-body ionizing radiation. Our results reveal that p53 protein is induced robustly in the spleen of DGK\u03b6-KO mice upon exposure to ionizing radiation, thereby promoting apoptosis in this organ. Taken together, the results demonstrate that DGK\u03b6 plays a sentinel role in p53 expression at the cellular and organismal levels after DNA damaging stress conditions.",

     "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA). Mammalian DGK comprises ten isozymes (\u03b1\u2013\u03ba) and regulates a wide variety of physiological and pathological events, such as cancer, type II diabetes, neuronal disorders and immune responses. DG and PA consist of various molecular species that have different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions, and consequently, mammalian cells contain at least 50 structurally distinct DG/PA species. Because DGK is one of the components of phosphatidylinositol (PI) turnover, the generally accepted dogma is that all DGK isozymes utilize 18:0/20:4-DG derived from PI turnover.We recently established a specific liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method to analyze which PA species were generated by DGK isozymes in a cell stimulation-dependent manner. Interestingly, we determined that DGK\u03b4, which is closely related to the pathogenesis of type II diabetes, preferentially utilized 14:0/16:0-, 14:0/16:1-, 16:0/16:0-, 16:0/16:1-, 16:0/18:0- and 16:0/18:1-DG species (X:Y\u00a0=\u00a0the total number of carbon atoms: the total number of double bonds) supplied from the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C pathway, but not 18:0/20:4-DG, in high glucose-stimulated C2C12 myoblasts. Moreover, DGK\u03b1 mainly consumed 14:0/16:0-, 16:0/18:1-, 18:0/18:1- and 18:1/18:1-DG species during cell proliferation in AKI melanoma cells. Furthermore, we found that 16:0/16:0-PA was specifically produced by DGK\u03b6 in Neuro-2a cells during retinoic acid- and serum starvation-induced neuronal differentiation. These results indicate that DGK isozymes utilize a variety of DG molecular species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways as substrates in different stimuli and cells.DGK isozymes phosphorylate various DG species to generate various PA species. It was revealed that the modes of activation of conventional and novel protein kinase isoforms by DG molecular species varied considerably. However, PA species-selective binding proteins have not been found to date. Therefore, we next attempted to identify PA species-selective binding proteins from the mouse brain and identified \u03b1-synuclein, which has causal links to Parkinson's disease. Intriguingly, we determined that among phospholipids, including several PA species (16:0/16:0-PA, 16:0/18:1-PA, 18:1/18:1-PA, 18:0/18:0-PA and 18:0/20:4-PA); 18:1/18:1-PA was the most strongly bound PA to \u03b1-synuclein. Moreover, 18:1/18:1-PA strongly enhanced secondary structural changes from the random coil form to the \u03b1-helix form and generated a multimeric and proteinase K-resistant \u03b1-synuclein protein.In contrast with the dogma described above, our recent studies strongly suggest that PI turnover-derived DG species and also various DG species derived from PI turnover-independent pathways are utilized by DGK isozymes. DG species supplied from distinct pathways may be utilized by DGK isozymes based on different stimuli present in different types of cells, and individual PA molecular species would have specific targets and exert their own physiological functions.",

Here, I review the recent insights into the conserved mechanisms of ribosome assembly that have come from functional characterisation of the genes mutated in human ribosomopathies. In particular, recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy, coupled with genetic, biochemical and prior structural data, have revealed that the SBDS protein that is deficient in the inherited leukaemia predisposition disorder Shwachman-Diamond syndrome couples the final step in cytoplasmic 60S ribosomal subunit maturation to a quality control assessment of the structural and functional integrity of the nascent particle.

     "abstract": "Phospholipase D (PLD) activity has been proposed to facilitate multiple steps in cancer progression including growth, metabolism, angiogenesis, and mobility. The canonical enzymes PLD1 and PLD2 enact their diverse effects through hydrolyzing the membrane lipid phosphatidylcholine to generate the second messenger and signaling lipid phosphatidic acid (PA). However, the widespread expression of PLD1 and PLD2 in normal tissues and the additional distinct enzymatic mechanisms through which PA can be generated have produced uncertainty regarding the optimal settings in which PLD inhibition might ameliorate cancer. Recent studies in mouse model systems have demonstrated that inhibition or elimination of PLD activity reduces tumor growth and metastasis. One mechanism proposed for this outcome involves proliferative signaling mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), which is attenuated when downstream PLD signal propagation is suppressed. The reduced proliferative signaling has been reported to be compounded by dysfunctional energetic metabolism in the tumor cells under conditions of nutrient deprivation. Moreover, cancer cells lacking PLD activity display inefficiencies across multiple steps of the metastatic cascade, limiting the tumor's lethal spread. Using PLD isoform knockout mice, recent studies have reported on the net effects of inhibition and ablation in multiple cancer models through examining the role of PLD in the non-tumor cells comprising the stroma and microenvironment. The promising results of such in vivo studies, combined with the apparent low toxicity of highly-specific and potent inhibitors, highlights PLD as an attractive target for therapeutic inhibition in cancer. We discuss here the array of anti-tumor effects produced by PLD inhibition and ablation in cancer models with a focus on animal studies.",

Therefore, the lipid-metabolizing enzymes that produce phosphatidic acid are vital to the regulation of the cycle. Our lab is particularly interested in the potential regulatory mechanisms and neuronal roles of two phosphatidic acid-producing enzymes: diacylglycerol kinase theta (DGK\u03b8) and phospholipase D (PLD). We recently discovered a regulatory role of DGK\u03b8 on evoked endocytosis (Goldschmidt et al., 2016). In addition to this enzyme, studies implicate PLD1 in neurotransmission, although its precise role is of some debate. Altogether, the production of phosphatidic acid by these enzymes offer an interesting and novel pathway for the regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle.",

Soon after a limited number of germline-encoded receptors, called pathogen recognition receptors, sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns, hosts trigger innate immune responses, including production of type \u2160 interferons, proinflammatory cytokines, and cellular apoptosis, to limit propagation of invading pathogens. Importantly, these host responses are also activated during inflammatory diseases, irrespective of pathogen infection, and often play a causal role in pathogenesis and progression of these diseases, thereby implying an intimate link between immune responses and inflammatory disease. The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) family belongs to the larger MAP3K family that controls various stress responses.

The apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) family members are stress-responsive kinases, which are activated by not only physicochemical stresses, such as oxidative stress, osmotic pressure, calcium overload, and anti-cancer drugs, but also biological stresses, such as inflammatory cytokines and pathogen infection. Recently, we found that ASK1, a member of ASK family, is activated by bacterial components, such as lipopolysaccharide, in a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner, demonstrating that ASK1 is required for the innate immune response and plays a critical role in the regulation of innate immune signaling. Moreover, our findings indicate that ROS are common mediators in physicochemical stress signaling, including redox signaling, and biological stress signaling, including innate immune signaling. This review especially focuses on the roles of ASK family in innate immunity and provides recent progress in our knowledge on activation mechanisms and physiological functions of ASK family kinases in innate immune responses.",

Longer lifespans may be leading to an increase in the number of people affected by NDDs worldwide. Among the pathways strongly impacting the pathogenesis of NDDs, oxidative stress, a condition that occurs because of an imbalance in oxidant and antioxidant levels, has been known to play a vital role in the pathophysiology of NDDs. One of the molecules activated by oxidative stress is apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which has been shown to play a role in NDDs. ASK1 activation is regulated by multiple steps, including oligomerization, phosphorylation, and protein-protein interactions. In the oxidative stress state, reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce the dissociation of thioredoxin, a protein regulating cellular reduction and oxidation (redox), from the N-terminal region of ASK1, and ASK1 is subsequently activated by the oligomerization and phosphorylation of a critical threonine residue, leading to cell death. Here, we review experimental evidence that links ASK1 signaling with the pathogenesis of several NDDs. We propose that ASK1 may be a new point of therapeutic intervention to prevent or treat NDDs.",

GSK3 was one of the first identified substrates of the heavily studied oncogenic kinase AKT, phosphorylation by which inhibits GSK3 activity via the formation of an autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate sequence. This has led to investigation of the role of GSK3 inhibition as a key component of the cellular responses to growth factors and insulin, which stimulate the class I PI 3-Kinases and in turn AKT activity and GSK3 phosphorylation. GSK3 has been shown to phosphorylate several upstream and downstream components of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling network, including AKT itself, RICTOR, TSC1 and 2, PTEN and IRS1 and 2, with the potential to apply feedback control within the network. However, it has been clear for some time that functionally distinct, insulated pools of GSK3 exist which are regulated independently, so that for some GSK3 substrates such as \u03b2-catenin, phosphorylation by GSK3 is not controlled by input from PI3K and AKT. Instead, as almost all GSK3 substrates require a priming phosphorylated residue to be 4 amino acids C-terminal to the Ser/Thr phosphorylated by GSK3, the predominant form of regulation of the activity of GSK3 often appears to be through control over these priming events, specific to individual substrates. Therefore, a major role of GSK3 can be viewed as an amplifier of the electrostatic effects on protein function which are caused by these priming phosphorylation events. Here we discuss these different aspects to GSK3 regulation and function, and the functions of GSK3 as it integrates with signalling through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling axis.",

In this manuscript we review the crosstalk between the Casein Kinase II (CK2) and Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3 (GSK-3) pathways that plays a critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation in leukemia. Both CK2 and GSK-3 are potential targets for anti-leukemia treatment. Previously published data suggest that CK2 and GSK-3 act synergistically to promote the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway via phosphorylation of PTEN. More recent data demonstrate another mechanism through which CK2 promotes the PI3K pathway \u2013 via transcriptional regulation of PI3K pathway genes by the newly-discovered CK2-Ikaros axis. Together, these data suggest that the CK2 and GSK-3 pathways regulate AKT/PI3K signaling in leukemia via two complementary mechanisms: a) direct phosphorylation of PTEN and b) transcriptional regulation of PI3K-promoting genes. Functional interactions between CK2, Ikaros and GSK3 define a novel signaling network that regulates proliferation of leukemia cells. This regulatory network involves both direct posttranslational modifications (by CK and GSK-3) and transcriptional regulation (via CK2-mediated phosphorylation of Ikaros).

     "abstract": "While leukemias represent a diverse set of diseases with malignant cells derived from myeloid or lymphoid origin, a common feature is the dysregulation of signal transduction pathways that influence leukemogeneisis, promote drug resistance, and favor leukemia stem cells. Mutations in PI3K, PTEN, RAS, or other upstream regulators can activate the AKT kinase which has central roles in supporting cell proliferation and survival. A major target of AKT is Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3). GSK3 has two isoforms (alpha and beta) that were studied as regulators of metabolism but emerged as central players in cancer in the early 1990s. GSK3 is unique in that the isoforms are constitutively active. Active GSK3 promotes destruction of oncogenic proteins such as beta Catenin, c-MYC, and MCL-1 and thus has tumor suppressor properties. In AML, inactivation of GSK3 is associated with poor overall survival. Interestingly in some leukemias GSK3 targets a tumor suppressor and thus the kinases can act as tumor promoters in those instances. An example is GSK3 targeting p27Kip1 in AML with MLL translocation. This review will cover the role of GSK3 in various leukemias both as tumor suppressor and tumor promoter. We will also briefly cover current state of GSK3 inhibitors for leukemia therapy.",

The fundamental basis of this genomic stability has yet to be elucidated, and the role of certain proteins involved in cell cycle regulation may be the key to the development of these specific genotypes. We examined whether thyroid hormone receptor beta 1 and 2 (TR\u03b21 and TR\u03b22), known to regulate tumorigenesis, and PTTG1, a mitotic checkpoint protein, play a role in maintaining genomic stability in retinoblastoma.In order to elucidate the role of these proteins in development of aneuploidy/polyploidy, an indicator of GIN, we first studied comparative GIN in retinoblastomas and multiple RB mutant cancer cell lines using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. We then utilized pLKO lentiviral vectors to selectively modify expression of the targeted cell cycle proteins and interpret their effect on downstream cell cycle proteins and their relative effects on the development of polyploidy in multiple tumor cell lines.The SNP analysis showed that retinoblastomas displayed relatively fewer genomic copy number changes as compared to other RB1-deficient cancer cell lines. Both TR\u03b21 and TR\u03b22 knockdown led to accumulation of E2F1 and PTTG1 and increased GIN as demonstrated by an increase in polyploidy. Downregulation of PTTG1 led to a relative decrease in GIN while upregulation of PTTG1 led to a relative increase in GIN. Knockdown of E2F1 led to a downstream decrease in PTTG1 expression. Rb-knockdown also upregulated E2F1 and PTTG1 leading to increased GIN. We showed that Rb is necessary for PTTG1 inhibition and genomic stability. A relatively stable genome in retinoblastoma tumor cells is maintained by TR\u03b21 and TR\u03b22-mediated PTTG1 inhibition, counteracting Rb-deficiency-related GIN. TR\u03b21, TR\u03b22 and Rb-KD all led to the downstream PTTG1 accumulation, apparently through an activation of E2F1 resulting in extensive genomic instability as seen in other Rb-deficient tumors.",

     "abstract": "Activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signaling cascade has been shown in tumorigenesis of numerous malignancies including glioblastoma (GB). This signaling cascade is frequently upregulated due to loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN, a phosphatase that functions antagonistically to PI3K. mTOR regulates cell growth, motility, and metabolism by forming two multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which are composed of special binding partners. These complexes are sensitive to distinct stimuli. mTORC1 is sensitive to nutrients and mTORC2 is regulated via PI3K and growth factor signaling. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis and cell growth through downstream molecules: 4E-BP1 (also called EIF4E-BP1) and S6K. Also, mTORC2 is responsive to growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases like Akt and SGK. mTORC2 plays a crucial role in maintenance of normal and cancer cells through its association with ribosomes, and is involved in cellular metabolic regulation. Both complexes control each other as Akt regulates PRAS40 phosphorylation, which disinhibits mTORC1 activity, while S6K regulates Sin1 to modulate mTORC2 activity. Another significant component of mTORC2 is Sin1, which is crucial for mTORC2 complex formation and function. Allosteric inhibitors of mTOR, rapamycin and rapalogs, have essentially been ineffective in clinical trials of patients with GB due to their incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 or unexpected activation of mTOR via the loss of negative feedback loops. Novel ATP binding inhibitors of mTORC1 and mTORC2 suppress mTORC1 activity completely by total dephosphorylation of its downstream substrate pS6KSer235/236, while effectively suppressing mTORC2 activity, as demonstrated by complete dephosphorylation of pAKTSer473. Furthermore, proliferation and self-renewal of GB cancer stem cells are effectively targetable by these novel mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitors. Therefore, the effectiveness of inhibitors of mTOR complexes can be estimated by their ability to suppress both mTORC1 and 2 and their ability to impede both cell proliferation and migration.",

Much of the initial research in this area has highlighted the major roles played by the phosphoinositides (PtdIns), diacylglycerol (DAG), and phosphatidic acid (PtdOH). Of these, PtdOH has not received as much attention as the other lipids although its role and metabolism appears to be extremely important. This lipid has been shown to play a role in modulating both exocytosis and endocytosis although its precise role in either process is not well defined. The currently evidence suggest this lipid likely participates in key processes by altering membrane architecture necessary for membrane fusion, mediating the penetration of membrane proteins, serving as a precursor for other important SV cycling lipids, or activating essential enzymes. In this review, we address the sources of PtdOH, the enzymes involved in its production, the regulation of these enzymes, and its potential roles in neurotransmission in the central nervous system.",

     "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the transformation of diacylglycerol into phosphatidic acid. In T lymphocytes, DGK\u03b1 and \u03b6 limit the activation of the PLC\u03b3/Ras/ERK axis, providing a critical checkpoint to inhibit T cell responses. Upregulation of these isoforms limits Ras activation, leading to hypo-responsive, anergic states similar to those caused by tumors. Recent studies have identified DGK\u03b1 upregulation in tumor lymphocyte infiltrates, and cells from DGK\u03b1 and \u03b6 deficient mice show enhanced antitumor activity, suggesting that limitation of DAG based signals by DGK is used by tumors to evade immune attack.DGK\u03b1 expression is low or even absent in other healthy cells like melanocytes, hepatocytes or neurons. Expression of this isoform, nevertheless is upregulated in melanoma, hepatocarcinoma and glioblastoma where DGK\u03b1 contributes to the acquisition of tumor metastatic traits. A model thus emerges where tumor milieu fosters DGK\u03b1 expression in tumors as well as in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes with opposite consequences.Here we review the mechanisms and targets that facilitate tumor \u201caddiction\u201d to DGK\u03b1, and discuss its relevance in the more advanced forms of cancer for tumor immune evasion. A better knowledge of this function offers a new perspective in the search of novel approaches to prevent inhibition of immune attack in cancer.Part of the failure in clinical progress may be attributed to the complexity of the tumor/T lymphocyte interaction. As they develop, tumors use a number of mechanisms to drive endogenous, tumor reactive T cells to a general state of hyporesponsiveness or anergy. A better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that tumors use to trigger T cell anergic states will greatly help in the advance of immunotherapy research.",

Due to the pleiotropic effects that TP53 has on gene expression and cellular physiology, mutations at this tumor suppressor gene result in diverse physiological effects. T53 mutations are frequently detected in numerous cancers. The expression of TP53 can be induced by various agents used to treat cancer patients such as chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation. Radiation will induce Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and other kinases that results in the phosphorylation and activation of TP53. TP53 is also negatively regulated by other mechanisms, such as ubiquitination by ligases such as MDM2. While TP53 has been documented to control the expression of many \u201cclassical\u201d genes (e.g., p21Cip\u22121, PUMA, Bax) by transcriptional mechanisms for quite some time, more recently TP53 has been shown to regulate microRNA (miR) gene expression. Different miRs can promote oncogenesis (oncomiR) whereas others act to inhibit tumor progression (tumor suppressor miRs). Targeted therapies to stabilize TP53 have been developed by various approaches, MDM2/MDM4 inhibitors have been developed to stabilize TP53 in TP53-wild type (WT) tumors. In addition, small molecules have been isolated that will reactivate certain mutant TP53s. Both of these types of inhibitors are in clinical trials. Understanding the actions of TP53 may yield novel approaches to suppress cancer, aging and other health problems.",

     "abstract": "The large multimeric plasma glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (VWF) is essential for primary hemostasis by recruiting platelets to sites of vascular injury. VWF multimers respond to elevated hydrodynamic forces by elongation, thereby increasing their adhesiveness to platelets. Thus, the activation of VWF is force-induced, as is its inactivation. Due to these attributes, VWF is a highly interesting system from a biophysical point of view, and is well suited for investigation using biophysical approaches. Here, we give an overview on recent studies that predominantly employed biophysical methods to gain novel insights into multiple aspects of VWF: Electron microscopy was used to shed light on the domain structure of VWF and the mechanism of VWF secretion. High-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), microscale thermophoresis and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy allowed identification of protein disulfide isomerase isoform A1 as the VWF dimerizing enzyme and, together with molecular dynamics simulations, postulation of the dimerization mechanism. Advanced mass spectrometry led to detailed identification of the glycan structures carried by VWF. Microfluidics was used to illustrate the interplay of force and VWF function. Results from optical tweezers measurements explained mechanisms of the force-dependent functions of VWF's domains A1 and A2 and, together with thermodynamic approaches, increased our understanding of mutation-induced dysfunctions of platelet-binding. AFM-based force measurements and AFM imaging enabled exploration of intermonomer interactions and their dependence on pH and divalent cations.These advances would not have been possible by the use of biochemical methods alone and show the benefit of interdisciplinary research approaches.",

     "abstract": "T-cells need to be tightly regulated during their activation and effector phase to assure an appropriate defence against cancer or pathogens and \u2013 vice versa \u2013 to avoid autoimmune reactions. Regulatory signals are provided via the immune synapse between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or target cells. The stability and kinetics of immune synapse formation is critical for proper T-cell functions. It requires dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton necessary for organized spatio-temporal redistribution of receptors and adhesion molecules. We identified glucocorticoid-sensitive phosphorylation of serine 5 on the actin-bundling protein L-plastin as one important signalling event for this regulation.Using imaging flow cytometry as well as confocal and super-resolution microscopy we showed that L-plastin relocalizes to the immune synapse upon antigen encounter, where it associates with the \u03b22-subunit of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18). Interfering with L-plastin expression or activation leads to a defective LFA-1 recruitment and unstable T-cell/APC contacts. Consequently, the lack of L-plastin diminishes T-cell activation, proliferation and proximal effector responses such as cytokine production. On the other hand, a pro-oxidative milieu leads to prolonged activation of L-plastin resulting in a stronger enrichment of LFA-1 in the cytolytic immune synapse. Concomitant stabilization of conjugates formed by cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and their target cells impairs the ability of CTLs to kill more than one target cells (serial killing), which de facto leads to a downregulation of T-cell cytotoxicity. Together, we demonstrate that activation and spacial distribution of L-plastin regulates the maturation and stability of activating and cytolytic immune synapses important for T-cell activation and effector functions.",

These studies have managed to define the metabolism, regulation, and function of these bioactive sphingolipids. This emerging body of literature has also implicated bioactive sphingolipids, particularly S1P and ceramide, as key regulators of cellular homeostasis. Ceramidases have the important role of cleaving fatty acid from ceramide and producing sphingosine, thereby controlling the interconversion of these two lipids. Thus far, five human ceramidases encoded by five different genes have been identified: acid ceramidase (AC), neutral ceramidase (NC), alkaline ceramidase 1 (ACER1), alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2), and alkaline ceramidase 3 (ACER3). These ceramidases are classified according to their optimal pH for catalytic activity. AC, which is localized to the lysosomal compartment, has been associated with Farber's disease and is involved in the regulation of cell viability. Neutral ceramidase, which is localized to the plasma membrane and primarily expressed in the small intestine and colon, is involved in digestion, and has been implicated in colon carcinogenesis. ACER1 which can be found in the endoplasmic reticulum and is highly expressed in the skin, plays an important role in keratinocyte differentiation. ACER2, localized to the Golgi complex and highly expressed in the placenta, is involved in programed cell death in response to DNA damage. ACER3, also localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex, is ubiquitously expressed, and is involved in motor coordination-associated Purkinje cell degeneration.

Innate immune cells play an integral role in normal intestinal homeostasis but their dysregulation is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. In particular, neutrophils are key effector cells and are first line defenders against invading pathogens. While the activity of neutrophils in the intestinal mucosa is required for homeostasis, regulatory mechanisms are equally important to prevent unnecessary activation. In ulcerative colitis, unregulated neutrophil inflammatory mechanisms promote tissue injury and loss of homeostasis. Aberrant neutrophil function represents an early checkpoint in the detrimental cycle of chronic intestinal inflammation; thus, dissecting the mechanisms by which these cells are regulated both before and during disease is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis.

The pleotropic actions of S1P are attributed to its unique inside-out (extracellular) signaling via G-protein-coupled S1P1-5 receptors, and intracellular receptor independent signaling. Additionally, S1P generated in the nucleus by nuclear SphK2 modulates HDAC1/2 activity, regulates histone acetylation, and transcription of pro-inflammatory genes. Here, we present data on the role of S1P lyase mediated S1P signaling in regulating LPS-induced inflammation in lung endothelium. Blocking S1P lyase expression or activity attenuated LPS-induced histone acetylation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Degradation of S1P by S1P lyase generates \u03942-hexadecenal and ethanolamine phosphate and the long-chain fatty aldehyde produced in the cytoplasmic compartment of the endothelial cell seems to modulate histone acetylation pattern, which is different from the nuclear SphK2/S1P signaling and inhibition of HDAC1/2.

We show that loss of Fhit initiates mild genome instability in early passage mouse kidney cells, confirming that DNA damage associated with Fhit-deficiency is not limited to cancer cells. We also demonstrate that the cause of Fhit-deficient DSBs: thymidine deficiency-induced replication stress, can be resolved with thymidine supplementation in early passage mouse kidney cells before extensive genome instability occurs. As for consequences of Wwox loss in cancer, we show in a small panel of breast cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts that Wwox expression predicts response to radiation and mitomycin C, all agents that cause DSBs. In addition, loss of Wwox significantly reduced progression free survival in a cohort of ovarian cancer patients treated with platin-based chemotherapies. Finally, stratification of a cohort of squamous lung cancers by Fhit expression reveals that Wwox expression is significantly reduced in the low Fhit-expressing group, suggesting that loss of Fhit is quickly succeeded by loss of Wwox. We propose that Fhit and Wwox loss work synergistically in cancer progression and that DNA damage caused by Fhit could be targeted early in cancer initiation for prevention, while DNA damage caused by Wwox loss could be targeted later in cancer progression, particularly in cancers that develop resistance to genotoxic therapies.",

Stimulation of cells, cultured in either normal or arachidonate-enriched conditions, with 2\u00a0ng/ml EGF for 90\u00a0s caused substantial activation of Class I PI3K and accumulation of PIP3. Despite the increased proportion of C38:4 PIP3 under the arachidonate-supplemented conditions, the total amount of all combined PIP3 species accumulating in response to EGF was the same, with or without arachidonate supplementation; there were however small but significant preferences for the conversion of some PIP2 species to PIP3, with the polyunsaturated C38:4 and C38:3 species being more favoured over other species. These results suggest the enzymes which interconvert phosphoinositides are able to act on several different molecular species and homoeostatic mechanisms are in place to deliver similar phosphoinositide pool sizes under quite different conditions of arachidonate availability. They also suggest enzymes regulating PIP3 levels downstream of growth factor stimulation (i.e. PI3Ks and PIP3-phosphatases) show some acyl selectivity and further work should be directed at assessing whether different acyl species of PIP3 exhibit differing signalling potential.",

     "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal late onset motor neuron disease with underlying cellular defects in RNA metabolism. In prior studies, two deleterious heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding human (h)Gle1 were identified in ALS patients. hGle1 is an mRNA processing modulator that requires inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) binding for function. Interestingly, one hGLE1 mutation (c.1965-2A>C) results in a novel 88 amino acid C-terminal insertion, generating an altered protein. Like hGle1A, at steady state, the altered protein termed hGle1-IVS14-2A>C is absent from the nuclear envelope rim and localizes to the cytoplasm. hGle1A performs essential cytoplasmic functions in translation and stress granule regulation. Therefore, we speculated that the ALS disease pathology results from altered cellular pools of hGle1 and increased cytoplasmic hGle1 activity. GFP-hGle1-IVS14-2A>C localized to stress granules comparably to GFP-hGle1A, and rescued stress granule defects following siRNA-mediated hGle1 depletion. As described for hGle1A, overexpression of the hGle1-IVS14-2A>C protein also induced formation of larger SGs. Interestingly, hGle1A and the disease associated hGle1-IVS14-2A>C overexpression induced the formation of distinct cytoplasmic protein aggregates that appear similar to those found in neurodegenerative diseases. Strikingly, the ALS-linked hGle1-IVS14-2A>C protein also rescued mRNA export defects upon depletion of endogenous hGle1, acting in a potentially novel bi-functional manner. We conclude that the ALS-linked hGle1-c.1965-2A>C mutation generates a protein isoform capable of both hGle1A- and hGle1B-ascribed functions, and thereby uncoupled from normal mechanisms of hGle1 regulation.",

     "abstract": "Immediate-early genes (IEGs) can be activated and transcribed within minutes after stimulation, without the need for de novo protein synthesis, and they are stimulated in response to both cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals. Extracellular signals are transduced from the cell surface, through receptors activating a chain of proteins in the cell, in particular extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and members of the RhoA-actin pathway. These communicate through a signaling cascade by adding phosphate groups to neighboring proteins, and this will eventually activate and translocate TFs to the nucleus and thereby induce gene expression. The gene activation also involves proximal and distal enhancers that interact with promoters to simulate gene expression. The immediate-early genes have essential biological roles, in particular in stress response, like the immune system, and in differentiation. Therefore they also have important roles in various diseases, including cancer development.

Multidisciplinary approaches that include hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) and computational techniques have been employed with great success in order to address important questions about the mode of interactions of PLA2 enzymes with membranes, phospholipid substrates and inhibitors. Understanding the interactions of PLA2s is crucial since these enzymes are the upstream regulators of the eicosanoid pathway liberating free arachidonic acid (AA) and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The liberation of AA by PLA2 enzymes sets off a cascade of molecular events that involves downstream regulators such as cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) metabolites leading to inflammation. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting COX, while Zileuton inhibits LOX and both rely on PLA2 enzymes to provide them with AA. That means PLA2 enzymes can potentially also be targeted to diminish inflammation at an earlier point in the process. In this review we describe extensive efforts reported in the past to define the interactions of PLA2 enzymes with membranes, substrate phospholipids and inhibitors using DXMS, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.",

Besides their critical role in pathophysiology, platelets represent a valuable model to investigate, both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, the biological roles of different branches of the phosphoinositide metabolism, which is highly active in platelets. While the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway has a crucial role in platelet activation, it is now well established that at least one class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is also mandatory for proper platelet functions. Except class II PI3K\u03b3, all other isoforms of PI3Ks (class I \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4; class II \u03b1, \u03b2 and class III) are expressed in platelets. Class I PI3Ks have been extensively studied in different models over the past few decades and several isoforms are promising drug targets to treat cancer and immune diseases. In platelet activation, it has been shown that while class I PI3K\u03b4 plays a minor role, class I PI3K\u03b2 has an important function particularly in thrombus growth and stability under high shear stress conditions found in stenotic arteries. This class I PI3K is a potentially interesting target for antithrombotic strategies. The role of class I PI3K\u03b1 remains ill defined in platelets. Herein, we will discuss our recent data showing the potential impact of inhibitors of this kinase on thrombus formation.The role of class II PI3K\u03b1 and \u03b2 as well as class III PI3K (Vps34) in platelet production and function is just emerging.

Using a yeast two-hybrid and other approaches, we have recently found that the same region of PLC\u03b2 that binds G\u03b1q also interacts with Component 3 Promoter of RNA induced silencing complex (C3PO), which is required for efficient activity of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In purified form, C3PO competes with G\u03b1q for PLC\u03b2 binding and at high concentrations can quench PLC\u03b2 activation. Additionally, we have found that the binding of PLC\u03b2 to C3PO inhibits its nuclease activity leading to reversal of RNA-induced silencing of specific genes. In cells, we found that PLC\u03b2 distributes between the plasma membrane where it localizes with G\u03b1q, and in the cytosol where it localizes with C3PO. When cells are actively processing small interfering RNAs the interaction between PLC\u03b2 and C3PO gets stronger and leads to changes in the cellular distribution of PLC\u03b2.

     "abstract": "The development of a mammalian embryo is initiated by a sequence of molecular events collectively referred to as \u2018oocyte activation\u2019 and regulated by the release of intracellular calcium in the ooplasm. Over the last decade, phospholipase C zeta (PLC\u03b6), a sperm protein introduced into the oocyte upon gamete fusion, has gained almost universal acceptance as the protein factor responsible for initiating oocyte activation. A large body of consistent and reproducible evidence, from both biochemical and clinical settings, confers support for the role of PLC\u03b6 in this fundamental biological context, which has significant ramifications for the management of human male infertility. Oocyte activation deficiency (OAD) and total fertilisation failure (TFF) are known causes of infertility and have both been linked to abnormalities in the structure, expression, and localisation pattern of PLC\u03b6 in human sperm. Assisted oocyte activators (AOAs) represent the only therapeutic option available for OAD at present, although these agents have been the source of much debate recently, particularly with regard to their potential epigenetic effects upon the embryo. Consequently, there is much interest in the deployment of sensitive PLC\u03b6 assays as prognostic/diagnostic tests and human recombinant PLC\u03b6 protein as an alternative form of therapy. Although PLC\u03b6 deficiency has been directly linked to a cohort of infertile cases, we have yet to identify the specific causal mechanisms involved. While two genetic mutations have been identified which link defective PLC\u03b6 protein to an infertile phenotype, both were observed in the same patient, and have yet to be described in other patients. Consequently, some researchers are investigating the possibility that genetic variations in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could provide some explanation, especially since >6000 SNPs have been identified in the PLC\u03b6 gene. As yet, however, there is no consistent data to suggest that any of these SNPs influence the functional ability of PLC\u03b6. Other laboratories appear to be focussing upon the PLC\u03b6 promoter, which is bi-directional and shared with the actin filament capping muscle Z-line alpha 3 gene (CAPZA3), or seeking to identify interacting proteins within the ooplasm. The aim of this review is to provide a synopsis of recent progress in the application of PLC\u03b6 in diagnostic and therapeutic medicine, to discuss our current understanding of how the functional ability of PLC\u03b6 might be controlled, and thus how PLC\u03b6 deficiency might arise, and finally, to consider the potential implications of alternative sperm protein candidates, such as post-acrosomal WW-domain binding protein (PAWP), which has caused much debate and confusion in the field over the last few years.",

Turnover of phosphoinositides (PI), particularly phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), has been implicated in macrophage functions such as toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated cytokine production and phagocytosis. However, PI metabolizing enzymes responsible for macrophage functions are not well defined. The phospholipase C (PLC) family of enzymes is critical in PI(4,5)P2 turnover. In this study, we investigated the role of PLC\u03b41, a prototype PLC, in macrophages on the expression of inflammation-associated genes and phagocytosis. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) signal through TLR4 to produce proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2. LPS stimulation of both RAW264.7 murine macrophages and murine bone marrow-derived macrophages resulted in lower PLC\u03b41 mRNA and protein expression levels, compared to that in the control. Using chemical inhibitor compounds, we demonstrated that the up-regulation of p38 MAPK activity led to down-regulation of PLC\u03b41 mRNA expression in macrophages. PLC\u03b41 reduction by RNAi or gene deletion resulted in greater LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression than that observed in the control siRNA-treated cells, without increasing TLR4 cell surface expression. PLC\u03b41 also negatively regulated LPS-induced cell spreading. Analysis of Fc\u03b3 receptor-mediated phagocytosis demonstrated an increased phagocytosis index after PLC\u03b41 knockdown in RAW264.7\u00a0cells. Conversely, overexpression of PLC\u03b41 reduced phagocytosis whereas catalytic inactive PLC\u03b41 had no effect. Altered levels of PLC\u03b41 affected the binding of opsonized latex beads with cells, rather than the phagocytic activity.

Counter-intuitively, however, DGK\u03b6 deletion suppresses p53 transcriptional activity despite increased p53 levels. In contrast, DGK\u03b6 knockdown engenders enhancement of NF-\u03baB pathway in response to cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. In response to these cytokines, DGK\u03b6 downregulation accelerates phosphorylation of the p65 subunit and its nuclear translocation, thereby enhancing NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity. Furthermore, DGK\u03b6 deficiency is shown to promote increased association of p65 subunit with the transcriptional cofactor CBP. It is particularly interesting that this association is observed even under basal conditions in the absence of stimulation. These findings suggest that DGK\u03b6 plays a role in sequestration of the limiting pool of CBP/p300 between the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit and p53, and that DGK\u03b6 downregulation shifts CBP/p300 toward the NF-\u03baB subunit to regulate reciprocally antagonistic phenotypes of these transcription factors.",

     "abstract": "Synthesis of inositol pyrophosphates through activation of Kcs1 plays an important role in the signalling response required for cell cycle progression after mating pheromone arrest. Overexpression of Kcs1 doubled the level of inositol pyrophosphates when compared to wild type cells and 30\u00a0min following the release from \u03b1-factor block further increase in inositol pyrophosphates was observed, which resulted that cells overexpressing Kcs1 reached G2/M phase earlier than wild type cells. Similar effect was observed in ipk1\u0394 cells, which are unable to synthesize IP6-derived inositol pyrophosphates (IP7 and IP8) but will synthesize IP5-derived inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IP4 and (PP)2-IP3). Although ipk1\u0394 cells have shorter telomeres than wild type cells, overexpression of Kcs1 in both strains have similar effect on cell cycle progression. As it is known that PP-IP4 regulates telomere length through Tel1, inositol polyphosphates, cell cycle and telomere length were determined in tel1\u0394 cells. The release of the cells from \u03b1-factor block and overexpression of Kcs1 in tel1\u0394 cells produced similar effects on inositol pyrophosphates level and cell cycle progression when compared to wild type cells, although tel1\u0394 cells possesses shorter telomeres than wild type cells. It can be concluded that telomere length does not affect cell cycle progression, since cells with short telomeres (ipk1\u0394 and tel1\u0394) progress through cell cycle in a similar manner as wild type cells and that overexpression of Kcs1 in cells with either short or normal telomeres will increase S phase progression without affecting telomere length. Furthermore, IP5-derived inositol pyrophosphates can compensate for the loss of IP6-derived inositol pyrophosphates, in modulating S phase progression of the cell cycle.",

     "abstract": "Recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) are genetic alterations commonly observed in human tumors. One of the most frequent CNVs in human tumors involves copy number gains (CNGs) at chromosome 3q26, which is estimated to occur in >20% of human tumors. The high prevalence and frequent occurrence of 3q26 CNG suggest that it drives the biology of tumors harboring this genetic alteration. The chromosomal region subject to CNG (the 3q26 amplicon) spans from chromosome 3q26 to q29, a region containing \u223c200 protein-encoding genes. The large number of genes within the amplicon makes it difficult to identify relevant oncogenic target(s). Whereas a number of genes in this region have been linked to the transformed phenotype, recent studies indicate a high level of cooperativity among a subset of frequently amplified 3q26 genes. Here we use a novel bioinformatics approach to identify potential driver genes within the recurrent 3q26 amplicon in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Our analysis reveals a set of 35 3q26 amplicon genes that are coordinately amplified and overexpressed in human LSCC tumors, and that also map to a major LSCC susceptibility locus identified on mouse chromosome 3 that is syntenic with human chromosome 3q26. Pathway analysis reveals that 21 of these genes exist within a single predicted network module. Four 3q26 genes, SOX2, ECT2, PRKCI and PI3KCA occupy the hub of this network module and serve as nodal genes around which the network is organized. Integration of available genetic, genomic, biochemical and functional data demonstrates that SOX2, ECT2, PRKCI and PIK3CA are cooperating oncogenes that function within an integrated cell signaling network that drives a highly aggressive, stem-like phenotype in LSCC tumors harboring 3q26 amplification. Based on the high level of genomic, genetic, biochemical and functional integration amongst these 4 3q26 nodal genes, we propose that they are the key oncogenic targets of the 3q26 amplicon and together define a \u201c3q26 OncCassette\u201d that mediates 3q26 CNG-driven tumorigenesis. Genomic analysis indicates that the 3q26 OncCassette also operates in other major tumor types that exhibit frequent 3q26 CNGs, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), ovarian serous cancer and cervical cancer. Finally, we discuss how the 3q26 OncCassette represents a tractable target for development of novel therapeutic intervention strategies that hold promise for improving treatment of 3q26-driven cancers.",

CHEK1 loss-of-function mutations have not been found in human tumors, and transgenic expression of Chek1 in mice promotes oncogene-induced transformation through RS inhibition. Moreover, CHK1 is overexpressed in various human cancers and CHK1 inhibitors have been developed as sensitizers to enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA damage-inducing chemotherapies. Here, we summarize the literature on the involvement of CHK1 in cancer progression, including our recent observation that CHK1 sustains T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell viability.

ZFNs and TALENs consist of endonucleases fused to a DNA-binding domain, while the CRISPR/Cas9 system uses guide RNAs to target the bacterial Cas9 endonuclease to the desired genomic location. The double-strand breaks made by these endonucleases are repaired in the cells either by non-homologous end joining, resulting in the introduction of insertions/deletions, or, if a repair template is provided, by homology directed repair. The ZFNs, TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 systems take advantage of these repair mechanisms for targeted genome modification and have been successfully used to manipulate the genome in human cells. These genome editing tools can be used to investigate gene function, to discover new therapeutic targets, and to develop disease models.

Three isoenzymes Itpka/b and c have been identified in human, rat and mouse. They share a catalytic domain relatively well conserved at the C-terminal end and a quite isoenzyme specific regulatory domain at the N-terminal end of the protein. Activity determined in cell homogenates with Ins(1,4,5)P3 and ATP as substrate is generally very low compared to Ins(1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, except in a few tissues such as brain, testis, thymus or intestine. Activity is very much Ca2+ sensitive and increased in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) as compared to EGTA alone. When challenged after receptor activation, activity could be further activated several fold, e.g. in rat brain cortical slices stimulated by carbachol or in human astrocytoma cells stimulated by purinergic agonists. Two of the three isoenzymes show an unexpected cytoskeletal localization for Itpka/b or at the leading edge for Itpkb. This is explained by the presence of an F-actin binding site at the N-terminal part of the two isoenzymes. This interaction confers to Itpka the properties of an F-actin bundling protein with two major consequences: i) it can reorganize the cytoskeletal network, particularly in dendritic spines, and ii) can provide an opportunity for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 to act very locally as second messenger.",

     "abstract": "The complex physiology of living organisms must be finely-tuned to permit the flexibility required to respond to the changing environment. Evolution has provided an interconnected and intricate array of regulatory mechanisms to facilitate this fine-tuning. The number of genes cannot alone explain the complexity of these mechanisms. Rather, signalling is regulated at multiple levels, from genomic to transcriptional, translational and post-translational. Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins offers an additional level of regulation after protein synthesis that allows a rapid, controlled and reversible response to environmental cues. Many amino acid side chains are post-translationally modified. These modifications can either be enzymatic, such as the phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues, or non-enzymatic, such as the nitrosylation of cysteine residues. Strikingly, lysine residues are targeted by a particularly high number of PTMs including acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and sumoylation. Additionally, lysines have recently been identified as the target of the non-enzymatic PTM polyphosphorylation. This novel PTM sees linear chains of inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) covalently attached to lysine residues. Interestingly, polyphosphorylation is indirectly dependent on inositol pyrophosphates, a class of cellular messengers. The attachment of polyP to lysine occurs through the phosphoramidate bond, which, unlike the phosphester bond, is unstable under the conditions used in common mass spectroscopy. This characteristic, together with the diversity of lysine PTMs, suggests that many other lysine modifications may still remain unidentified, raising the intriguing possibility that lysine PTMs may be the major means by which signalling pathways modify protein behaviour.",

In addition, S1P can bind to intracellular target proteins, such as HDAC1/2, to induce cell responses. There is increasing evidence of a role for S1P receptors (e.g. S1P4) and SK1 in cancer, where high expression of these proteins in ER negative breast cancer patient tumours is linked with poor prognosis. Indeed, evidence will be presented here to demonstrate that S1P4 is functionally linked with SK1 and the oncogene HER2 (ErbB2) to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and growth of breast cancer cells. Although much emphasis is placed on SK1 in terms of involvement in oncogenesis, evidence will also be presented for a role of SK2 in both T-cell and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In patient T-ALL lymphoblasts and T-ALL cell lines, we have demonstrated that SK2 inhibitors promote T-ALL cell death via autophagy and induce suppression of c-myc and PI3K/AKT pathways.

In addition, the SK1 inhibitor, PF-543 exacerbates disease progression in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mouse model indicating that SK1 functions in an anti-inflammatory manner.

In the last few years, the study of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) functions has become an attractive area of investigation in the field of arterial diseases, especially since inhibitors of specific PI3K isoforms have been developed. The PI3K family includes 8 members divided into classes I, II or III depending on their substrate specificity. Although some of the different isoforms are responsible for the production of the same 3-phosphoinositides, they each have specific, non-redundant functions as a result of differences in expression levels in different cell types, activation mechanisms and specific subcellular locations. This review will focus on the functions of the different PI3K isoforms that are suspected as having protective or deleterious effects in both the various immune cells and types of cell found in the arterial wall. It will also discuss our current understanding in the context of which PI3K isoform(s) should be targeted for future therapeutic interventions to prevent or treat arterial diseases.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer belongs to the incurable family of solid cancers. Despite of a recent better understanding its molecular biology, and an increased number of clinical trials, there is still a lack for innovative targeted therapies to fight this deadly malignancy. PI3K/Akt signalling is one of the most commonly deregulated signalling pathways in cancer, which explains the massive attention from many pharmaceutical companies over the ten past years on these signalling molecules. The already developed small molecule inhibitors are currently under clinical trial in various cancer types. Class I PI3Ks have 4 isoforms for which the role in physiology starts to be well described in the literature. Data are more unclear for their differential involvement in oncogenesis. In this review, we will discuss about the cognitive and therapeutic potential of targeting this signalling pathway and in particular Class I PI3K isoforms for pancreatic cancer treatment. Isoform-specificity of PI3K inhibitors are currently designed to achieve the same goal as pan-PI3K inhibitors but without potential adverse effects. We will discuss if such strategy is relevant in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",

     "abstract": "Blood platelets are anucleated circulating cells that play a critical role in hemostasis and are also implicated in arterial thrombosis, a major cause of death worldwide. The biological function of platelets strongly relies in their reactiveness to a variety of extracellular agonists that regulate their adhesion to extracellular matrix at the site of vascular injury and their ability to form rapidly growing cell aggregates. Among the membrane receptors expressed on the cell surface, integrins are crucial for both platelet activation, adhesion and aggregation. Integrin affinity for specific ligands is regulated by intracellular signaling pathways activated in stimulated platelets, and, once engaged, integrins themselves generate and propagate signals inside the cells to reinforce and consolidate platelet response and thrombus formation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases (PI3Ks) have emerged as crucial players in platelet activation, and they are directly implicated in the regulation of integrin function. This review will discuss the contribution of PI3Ks in platelet integrin signaling, focusing on the role of specific members of class I PI3Ks and their downstream effector Akt on both integrin inside-out and outside-in signaling. The contribution of the PI3K/Akt pathways stimulated by integrin engagement and platelet activation in thrombus formation and stabilization will also be discussed in order to highlight the possibility to target these enzymes in effective anti-thrombotic therapeutic strategies.",

     "abstract": "In many human cell types, the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases play key roles in the control of diverse cellular processes including growth, proliferation, survival and polarity. This is achieved through their activation by many cell surface receptors, leading to the synthesis of the phosphoinositide lipid signal, PIP3, which in turn influences the function of numerous direct PIP3-binding proteins. Here we review PI3K pathway biology and analyse the evolutionary distribution of its components and their functions. The broad phylogenetic distribution of class I PI3Ks in metazoa, amoebozoa and choannoflagellates, implies that these enzymes evolved in single celled organisms and were later co-opted into metazoan intercellular communication. A similar distribution is evident for the AKT and Cytohesin groups of downstream PIP3-binding proteins, with other effectors and pathway components appearing to evolve later. The genomic and functional phylogeny of regulatory systems such as the PI3K pathway provides a framework to improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which key cellular processes are controlled in humans.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth most common cancer, is increasing in incidence and soon will be the second leading cause of cancer death in the USA. This is a deadly malignancy with an incidence that approximates the mortality with 44,000 new cases and 36,000 deaths each year. Surgery, although only modestly successful, is the only curative option. However, due the locally aggressive nature and early metastasis, surgery can be performed on less than 20% of patients. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is palliative, has significant toxicity and improves survival very little. Thus new treatment paradigms are needed desperately. Due to the extremely high frequency of KRAS gene mutations (>90%) detected in pancreatic cancer patients, the roles of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1/GSK-3 pathways have been investigated in pancreatic cancer for many years. Constitutively active Ras can activate both of these pathways and there is cross talk between Ras and EGFR which is believed to be important in driving metastasis. Mutant KRAS may also drive the expression of GSK-3 through Raf/MEK/ERK-mediated effects on GSK-3 transcription. GSK-3 can then regulate the expression of NF-kappaB which is important in modulating pancreatic cancer chemoresistance. While the receptors and many downstream signaling molecules have been identified and characterized, there is still much to learn about these pathways and how their deregulation can lead to cancer. Multiple inhibitors to EGFR, PI3K, mTOR, GSK-3, Raf, MEK and hedgehog (HH) have been developed and are being evaluated in various cancers. Current research often focuses on the role of these pathways in cancer stem cells (CSC), with the goal to identify sites where therapeutic resistance may develop. Relatively novel fields of investigation such as microRNAs and drugs used for other diseases e.g., diabetes, (metformin) and malaria (chloroquine) have provided new information about therapeutic resistance and CSCs.

     "abstract": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its precursor (proNGF) are primarily considered as regulators of neuronal function that induce their responses via the tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA and the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. It has been generally held that NGF exerts its effects primarily through TrkA, inducing a cascade of tyrosine kinase-initiated responses, while proNGF binds more strongly to p75NTR. When this latter entity interacts with a third receptor, sortilin, apoptotic responses are induced in contrast to the survival/differentiation associated with the other two. Recent studies have outlined portions of the downstream phosphoproteome of TrkA in the neuronal PC12 cells and have clarified the contribution of individual docking sites in the TrkA endodomain. The patterns observed showed a similarity with the profile induced by the epidermal growth factor receptor, which is extensively associated with oncogenesis. Indeed, as with other neurotrophic factors, the distribution of TrkA and p75NTR is not limited to neuronal tissue, thus providing an array of targets outside the nervous systems. One such source is breast cancer cells, in which NGF and proNGF stimulate breast cancer cell survival/growth and enhance cell invasion, respectively. This latter activity is exerted via TrkA (as opposed to p75NTR) in conjunction with sortilin. Another tissue overexpressing proNGF is prostate cancer and here the ability of cancer cells to induce neuritogenesis has been implicated in cancer progression. These studies show that the non-neuronal functions of proNGF/NGF are likely integrated with their neuronal activities and point to the clinical utility of these growth factors and their receptors as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastasis and cancer pain.",

The major clinical features of MDS are ineffective hematopoiesis, peripheral cytopenias, and an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemias, which in turn is most likely determined by specific genetic abnormalities and other presenting hematologic features. The risk of developing MDS is relatively higher in some genetic syndromes such as Fanconi anemia and receipt of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In recent years a significant progress has occurred and a vast literatures has become available including the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities, gene mutations relating to RNA splicing machinery, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and signaling pathways associated with MDS pathogenesis, which have provided opportunities to understand the molecular mechanisms as well as employ targeted therapeutic approaches to treat MDS. The cytogenetic abnormalities detected in MDS varies from a single abnormality to complex karyotype not easily amenable to conventional cytogenetic analysis. In such cases, array based high resolution genomic analysis detected abnormalities, which are diagnostic as well as prognostic. The most common driver gene mutations detected in patients with MDS include RNA splicing (SF3B1,SRSF2,U2F1,ZRSR2), DNA methylation (TET2,DNMT3A,IDH1/IDH2), chromatin modification (ASXL1,EZH2), transcription regulation (RUNX1,BCOR) and DNA repair control p53. A small subset of MDS arise due to deregulation of RAS pathway, mainly due to NRAS/KRAS/NF1 mutations. Identification of these mutations and pathways have provided opportunities for oncologists to target these patients with specific therapies. Several drugs which either target the spliceosome, oncogenic RAS signaling, or hypomethylating agents have been employed to successfully treat MDS patients.",

The regulation of these lipids is critical for normal cell function and disregulation has been implicated in pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and inflammation. Here we examine control of the initiating, and rate limiting, enzyme in sphingolipid biosynthesis, serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). We find that de novo synthesis of sphingolipid is stimulated by a number of cancer chemotherapeutics, suggesting that this may be an important aspect of their cytotoxic effects. The three ORMDL proteins are membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum related to the yeast Orm proteins, which have been shown to be homeostatic regulators of SPT. We find that the ORMDL proteins are also negative regulators of SPT that transmit cellular levels of sphingolipids to SPT. The three isoforms have redundant functions in this system. The sphingosine kinases (sphingosine kinase-1 and -2) phosphorylate both sphingosine, which is released from ceramide, but also dihydrosphingosine, which is in the de novo biosynthetic pathway. We therefore examined the role of the sphingosine kinases in controlling de novo ceramide biosynthesis and find that sphingosine kinase-1 does indeed act as a negative regulator of this pathway. This establishes that sphingosine kinase, in addition to producing sphingosine-1-phosphate as a signaling molecule, also consumes dihydrosphingosine to regulate ceramide synthesis. Our studies demonstrate that there are multiple mechanisms of regulation of SPT and suggest that these regulators are important mediators of cell stress responses.",

Levels of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a naturally occurring bioactive lipid, are elevated in bronchoalveolar fluids and lung tissues from IPF patients and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. However, the in\u00a0vivo contribution of S1P, regulated by its synthesis catalyzed by Sphingosine kinases (SphKs) 1 & 2 and catabolism by S1P phosphatases and S1P lyase (S1PL), in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is not well defined. Microarray analysis of blood mononuclear cells from patients with IPF and SphK1-, SphK2- or S1PL-knockout mice and SphK inhibitor were used to assess the role of S1P in fibrogenesis. The expression of SphK1 negatively correlated with lung function and survival of patients with IPF. Further, the expressions of SphK1 and S1PL were increased in lung tissues from patients with IPF and bleomycin-challenged mice. Genetic knockdown of SphK1, but not SphK2, ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice while deletion of S1PL (SGPL1+/\u2212) in mice potentiated fibrosis post-bleomycin challenge. TGF-\u03b2 increased the expression of SphK1 and S1PL in human lung fibroblasts and knockdown of SphK1 or treatment with SphK inhibitor attenuated S1P generation and TGF-\u03b2 mediated signal transduction.

     "abstract": "Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine\u2013threonine kinase that functions via two multiprotein complexes, namely mTORC1 and mTORC2, each characterized by different binding partners that confer separate functions. mTORC1 function is tightly regulated by PI3-K/Akt and is sensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is sensitive to growth factors, not nutrients, and is associated with rapamycin-insensitivity. mTORC1 regulates protein synthesis and cell growth through downstream molecules: 4E-BP1 (also called EIF4E-BP1) and S6K. Also, mTORC2 is thought to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt and SGK. Recent evidence has suggested that mTORC2 may play an important role in maintenance of normal as well as cancer cells by virtue of its association with ribosomes, which may be involved in metabolic regulation of the cell. Rapamycin (sirolimus) and its analogs known as rapalogues, such as RAD001 (everolimus) and CCI-779 (temsirolimus), suppress mTOR activity through an allosteric mechanism that acts at a distance from the ATP-catalytic binding site, and are considered incomplete inhibitors. Moreover, these compounds suppress mTORC1-mediated S6K activation, thereby blocking a negative feedback loop, leading to activation of mitogenic pathways promoting cell survival and growth. Consequently, mTOR is a suitable target of therapy in cancer treatments. However, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. In recent years, new pharmacologic agents have been developed which can inhibit these complexes via ATP-binding mechanism, or dual inhibition of the canonical PI3-K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. These compounds include WYE-354, KU-003679, PI-103, Torin1, and Torin2, which can target both complexes or serve as a dual inhibitor for PI3-K/mTOR. This investigation describes the mechanism of action of pharmacological agents that effectively target mTORC1 and mTORC2 resulting in suppression of growth, proliferation, and migration of tumor and cancer stem cells.",

An age-dependent deterioration in \u03b2-cell function has also been observed, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Our previous studies indicate that the regulation of cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) may be critical and that this is dependent on the proper function of the mitochondria. The [Ca2+]i dynamics of the pancreatic \u03b2-cell are driven by an interplay between glucose-induced influx of extracellular Ca2+ via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-mediated liberation of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Our previous work\u00a0has indicated a direct relationship between disruption of Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ regulation and loss of \u03b2-cell function, including disturbed [Ca2+]i dynamics and compromised insulin secretion. To investigate these processes in aging we used three mouse models, a premature aging mitochondrial mutator mouse, a mature aging phenotype (C57BL/6) and an aging-resistant phenotype (129). Our data suggest that age-dependent impairment in mitochondrial function leads to modest changes in [Ca2+]i dynamics in mouse \u03b2-cells, particularly in the pattern of [Ca2+]i oscillations. These changes are driven by modifications in both PLC/Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and decreased \u03b2-cell Ca2+ influx over the plasma membrane.

     "abstract": "The C2 domain is a protein module often found in molecules that regulate exocytosis. C2 domains mediate interactions between the parental molecule and Ca2+, phospholipids, and proteins. Although various molecules have been shown to interact with several C2 domains, no interactions between the C2 domains from different molecules have yet been reported. In the present study, we identified direct interactions between the C2 domain of PRIP (phospholipase C-related but catalytically inactive protein) and the C2 domains of other molecules. Among the C2 domains examined, those of synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1-C2A and Syt1-C2B) and phospholipase C \u03b4-1 bound to the C2 domain of PRIP. We investigated the interactions between the C2 domain of PRIP (PRIP-C2) with Syt1-C2A and Syt1-C2B, and the mode of binding of each was Ca2+-dependent and -independent, respectively. We further demonstrated that the Ca2+ dependence of the interaction between PRIP-C2 and Syt1-C2A was attributed to Ca2+ binding with Syt1-C2A, but not PRIP-C2, using a series of mutants prepared from both C2 domains. We previously reported that the interaction between PRIP-C2 and the membrane fusion machinery suggested a critical role for PRIP in exocytosis; therefore, the results of the present study further support the importance of PRIP-C2 in the inhibitory function of PRIP in regulating exocytosis.",

     "abstract": "Cell signaling does not apparently occur randomly over the cell surface, but it seems to be integrated very often into cholesterol-rich membrane domains, termed lipid rafts. Membrane lipid rafts are highly ordered membrane domains that are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids and gangliosides, and behave as major modulators of membrane geometry, lateral movement of molecules, traffic and signal transduction. Because the lipid and protein composition of membrane rafts differs from that of the surrounding membrane, they provide an additional level of compartmentalization, serving as sorting platforms and hubs for signal transduction proteins. A wide number of signal transduction processes related to cell adhesion, migration, as well as to cell survival and proliferation, which play major roles in cancer development and progression, are dependent on lipid rafts. Despite lipid rafts harbor mainly critical survival signaling pathways, including insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, recent evidence suggests that these membrane domains can also house death receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling. Recruitment of this death receptor signaling pathway in membrane rafts can be pharmacologically modulated, thus opening up the possibility to regulate cell demise with a therapeutic use. The synthetic ether phospholipid edelfosine shows a high affinity for cholesterol and accumulates in lipid rafts in a number of malignant hematological cells, leading to an efficient in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo antitumor activity by inducing translocation of death receptors and downstream signaling molecules to these membrane domains. Additional antitumor drugs have also been shown to act, at least in part, by recruiting death receptors in lipid rafts. The partition of death receptors together with downstream apoptotic signaling molecules in membrane rafts has led us to postulate the concept of a special liquid-ordered membrane platform coined as \u201ccluster of apoptotic signaling molecule-enriched rafts\u201d (CASMER), referring to raft platforms enriched in apoptotic molecules. CASMERs act as scaffolds for apoptosis signaling compartmentalization, facilitating and stabilizing protein\u2013protein interactions by local assembly of cross-interacting molecules, which leads to apoptosis amplification and a decrease in apoptotic signal threshold. Edelfosine also displaced survival PI3K/Akt signaling from lipid rafts, leading to Akt inhibition, in mantle cell lymphoma cells. Thus, membrane rafts could act as scaffold structures where segregation of pro- from anti-apoptotic molecules could take place. In this review, we summarize our view of how reorganization of the protein composition of lipid raft membrane domains regulates cell death and therefore it might be envisaged as a novel target in the treatment of cancer.",

     "publication date": "01-2015",
     "abstract": "The synaptic vesicle (SV) cycle includes exocytosis of vesicles loaded with a neurotransmitter such as glutamate, coordinated recovery of SVs by endocytosis, refilling of vesicles, and subsequent release of the refilled vesicles from the presynaptic bouton. SV exocytosis is tightly linked with endocytosis, and variations in the number of vesicles, and/or defects in the refilling of SVs, will affect the amount of neurotransmitter available for release (Sudhof, 2004). There is increasing interest in the roles synaptic vesicle lipids and lipid metabolizing enzymes play in this recycling. Initial emphasis was placed on the role of polyphosphoinositides in SV cycling as outlined in a number of reviews (Lim and Wenk, 2009, Martin, 2012, Puchkov and Haucke, 2013, Rohrbough and Broadie, 2005). Other lipids are now recognized to also play critical roles. For example, PLD1 (Humeau et\u00a0al., 2001, Rohrbough and Broadie, 2005) and some DGKs (Miller et\u00a0al., 1999, Nurrish et\u00a0al., 1999) play roles in neurotransmission which is consistent with the critical roles for phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in the regulation of SV exo/endocytosis (Cremona et\u00a0al., 1999, Exton, 1994, Huttner and Schmidt, 2000, Lim and Wenk, 2009, Puchkov and Haucke, 2013, Rohrbough and Broadie, 2005). PLD generates phosphatidic acid by catalyzing the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) and in some systems this PtdOH is de-phosphorylated to generate DAG. In contrast, DGK catalyzes the phosphorylation of DAG thereby converting it into PtdOH. While both enzymes are poised to regulate the levels of DAG and PtdOH, therefore, they both lead to the generation of PtdOH and could have opposite effects on DAG levels. This is particularly important for SV cycling as PtdOH and DAG are both needed for evoked exocytosis (Lim and Wenk, 2009, Puchkov and Haucke, 2013, Rohrbough and Broadie, 2005). Two lipids and their involved metabolic enzymes, two sphingolipids have also been implicated in exocytosis: sphingosine (Camoletto et\u00a0al., 2009, Chan et\u00a0al., 2012, Chan and Sieburth, 2012, Darios et\u00a0al., 2009, Kanno et\u00a0al., 2010, Rohrbough et\u00a0al., 2004) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (Chan et\u00a0al., 2012, Chan and Sieburth, 2012, Kanno et\u00a0al., 2010). Finally a number of reports have focused on the somewhat less well studies roles of sphingolipids and cholesterol in SV cycling. In this report, we review the recent understanding of the roles PLDs, DGKs, and DAG lipases, as well as sphingolipids and cholesterol play in synaptic vesicle cycling.",

     "abstract": "We recently discovered that the Warburg effect, defined by the dramatically enhanced metabolism of glucose to pyruvate, even in well-oxygenated cancer cells, can occur as a consequence of mutations that enhance lipid biosynthesis at the expense of respiratory capacity. Specifically, mutations in the E1 subunit of either of two respiratory enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC) or \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDC), change substrate specificity from the 3-carbon \u03b1-ketoacid pyruvate, or the 5-carbon \u03b1-ketoacid \u03b1-ketoglutarate, to the 4-carbon \u03b1-ketoacid oxaloacetate (OADC). These mutations result in OADC-catalyzed synthesis of malonyl-CoA (MaCoA), the essential precursor of all fatty acids. These mutants arose as spontaneous suppressors of a yeast acc1cs cold-sensitive mutation encoding an altered form of AcCoA carboxylase (Acc1) that fails to produce MaCoA at the restrictive temperature (16\u00b0C). Notably, these suppressors are respiratory defective as a result of the same nuclear mutations that suppress acc1cs. These mutants also suppress sensitivity to Soraphen A, a potent inhibitor of Acc1 activity, at normal temperature (30\u00b0C). To our knowledge, OADC activity has never been identified in eukaryotic cells. Our results offer a novel perspective on the Warburg effect: the reprogramming of energy metabolism in cancer cells as a consequence of mutational impairment of respiration to meet the fatty acid requirements of rapidly proliferating cells. We suggest OADC activity is a common feature of cancer cells and represents a novel target for the development of chemotherapeutics.",

Yet, phosphate esters are also a major energy currency in cells. So the synthesis of PP-InsPs, and the maintenance of their levels in the face of a high rate of ongoing turnover, all requires significant bioenergetic input. What are the particular properties of PP-InsPs that repay this investment of cellular energy? Potential answers to that question are discussed here, against the backdrop of a recent hypothesis that signaling by PP-InsPs is evolutionarily ancient. The latter idea is extended herein, with the proposal that the primordial origins of PP-InsPs is reflected in the apparent lack of isomeric specificity of certain of their actions. Nevertheless, there are other aspects of signaling by these polyphosphates that are more selective for a particular PP-InsP isomer. Consideration of the nature of both specific and non-specific effects of PP-InsPs can help rationalize why such molecules possess so many phosphates.",

IP3R was identified to be P400 protein, a protein, which was missing in the cerebellum of ataxic mutant mice lacking Ca2+ spikes in Pukinje cells. IP3R was an IP3 binding protein and was a Ca2+ channel localized on the endoplasmic reticulum. Full-length cDNA of IP3R type 1 was initially cloned and later two other isoforms of IP3R (IP3R type 2 and type 3) were cloned in vertebrates. Interestingly, the phosphorylation sites, splicing sites, associated molecules, IP3 binding affinity and 5\u2032 promoter sequences of each isoform were different. Thus each isoform of IP3 receptor plays a role as a signaling hub offering a unique platform for matching various functional molecules that determines different trajectories of cell signaling. Because of this distinct role of each isoform of IP3R, the dysregulation of IP3 receptor causes various kinds of diseases in human and rodents such as ataxia, vulnerability to neuronal degeneration, heart disease, exocrine secretion deficit, taste perception deficit.

T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive neoplastic disorder of immature hematopoietic precursors committed to the T-cell lineage. T-ALL comprises about 15% of pediatric and 25% of adult ALL cases and is prone to early relapse. Although the prognosis of T-ALL has improved especially in children due to the use of new intensified treatment protocols, the outcome of relapsed T-ALL cases is still poor. Putative LICs have been identified also in T-ALL. LICs are mostly quiescent and for this reason highly resistant to chemotherapy. Therefore, they evade treatment and give rise to disease relapse. At present great interest surrounds the development of targeted therapies against signaling networks aberrantly activated in LICs and important for their survival and drug-resistance. Both the Notch1 pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) network are involved in T-ALL LIC survival and drug-resistance and could be targeted by small molecules. Thus, Notch1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors are currently being developed for clinical use either as single agents or in combination with conventional chemotherapy for T-ALL patient treatment. In this review, we summarize the existing knowledge of the relevance of Notch1 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in T-ALL LICs and we examine the rationale for targeting these key signal transduction networks by means of selective pharmacological inhibitors.",

PTEN is involved in inherited syndromes, which predispose to different types of cancers and is among the most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor genes in sporadic cancers. Indeed, loss of PTEN function occurs in a wide spectrum of human cancers through a variety of mechanisms, including mutations, deletions, transcriptional silencing, or protein instability. PTEN prevents tumorigenesis through multiple mechanisms and regulates a plethora of cellular processes, including survival, proliferation, energy metabolism and cellular architecture. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that PTEN is able to exit, exist, and function outside the cell, allowing for inhibition of the PI3K pathway in neighboring cells in a paracrine fashion. Most recently, studies have shown that PTEN is also critical for stem cell maintenance and that PTEN loss can lead to the emergence and proliferation of cancer stem cell (CSC) clones. Depending on the cellular and tissue context of origin, PTEN deletion may result in increased self-renewal capacity or normal stem cell exhaustion and PTEN-def\u00eccient stem and progenitor cells have been reported in prostate, lung, intestinal, and pancreatic tissues before tumor formation; moreover, reversible or irreversible PTEN loss is frequently observed in CSC from a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies, where it may contribute to the functional phenotype of CSC.In this review, we will focus on the role of PTEN expression and function and downstream pathway activation in cancer stem cell biology and regulation of the tumorigenic potential; the emerging role of PTEN in mediating the crosstalk between the PI3K and MAPK pathways will also be discussed, together with prospects for the therapeutic targeting of tumors lacking PTEN expression.",

Breast CICs endowed with self-renewing and tumor-initiating capacities are believed to be responsible for the relapses which often occur after various breast cancer therapies. In this review, we will summarize some of the key developments in breast CICs which will include discussion of some of the key genes implicated: estrogen receptor (ER), HER2, BRCA1, TP53, PIK3CA, RB, P16INK1 and various miRs as well some drugs which are showing promise in targeting CICs. In addition, the concept of combined therapies will be discussed. Basic and clinical research is resulting in novel approaches to improve breast cancer therapy by targeting the breast CICs.",

So removal of cancer stem cells is considered to be important for future cancer therapy. In one hand, NF-\u03baB is the transcription factor that promotes expressions of various inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis inhibitory proteins. Cancer cells often possess constitutively activated NF-\u03baB that often provides excess survival and therapeutic resistance in cancer cells. We have discovered DHMEQ as a specific inhibitor of NF-\u03baB. This compound was found to be more active in cancer stem cells than in balk cancer cells.

However in some tumor types RAS mutations are conspicuously absent or rare, despite the fact that RAS and downstream effector pathways are hyperactivated. Recently, RAS GTPase Activating Proteins (RAS GAPs) have emerged as an expanding class of tumor suppressors that, when inactivated, provide an alternative mechanism of activating RAS. RAS GAPs normally turn off RAS by catalyzing the hydrolysis of RAS-GTP. As such, the loss of a RAS GAP would be expected to promote excessive RAS activation. Indeed, this is the case for the NF1 gene, which plays an established role in a familial tumor predisposition syndrome and a variety of sporadic cancers. However, there are 13 additional RAS GAP family members in the human genome. We are only now beginning to understand why there are so many RAS GAPs, how they differentially function, and what their potential role(s) in human cancer are. This review will focus on our current understanding of RAS GAPs in human disease and will highlight important outstanding questions.",

By contrast, an increasing body of evidence has recently uncovered the concept of Akt isoform signaling specificity, supported by distinct phenotypes displayed by animal strains genetically modified for each of the three genes, as well as by the identification of isoform-specific substrates and association with discrete subcellular locations. Given that Akt is regarded as a promising therapeutic target in a number of pathologies, it is essential to dissect the relative contributions of each isoform, as well as the degree of compensation in pathophysiological function.

Accordingly, diacylglycerol generation and metabolism are strictly controlled, allowing for localized regulation of its concentration.While the increased production of diacylglycerol upon receptor triggering is well recognized, the modulation of diacylglycerol metabolism by diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) is less characterized. Some agonists induce DGK activation and recruitment to the plasma membrane, promoting diacylglycerol metabolism to phosphatidic acid. Conversely, several reports indicate that signaling pathways that selectively inhibits DGK isoforms can enhance cellular diacylglycerol levels and signal transduction. For example, the impairment of DGK\u03b8 activity by RhoA binding to the catalytic domain represents a conserved mechanism controlling diacylglycerol signaling from Caenorhabditis elegans motoneurons to mammalian hepatocytes. Similarly, DGK\u03b1 activity is inhibited in lymphocytes by TCR signaling, thus contributing to a rise in diacylglycerol concentration for downstream signaling. Finally, DGK\u03bc activity is inhibited by ischemia\u2013reperfusion-generated reactive oxygen species in airway endothelial cells, promoting diacylglycerol-mediated ion channel opening and edema.In those systems, DGKs provide a gatekeeper function by blunting diacylglycerol levels or possibly establishing permissive domains for diacylglycerol signaling.

In neuronal cells of adult brain, the standard model proposes that activation of metabotropic receptors coupled to Phospholipase C-\u03b21 (PLC-\u03b21) is linked to endocannabinoid signaling through the production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which could be systematically metabolized by 1,2-diacylglycerol Lipases (DAGL) to produce an increase of 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), the most abundant endocannabinoid in the brain. However, the existence of a nuclear PtdIns metabolism independent from that occurring elsewhere in the cell is now widely accepted, suggesting that the nucleus constitutes both a functional and a distinct compartment for PtdIns metabolism. In this review, we shall highlight the main achievements in the field of neuronal nuclear inositol lipid metabolism with particular attention to progress made linked to the 2-AG biosynthesis. Our aim has been to identify potential sites of 2-AG synthesis other than the neuronal cytoplasmic compartment by determining the subcellular localization of PLC-\u03b21 and DAGL-\u03b1, which is much more abundant than DAGL-\u03b2 in brain. Our data show that PLC-\u03b21 and DAGL-\u03b1 are detected in discrete brain regions, with a marked predominance of pyramidal morphologies of positive cortical cells, consistent with their role in the biosynthesis and release of 2-AG by pyramidal neurons to control their synaptic inputs. However, as novelty, we showed here an integrated description of the localization of PLC-\u03b21 and DAGL-\u03b1 in the neuronal nuclear compartment. We discuss our comparative analysis of the expression patterns of PLC-\u03b21 and DAGL-\u03b1, providing some insight into the potential autocrine role of 2-AG production in the neuronal nuclear compartment that probably subserve additional roles to the recognized activation of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor.",

Although signaling dynamics and spatiotemporal mechanisms serve critical roles, it remains unclear if these are the only ways cells achieve specificity within networks. The transcription factor Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1) is an excellent model to address this question, as it forms dynamic complexes with several chemically distinct lipid species (phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylcholines and sphingolipids). This property is important since lipids bound to SF-1 are modified by lipid signaling enzymes (IPMK & PTEN), regulating SF-1 biological activity in gene expression. Thus, a particular SF-1/lipid complex can interface with a lipid signaling enzyme only if SF-1 has been loaded with a chemically compatible lipid substrate. This mechanism permits dynamic downstream responsiveness to constant upstream input, disentangling specific pathways from the full network. The potential of this paradigm to apply generally to nuclear lipid signaling is discussed, with particular attention given to the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors and their phospholipid ligands.",

Importantly, macrophages are elite producers of eicosanoids and other related lipid mediators during inflammation, but specific roles of these molecules have not generally been incorporated into the larger context of macrophage biology.

Accurate measurement of the cellular levels of these lipids, particularly the more highly phosphorylated species, is hampered by their high polarity and low cellular concentrations. Recently, much progress has been made in using mass spectrometry to measure many different lipid classes in parallel, an approach generally referred to as \u2018lipidomics\u2019. Unfortunately, the acidic nature of highly phosphorylated phosphoinositides makes them difficult to measure using these methods, because they yield low levels of useful ions; this is particularly the case with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.

Spliceosome mutations are found in over half of all MDS patients and are likely founder mutations. The spliceosome mutations are highly specific to MDS and closely related conditions and, to some extent, appear to define distinct clinical phenotypes in MDS. The high frequency of mutations in different components of the RNA splicing machinery in MDS suggests that abnormal RNA splicing is the common consequence of these mutations.

Emerging data from the study of the MDS transcriptome suggests that spliceosomal mutations have effects on specific genes, including some previously shown to play a role in MDS pathogenesis.

Elevation of either PLD1 or PLD2 (the two mammalian isoforms of PLD) is able to transform fibroblasts and contribute to cancer progression. Elevated total PLD activity, as well as overexpression, is present in a wide variety of cancers such as gastric, colorectal, renal, stomach, esophagus, lung and breast. PLD provides survival signals and is involved in migration, adhesion and invasion of cancer cells, and all are increased during PLD upregulation or, conversely, they are decreased during PLD loss of function. Eventhough the end results of PLD action as relates to downstream signaling mechanisms are still currently being elucidated, invasion, a pre-requisite for metastasis, is directly affected by PLD. This review will introduce the classical mammalian PLD's, PLD1 and PLD2, followed by the mechanisms of intracellular regulation and a status of current investigation in the crucial involvement of PLD in cancer, mostly through its role in cell migration, invasion and metastasis, that has grown exponentially in the last few years.",

     "abstract": "Sulfur is an essential micronutrient involved in diverse cellular functions ranging from the control of intracellular redox states to electron transport. Eukaryotes incorporate sulfur by metabolizing inorganic sulfate into the universal sulfur donor 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate (PAPS). Sulfotransferases then catalyze the donation of the activated sulfur from PAPS to a broad range of acceptors including xenobiotic small molecules and extracellular proteoglycans while also generating the byproduct 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphate (PAP). In mammals, PAP is regulated by two related 3\u2032-nucleotidases, Golgi-resident PAP phosphatase (gPAPP) and cytoplasmic bisphosphate 3\u2032-nucleotidase 1 (Bpnt1), which hydrolyze PAP to 5\u2032-AMP and whose inactivation results in severe physiological defects. Loss of Bpnt1 in mice leads to the accumulation of PAP in the liver, aberrant nucleolar architecture, and liver failure, all of which can be rescued by genetically repressing PAPS synthesis. Yet interestingly, Bpnt1 protein is expressed at high levels in a majority of tissues, suggesting that additional tissues might also be affected. To investigate this possibility, we closely examined the expression of Bpnt1 protein, accumulation of PAP, and appearance of dysmorphic nucleoli in wild-type and Bpnt1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Surprisingly, we found that while Bpnt1 protein is widely expressed, only the liver, duodenum, and kidneys contain high levels of PAP and nucleolar reorganization. We hypothesize that these tissues share commonalities such as being highly polarized and situated at the interfaces of fluid reservoirs that might enhance their susceptibility to loss of Bpnt1. These studies highlight the importance of PAP metabolism in extrahepatic tissues and provide a framework for future investigations into the function of Bpnt1 in the kidney and small intestine.",

With the advances in lipid analytical technologies, the structural diversity of ceramide species have become evident, and the complexity of cellular metabolism and function associated with distinct ceramide species is beginning to be revealed. One of the common structural variations of ceramide is 2\u2032-hydroxylation of the N-acyl chain. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) is one of the enzymes that introduce the hydroxyl group during de novo synthesis of ceramide. FA2H is essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system, as evidenced by demyelinating disorder associated with FA2H mutations in humans and mice. Studies of Fa2h mutant mice indicate that lack of 2\u2032-hydroxy galactosylceramide in the myelin membrane results in loss of long-term stability of myelin and eventual demyelination. FA2H also regulates differentiation of various cell types (epidermal keratinocytes, schwannoma cells, adipocytes). When provided exogenously, ceramide induces apoptosis in many cell types. Interestingly, the effective concentration of 2\u2032-hydroxy ceramide that induces apoptosis is significantly lower compared to non-hydroxy ceramide, and cells die much more rapidly, suggesting that 2\u2032-hydroxy ceramide can mediate proapoptotic signaling distinct from non-hydroxy ceramide. Collectively, current evidence clearly shows that 2\u2032-hydroxy ceramide and 2\u2032-hydroxy complex sphingolipids have unique functions in membrane homeostasis and cell signaling that could not be substituted by non-hydroxy counterparts.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells have evolved to possess a distinct subcellular compartment, the nucleus, separated from the cytoplasm in a manner that allows the precise operation of the chromatin, thereby permitting controlled access to the regulatory elements in the DNA for transcription and replication. In the cytoplasm, genetic information contained in the DNA sequence is translated into proteins, including enzymes that catalyze various reactions, such as metabolic processes, energy control, and responses to changing environments. One mechanism that regulates these events involves phosphoinositide turnover signaling, which generates a lipid second messenger, diacylglycerol (DG). Since DG acts as a potent activator of several signaling molecules, it should be tightly regulated to keep cellular responsiveness within a physiological range. DG kinase (DGK) metabolizes DG by phosphorylating it to generate phosphatidic acid, thus serving as a critical regulator of DG signaling. Phosphoinositide turnover is employed differentially in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. A member of the DGK family, DGK\u03b6, localizes to the nucleus in various cell types and is considered to regulate nuclear DG signaling. Recent studies have provided evidence that DGK\u03b6 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in neurons under pathophysiological conditions. Transport of a signal regulator between the nucleus and the cytoplasm should be a critical function for maintaining basic processes in the nucleus, such as cell cycle regulation and gene expression, and to ensure communication between nuclear processes and cytoplasmic functions. In this review, a series of studies on nucleocytoplasmic translocation of DGK\u03b6 have been summarized, and the functional implications of this phenomenon in postmitotic neurons and cancer cells under stress conditions are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The hallmark of mammalian phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITPs) is to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membrane compartments. In the mammalian genome, there are three genes that code for soluble PITP proteins, PITP\u03b1, PITP\u03b2 and RdgB\u03b2 and two genes that code for membrane-associated multi-domain proteins (RdgB\u03b1I and II) containing a PITP domain. PITP\u03b1 and PITP\u03b2 constitute Class I PITPs whilst the RdgB proteins constitute Class II proteins based on sequence analysis. The PITP domain of both Class I and II can sequester one molecule of phosphatidylinositol (PI) in its hydrophobic cavity. Therefore, in principle, PITPs are therefore ideally poised to couple phosphatidylinositol delivery to the PI kinases for substrate provision for phospholipases C during cell activation. Since phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate plays critical roles in cells, particularly at the plasma membrane, where it is a substrate for both phospholipase C and phosphoinositide-3-kinases as well as required as an intact lipid to regulate ion channels and the actin cytoskeleton, homeostatic mechanisms to maintain phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate levels are vital. To maintain phosphatidylinositol levels, phospholipase C activation inevitably leads to the resynthesis of PI at the endoplasmic reticulum where the enzymes are located. Phosphatidic acid generated at the plasma membrane during phospholipase C activation needs to move to the ER for conversion to PI and here we provide evidence that Class II PITPs are also able to bind and transport phosphatidic acid. Thus RdgB proteins could couple PA and PI transport bidirectionally during phospholipase C signalling.",

     "abstract": "Mounting scientific and clinical evidence supports the key role played by phospholipase C zeta (PLC\u03b6), a sperm-specific protein, in the activation of oocytes following fertilisation. Lacking a pleckstrin homology domain, PLC\u03b6 remains the smallest known mammalian PLC and was first identified in 2002. Since then, PLC\u03b6 has been the target for a multitude of studies in both mammalian and non-mammalian species focused upon its fundamental biochemical activity and crucial role as the mediator of oocyte activation. The earliest event subsequent to gamete fusion is the onset of a series of intracellular calcium oscillations within the oocyte, which are known to modulate cortical granule exocytosis, release meiotic arrest, regulate gene expression, recruit maternal mRNA, and initiate embryogenesis. Collectively these processes are known as \u2018oocyte activation\u2019 and together, represent a fundamental mechanism for early embryonic development. Evidence suggests that these processes are initiated and controlled by calcium release from ooplasmic sources in response to PLC\u03b6 activity via the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) pathway. While the biochemical action of PLC\u03b6 has been extensively studied, especially in relation to the EF-hands, X\u2013Y linker, and C2 domain, all of which play critical roles for in\u00a0vivo activity, there are still key gaps in our knowledge, particularly in terms of regulation and interaction with other proteins within the oocyte. Moreover, increasing clinical evidence has revealed a strong correlation between certain types of male infertility and the aberrant expression, localisation, structure and function of PLC\u03b6 in human sperm, particularly in cases of recurrent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) failure, globozoospermia, and oocyte activation deficiency (OAD). In addition, two heterozygous substitution mutations have been identified in the coding sequence of PLC\u03b6 in one particular patient causing disruption to the catalytic X and Y domains and resulting in infertility. Although, such cases can be treated via the use of artificial oocyte activators (AOAs) such as calcium ionophores, significant concern remains over the use of such chemical agents, largely due to the fact that calcium release manifests as a single transient, rather than a series of oscillations as observed during normal fertilisation. Current interest in PLC\u03b6 is thus to develop a series of prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches which could first identify male patients that are deficient in PLC\u03b6 and then rescue oocyte activation ability via assisted reproductive technology (ART) and a pure, functionally-active, recombinant human PLC\u03b6 protein. While significant progress has been made in such areas over recent years, there is a clear need to translate scientific findings to clinical settings in order to maximise successful outcome for patients.",

The Phospholipase C members are the most well-known phospholipases for their role in lipid signalling and cell proliferation and comprise 13 isoforms classified in 6 distinct sub-families. In particular, signalling activated by Phospholipase C \u03b3, mostly activated by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is well characterized in different cell systems. Increasing evidence suggest that Phospholipase C \u03b3 plays a key role in cell migration and invasion. Because of its role in cell growth and invasion, aberrant Phospholipase C \u03b3 signalling can contribute to carcinogenesis. A major challenge facing investigators who seek to target Phospholipase C \u03b3 directly is the fact that it is considered an \u201cundruggable\u201d protein.

In this article, we summarize our current reach regarding the interaction of PRIP with Akt and protein phosphatases, in relation to the cellular phospho-regulations. PP1 and PP2A are major members of the protein serine/threonine phosphatase families. We have identified PP1 and PP2A as interacting partners of PRIP. We first investigated the interaction of PRIP with two phosphatases, using purified recombinant proteins. PRIP immobilized on beads pulled-down the catalytic subunits of both PP1 and PP2A, indicating that the interactions were in a direct manner, and the binding of PP1 and PP2A to PRIP were mutually exclusive. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the binding sites for PP1 and PP2A on PRIP were not identical, but in close proximity. Phosphorylation of PRIP by protein kinase A (PKA) resulted in the reduced binding of PP1, but not PP2A. Rather, the dissociation of PP1 from PRIP by phosphorylation accompanied the increased binding of PP2A in in\u00a0vitro experiments. This binding regulation of PP1 and PP2A to PRIP by PKA-dependent phosphorylation was also observed in living cells treated with forskolin or isoproterenol. These results suggested that PRIP directly interacts with the catalytic subunits of two distinct phosphatases in a mutually exclusive manner and the interactions are regulated by phosphorylation, thus functioning as a scaffold to regulate the activities and subcellular localizations of both PP1 and PP2A in phospho-dependent cellular signaling.",

The end of mitosis is marked by the proteolysis of the cyclin subunit of CDK1, which terminates kinase activity. At this point, the phosphate moieties that altered the properties of hundreds of proteins to bring about the cellular reorganization are removed by protein phosphatases. At least one protein phosphatase, PP2A-B55, is completely shut off in mitosis. Depletion of this particular form of PP2A accelerates entry into mitosis, and blocks exit from mitosis. Control of this phosphatase is achieved by an inhibitor protein (\u03b1-endosulfine or ARPP-19) that becomes inhibitory when phosphorylated by a protein kinase called Greatwall, which is itself a substrate of CDK1.

     "abstract": "Oxidative signaling is important in cellular health, involved in aging and contributes to the development of several diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. Correct management of reactive oxygen species (ROS) prevents oxidative stress within cells and is imperative for cellular wellbeing. A key pathway that is regulated by oxidative stress is the activation of proline-directed stress kinases (p38, JNK). Phosphorylation induced by these kinases is often translated into cellular outcome through the recruitment of the prolyl-isomerase Pin1. Pin1 binds to phosphorylated substrates using its WW-domain and can induce conformational changes in the target protein through its prolyl-isomerase activity. We show that exposure of cells to UV irradiation or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), induces the synthesis of the phosphoinositide second messenger PtdIns5P in part by inducing\u00a0the interaction between phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K) enzymes that remove PtdIns5P, with Pin1. In response to H2O2 exposure, Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from Pin1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased cell viability and an increased abundance of PtdIns5P compared to wild-type MEFs. Decreasing the levels of PtdIns5P in Pin1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs decreased both their viability in response to H2O2 exposure and the expression of genes required for cellular ROS management.

     "abstract": "Members of the RASSF family (RASSF1-10) have been identified as candidate tumour suppressors that are frequently downregulated by promoter hypermethylation in cancers. These proteins carry a common Ras-association (RA) and SARAH domain (RASSF1-6) that can potentially bind Ras oncoproteins and mediate protein\u2013protein interactions with other SARAH domain proteins. However, there is a notable lack of comparative characterisation of the RASSF family, as well as molecular and structural information that facilitate their tumour suppressive functions. As part of our comparative analysis, we modelled the RA and SARAH domains of the RASSF members based on existing structures and predicted their potential interactions. These in silico predictions were compared to in\u00a0vitro interaction studies with Ras and MST kinase (a SARAH domain-containing protein). Our data shows a diversity of interaction within the RASSF family RA domain, whereas the SARAH domain-mediated interactions for RASSF1-6 are consistent with the predictions. This suggests that different members, despite shared general architecture, could have distinct functional properties. Additionally, we identify a new interacting partner for MST kinase in the form of RASSF7. Current data supports an interaction model where RASSF serves as an adaptor for the assembly of multiple protein complexes and further functional interactions, involving MST kinases and other SARAH domain proteins, which could be regulated by Ras.",

It is thereby shown to be deregulated in numerous pathological conditions including cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration.

However, the two main pathways activated by IL-7, JAK/STAT5 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, have both been implicated in cancer and there is considerable evidence that IL-7 and its receptor (IL-7R), formed by IL-7R\u03b1 (encoded by IL7R) and \u03b3c, may partake in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) development.

Erythroblasts obtained from patients with the 5q- syndrome and DBA show impaired mRNA translation and this defect in translation may represent a potential therapeutic target in these ribosomopathies. There are some indications that the amino acid l-leucine, a translation enhancer, may have some efficacy in this group of disorders. Recent studies have shown that l-leucine treatment of zebrafish and murine models of the 5q- syndrome and DBA results in a marked improvement in the anemia. l-leucine treatment of RPS14-deficient and RPS19-deficient erythroblasts and erythroblasts from patients with the 5q- syndrome has been shown to result in an increase in cell proliferation, erythroid differentiation and mRNA translation in culture. l-leucine has been shown to improve hemoglobin levels and transfusion independence in a patient with DBA. l-leucine activates the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway that controls cell growth and mRNA translation. There is evidence to suggest that the promotion of translation via the mTOR pathway by l-leucine is the mechanism that underlies the enhanced erythroid progenitor cell growth and differentiation observed in animal and cellular models of the 5q- syndrome and DBA treated with this amino acid.

The SH2 domain containing inositol 5-phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2 belong to this family of enzymes very much involved in physiopathology and development. Therefore activity and localization of the enzymes are particularly important taking into account both catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms of the SHIP phosphatases. Several different mechanisms have been reported for SHIP2 targeting that often result from specific protein:protein interactions. In unstimulated astrocytoma cells, SHIP2 has a perinuclear and cytoplasmic localization. In serum-stimulated cells, SHIP2 can be localized at the plasma membrane and at focal contacts in polarized cells. A phosphorylated form of SHIP2 on S132 can be found in the nucleus and nuclear speckles. When present at the plasma membrane, SHIP2 may control the intracellular level of PI(3,4,5)P3 thereby producing PI(3,4)P2. When present in the nucleus, SHIP2 probably associates to other nuclear proteins such as lamin A/C and could potentially control nuclear PI(4,5)P2. Finally, its presence at focal adhesions and lamellipodia could suggest a role in cell adhesion and migration. It is proposed that the complex phenotype observed in SHIP2 mutant mice in tissue development and growth could result from the addition of plasma membrane and nuclear effects consecutive to SHIP2 alteration.",

PI4,5P2 is generated primarily by type I phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKI). Phosphoinositides are present in the nucleus including at nuclear speckles compartments separate from known membrane structures. PIPKs regulate cellular functions by interacting with PI4,5P2 effectors where PIPKs generate PI4,5P2 that then modulates the activity of the associated effectors. Nuclear PIPKI\u03b1 interacts with and regulates Star-PAP, and PI4,5P2 specifically activates Star-PAP in a gene- and signaling-dependent manner. Importantly, other select signaling molecules integrated into the Star-PAP complex seem to regulate Star-PAP activities and processivities toward RNA substrates, and unique sequence elements around the Star-PAP binding sites within the 3\u2032-UTR of target genes contribute to Star-PAP specificity for processing.

Most of these functions of Fhit have been observed on exogenous re-expression of Fhit in Fhit-negative cancer cells. However, little is known about the tumorigenic changes that occur in normal or precancerous cells following loss of Fhit expression. Recently, we have shown that shortly after loss of Fhit expression, cells exhibit signs of DNA replication stress-induced DNA damage and develop genomic instability. Here, we extend these findings through investigation of different factors that affect Fhit function to prevent DNA damage. We found that Fhit activity is dependent upon a functional HIT domain and the tyrosine-114 residue, previously shown to be required for tumor suppression by Fhit. Furthermore, Fhit function was shown to be independent of exogenous and endogenous sources of oxidative stress. Finally, Fhit function was shown to be dependent upon Chk1 kinase activity, but independent of Atr or Atm kinases. Evidence suggests that Fhit and Chk1 kinase cooperate to prevent replication stress-induced DNA damage. These findings provide important and unexpected insights into the mechanism whereby loss of Fhit expression contributes to cell transformation.",

Following activation by ligand binding, they selectively form phosphotyrosine residues by autocatalytic modification. Some of these sites are involved in maintaining the active conformation of the kinase, while others become docking sites for various adaptor/effector/scaffold proteins, which, after complexing with the receptor, then initiate further responses through cascades of post-translational modifications and the generation of lipid second messengers. Although there is substantial overlap in the pathways and activities stimulated by this superfamily, the molecular features of the endodomains of the sub-families and the moieties that they interact with to perpetrate their signals are surprisingly distinct, which may play a significant role in the regulation and responses of the individual RTK types. Some use large scaffold proteins as the basis for most, if not all, of their signal-generating interactions, while others have numerous receptor endodomain phosphotyrosine sites that are quite overlapping in specificity. The members of the Trk family of receptors each have several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated following stimulation, including those in the kinase activation loop, but there are only two established sites (Y490 and Y785 on TrkA) that are known to be directly involved in signal propagation. Taking advantage of this limited repertoire of docking sites, we have applied phosphoproteomic methods to dissect the signaling responses of both the native protein and derivatives that have had these two sites modified. Interestingly, a clear subset that was not dependent on either docking site was identified. A comparison with a similar set of data for EGFR indicates a considerable degree of similarity in the downstream signaling profile between these two RTKs.",

The binding of the p85 subunit to the p110 catalytic subunits is constitutive, and this inhibits activity, but some of the inhibitory contacts are reversible and subject to regulation. Interaction with phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (RTK-pY) releases a subset of these inhibitory contacts. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) provides a map of the dynamic interactions unique to each of the isotypes. RTK-pY binding exposes the p110 helical domains for all class IA enzymes (due to release of the nSH2 contact) and exposes the C-lobe of the kinase domains of p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 (resulting from release of the cSH2 contact). Consistent with this, our in\u00a0vitro assays show that all class IA isoforms are inhibited by the nSH2, but only p110\u03b2 and p110\u03b4 are inhibited by the cSH2. While a C2/iSH2 inhibitory contact exists in all isoforms, HDX indicates that p110\u03b2 releases this contact most readily.

These enzymes catalyze the transfer of the \u03b3-phosphate of ATP to the hydroxyl group of DAG, which generates PtdOH while reducing DAG. As these enzymes reciprocally modulate the relative levels of these two signaling lipids, it is essential to understand the regulation and roles of these enzymes in various tissues.

However, there has been a growing awareness that the beta cell, which is mandatory for insulin secretion, has a unique context within the micro-organ of the pancreatic Islet of Langerhans. In this environment the beta cell both mediates and receives paracrine regulation, critical for the control of blood glucose homeostasis. Failure of an appropriate beta cell function leads to the development of diabetes mellitus.In our quest to understand the molecular events maintaining beta cell function we have faced two key challenges. Firstly, whilst there are many similarities between signal transduction in pancreatic islets between the much used rodent models and humans there are some notable differences. Critical distinctions between rodent and primate can be made in the structure of the islet, including the arrangement of the islet cells, the innervation pattern and the microcirculation. This means that important signaling interactions between islets cells, mediated through for example insulin, glucagon, GABA, glutamate and ATP, will have a unique human framework. The second challenge was to be able to take the discoveries we have made using in\u00a0vitro systems and examine them in an in\u00a0vivo context. Advances in in\u00a0vivo imaging achieved by utilizing the anterior chamber of the eye as a transplantation site for pancreatic islets make it possible for non-invasive, longitudinal studies at single cell resolution in real time of islet cell physiology and pathology.

These mechanisms are compromised with the onset and progression of cancer. For example, the oncogenic AML1-ETO protein, which results from a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21, is expressed in nearly 25% of all acute myelogenous leukemias, disrupts Runx1 subnuclear localization during interphase and compromises transcriptional regulation. Epigenetically, the leukemic protein redirects the Runx1 DNA binding domain to leukemia-specific nuclear microenvironments, modifies regulatory protein accessibility to Runx1 target genes by imprinting repressive chromatin marks, and deregulates the microRNA (miR) profile of diseased myeloid cells. Consequently, the entire Runx1-dependent transcriptional program of myeloid cells is deregulated leading to onset and progression of acute myeloid leukemia and maintenance of leukemic phenotype.

There is a growing awareness that histone modifications and chromatin organization influence pre-mRNA splicing. Further there is emerging evidence that pre-mRNA splicing itself influences chromatin organization. In the mammalian genome around 95% of multi-exon genes generate alternatively spliced transcripts, the products of which create proteins with different functions. It is now established that several human diseases are a direct consequence of aberrant splicing events. In this review we present the interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and splicing regulation, as well as discuss recent studies on the role of histone deacetylases in splicing activities.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have established a positive correlation between cancer and metabolic disorders, suggesting that aberrant cell metabolism is a common feature of nearly all tumors. To meet their demand of building block molecules, cancer cells switch to a heavily glucose-dependent metabolism. As insulin triggers glucose uptake, most tumors are or become insulin-dependent. However, the effects of insulin and of other similar growth factors are not only limited to metabolic control but also favor tumor growth by stimulating proliferation and survival. A key signaling event mediating these metabolic and proliferative responses is the activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K) pathway. In this review, we will thus discuss the current concepts of tumor metabolism and the opportunity of PI3K-targeted therapies to exploit the \u201csweet tooth\u201d of cancer cells.",

     "publication date": "05-2012",
     "abstract": "Rho GTPases act as molecular switches central in cellular processes such as cytoskeleton dynamics, migration, cell proliferation, growth or survival. Their activation is tightly regulated downstream of cell surface receptors by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs), that are responsible for the specificity, the accuracy, and the spatial restriction of Rho GTPases response to extracellular cues. Because there is about four time more RhoGEFs that Rho GTPases, and GEFs do not always show a strict specificity for GTPases, it is clear that their regulation depends on specific interactions with the subcellular environment. RhoGEFs bear a peculiar structure, highly conserved though evolution, consisting of a DH-PH tandem, the DH (Dbl homology) domain being responsible for the exchange activity. The function of the PH (Pleckstrin homology) domain known to bind phosphoinositides, however, remains elusive, and reports are in many cases rather confusing. This review summarizes data on the regulation of RhoGEFs activity through interaction of the PH-associated DH domain with phosphoinositides which are considered as critical players in the spatial organization of major signaling pathways.",

     "publication date": "05-2012",
     "abstract": "Phosphoinositide cycle plays a pivotal role in neuronal signal transduction. In this cycle, diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) phosphorylates diacylglycerol (DG) to yield phosphatidic acid (PA). DG and PA acts as important second messengers that regulate distinct cascade of cellular events. Previous studies have disclosed that DGK consists of a family of isozymes that differ in their structure, enzymatic property, gene expression, subcellular localization, and binding partner. Intriguingly, most if not all DGK isozymes are abundantly expressed in the brain, suggesting important roles of this enzyme family in brain function. Of DGKs, DGK\u03b2 was the first enzyme identified as being expressed in a neuronal population in the brain. This review focuses on recent findings of DGK\u03b2 at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels together with pathological implications in brain function and disease.",

     "publication date": "05-2012",
     "abstract": "Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors regulating cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Of the 24 integrin heterodimers identified in humans, \u03b19\u03b21 integrin is one of the least studied. \u03b19, together with \u03b14, comprise a more recent evolutionary sub-family of integrins that is only found in vertebrates. Since \u03b19 was thought to have similar functions as \u03b14, due to many shared ligands, it was a rather overlooked integrin until recently, when its importance for survival after birth was highlighted upon investigation of the \u03b19 knockout mouse. \u03b19\u03b21 is expressed on a wide variety of cell types, interacts with many ligands for example fibronectin, tenascin-C and ADAM12, and has been shown to have important functions in processes such as cell adhesion and migration, lung development, lymphatic and venous valve development, and in wound healing. This has sparked an interest to investigate \u03b19\u03b21-mediated signaling and its regulation. This review gives an overview of the recent progress in \u03b19\u03b21-mediated biological and pathological processes, and discusses its potential as a target for cancer diagnosis and therapy.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic tissues, including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and the digestive system, dynamically secrete various factors depending on the metabolic state, communicate with each other and orchestrate functions to maintain body homeostasis. Skeletal muscle secretes cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-15, fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and IL-8. These compounds, myokines, play important roles in biological homeostasis such as energy metabolism, angiogenesis and myogenesis. New technological advances have allowed secretomics \u2013 analysis of the secretome \u2013 to be performed. The application of highly sensitive mass spectrometry makes qualitative and quantitative analysis of the secretome of skeletal muscle possible. Secretory proteins derived from skeletal muscle cells under various conditions were analyzed, and many important factors were suggested. In-depth studies of the secretome from metabolic cells in various conditions are strongly recommended. This study will provide information on methods of novel communication between metabolic tissues.",

     "publication date": "05-2012",
     "abstract": "Phosphorus in his phosphate PO43\u2212 configuration is an essential constituent of all life forms. Phosphate diesters are at the core of nucleic acid structure, while phosphate monoester transmits information under the control of protein kinases and phosphatases. Due to these fundamental roles in biology it is not a surprise that phosphate cellular homeostasis is under tight control. Inositol pyrophosphates are organic molecules with the highest proportion of phosphate groups, and they are capable of regulating many biological processes, possibly by controlling energetic metabolism and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Furthermore, inositol pyrophosphates influence inorganic polyphosphates (polyP) synthesis. The polymer polyP is solely constituted by phosphate groups and beside other known functions, it also plays a role in buffering cellular free phosphate [Pi] levels, an event that is ultimately necessary to generate ATP and inositol pyrophosphate. Although it is not yet clear how inositol pyrophosphates regulate cellular metabolism, understanding how inositol pyrophosphates influence phosphates homeostasis will help to clarify this important link. In this review I will describe the recent literature on this topic, with in the hope of inspiring further research in this fascinating area of biology.",
