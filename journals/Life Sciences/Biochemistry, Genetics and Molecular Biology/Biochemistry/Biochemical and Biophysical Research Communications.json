     "abstract": "Motile cilia play crucial roles in the maintenance of homeostasis in vivo. Defects in the biosynthesis of cilia cause immotile cilia syndrome, also known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), which is associated with a variety of complex diseases. In this study, we found that inhibitory Smad proteins, Smad7 and Smad6, significantly promoted the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into ciliated cells. Moreover, these Smad proteins specifically induced morphologically distinct Musashi1-positive ciliated cells. These results suggest that inhibitory Smad proteins could be important regulators not only for the regulation of ciliated cell differentiation, but also for the subtype specification of ciliated cells during differentiation from mouse ES cells.",

Recently, CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibition has been used as a novel oral therapeutic approach for patients with type 2 diabetes. While accumulating data indicate that vascular inflammation is a key feature of both micro- and macro-vascular complications in diabetes, the direct role of CD26/DPP-4 in endothelial biology is to be elucidated. We herein showed that proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor or interleukin-1 reduce expression of CD26 on microvascular endothelial cells, and that genetical or pharmacological inhibition of CD26/DPP-4 enhances endothelial growth both in vitro and in vivo. With DPP-4 inhibitors being used widely in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, our data strongly suggest that DPP-4 inhibition plays a pivotal role in endothelial growth and may have a potential role in the recovery of local circulation following diabetic vascular complications.",

Here we demonstrate a small molecule SIRT1 inhibitor, ILS-JGB-1741(JGB1741) with potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of human metastatic breast cancer cells, MDA-MB 231. The molecule has been designed using medicinal chemistry approach based on known SIRT1 inhibitor, sirtinol. The molecule showed a significant inhibition of SIRT1 activity compared to sirtinol. Studies on the antitumor effects of JGB on three different cancer cell lines, K562, HepG2 and MDA-MB 231 showed an IC50 of 1, 10 and 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Further studies on MDA-MB 231 cells showed a dose-dependent increase in K9 and K382 acetylation of H3 and p53, respectively. Results also demonstrated that JGB1741-induced apoptosis is associated with increase in cytochrome c release, modulation in Bax/Bcl2 ratio and cleavage of PARP. Flowcytometric analysis showed increased percentage of apoptotic cells, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in multicaspase activation. In conclusion, the present study indicates the potent apoptotic effects of JGB1741 in MDA-MB 231 cells.",

Given this dual nature, previous in vitro research using BMPs has relied on distinct media formulations and culture conditions to drive undifferentiated cells to the osteogenic or chondrogenic lineage. To isolate the impact of culture conditions and to explore the effect of BMP-6 on murine adipose-derived mesenchymal cells (ASCs), ASCs were seeded in either monolayer or pellets in an identical medium containing BMP-6. Results indicate that BMP-6 differentially promotes osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in ASCs depending on culture conditions. BMP-6 potently induced alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization in ASCs cultured in monolayer conditions. In contrast, BMP-6 enhanced proteoglycan accumulation in ASCs seeded in chondrogenic pellet culture. A comparison of gene expression suggests that the differentiating effect of BMP-6 is specific to the particular culture condition. This study highlights the importance of the interactions between chemical signaling and microenvironmental cues in directing cell fate.",

     "abstract": "The phenotypes of mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been proposed to be strictly regulated by the proportion of wild-type and pathogenically mutated mtDNAs. More specifically, it is thought that the onset of the disease phenotype occurs when cells cannot maintain the proper mitochondrial function because of an over-abundance of pathological mtDNA. Therapies that cause a decrease in the pathogenic mtDNA population have been proposed as a treatment for mitochondrial diseases, but these therapies are difficult to apply in practice. In this report, we present a novel concept: to improve mitochondrial disease phenotypes via an increase in the absolute copy number of the wild-type mtDNA population in pathogenic cells even when the relative proportion of mtDNA genotypes remains unchanged. We have succeeded in ameliorating the typical symptoms of mitochondrial disease in a model mouse line by the over-expression of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) followed by an increase of the mtDNA copy number. This new concept should lead to the development of a novel therapeutic treatment for mitochondrial diseases.",

In the present study protocols were developed for an RT-CES-based system (xCELLigence\u2122, Roche Applied Science, ACEA Biosciences Inc.) to supplement conventional techniques in pox virology. First, proliferation of cells susceptible to orthopoxviruses was monitored. For virus titration cells were infected with vaccinia virus and cell status, represented by the dimensionless impedance-based cell index (CI), was monitored. A virus-dose dependent decrease in electrical impedance could be shown. Calculation of calibration curves at a suitable CI covering a dynamic range of 4\u00a0log enabled the quantification of virus titers in unknown samples. Similarly, antiviral effects could be determined as shown for anti-poxviral agents ST-246 and Cidofovir. Published values for the in vitro concentration that inhibited virus replication by 50% (IC50) could be confirmed while cytotoxicity in effective concentrations was excluded in long-term incubation experiments. Finally, an RT-CES-based virus neutralization test was established. Various poxvirus-specific antibodies were examined for their neutralizing activity and a calculation mode for the neutralizing antibody titer was introduced. In summary, the presented RT-CES-based methods outmatch end-point assays by observing the cell population throughout the entire experiment while workload and time to result are reduced.",

In this study, direct cycle sequencing was used to analyze all five coding exons and adjacent intronic regions of RHO in 248 Chinese probands with different forms of non X-linked RP. Eight heterozygous nucleotide changes were detected, including two novel mutations (c.628G>T, p.Val210Phe; c.945C>G, p.Asn315Lys) and six known mutations (c.527C>T, p.Ser176Phe; c.568G>T, p.Asp190Tyr; c.768_770delCAT, p.Ile256del; c.1040C>T, p.Pro347Leu; c.310G>A, p.Val104Ile; c.895G>T, p.Ala299Ser), in 14 probands (nine isolated cases, three from autosomal dominant families, and three from autosomal recessive families).

In this study we performed microarray analyses on a GPA1 deletion mutant of G. zeae (\u0394gpa1) to identify genes involved in the sexual reproduction of this fungus. In the \u0394gpa1 strain, 645 genes were down-regulated and 550 genes were up-regulated during sexual reproduction when compared to the wild-type strain. One hundred of the down-regulated genes were selected for further investigation based on orthologous group clusters and differences in transcript levels. Quantitative real time-PCR was used to determine transcriptional profiles of these genes at various sexual and vegetative stages. We observed that transcript levels of 78 of these genes were dramatically increased in the wild-type strain during sexual reproduction compared to levels observed during vegetative growth, and were down-regulated in \u0394gpa1 compared to the wild-type strain. We deleted 57 of these genes and found that four of the deletion mutants lost self-fertility and five produced fewer perithecia compared to the wild-type strain. Two mutants produced wild-type numbers of perithecia, but maturation of perithecia and ascospores was delayed. In all we identified 11 genes that are involved in sexual reproduction of G. zeae and present evidence that some of these genes function at distinct stages during sexual reproduction in the fungus.",

These motors are distinct in containing two non-identical motor subunits together with an accessory subunit [1], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. We evaluated the significance of this organization by comparing purified wild type kinesin-2 holoenzymes that support IFT in vivo, with mutant trimers containing only one type of motor domain that do not support IFT in vivo. In motility assays, wild type kinesin-2 moved microtubules (MTs) at a rate intermediate between the rates supported by the two mutants. Interestingly, one of the mutants, but not the other mutant or the wild type protein, was observed to drive a persistent counter-clock-wise rotation of the gliding MTs. Thus one of the two motor domains of heterotrimeric kinesin-2 exerts torque as well as axial force as it moves along a MT, which may allow kinesin-2 to control its circumferential position around a MT doublet within the cilium.",

     "abstract": "The M2 protein of influenza A virus forms a proton-selective channel that is required for viral replication. It is the target of the anti-influenza drugs, amantadine and rimantadine. Widespread drug resistant mutants, however, has greatly compromised the effectiveness of these drugs. Here, we report the solution NMR structure of the highly pathogenic, drug resistant mutant V27A. The structure reveals subtle structural differences from wildtype that maybe linked to drug resistance. The V27A mutation significantly decreases hydrophobic packing between the N-terminal ends of the transmembrane helices, which explains the looser, more dynamic tetrameric assembly. The weakened channel assembly can resist drug binding either by destabilizing the rimantadine-binding pocket at Asp44, in the case of the allosteric inhibition model, or by reducing hydrophobic contacts with amantadine in the pore, in the case of the pore-blocking model. Moreover, the V27A structure shows a substantially increased channel opening at the N-terminal end, which may explain the faster proton conduction observed for this mutant. Furthermore, due to the high quality NMR data recorded for the V27A mutant, we were able to determine the structured region connecting the channel domain to the C-terminal amphipathic helices that was not determined in the wildtype structure. The new structural data show that the amphipathic helices are packed much more closely to the channel domain and provide new insights into the proton transfer pathway.",

CPI-17 phosphorylation increased at unphysiologically high Ca2+ levels of pCa\u00a0\u2a7d\u00a06.

CPI-17 phosphorylation induced by pCa 4.5 alone was markedly inhibited by the presence of PKC inhibitor but not ROCK inhibitor. In the presence of calyculin A, a potent PP1/PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, CPI-17 phosphorylation increased with time even under Ca2+-free conditions. Furthermore, as Ca2+ concentration increased, so did CPI-17 phosphorylation rate. GTP\u03b3S markedly enhanced the rate of phosphorylation of CPI-17 at a given Ca2+. In the absence of calyculin A, either steady-state phosphorylation of CPI-17 under Ca2+-free conditions in the presence of GTP\u03b3S or at pCa 6.7 in the absence of GTP\u03b3S was negligible, suggesting a high intrinsic CPI-17 phosphatase activity.

In this study, we have shown that the enhanced expression of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 3 (Raldh3) causes functional disorders of pancreatic islets in diabetic mouse models. In the pancreatic islets of HFD-induced diabetic BDF1 mice and spontaneously diabetic C57BL/KsJdb/db mice, gene expression analysis with oligonucleotide microarray revealed a significant increase in Raldh3 expression. Exposure to a culture medium containing a higher glucose concentration (25\u00a0mM) significantly increased Raldh3 expression in murine MIN6 and alphaTC1 clone 9 cells, which derived from the \u03b1 and \u03b2-cells of pancreatic islets, respectively. Overexpression of Raldh3 reduced the insulin secretion in MIN6 cells, and surprisingly, increased the glucagon secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of Raldh3 expression with siRNA decreased the glucagon secretion in alphaTC1 clone 9 cells. Raldh3 catalyzes the conversion of 13-cis retinal to 13-cis retinoic acid and we revealed that 13-cis retinoic acid significantly reduces cell viability in MIN6 and alphaTC1 clone 9 cells, but not in cells of H4IIEC3, 3T3-L1, and COS-1 cell lines. These findings suggest that an increasing expression of Raldh3 deregulates the balanced mechanisms of insulin and glucagon secretion in the pancreatic islets and may induce \u03b2-cell dysfunction leading to the development of type 2 diabetes.",

NDGA downregulated the level of mature SREBP-1 and its target genes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase), but, it upregulated expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3 coactivator-1, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1, and uncoupling protein-2. The specific AMPK inhibitor compound C attenuated the effects of NDGA on expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins in HepG2 hepatocytes. The beneficial effects of NDGA on HFD-induced hepatic triglyceride accumulation are mediated through AMPK signaling pathways, suggesting a potential target for preventing NAFLD.",

     "abstract": "Background: Components of the insulin receptor signaling pathway are probably some of the best studied ones. Even though methods for studying these components are well established, the in vivo effects of different fasting regimens, and the time course of insulin receptor phosphorylation and that of its downstream components in insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues have not been analyzed in detail. Rationale: When assessing insulin signaling, it may be beneficial to drive insulin levels as low as possible by performing an overnight fast before injecting a supra-physiological dose of insulin. Recent studies have shown however that 5 or 6\u00a0h fast in mice is sufficient to assess physiological responses to insulin and/or glucose in glucose tolerance tests [1], insulin tolerance tests [2], [3], [4] and euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies [5], [6]. Moreover, mice are nocturnal feeders, with \u223c70% of their daily caloric intake occurring during the dark cycle [5], and their metabolic rate is much higher than humans. Therefore, an overnight fast in mice is closer to starvation than just food withdrawal. Thus our aim was to assess insulin signaling components from the insulin receptor to downstream targets IRS1, Akt/PKB, GSK3, Erk1/2 and ribosomal protein S6 in muscle, liver and adipose tissue in 5\u00a0h versus 16\u00a0h (overnight) fasted mice, and the time course (0\u201330\u00a0min) of these phosphorylation events. We also assessed whether re-feeding under 5\u00a0h and 16\u00a0h fasting conditions was a more robust stimulus than insulin alone. Conclusions: Our study determines that a short food withdrawal from mice, for a period of 5\u00a0h, results in a similar insulin-stimulated response in phosphorylation events as the long overnight fast, presenting a more physiological experimental set up. We also demonstrate that in vivo, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of its signaling components is different between different peripheral tissues, and depending on the tissue(s) and protein(s) of interest, an appropriate time course should be chosen.",

Here, we integrated gene expression and functional module data to classify hubs into four types: non-co-expressed non-co-cluster hubs, non-co-expressed co-cluster hubs, co-expressed non-co-cluster hubs and co-expressed co-cluster hubs. We found that all the four hub types are more essential than non-hubs, but they also show different enrichments in essential proteins. Non-co-expressed non-co-cluster hubs play key role in organizing different modules formed by the other three hub types, but they are less important to the survival of the yeast cell. Among the four hub types, co-expressed co-cluster hubs, which likely correspond to the core components of stable protein complexes, are the most essential. These results demonstrated that our classification of hubs into four types could better improve the understanding of gene essentiality.",

Here we present new active Haptides bearing homologous sequences derived from the C-termini of other proteins, such as angiopoietin 1&2, tenascins C&X, and microfibril-associated glycoprotein-4. The cell adhesion properties of all the Haptides were found to be associated mainly with their 11 N-terminal residues. Mutated preC\u03b3 peptides revealed that positively charged residues account for their attachment effect. These results suggest a mechanism of direct electrostatic interaction of Haptides with the cell membrane.

In this study, we found markedly decreased level of Nup107, a key scaffold protein in nuclear pore complex assembly, in senescent human diploid fibroblasts as well as in organs of aged mice. Depletion of Nup107 by specific siRNA in young human diploid fibroblasts prevented the effective nuclear translocation of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) following epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, and decreased the expression of c-Fos in consequence. The disturbances in ERK signaling in Nup107 depleted cells closely mirror the similar changes in senescent cells. Knockdown of Nup107 in anaplastic oligodendroglioma cells caused cell death, rather than growth retardation, indicating a greater sensitivity to Nup107 depletion in cancer cells than in normal cells. These findings support the notion that Nup107 may contribute significantly to the regulation of cell fate in aged and transformed cells by modulating nuclear trafficking of signal molecules.",

It is controversial whether albumin levels per se are associated with the clinical outcomes in uremic patients. The co-occurrence of hypoalbuminemia and oxidative stress in hemodialysis (HD) patients led us to hypothesize that oxidative modifications of albumin decrease its detection and influence albumin quantification.Albumin levels are determined in clinical laboratories mainly by the bromocresol green (BCG) spectrophotometric assay. The detection of serum albumin was investigated in HD patients and in healthy controls using an \u201calbumin-detection index\u201d, defined as the ratio between BCG read-out (albumin-specific) to total albumin. The detection efficacy of albumin was also investigated in vitro, after glycoxidation, HOCl-mediated-oxidation, and metal-catalyzed-oxidation. Oncotic pressure was measured to assess albumin function.The albumin-detection index of patients was significantly lower compared with controls, correlating negatively with oxidative stress markers (serum advanced oxidation protein products-AOPP and glycoxidized serum albumin) and positively with serum albumin levels. The albumin-detection index was also decreased after in vitro oxidation.The study shows, both in vivo and in vitro, decreased detection of oxidized albumin by a commonly-used clinical assay, thus providing the molecular link between oxidative stress and hypoalbuminemia. Oxidative stress as reflected by hypoalbuminemia, rather than actual albumin levels, may be related to cardiovascular morbidity outcomes in HD patient.",

While AA is most commonly known for its antioxidant properties, it is also known to function as a pro-oxidant under select conditions. However, the complexity and often unknown composition of biological culture systems makes prediction of AA behaviour in supplemented cultures challenging. The frequent observation of outcomes inconsistent with antioxidant behaviour suggests that AA may be playing a pro-oxidant role more often than appreciated. In this work we explored the intracellular and extracellular impact of AA supplementation on KG1a myeloid leukaemia cells over a 24-h culture period following the addition of the AA supplement. At 24\u00a0h we found that supplementation of AA up to 250\u00a0\u03bcM resulted in intracellular antioxidant behaviour. However, when these same cultures were evaluated at 2 or 4\u00a0h we observed pro-oxidant activity at the higher AA concentrations indicating that the outcome was very much time and dose dependent. In contrast, pro-oxidant activity was never observed in the extracellular medium. Paradoxically, and to our knowledge not previously reported, we observed that intracellular pro-oxidant activity and extracellular antioxidant activity could occur simultaneously. These results indicate that the precise activity of AA supplementation varies as a function of dose, time and cellular location. Further, these results demonstrate how in the absence of careful culture characterization the true impact of AA on cultures could be underappreciated.",

Standard histological and molecular analytical approaches were employed to reveal morphological and cellular changes.Inactivation of Smad4 in the lens led to microphthalmia and cataract formation in addition to the persistent adhesion of the retina to the lens and the iris to the cornea. Inactivation of Smad4 from the ectoderm of the eyelid and cornea caused disruption to eyelid fusion and proper development of the corneal epithelium and corneal stroma.Smad4 is required for the development and maintenance of the lens in addition to the proper development of the cornea, eyelids, and retina.",

Bioinformatic analyses predict that angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a miR-155 target gene. The present study investigated the potential role of miR-155 in regulating AT1R expression and phenotypic differentiation in rat aortic adventitial fibroblasts (AFs). Luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-155 suppressed AT1R 3\u2032-UTR reporter construct activity. miR-155 overexpression in AFs did not reduce target mRNA levels, but significantly reduced target protein expression. In addition, AFs transfected with pSUPER/miR-155 exhibited reduced Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation. miR-155 overexpression in cells attenuated Ang II-induced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA, produces myofibroblast) expression, but did not transform growth factor beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21).

Recently, ADAM10-mediated cleavage of N-cadherin has been reported to play an important role in cell adhesion, migration, development and signaling. However, the significance of N-cadherin cleavage in chondrocyte differentiation has not been determined. In the present study, we found that the protein turnover of N-cadherin is accelerated during the early phase of chondrogenic differentiation in ATDC5 cells. Therefore, we generated the subclones of ATDC5 cells overexpressing wild-type N-cadherin, and two types of subclones overexpressing a cleavage-defective N-cadherin mutant, and examined the response of these cells to insulin stimulation. The ATDC5 cells overexpressing cleavage-defective mutants severely prevented the formation of cartilage aggregates, proteoglycan production and the induction of chondrocyte marker gene expression, such as type II collagen, aggrecan and type X collagen. These results suggested that the cleavage of N-cadherin is essential for chondrocyte differentiation.",

However, molecular mechanism of LT\u03b2R ligation-induced NF-\u03baB signaling remains incompletely understood. In this report we demonstrate that a novel zinc-finger protein 91 (ZFP91) is a critical regulator in LIGHT-induced activation of non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. ZFP91 appears to be required for NF-\u03baB2 (p100) processing to p52, nuclear translocation of p52 and RelB, and DNA-binding activity of NF-\u03baB in LIGHT-induced activation of non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, ZFP91 knock-down by RNA interference blocks the LIGHT-induced accumulation of NIK and p100 processing, as well as the expression of non-canonical NF-\u03baB target genes. These data clearly indicate that ZFP91 is a key regulator in LIGHT-induced activation of non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway in LT\u03b2R signaling.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 modulates transcription of a number of target genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and other important cellular responses. Mitofusin-2 (Mfn2) is a novel suppressor of cell proliferation that may also exert apoptotic effects via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified a p53 binding site in the Mfn2 promoter. Consistent with this, we showed that the p53 protein binds the Mfn2 promoter directly both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, we found that Mfn2 mRNA and protein levels are up-regulated in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, luciferase assays revealed that the activity of the wild-type Mfn2 promoter, but not a mutated version of the promoter, was up-regulated by p53. These results indicate that Mfn2 is a novel p53-inducible target gene, which provides insight into the regulation of Mfn2 and its associated activities in the inhibition of cell proliferation, promotion of apoptosis, and modulation of tumor suppression.",

In the rodent retina, Mrp4 mRNA and protein are exclusively expressed in vascular endothelial cells, but the angiogenic properties of Mrp4 are poorly understood so far. This study aims to explore the angiogenic properties of MRP4 in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRECs) utilizing the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. MRP4 expression was decreased at the mRNA and protein levels after stimulation with exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor in a dose-dependent manner. RNAi-mediated MRP4 knockdown in HRECs do not affect cell proliferation but enhances cell migration. Moreover, cell apoptosis induced by serum starvation was less prominent in MRP4 siRNA-treated HRECs as compared to control siRNA-treated HRECs. In a Matrigel-based tube-formation assay, although MRP4 knockdown did not lead to a significant change in the total tube length, MRP4 siRNA-treated HRECs assembled and aggregated into a massive tube-like structure, which was not observed in control siRNA-treated HRECs.

     "abstract": "Vertebrate akirin genes usually form a family with one-to-three members that regulate gene expression during the innate immune response, carcinogenesis and myogenesis. We recently established that an expanded family of eight akirin genes is conserved across salmonid fish. Here, we measured mRNA levels of the akirin family of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) during the differentiation of primary myoblasts cultured from fast-skeletal muscle. Using hierarchical clustering and correlation, the data was positioned into a network of expression profiles including twenty further genes that regulate myogenesis. akirin1(2b) was not significantly regulated during the maturation of the cell culture. akirin2(1a) and 2(1b), along with IGF-II and several igfbps, were most highly expressed in mononuclear cells, then significantly and constitutively downregulated as differentiation proceeded and myotubes formed/matured. Conversely, akirin1(1a), 1(1b), 1(2a), 2(2a) and 2(2b) were expressed at lowest levels when mononuclear cells dominated the culture and highest levels when confluent layers of myotubes were evident. However, akirin1(2a) and 2(2a) were first upregulated earlier than akirin1(1a), 1(1b) and 2(2b), when rates of myoblast proliferation were highest. Interestingly, akirin1(1b), 1(2a), 2(2a) and 2(2b) formed part of a module of co-expressed genes involved in muscle differentiation, including myod1a, myog, mef2a, 14-3-3\u03b2 and 14-3-3\u03b3. All akirin paralogues were expressed ubiquitously across ten tissues, although mRNA levels were regulated between cell-types and family members. Gene expression patterns were often highly correlated between akirin paralogues, suggesting that natural selection has maintained an intricate network of co-regulation among family members. We concluded that the Atlantic salmon akirin family performs a multifaceted role during myogenesis and has physiological functions spanning many cell-types.",

Members of the Tacc family reside at the centrosomes and associates with microtubules. Recent studies suggest that Tacc3 also contributes to the regulation of gene transcription. Tacc3 specifically interacts with the Notch4/Int3 CDC10/Ankyrin repeats and to a lesser extent, with residues C-terminal to these repeats in the ICD. Dual label immunofluorescence of mouse mammary tissue shows Tacc3 co-localizes with the Notch3 ICD. Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Notch and Tacc3 proteins from NIH3T3 cell extracts, lung and mammary gland confirms that these two proteins interact under physiological conditions. In addition, knock down of Tacc3 in NIH3T3 cells leads to the up-regulation of Hey2, a target gene for Notch signaling. The affinity of Tacc3 binding to Notch4/Int3 ICD is similar to that between Rbpj and Notch4/Int3 ICD. Notch4/Int3 ICD\u2013Tacc3 interaction results in the inhibition of transcription from a Hes1-Luciferase reporter vector in COS-1 cells. The inhibition was reversed in these cells by increasing the levels of Rbpj. Taken together, these results suggest that Tacc3 is a negative regulator of the Notch signaling pathway.",

Presently being tested in human clinical trials are compounds selective for \u03b14\u03b21 (VLA-4) as well as several dual antagonists that inhibit both \u03b14\u03b21 and \u03b14\u03b27. The value of a dual versus a selective small molecule antagonist as well as the consequences of inhibiting different affinity states of the \u03b14 integrins have been debated in the literature. Here, we characterize TBC3486, a N,N-disubstituted amide, which represents a unique structural class of non-peptidic, small molecule VLA-4 antagonists. Using a variety of adhesion assay formats as well as flow cytometry experiments using mAbs specific for certain activation-dependent integrin epitopes we demonstrate that TBC3486 preferentially targets the high affinity conformation of \u03b14\u03b21 and behaves as a ligand mimetic. The antagonist is capable of blocking integrin-dependent T-cell co-activation in vitro as well as proves to be efficacious in vivo at low doses in two animal models of allergic inflammation. These data suggest that a small molecule \u03b14 integrin antagonist selective for \u03b14\u03b21 over \u03b14\u03b27 and, specifically, selective for the high affinity conformation of \u03b14\u03b21 may prove to be an effective therapy for multiple inflammatory diseases in humans.",

Despite the biological importance of the GATA-1 and Sp1 interaction, the molecular mechanism of the interaction remains unclear. We constructed a series of deletion mutants of the zinc finger domains of GATA-1 and Sp1 to identify the regions within the GATA-1 and Sp1 zinc finger domains that interact. The zinc finger\u2013zinc finger interaction modes were also estimated from calorimetric measurements. This revealed that the interaction between the Sp1 and GATA-1 zinc finger domains was primarily electrostatic, and that the linker region of the Sp1 zinc fingers is important for the association with the GATA-1 zinc finger domains.

     "abstract": "Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a promising genetic risk factor for major mental disorders. Many groups repeatedly reported a role for DISC1 in brain development in various strains of mice and rats by using RNA interference (RNAi) approach. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of its molecular disposition, such as many splice variants and a spontaneous deletion in a coding exon of the DISC1 gene in some mouse strains, there have been debates on the interpretation on these published data. Thus, in this study, we address this question by DISC1 knockdown via short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) against several distinct target sequences with more than one delivery methodologies into several mouse strains, including C57BL/6, ICR, and 129X1/SvJ. Here, we show that DISC1 knockdown by in utero electroporation of shRNA against exons 2, 6, and 10 consistently results in neuronal migration defects in the developing cerebral cortex, which are successfully rescued by co-expression of full-length DISC1. Furthermore, lentivirus-mediated shRNA also led to migration defects, which is consistent with two other methodologies already published, such as plasmid-mediated and retrovirus-mediated ones. The previous study by Song\u2019s group also reported that, in the adult hippocampus, the phenotype elicited by DISC1 knockdown with shRNA targeting exon 2 was consistently seen in both C57BL/6 and 129S6 mice. Taken together, we propose that some of DISC1 isoforms that are feasible to be knocked down by shRNAs to exon 2, 6, and 10 of the DISC1 gene play a key role for neuronal migration commonly in various mouse strains and rats.",

In this study we focused on the actin\u2013myosin interaction which has been suggested to be an important player in the neurite extension. We examined in vitro how the decoration of actin filaments with a side-binding protein, drebrin-E, affects the motile properties of an intracellular transporter myosin V. Single myosin V molecules landed on the drebrin-E-decorated actin filaments with a lower frequency and ran over shorter distances; however, their velocities were normal. Furthermore, the analysis of the movement of myosin V molecules in the optical trap revealed that the decoration of actin filaments with drebrin-E markedly increased the load-sensitivity of the myosin V stepping. These results are attributable to the delay in the attachment of the motor\u2019s leading head (ADP\u00b7Pi state) to actin, induced by the competitive binding of drebrin-E to actin, whereas the rate of ADP release from the trailing head (the rate-limiting step in the ATPase cycle of myosin V) is unaffected.

Although proteasomal activity was slightly increased with UDCA, the effect was also observed for other bile acids. More importantly, immunoprecipitation assays revealed that UDCA promoted p53 ubiquitination, therefore leading to increased p53 degradation. In this regard, proteasome inhibition after UDCA pre-treatment resulted in accumulation of ubiquitinated p53, which in turn was prevented in cells overexpressing a mutated form of p53 that does not undergo Mdm-2 ubiquitination. The involvement of Mdm-2 in UDCA-mediated response was further confirmed by siRNA-mediated gene silencing experiments. Finally, the protective effect of UDCA against p53-induced apoptosis was abolished after inhibition of proteasome activity and prevention of p53 ubiquitination by Mdm-2. These findings suggest that UDCA protects cells from p53-mediated apoptosis by promoting its degradation via the Mdm-2-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.",

Here we show that Ngn2 is, indeed, ubiquitylated on non-canonical sites in extracts from neurula stage Xenopus embryos, when Ngn2 is usually active. Moreover, in the P19 mammalian embryonal carcinoma cell line capable of differentiating into neurons, xNgn2 is ubiquitylated on both canonical and non-canonical sites. We see that mutation of cysteines alone results stabilisation of the protein in P19 cells, indicating that non-canonical ubiquitylation on these residues normally contributes to the fast turnover of xNgn2 in mammalian cells.",

     "abstract": "Testosterone increases the size and strength of skeletal muscle. This study further characterized the molecular mechanisms of the anabolic actions of testosterone on a rat myoblast cell line (L6 cells). Testosterone did not induce hypertrophy in L6 cells lacking the androgen receptor (AR). Hypertrophy was prevented by the AR antagonist bicalutamide and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Testosterone induced Erk phosphorylation by 2\u00a0h, and mTOR autophosphorylation was elevated within 20\u00a0min; phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase was increased by 2\u00a0h. Inhibitors of Erk or PI3K blocked tesotosterone-induced hypertrophy. Erk phosphorylation returned to baseline when media containing testosterone was replaced at 16\u00a0h with fresh media lacking testosterone; when bicalutamide was added to testosterone-enriched media at 16\u00a0h, Erk phosphorylation remained elevated. Autophosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor was minimally altered by testosterone at 20\u00a0min and unaffected at later time points; PI3K/PDK1-dependent phosphorylation of Akt was not altered by testosterone. These findings indicate that testosterone stimulates hypertrophy of L6 myoblasts through a mechanism that requires its binding to the AR and involves a signaling cascade dependent upon Erk and mTOR which is likely activated by substances released into the extracellular space which are not IGF-1 or other ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases.",

Recent findings that Osx inhibits Wnt signaling provide a feedback control mechanism involved in bone formation. Mechanisms of Osx inhibition on Wnt signaling are not fully understood. Our results in this study revealed that the expression of a Wnt antagonist Sclerostin (Sost) was downregulated in Osx-null calvaria. Overexpression of Osx in stable C2C12 mesenchymal cell line resulted in Sost upregulation. Transient transfection assay showed that Osx activated 1\u00a0kb Sost promoter reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner. To define Sost promoter activated by Osx, we made a series of deletion mutants of Sost constructs, and narrowed down the minimal region to the proximal 260\u00a0bp. Gel shift assay indicated that Osx bound to GC-rich site within this minimal region, and that point mutations of this binding site disrupted Osx binding. Moreover, the same point mutations in 260\u00a0bp Sost promoter reporter disrupted the promoter activation by Osx, suggesting that the GC-rich binding site was responsible for Sost promoter activation by Osx. To further examine physical association of Osx with Sost promoter in vivo, Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using primary osteoblasts from mouse calvaria. Osx was found to associate with endogenous Sost promoter. Taken together, these findings support our hypothesis that Sost is a direct target of Osx. This provides a new additional mechanism through which Osx inhibits Wnt signaling during bone formation.",

Fluo-3 fluorimetric data demonstrated in intact cells that 1\u00a0h treatment with 1 or 10\u00a0\u03bcM rosiglitazone caused Ca2+ ions to leak into the cytoplasm. Gene expression analysis showed that within 4\u00a0h of rosiglitazone exposure, the UPR transcription factor XBP-1 was activated (likely due to corresponding ER Ca2+ depletion), and the UPR target genes BiP and SERCA2b were subsequently upregulated within 24\u201372\u00a0h.After 72\u00a0h 1 or 10\u00a0\u03bcM rosiglitazone treatment, microsomal Ca2+ATPase activity increased to >2-fold of that seen in control microsomes, while [Ca2+]i returned to basal, indicating that UPR-triggered SERCA2b upregulation was responsible for enhanced enzymatic Ca2+ sequestration within the ER. This appeared to be sufficient to replenish ER Ca2+ stores and restore normal cell physiology, as cell viability levels were not decreased due to rosiglitazone treatment throughout a 2-week study.Thus, incubation with 1\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM rosiglitazone triggers the UPR, but does not prove cytotoxic, in cells of the cardiovascular system.

To gain more insight into the properties of excitatory transmission to orexin neurons, whole cell patch clamp recordings were made in rat brain slices and quantal analysis of pharmacologically isolated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) was performed. In more than half the orexin neurons examined, mEPSCs showed heterogeneous time course: some mEPSCs had fast rise and decay (fast mEPSC), while some had longer kinetics, smaller amplitude but larger integrated area (slow mEPSC). Other orexin neurons showed low frequency mEPSCs with uniform, fast kinetics. In the former, distribution histogram of 10\u201390% rise time displayed two peaks, indicating that fast and slow mEPSCs are distinct subgroups. Occasionally fast and slow EPSCs would summate, suggesting that they arise from different pairs of active zones and postsynaptic receptor clusters. A large majority of mEPSCs were mediated by AMPA receptors that are sensitive to GYKI 52466 and DNQX. To determine whether synapses that give rise to fast and slow mEPSCs are differentially modulated, the D1- and D2-like agonists were tested on various parameters of mEPSCs. The agonists altered the frequency as previously reported, but had no effect on the rise, decay or area of mEPSC, suggesting that dopamine affects fast and slow mEPSCs equally. Given the potential physiological impact of EPSC time course on synaptic integration, our study raises an interesting possibility that distinct subset of excitatory synaptic inputs are processed differently by orexin neurons.",

The inverse correlation between Fto mRNA and glucose remained significant after adjusting for body weight. There were positive correlations between hepatic Fto mRNA expression and gluconeogenic gene expression.

We believe that the expression of the recombinant Bm-TFF2 in vitro is useful to decipher its role in amphibian skin repair. Bm-TFF2 contains 12 cysteine residues and has two TFF-domains. In this study, we expressed full-length of Bm-TFF2 and its single-domain truncations (Bm-TFF2-D1 and Bm-TFF2-D2, each contains a single TFF-domain of Bm-TFF2). The recombinant proteins, including full-length and its single-domain truncations of Bm-TFF2, can promote the migration of human epithelial AGS cells and wound healing of rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 cells. However, only the full-length of Bm-TFF2, but not its single-domain truncations, can inhibit ceramide-induced apoptosis in AGS cells. In summary, it is the first time to use the recombinant Bm-TFF2 and its truncations to investigate its structure\u2013function relationship.

While Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains more than 80 putative TA loci, the roles they play in this pathogen are yet to be studied. Here, we characterize a chromosomal Rv1102c\u2013Rv1103c TA system in M. tuberculosis. We found that the Rv1102c toxin interacts with the Rv1103c antitoxin in a pull-down assay and the yeast two-hybrid system. Rv1102c cleaved the era mRNA in Escherichia coli, and cleavage was inhibited by co-expression of Rv1103c. Heterologous expression of Rv1102c led to growth arrest in E. coli, which was fully recovered only when Rv1103c was co-expressed in cis with Rv1102c, suggesting that the production and assembly of Rv1102c and Rv1103c are tightly linked. Our additional results indicate that translational coupling of the Rv1102c and Rv1103c genes is important for Rv1102c\u2013Rv1103c binding. Finally, we discovered that the expression of Rv1102c induced growth arrest and increased the level of persister cells in Mycobacterium smegmatis. These results suggest that the Rv1102c\u2013Rv1103c TA system could play a role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis via generating bacilli that survive in the face of multidrug therapy.",

Because of their sequence homology with the Wnt-binding domain of Frizzled, they have generally been considered antagonists of canonical Wnt signaling. However, additional activities of various sFRPs including both synergism and mimicry of Wnt signaling as well as functions other than modulation of Wnt signaling have been reported. Using human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293A), we found that sFRP2 enhanced Wnt3a-dependent phosphorylation of LRP6 as well as both cytosolic \u03b2-catenin levels and its nuclear translocation. While addition of recombinant sFRP2 had no activity by itself, Top/Fop luciferase reporter assays showed a dose-dependent increase of Wnt3a-mediated transcriptional activity. sFRP2 enhancement of Wnt3a signaling was abolished by treatment with the Wnt antagonist, Dickkopf-1 (DKK1). Wnt-signaling pathway qPCR arrays showed that sFRP2 enhanced the Wnt3a-mediated transcriptional up-regulation of several genes regulated by Wnt3a including its antagonists, DKK1, and Naked cuticle-1 homolog (NKD1).

     "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation and histone modification controls cell fate during development and homeostasis in adulthood. Aberrant epigenetic modifications may lead to abnormal development, even diseases. We have found that Trip10 (thyroid hormone receptor interactor 10), an adaptor protein involved in diverse functions, is epigenetically regulated during lineage-specific induction of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To determine whether DNA methylation-induced gene silencing is sufficient to restrict cell fate changes, we applied an in\u00a0vitro method to specifically methylate the promoter of Trip10. Our hypothesis was that the methylation status of the Trip10 promoter in MSCs alters the differentiation preference of MSCs. Transfection of in vitro-methylated Trip10 promoter DNA into MSCs resulted in progressive accumulation of cytosine methylation at the endogenous Trip10 promoter, reduced Trip10 expression, and accelerated MSC-to-neuron and MSC-to-osteocyte differentiation. A two-component EGFP reporter gene system was established to confirm the level of transcriptional silencing and visualize the targeted DNA methylation. EGFP expression induced in the reporter system by targeted Trip10 methylation was reversed by adding 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, confirming that the suppressed Trip10 expression and disrupted MSC differentiation resulted from the in vitro-introduced methylations in the Trip10 promoter. With this targeted DNA methylation and reporter system, we are able to monitor the progression of locus-specific DNA methylation in vivo and correlate such changes with potential functional changes. Using this approach, we have established a new role for Trip10, showing that the level of Trip10 expression is associated with the maintenance and differentiation of MSCs.",

     "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue is a highly specialized organ that uses mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation to fuel non-shivering thermogenesis. In mice, mutations in the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family of fatty acid oxidation genes are associated with sensitivity to cold. Brown adipose tissue function has not previously been characterized in these knockout strains. Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficient mice were found to have increased brown adipose tissue mass as well as modest cardiac hypertrophy. Uncoupling protein-1 was reduced by 70% in brown adipose tissue and this was not due to a change in mitochondrial number, nor was it due to decreased signal transduction through protein kinase A which is known to be a major regulator of uncoupling protein-1 expression. PKA activity and in vitro lipolysis were normal in brown adipose tissue, although in white adipose tissue a modest increase in basal lipolysis was seen in SCAD\u2212/\u2212 mice. Finally, an in vivo norepinephrine challenge of brown adipose tissue thermogenesis revealed normal heat production in SCAD\u2212/\u2212 mice. These results suggest that reduced brown adipose tissue function is not the major factor causing cold sensitivity in acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout strains. We speculate that other mechanisms such as shivering capacity, cardiac function, and reduced hepatic glycogen stores are involved.",

In this study, we examined whether vinculin would activate integrin in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. Silencing of vinculin by lentiviral transduction with a short hairpin RNA sequence affected the binding of PAC-1 (an antibody recognizing activated human \u03b1IIb\u03b23) to a constitutively active form of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 (\u03b16B\u03b23) expressed on CHO cells, while its inhibitory effects were much weaker than those of talin-1. Overexpression of an active form of vinculin without intramolecular interactions, but not the full length one, induced PAC-1 binding to native \u03b1IIb\u03b23 expressed on CHO cells in a manner dependent on talin-1. On the other hand, silencing of talin-1, but not vinculin, failed to induce cell spreading of \u03b16B\u03b23-CHO cells on fibrinogen, even in the presence of PT 25-2, a monoclonal antibody that activates \u03b1IIb\u03b23.

     "abstract": "Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains serve as a signal for protein degradation by 26S proteasomes through its Ile44 hydrophobic patches interactions. The individual ubiquitin units of each chain are conjugated through an isopeptide bond between Lys48 and the C-terminal Gly76 of the preceding units. The conformation of Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin has been shown to change dynamically depending on solution pH. Here we enzymatically synthesized a wild-type Lys48-linked tetraubiquitin for structural study. In the synthesis, cyclic and non-cyclic species were obtained as major and minor fractions, respectively. This enabled us to solve the crystal structure of tetraubiquitin exclusively with native Lys48-linkages at 1.85\u00a0\u00c5 resolution in low pH 4.6. The crystallographic data clearly showed that the C-terminus of the first ubiquitin is conjugated to the Lys48 residue of the fourth ubiquitin. The overall structure is quite similar to the closed form of engineered tetraubiquitin at near-neutral pH 6.7, previously reported, in which the Ile44 hydrophobic patches face each other. The structure of the second and the third ubiquitin units [Ub(2)\u2013Ub(3)] connected through a native isopeptide bond is significantly different from the conformations of the corresponding linkage of the engineered tetraubiquitins, whereas the structures of Ub(1)\u2013Ub(2) and Ub(3)\u2013Ub(4) isopeptide bonds are almost identical to those of the previously reported structures. From these observations, we suggest that the flexible nature of the isopeptide linkage thus observed contributes to the structural arrangements of ubiquitin chains exemplified by the pH-dependent closed-to-open conformational transition of tetraubiquitin.",

The structural mechanism whereby aRelB neutralizes aRelE activity was examined by biochemical and biophysical analyses. Overexpression of aRelB with an aRelE mutant (\u0394C6), in which the C-terminal residues critical for aRelE activity were deleted, in Escherichia coli allowed a stable complex, aRelB\u2013\u0394C6, to be purified.

POR mutants Y181D, A457H, Y459H, V492E and R616X had total loss of HO-1 activity, while POR mutations A287P, C569Y and V608F lost 50\u201370% activity. The POR variants P228L, R316W and G413S, A503V and G504R identified as polymorphs had close to WT activity. Loss of HO-1 activity may result in increased oxidative neurotoxicity, anemia, growth retardation and iron deposition. Further examination of patients affected with POR deficiency will be required to assess the metabolic effects of reduced HO-1 activity in affected individuals.",

Aged mice and elderly adults both show decreased muscle mass as well as relatively low levels of the fat-derived hormone leptin. Here we demonstrate that loss of muscle mass and myofiber size with aging in mice is associated with significant changes in the expression of specific miRNAs. Aging altered the expression of 57 miRNAs in mouse skeletal muscle, and many of these miRNAs are now reported to be associated specifically with age-related muscle atrophy. These include miR-221, previously identified in studies of myogenesis and muscle development as playing a role in the proliferation and terminal differentiation of myogenic precursors. We also treated aged mice with recombinant leptin, to determine whether leptin therapy could improve muscle mass and alter the miRNA expression profile of aging skeletal muscle. Leptin treatment significantly increased hindlimb muscle mass and extensor digitorum longus fiber size in aged mice. Furthermore, the expression of 37 miRNAs was altered in muscles of leptin-treated mice. In particular, leptin treatment increased the expression of miR-31 and miR-223, miRNAs known to be elevated during muscle regeneration and repair. These findings suggest that aging in skeletal muscle is associated with marked changes in the expression of specific miRNAs, and that nutrient-related hormones such as leptin may be able to reverse muscle atrophy and alter the expression of atrophy-related miRNAs in aging skeletal muscle.",

     "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase RING1B plays an important role in Polycomb-mediated gene silencing by monoubiquitinating histone H2A. Both the activity and stability of RING1B are controlled by ubiquitination in two distinct manners. Self ubiquitination of RING1B generates K6, K27 and K48-based mixed polyubiquitin chain, and is required for its activity as a ligase. On the other hand, its proteasomal degradation is mediated by another ligase; E6-AP catalyzes the formation of K48-based chains. Since these two modes of ubiquitination target the same lysine residues and are therefore mutually exclusive, an important mode of regulation of RING1B should be at the level of deubiquitination. Here we identify USP7 as a deubiquitinating enzyme that regulates the ubiquitination state of RING1B. RING1B interacts with USP7, which is mediated in part by its RING domain. In addition, USP7 was found in a complex with other Polycomb proteins, suggesting a broad role in regulating these complexes. Although, USP7 directly and specifically deubiquitinates RING1B in vitro and in vivo, it does not discriminate between the activating and proteolysis-targeting modes of ubiquitination, and therefore has a stabilizing effect on RING1B.",

Although Bcl3 is known to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying the proto-oncogenic function of Bcl3 have not been completely elucidated. To gain insight into the oncogenic role of Bcl3, we applied a proteomic approach, which led to the identification of C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) as a binding partner of Bcl3. A PXDLS/R motif embedded in Bcl3 was found to mediate the interaction between Bcl3 and CtBP1, which caused the stabilization of CtBP1 by blocking proteasome-dependent degradation. Apoptotic stimuli-induced degradation of CtBP1 was significantly abolished by the upregulation of Bcl3, leading to the sustained repression of pro-apoptotic gene expression and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis. Intriguingly, a strong positive correlation between the protein levels of Bcl3 and CtBP1 was detected in breast cancer patient samples. Our study reveals a novel combinatorial role for Bcl3 and CtBP1, providing an explanation for the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells, which is a major requirement for cancer development.",

MPT/B-83 is a cell-associated lipoglycoprotein common to M. tuberculosis and M. bovis and an important antigen during infection of cattle. Since MPB83 is acylated and glycosylated, we investigated whether MPB83 would induce MMP-9 expression via interaction with TLR2, and assessed the contribution of the lipid, glycan and polypeptide components to its activity. Acylated peptide derived from MPB83 stimulated MMP-9 expression by human macrophage cells via interaction with both TLR2 and TLR1, but not TLR4. Lesser induction was found with secreted (non-acylated, but glycosylated) MPB83 protein purified from culture of M. bovis. Stimulation of cells with MPB83 induced TNF-\u03b1 production which acted to upregulate MMP-9 expression. Surprisingly, recombinant MPB83 protein devoid of any post-translational modification also induced MMP-9 expression.

Cyclin D1 inhibits p300-dependent RUNX3 acetylation and negatively regulates cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21 expression. These transcriptional effects of cyclin D1 do not require cdk4/6 kinase activation. We propose that cyclin D1 provides a transcriptional switch that allows the tumor suppressor activity of RUNX3 to be repressed in cancer cells.

Absence of either leukotriene, the precursor for LXA4, in mast cells or 12-LO in microparticles abolished LXA4 production. Using a mouse model, we demonstrated that platelet-derived microparticles were taken up by peritoneal mast cells in vivo and triggered LXA4 production. We also found that similar to LXA4, platelet-derived microparticles attenuated LPS- or dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation by regulating inflammatory cytokines. Together, these data suggest a critical role of platetlet-derived microparticles as a signal mediator, at least in LXA4 production, resulting in significant immunoregulatory consequences.",

Although GPR119 agonists represent promising oral antidiabetic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes therapy, they suffer from the inability to adequately directly preserve \u03b2-cell function. To identify a new structural class of small-molecule GPR119 agonists with both GSIS and the potential to preserve \u03b2-cell function, we screened a library of synthetic compounds and identified a candidate molecule, AS1269574, with a 2,4,6-tri-substituted pyrimidine core. Here, we examined the preliminary in vitro and in vivo effects of AS1269574 on insulin secretion and glucose tolerance. AS1269574 had an EC50 value of 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM in HEK293 cells transiently expressing human GPR119 and enhanced insulin secretion in the mouse pancreatic \u03b2-cell line MIN-6 only under high-glucose (16.8\u00a0mM) conditions. This contrasted with the action of the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, which also induced insulin secretion under low-glucose conditions (2.8\u00a0mM). In in vivo studies, a single administration of AS1269574 to normal mice reduced blood glucose levels after oral glucose loading based on the observed insulin secretion profiles. Significantly, AS1269574 did not affect fed and fasting plasma glucose levels in normal mice.

A time-lapse microscopy analysis showed that tlk-1 mutants are defective in chromosome condensation and cytokinesis, in addition to chromosome segregation, during mitosis. Our data indicate that TLK-1 contributes to chromosome condensation and segregation, at least in part, in a manner that is distinct from the ICP-1-mediated mechanism and does not involve loading AIR-2 or condensin proteins to mitotic chromosomes. Moreover, TLK-1 functions in cytokinesis by localizing AIR-2 to the midzone microtubules.

However, the cell surface phenotype of the native bone marrow stem/progenitor cell that gives rise to BMSCs that support hematopoiesis remains poorly defined. We recently reported the derivation of human BMSC-like cells (CD133BMSCs) by magnetic cell sorting against Prominin-1 (CD133), an epitope expressed by embryonic, fetal, and adult stem cells. Here we demonstrate that CD133BMSCs are capable of forming ectopic HMEs. Cultured adherent CD133BMSCs derived from sorted CD133-positive cells lacked CD133 expression, but were uniformly positive for CD146, an epitope recently described to identify self-renewing osteoprogenitor cells that could transfer the HME. CD133BMSCs were genetically-tagged by lentivirus, expanded, and seeded into HA/TCP/fibrin constructs that were implanted subcutaneously. After 60\u00a0days, CD133BMSCs produced human osteocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and reticular cells that supported murine hematopoiesis. CD133BMSCs that were not transduced with lentivirus also formed HMEs. Control constructs seeded with human dermal fibroblasts formed connective tissue, but failed to form HMEs. Our data indicate that CD133 expression identifies a native human bone marrow stem/progenitor cell that gives rise to BMSCs capable of forming the HME.",

     "abstract": "More and more protein structures are being discovered, but most of these still have little functional information. Based on the assumption that structural resemblance would lead to functional similarity, researchers computationally compare a new structure with functionally annotated structures, for high-throughput function prediction. The effectiveness of this approach depends critically upon the quality of comparison. In particular, robust classification often becomes difficult when a function class is an aggregate of multiple subclasses, as is the case with protein annotations. For such multiple-subclass classification problems, an optimal method termed the maximin correlation analysis (MCA) was proposed. However, MCA has never been applied to automated protein function prediction although MCA can minimize the misclassification risk in the correlation-based nearest neighbor classification, thus increasing classification accuracy. In this article, we apply MCA to classifying three-dimensional protein local environment data derived from a subset of the protein data bank (PDB). In our framework, the MCA-based classifier outperformed the compared alternatives by 7\u201319% and 6\u201327% in terms of average sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Given that correlation-based similarity measures have been widely used for mining protein data, we expect that MCA would be employed to enhance other types of automated function prediction methods.",

In the present study, we found that GH mRNA expression was facilitated by application of glucocorticoid. We artificially increased GH synthesis by transfection of green fluorescent protein-tagged GH (GH-GFP) gene. We found that the artificial elevation of GH expression in the cells did not accumulate the secretory granules in the cytosol, whereas glucocorticoid-induced the biogenesis of granules in GH-GFP-expressing MtT/S cells. We next performed DNA microarray and real-time RT-PCR analysis and found that glucocorticoid significantly altered the expression of membrane trafficking-related protein, syntaxin11 (Syx11). Immunocytochemical analysis further demonstrated that Syx11 positive structures were well colocalized with GH-containing granules in both MtT/S cells and rat anterior pituitary gland. Our findings indicate that glucocorticoid regulate the expression of Syx11 and facilitate the biogenesis and the trafficking of GH-containing granules in the MtT/S cells.",

Expression of oncogenes and stimulation with cytokines has been shown to suppress intercellular communication; however, the exact mechanism by which intercellular communication is disrupted by these factors remains uncertain. In this report, we show that Akt is essential for the disruption of gap junctional communication in v-Src-transformed cells. In addition, inhibition of Akt restores gap junctional communication after it is suppressed by TNF-\u03b1 signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of a constitutively active form of Akt1, but not of Akt2 or Akt3, is sufficient to suppress gap junctional communication.

The cellular localization and function of Repin1 has remained elusive since its discovery in 1990. To characterize the role of Repin1 in adipocyte biology, we used siRNA knockdown technology to reduce the expression of Repin1 by electroporation of semiconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Glucose transport, palmitate uptake as well as triglyceride content were measured. In paired samples of human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, we investigated whether Repin1 mRNA expression is related to measures of fat accumulation and adipocyte size. We demonstrate that Repin1 increases during adipogenesis. RNA interference based Repin1 downregulation in mature adipocytes significantly reduces adipocyte size and causes reduced basal, but enhanced insulin stimulated glucose uptake into 3T3-L1 cells. Additionally, knockdown of Repin1 resulted in reduced palmitate uptake and significantly changed the mRNA expression of genes involved lipid droplet formation, adipogenesis, glucose and fatty acid transport. Furthermore, we found significant correlations between Repin1 mRNA expression in human paired visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and total body fat mass as well as adipocyte size. We have identified a potential role for Repin1 in the regulation of adipocyte size and expression of glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4 in adipocytes.",

In this study, we show that Siva-1 also interacts with a member of the Jak family protein kinases, tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). Siva-1 bound to Tyk2 via its N-terminal region, and Tyk2 phosphorylated Siva-1 at tyrosines 53 and 162. In murine pro-B cells, Ba/F3 cells, expression of Tyk2 augmented Siva-1-induced apoptosis. This augmentation of Siva-1-induced apoptosis was retained regardless of the phosphorylation of Siva-1, but was almost completely prevented by the abrogation of the Tyk2-Siva-1 association. These findings indicate that the interaction between Siva-1 and Tyk2 directly augments the apoptotic activity of Siva-1.

Although numerous reports suggest that protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are involved in cytokine induction in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS; TLR4 ligand) in macrophages, the PTK-mediated signal transduction pathway has yet to be analyzed in detail. Here, we carried out a comprehensive and quantitative dynamic tyrosine phosphoproteomic analysis on the TLR4-mediated host defense system in RAW264.7 macrophages using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). We determined the temporal profiles of 25 proteins based on SILAC-encoded peptide(s). Of these, we focused on the tyrosine phosphorylation of B-cell adaptor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (BCAP) because the function of BCAP remains unknown in TLR signaling in macrophages. Furthermore, Bcap has two distinct transcripts, a full-length (Bcap-L) and an alternatively initiated or spliced (Bcap-S) mRNA, and little is known about the differential functions of the BCAP-L and BCAP-S proteins. Our study showed, for the first time, that RNAi-mediated selective depletion of BCAP-L enhanced IL-6 and IL-10 production but not TNF-\u03b1 production in TLR ligand-stimulated macrophages. We propose that BCAP-L (but not BCAP-S) is a negative regulator of the TLR-mediated host defense system in macrophages.",

The Cdc42 GTPase activating protein cdGAP is shown to interact with Pkc\u03b6 at baseline and prevent Par6-Cdc42 association. Erk, by phosphorylating cdGAP at threonine776, can inhibit the GAP activity, thereby increasing Par6-Cdc42 association and TJ disassembly.

In vivo, they are likely to interact frequently both in the bone marrow and at sites of injury. In this study, the physical and biochemical interactions between BM-EPCs and MSCs in an in vitro co-culture system were investigated to further clarify their roles in vascularization. BM-EPC/MSC co-cultures established close cell\u2013cell contacts soon after seeding and self-assembled to form elongated structures at 3\u00a0days. Besides direct contact, cells also exhibited vesicle transport phenomena. When co-cultured in Matrigel, tube formation was greatly enhanced even in serum-starved, growth factor free medium. Both MSCs and BM-EPCs contributed to these tubes. However, cell proliferation was greatly reduced in co-culture and morphological differences were observed. Gene expression and cluster analysis for wide panel of angiogenesis-related transcripts demonstrated up-regulation of angiogenic markers but down-regulation of many other cytokines. These data suggest that cross-talk occurs in between BM-EPCs and MSCs through paracrine and direct cell contact mechanisms leading to modulation of the angiogenic response.",

However, these results are blind to lineage-specific cis-regulatory elements. In this study, we identified ER and FoxA1 binding sites conserved in evolution by using Detection of LinEage-Specific Selection (DLESS) method. We also analyzed target genes close to conserved cis-regulatory elements by combining gene-expression data. A total of 7877 ER binding sites and 18,135 FoxA1 binding sites were identified in MCF-7 cells by performing an unbiased genome-wide ChIP-chip with False Discovery Rate (FDR) of 5%.

Furthermore, network analysis of apoptosis-related genes within 10\u00a0kb of fully conserved cis-regulatory elements was constructed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Apoptosis genes in the network showed over- and under-expression in MCF-7 cell-line. And these apoptosis-related genes closest to fully conserved cis-regulatory elements in network showed strong correlation with ER in MCF-7 cells. These results elucidate that ER regulates an evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway. This opens up new perspectives in the apoptosis of human breast cancer from the evolution of cis-regulatory elements.",

     "abstract": "Pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells possess the ability to differentiate into many cell types, but the precise mechanisms of differentiation are still unclear. Here, we provide evidence that Rbpj (recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa j region) protein, the primary nuclear mediator of Notch, is involved in osteogenesis. Overexpression of Rbpj promoted osteogenic differentiation of mouse Kusa-A1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Transient transfection of an Rbpj expression vector into Kusa-A1 cells upregulated promoter activities of Runx2 and Ose2. Enhanced osteogenic potentials including high alkaline phosphatase activity, rapid calcium deposition, and increased calcified nodule formation, were observed in established stable Rbpj-overexpressing Kusa-A1 (Kusa-A1/Rbpj) cell line. In vivo mineralization by Kusa-A1/Rbpj was promoted compared to that by Kusa-A1 host cells. Histological findings revealed that expression of Rbpj was primarily observed in osteoblasts. These results suggest that Rbpj may play essential roles in osteoblast differentiation.",

Our results showed that overexpression of TTP reduced the stability of cIAP2 mRNA and the expression level of cIAP2. In addition, TTP destabilized a luciferase mRNA containing cIAP2 mRNA 3\u2032UTR. cIAP2 mRNA 3\u2032UTR contains four AU-rich elements (AREs) and the 2nd ARE was responsible for the TTP-mediated destabilization of the cIAP2 mRNA. RNA EMSA revealed that TTP directly bound to 42 nucleotides from the 3\u2032UTR of cIAP2 mRNA containing the 2nd ARE. However, the 42 nucleotides did not promote TTP-dependent destabilization of mRNA and did not recruit the decapping enzyme Dcp2 and the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease Xrn1. When we used a 52 nucleotide sequence containing an additional 5 nucleotides from cIAP2 mRNA 3\u2032UTR at both ends, this long nucleotide sequences recruited Dcp2 and Xrn1 and promoted TTP-dependent destabilization of mRNA. Collectively, our results suggest that TTP can bind to the 2nd ARE of cIAP2 mRNA 3\u2032UTR and destabilize cIAP2 mRNA by forming complexes with Dcp2 and Xrn1. However, while a short nucleotide sequence containing the 2nd ARE of cIAP2 mRNA can recruit the TTP binding, this cannot recruit Dcp2 and Xrn1 and cannot induce TTP-mediated destabilize the mRNA. Instead, additional nucleotide sequences are required to recruit Dcp2 and Xrn1 and to destabilize mRNA.",

To understand the role of the fork-head transcription factor FOXN3 in mammalian development, we have generated a mutant mouse model for the Foxn3 gene. Our analysis shows that the Foxn3 mutation leads to partial embryonic and postnatal lethality, growth retardation, eye formation defects, dental anomalies and craniofacial defects.

Interestingly, the phenotypes of Foxn3 mutant mice show a striking overlap with the clinical features of human patients with congenital defects and chromosomal aberrations involving the human FOXN3 locus.

     "abstract": "Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that has antidiabetic and antiatherogenic effects through two membrane receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) and adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2). Although it has been reported that the expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 is regulated under physiological and pathophysiological states, their regulation is largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or obesity-inducible ATF3 negatively regulates the expression of adiponectin and AdipoR2. Here, we investigated the regulation of another adiponectin receptor, AdipoR1 by ATF3, to determine if ATF3 may contribute to impairment of adiponectin signaling by repressing the expression of both adiponectin and adiponectin receptors. We found that treatment with thapsigargin, a stimulator of ATF3 expression as an inducer of ER stress, decreased AdipoR1 expression in insulin-sensitive cells (HepG2, C2C12) and insulin secreting cells (MIN6N8). Furthermore, overexpression of lentivirus carrying-ATF3 decreased AdipoR1 expression in those cells, demonstrating that ATF3 downregulates AdipoR1 expression. Next, we investigated the effects of ATF3 on human AdipoR1 promoter activity and identified an ATF3-responsive region in the promoter. Both thapsigargin treatment and ATF3 expression repressed AdipoR1 promoter activity. Transfection studies using mutant constructs containing 5\u2032-deletions in the human AdipoR1 promoter revealed that putative ATF/CRE site is located between the \u2212248 and \u2212224, TGACGCGG. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that ATF3 directly binds to human AdipoR1 promoter spanning from \u2212248 to \u2212224. Finally, deletion of the putative ATF/CRE site abrogated ATF3-mediated transrepression of the AdipoR1 promoter. Importantly, ATF3 expression was increased in hyperglycemia or TNF-\u03b1-treated C2C12 cells in which AdipoR1 expression was decreased, suggesting that ATF3 may contribute to downregulation of AdipoR1 by hyperglycemia and TNF-\u03b1. Collectively, these results demonstrate that ATF3 negatively regulates human AdipoR1 expression via binding to an ATF3-responsive region in the promoter, which plays an important role in attenuation of adiponectin signaling and induction of insulin resistance.",

Using immunoblot analysis we showed that BGs generated from the flagellin-deficient (\u0394FliC) E. coli strain NK9375 were as effective as its isogenic wild-type (wt) E. coli strain NK9373 to induce psoriasin expression when normalized to BG particles being taken up by KCs. However, results obtained from endocytic activity of KCs reflect that internalization of BGs is greatly dependent on the presence of flagellin on the surface of BGs. Moreover, BGs derived from wt E. coli NK9373 strongly induced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, compared to \u0394FliC E. coli NK9375 BGs. Taken together, obtained data demonstrate that non-living BGs possessing all bacterial bio-adhesive surface properties in their original state while not posing any infectious threat have the capacity to induce the expression of innate immune modulators and that these responses are partially dependent on the presence of flagellin.",

SM22\u03b1 overexpression in HepG2 cells elevated p16INK4a followed by pRB activation, but did not activate the p53/p21WAF1/Cip1 pathway. Moreover, MT-1G, which is induced by SM22\u03b1 overexpression, was involved in the activation of the p16INK4a/pRB pathway, which led to a growth arrest state and promoted cellular senescence caused by damaging agents.

Here, we conducted electrophysiological studies to clarify the influences of the Scn1a mutation on the hippocampal synaptic transmission, specifically focusing on the GABAergic system. Hippocampal slices were prepared from Hiss or F344 (control) rats and maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2in vitro. Single neuron activity was recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons and their responses to the test (unconditioned) or paired pulse (PP) stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers were evaluated. Hiss rats were first tested for pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures and confirmed to show high seizure susceptibility to the blockade of GAGAA receptors. The Scn1a mutation in Hiss rats did not directly affect spike generation (i.e., number of evoked spikes and firing threshold) of the CA1 pyramidal neurons elicited by the Schaffer collateral/commissural stimulation. However, GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition of pyramidal neurons by the PP stimulation was significantly disrupted in Hiss rats, yielding a significant increase in the number of PP-induced firings at PP intervals of 32\u2013256\u00a0ms.

Glycerol release was significantly elevated immediately (0\u00a0h) and three hours (3\u00a0h) after exercise. Both activity and localization to the pellet of HSL were significantly greater in the pellet fraction, which is included in lipid droplet associated-proteins, than in the supernatant fraction. In the pellet fraction, although neither perilipin A nor CGI-58 protein level changed, level of perilipin A/CGI-58 complex was significantly reduced, accompanied by up-regulated association of perilipin A/HSL at 0\u00a0h and 3\u00a0h after exercise. On the other hand, there were no changes in these molecules at 24\u00a0h after exercise, despite a significant decrease in lipolysis that was observed in response to isoproterenol. These findings suggest that acute exercise enhances lipolysis up to at least 3\u00a0h after exercise in a manner dependent on modification of HSL and its association with and alteration in scaffold protein.",

In scutellarin-treated HUVECs, a dramatic increase in migration was measured by wound healing assay; Transwell chamber assay found significantly more invading cells in scutellarin-treated groups. Scutellarin also promoted capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs on Matrigel, and significantly upregulated platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 at both mRNA and protein levels.

To purify and isolate a novel anabolic that acts to osteoblasts, we monitored changes in intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+]i). We identified a novel, 24 amino-acid peptide from the rat stomach and termed this peptide osteoblast activating peptide (OBAP). Furthermore, we examined the effects of OBAP in osteoblasts. First, osteoblast differentiation markers (alkaline phosphatase [ALP], osteocalcin [OCN]) were analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. We also examined the ALP activity in osteoblasts induced by OBAP. OBAP significantly increased the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers and the activity of ALP in vitro. Next, to address the in vivo effects of OBAP on bone metabolism, we examined the bone mineral density (BMD) of gastrectomized (Gx) rats and found that OBAP significantly increased BMD in vivo. Finally, to confirm the in vivo effects of OBAP on bone, we measured serum ALP and OCN in Gx rats and found that OBAP significantly increased serum ALP and OCN. Taken together, these results indicate that the novel peptide, OBAP, positively regulates bone formation by augmenting osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, these results may provide a new therapeutic approach to anabolically treat bone-related disorders.",

We assume that investigation of the internal structure of chromosomes will aid in elucidating the condensation process. In order to observe the detailed structure of a chromosome, we stretched a human chromosome by using a micromanipulator and observed its morphology along the stretched region by scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We found that the chromosome consisted of some fibers that were thicker than chromatin fibers. The found fiber was composed of approximately 90-nm-wide beads that were linked linearly. To explore the components of the fiber, we performed immunofluorescence staining of the stretched chromosome. Fluorescence signals of topoisomerase (Topo) II\u03b1, which is known to interact with and support chromatin fibers, and DNA were detected both on the found fiber and beads. Furthermore, after micrococcal nuclease and trypsin treatments, the fibers were found to be mechanically supported by proteins.

This marks the PMV as a biologically distinct entity from that of its parent cell, despite containing surface markers from the original cell, and also explains its role in events such as phagocytosis and thrombosis. There is currently a large amount of variation between investigators with regard to the pre-analytical steps employed in isolating red cell PMVs or RPMVs (which are slightly smaller than most PMVs), with key differences being centrifugation and sample storage conditions, which often leads to result variability.

Beyond its expression in steroid-producing tissues, heart, liver and kidney, the PBR is also known to be highly expressed in blood cells. In this work, we demonstrate by flow cytometry experiments, that SSR180575, at low concentrations, is able to protect polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) against TNF\u03b1-induced apoptosis in whole blood. Thus, in a new context, SSR180575 again shows potent anti-apoptotic properties.

To understand the tissue-specific role of SCD1 in energy homeostasis, we have generated mice with an adipose-specific knockout of Scd1 (AKO), and report here that SCD1 deficiency increases GLUT1 expression in adipose tissue of AKO mice, but not global SCD1 knockout (GKO) mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with an SCD inhibitor, basal glucose uptake and the cellular expression of GLUT1 were significantly increased while GLUT4 expression remained unchanged. Consistently, adipose-specific SCD1 knockout (AKO) mice had significantly elevated GLUT1 expression, but not GLUT4, in white adipose tissue compared to Lox counterparts. Concurrently, adiponectin expression was significantly diminished, whereas TNF-\u03b1 expression was elevated. In contrast, in adipose tissue of GKO mice, GLUT4 and adiponectin expression were significantly elevated with lowered TNF-\u03b1 expression and little change in GLUT1 expression, suggesting a differential responsiveness of adipose tissue to global- or adipose-specific SCD1 deletion. Taken together, these results indicate that adipose-specific deletion of SCD1 induces GLUT1 up-regulation in adipose tissue, associated with decreased adiponectin and increased TNF-\u03b1 production, and suggest that GLUT1 may play a critical role in controlling glucose homeostasis of adipose tissue in adipose-specific SCD1-deficient conditions.",

     "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that cell surface receptors, such as the entire epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, have been shown to localize in the nucleus. A retrograde route from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is postulated to be involved in the EGFR trafficking to the nucleus; however, the molecular mechanism in this proposed model remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that membrane-embedded vesicular trafficking is involved in the nuclear transport of EGFR. Confocal immunofluorescence reveals that in response to EGF, a portion of EGFR redistributes to the Golgi and the ER, where its NH2-terminus resides within the lumen of Golgi/ER and COOH-terminus is exposed to the cytoplasm. Blockage of the Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking by brefeldin A or dominant mutants of the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor, which both resulted in the disassembly of the coat protein complex I (COPI) coat to the Golgi, inhibit EGFR transport to the ER and the nucleus. We further find that EGF-dependent nuclear transport of EGFR is regulated by retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER involving an association of EGFR with \u03b3-COP, one of the subunits of the COPI coatomer. Our findings experimentally provide a comprehensive pathway that nuclear transport of EGFR is regulated by COPI-mediated vesicular trafficking from the Golgi to the ER, and may serve as a general mechanism in regulating the nuclear transport of other cell surface receptors.",

In addition, we demonstrate that a lysine-rich region (aa 101\u2013140) in the first half of DNA binding domain of the Dot1p is critical in interaction with ubiquitin as well as binding to nucleosome core.

HCV uses components of the host cell to proliferate, including lipid droplets (LD) onto which HCV core proteins bind and facilitate viral particle assembly. We have measured the dynamics of HCV core protein-mediated changes in LDs and rates of LD movement on microtubules using a combination of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), two-photon fluorescence (TPF), and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopies. Results show that the HCV core protein induces rapid increases in LD size. Particle tracking experiments show that HCV core protein slowly affects LD localization by controlling the directionality of LD movement on microtubules. These dynamic processes ultimately aid HCV in propagating and the molecules and interactions involved represent novel targets for potential therapeutic intervention.",

Their subcellular localizations are regulated through interaction with Rax1p/Rax2p. We investigated when and where Bud8p and Bud9p physically interact with Rax2p in vivo using a split-GFP method. GFP fluorescence showed that Bud8p physically interacted with Rax2p at the proximal or distal pole in unbudded cells; a physical interaction was also observed at the opposite pole to the growing bud in mother cells with a large-size bud. Bud9p physically interacted with Rax2p at the birth scar in budded mother cells.

However, prolonged incubation of cells with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in remodeling of fused mitochondria into large swollen mitochondria with irregular cristae structure. While initial fusion of mitochondria by 15d-PGJ2 required the presence of both outer (Mfn1 and Mfn2) and inner (OPA1) mitochondrial membrane fusion proteins, later mitochondrial changes involved increased degradation of the fusion protein OPA1 and ubiquitination of newly synthesized OPA1 along with decreased expression of Mfn1 and Mfn2, which likely contributed to the loss of tubular rigidity, disorganization of cristae, and formation of large swollen degenerated dysfunctional mitochondria. Similar to inhibition of Drp1 by 15d-PGJ2, decreased expression of fission protein Drp1 by siRNA also resulted in the loss of fusion proteins. Prevention of 15d-PGJ2 induced mitochondrial elongation by thiol antioxidants prevented not only loss of OPA1 isoforms but also its ubiquitination. These findings provide novel insights into unforeseen complexity of molecular events that modulate mitochondrial plasticity.",

They are divided in two subclasses based on their affinities for each other and on sequence conservation. Receptor\u2013ligand binding within each subclass is fairly promiscuous, while binding cross the subclasses happens rarely. EphA4 is an exception to this general rule, since it has long been known to bind both A- and B-class ephrin ligands but the reason for this exceptional behavior has not been worked out at molecular level. Recent structural and biochemical studies on EphA4 ligand-binding domain alone and in complex with its ligands have addressed this question. However, the published structures of EphA4/ephrin complexes differ considerably from each other and strikingly different explanations for the exceptional promiscuity of EphA4 were proposed. To address these contradictory findings, we have determined a crystal structure of the EphA4 ligand-binding domain at 2.3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and show that the receptor has an unprecedented ability to exist in two very different, well-ordered conformations even in the unbound state. Our results suggest that the ligand promiscuity of the Ephs is directly correlated with the structural flexibility of the ligand-binding surface of the receptor.",

We used different vinculin mutants mimicking either a permanently activated or inhibited phosphorylation site at position 1065. Using these mutants, we determined their influence on the exchange dynamics and cell forces using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and traction microscopy. The results indicate that phosphorylation at Y1065 significantly increases the amount of freely exchanging vinculin within FAs whereas inhibition of this phosphorylation site leads to an uncontrolled exchange of vinculin and reduced adhesive cell forces.

In this study we use a ratiometric calcium imaging with fura-2 AM as a calcium indicator to show that misoprostol alters intracellular calcium levels in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells via similar mechanisms as PGE2. We demonstrate that the misoprostol-induced increase in calcium is mediated by a protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent mechanism and that the EP4 receptor signaling pathway may play an inhibitory role on calcium regulation.

Growth inhibition of planktonic bacteria was tested using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS).

Synergistic effects were evaluated by testing the effects of P5-18mer alone and in combination with flomoxef sodium, isepamicin or cefpiramide at 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MIC. P5-18mer peptide displayed strong activity against pathogens and flomoxef sodium, isepamicin and cefpiramide-resistant bacteria cell lines obtained from a patient with gallstones; however, it did not exert cytotoxicity against the human keratinocyte HaCat cell line.

Finally, the use of P5-18mer and antibiotics exerted synergistic effects against cell lines that were resistant to commonly used antibiotics.

We found that V. vulnificus produce OMVs and that these vesicles can induce host cell death. This process appears to be mediated by VvhA, as evidenced by the finding that OMVs isolated from VvhA-null mutants do not induce cytotoxicity. In addition, cholesterol sequestration in the host cells prevents OMV-mediated VvhA delivery, indicating that VvhA-bearing OMVs interact with cholesterol on the host cell surface.

We hypothesized that the excessive activation of signal transduction pathways, which is responsible for VEGF/VEGFR-2-mediated endothelial permeability (Src, Akt), is a new element in the pathogenesis of chronic UC. We demonstrated increased expression of pro-angiogenic growth factor VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-2 in colonic tissue during acute 6% iodoacetamide-induced UC in rats and chronic spontaneously developed UC in IL-10 knockout mice (IL-10 KO). Development of acute 6% iodoacetamide-induced UC in rats was accompanied by activation of Erk1/2 and Src kinase, while expression of total proteins Erk1/2 and Src was unchanged. During chronic colitis phosphorylation (i.e., activation) of Erk1/2 was significantly decreased in IL-10 KO mice vs. wild-type mice. Levels of total Erk1/2 proteins were unchanged, but the expression of total Src protein as well as its phosphorylated form was significantly increased in IL-10 KO vs. wild-type mice. There were no changes in total Akt proteins, while levels of activated Akt (pAkt) were slightly increased in IL-10 KO vs. wild-type mice.

Furthermore, cDNA microarray analysis revealed the repression of COX-2, another member of the ER stress pathway. In contrast, these genes were not altered either by the low-risk HPV-6b E5, or a C-terminal HPV-16 E5 mutant, in which the histidine and alanine residues (conserved in high-risk HPVs) were replaced with tyrosine and isoleucine (conserved in low-risk HPVs). HPV-16 E5 was also able to lower COX-2 mRNA levels in cells co-expressing E6/E7, suggesting that it might exert similar activity during viral replication. Interestingly, the E6/E7 genes were independently able to lower COX-2 transcripts compared to vector cells, indicating that multiple pathways of COX-2 repression exist. COX-2 downregulation by E5 could be overcome by thapsigargin or tunicamycin treatments, which initiate ER stress via calcium fluxes and abnormal protein glycosylation respectively, making it unlikely that E5 specifically tempers these pathways. Overall, our data indicate that E5 represses the cellular ER stress response and suggest a potential role for E5 during productive HPV infection.",

     "abstract": "Ski acts as a transcriptional co-repressor by multiple direct and indirect interactions with several distinct repression complexes. Ski represses retinoic acid (RA) signaling by interacting with, and stabilizing, key components of the co-repressor complex, namely, HDAC3. However, little is known as to how the Ski protein can stabilize HDAC3. In the present study, we identified the Siah2 protein as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediated proteasomal degradation of HDAC3. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays further revealed that Ski interacts with Siah2. Furthermore, co-expression of the Ski protein stabilized the level of Siah2 protein. Since Siah2 regulates its own level of expression by self-degradation, the stabilization of Siah2 by Ski is an indication that Ski association leads to inhibition of Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Only wild-type Ski and Ski truncation mutants that were in the same complex with Siah2 could stabilize HDAC3 levels. Taken together, the results suggest that association with Ski leads to inhibition of Siah2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and in this way, the Ski protein inhibits Siah2-mediated proteasomal degradation of HDAC3.",

The optimal preclinical testing of promising therapies would be aided by a humanized immune-mediated T1D model. We develop this model in NOD-scid IL2r\u03b3null mice. The selective destruction of pancreatic islet \u03b2 cells was mediated by human T lymphocytes after an initial trigger was supplied by the injection of irradiated spleen mononuclear cells (SMC) from diabetic nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. This resulted in severe insulitis, a marked loss of total \u03b2-cell mass, and other related phenotypes of T1D. The migration of human T cells to pancreatic islets was controlled by the \u03b2 cell-produced highly conserved chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and its receptor C-X-C chemokine receptor (CXCR) 4, as demonstrated by in vivo blocking experiments using antibody to CXCR4. The specificity of humanized T cell-mediated immune responses against islet \u03b2 cells was generated by the local inflammatory microenvironment in pancreatic islets including human CD4+ T cell infiltration and clonal expansion, and the mouse islet \u03b2-cell-derived CD1d-mediated human iNKT activation. The selective destruction of mouse islet \u03b2 cells by a human T cell-mediated immune response in this humanized T1D model can mimic those observed in T1D patients. This model can provide a valuable tool for translational research into T1D.",

This study aimed to clarify if indoxyl sulfate could contribute to cell senescence in the aorta of hypertensive rats. The rat groups consisted of (1) Dahl salt-resistant normotensive rats (DN), (2) Dahl salt-resistant normotensive indoxyl sulfate-administered rats (DN\u00a0+\u00a0IS), (3) Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats (DH), and (4) Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive indoxyl sulfate-administered rats (DH\u00a0+\u00a0IS). After 32\u00a0weeks, their arcuate aortas were excised for histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Cell senescence was evaluated by immunohistochemistry of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal), and senescence-related proteins such as p16INK4a, p21WAF1/CIP1, p53 and retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Both DH and DH\u00a0+\u00a0IS rats showed significantly higher systolic blood pressure than DN and DN\u00a0+\u00a0IS rats, respectively. Serum indoxyl sulfate levels were significantly higher in DN\u00a0+\u00a0IS and DH\u00a0+\u00a0IS rats than in DN and DH rats, respectively. In aorta, DH rats showed significantly increased aortic calcification and wall thickness, and increased expression of SA-\u03b2-gal, p16INK4a, p21WAF1/CIP1, p53 and Rb in the calcification area of arcuate aorta as compared with DN rats. More notably, DH\u00a0+\u00a0IS rats showed significantly increased aortic calcification and wall thickness, and significantly increased expression of SA-\u03b2-gal, p16INK4a, p21WAF1/CIP1, p53 and Rb in the cells embedded in the calcification area as compared with DH rats.

     "abstract": "Neopterin production is induced in human monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells upon stimulation with Th1-type cytokine interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). In parallel, IFN-\u03b3 induces the tryptophan-(trp)-degrading enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and triggers the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Translocation of the signal transduction element nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is induced by ROS and accelerates the pro-inflammatory response by activation of other pro-inflammatory pathways. Therefore, a close relationship between NF-\u03baB expression, the production of neopterin and the degradation of trp can be assumed, although this has not been demonstrated so far. In the present in vitro study we compared the influence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on NF-\u03baB activation, neopterin formation and the degradation of trp in THP-1Blue cells, which represent the human myelomonocytic cell line THP-1 stably transfected with an NF-\u03baB inducible reporter system.In cells stimulated with LPS, a significant induction of NF-\u03baB was observed, and this was paralleled by an increase of kynureunine (kyn) and neopterin concentrations and a decline of trp. The increase of the kyn to trp quotient indicates accelerated IDO activity. Higher LPS concentrations and longer incubation of cells were associated with higher activities of all three biochemical pathways and significant correlations existed between NF-\u03baB activation, neopterin release and trp degradation (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We conclude that there is a parallel induction of NF-\u03baB, neopterin formation and trp degradation in monocytic THP-1 cells, which is elicited by pro-inflammatory triggers like LPS during innate immune responses.",

Thirty-one (20 males/11 females) of 83 matrilineal relatives in these families exhibited the variable severity and age-at-onset in visual impairment. The average age-of-onset of vision loss was 22\u00a0years old. Strikingly, these penetrances of visual impairment in these Chinese families were higher than those in other 11 Chinese pedigrees carrying the only ND4 G11778A mutation. Molecular analysis identified the known G11778A mutation and distinct sets of variants belonging to the Asian haplogroups M10a and M7c2. Of these, the T14502C mutation caused the substitution of a highly conserved isoleucine for valine at position 58 in ND6. This mutation has been associated with LHON in other Chinese families with very low penetrance of LHON. Thus, the deficient activities of complex I, caused by G11778A mutation, would be worsened by the T14502C mutation in these four Chinese families. As a result, mitochondrial dysfunctions would lead to the high penetrance and expressivity of visual loss in these Chinese families carrying both G11778A and T14502C mutations than other 11 Chinese families carrying only G11778A mutation. These data suggested that the T14502C variant may modulate the phenotypic manifestation of the G11778A mutation in these Chinese pedigrees.",

Giardia intestinalis, a microaerophilic parasite causing one of the most common intestinal human infectious diseases worldwide, is the only pathogenic protozoon as yet identified coding for a flavoHb. By NO amperometry we show that, in the presence of NADH, the recombinant Giardia flavoHb metabolizes NO with high efficacy under aerobic conditions (TN\u00a0=\u00a0116\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0s\u22121 at 1\u00a0\u03bcM NO, T\u00a0=\u00a037\u00a0\u00b0C).

Immunoblotting analysis shows that the protein is expressed at low levels in the vegetative trophozoites of Giardia; accordingly, these cells aerobically metabolize NO with low efficacy. Interestingly, in response to nitrosative stress (24-h incubation with \u2a7e5\u00a0mM nitrite) flavoHb expression is enhanced and the trophozoites thereby become able to metabolize NO efficiently, the activity being sensitive to both cyanide and carbon monoxide. The NO-donors S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and DETA-NONOate mimicked the effect of nitrite on flavoHb expression. We propose that physiologically flavoHb contributes to NO detoxification in G. intestinalis.",

Here, we established a model of efficient EMT induction in normal finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) using transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2). We demonstrate that EMT in HMEC occurs in three distinctive phases that are governed by a hierarchy of EMT-activating transcription factors (TFs). Loss of epithelial cell polarity (ZO-1), and acquisition of mesenchymal marker (Vimentin, Fibronectin) expression are immediate-early events, whereas switching from E-cadherin to N-cadherin protein expression occurs only after EMT-like morphological changes become apparent. The kinetics of TF induction suggests that ZEB1 and SNAIL mediate early EMT induction reinforced by ZEB2, while GOOSECOID and FOXC2 may play a role in EMT maintenance. TWIST and SLUG were not significantly induced in this system. Furthermore, we show for the first time that normal HMEC acquire a CD44+/CD24\u2212/low stem cell phenotype during a third phase of EMT that is characterized by maximum TF expression levels.

Significantly, in cyr1\u0394 cells, but not wild type cells, a substantial proportion of Pka1 protein is hyperphosphorylated. Pka1 hyperphosphorylation is strongly induced in cyr1\u0394 cells, and to varying degrees in wild type cells, by both glucose starvation and stationary phase stresses, which are associated with reduced cAMP-dependent PKA activity, and by KCl stress, the cellular adaptation to which is dependent on PKA activity. Interestingly, hyperphosphorylation of Pka1 was not detected in either cyr1+ or cyr1\u0394 S. pombe strains carrying a deletion in the PKA regulatory subunit gene, cgs1, under any of the tested conditions.

To test whether this is also true in the heart, we measured HSL activity in the left ventricle of sedentary male rats that had been treated with testosterone supplementation or orchidectomy with or without testosterone substitution. Left ventricle HSL activity against TG was significantly elevated in intact rats supplemented with testosterone. HSL activity against both TG and diacylglyceride was reduced by orchidectomy, whereas testosterone replacement fully reversed this effect. Moreover, testosterone increased left ventricle free fatty acid levels, caused an inhibitory effect on carbohydrate metabolism in the heart, and elevated left ventricular phosphocreatine and ATP levels as compared to control rats.

Its removal could prevent the glutamate excitotoxicity that causes long-lasting neurological deficits. As in previous studies, we have established the role of blood glutamate levels in brain neuroprotection, we have now investigated the contribution of the peripheral organs to the homeostasis of glutamate in blood. We have administered naive rats with intravenous injections of either l-[1-14C] Glutamic acid (l-[1-14C] Glu), l-[G-3H] Glutamic acid (l-[G-3H] Glu) or d-[2,3-3H] Aspartic acid (d-[2,3-3H] Asp), a non-metabolized analog of glutamate, and have followed their distribution into peripheral organs. We have observed that the decay of the radioactivity associated with l-[1-14C] Glu and l-[G-3H] Glu was faster than that associated with glutamate non-metabolized analog, d-[2,3-3H] Asp. l-[1-14C] Glu was subjected in blood to a rapid decarboxylation with the loss of 14CO2. The three major sequestrating organs, serving as depots for the eliminated glutamate and/or its metabolites were skeletal muscle, liver and gut, contributing together 92% or 87% of total l-[U-14C] Glu or d-[2,3-3H] Asp radioactivity capture. l-[U-14C] Glu and d-[2,3-3H] Asp showed a different organ sequestration pattern. We conclude that glutamate is rapidly eliminated from the blood into peripheral tissues, mainly in non-metabolized form. The liver plays a central role in glutamate metabolism and serves as an origin for glutamate metabolites that redistribute into skeletal muscle and gut. The findings of this study suggest now that pharmacological manipulations that reduce the liver glutamate release rate or cause a boosting of the skeletal muscle glutamate pumping rate are likely to cause brain neuroprotection.",

Its maximum potency at 100\u00a0\u03bcM was stronger than that of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a positive control. At this concentration, 2Cl-C.OXT-A moderately stimulated proliferation as well as migration of HUVEC. To gain mechanistic insights how 2Cl-C.OXT-A promotes angiogenic responses in HUVEC, we performed immunoblot analyses using phospho-specific antibodies as probes. 2Cl-C.OXT-A induced robust phosphorylation/activation of MAP kinase ERK1/2 and an upstream MAP kinase kinase MEK. Conversely, a MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished ERK1/2 activation and tube formation both enhanced by 2Cl-C.OXT-A. In contrast, MAP kinase responses elicited by 2Cl-C.OXT-A were not inhibited by SU5416, a specific inhibitor of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Collectively these results suggest that 2Cl-C.OXT-A-induces angiogenic responses in HUVEC mediated by a MAP kinase cascade comprising MEK and ERK1/2, but independently of VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase. In vivo assay using chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and rabbit cornea also suggested the angiogenic potency of 2Cl-C.OXT-A.",

     "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma is primarily caused by a t(11;22) chromosomal translocation encoding the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein. To exert its oncogenic function, EWS-FLI1 acts as an aberrant transcription factor, broadly altering the gene expression profile of tumor cells. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF\u03baB) is a tightly regulated transcription factor controlling cell survival, proliferation and differentiation, as well as tumorigenesis. NF\u03baB activity is very low in unstimulated Ewing sarcoma cells, but can be induced in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). We wondered whether NF\u03baB activity could be modulated by EWS-FLI1 in Ewing sarcoma. Using a knockdown approach in Ewing sarcoma cells, we demonstrated that EWS-FLI1 has no influence on NF\u03baB basal activity, but impairs TNF-induced NF\u03baB-driven transcription, at least in part through inhibition of NF\u03baB binding to DNA. We detected an in vivo physical interaction between the fusion protein and NF\u03baB p65, which could mediate these effects. Our findings suggest that, besides directly controlling the activity of its primary target promoters, EWS-FLI1 can also indirectly influence gene expression in tumor cells by modulating the activity of key transcription factors such as NF\u03baB.",

To better understand how CRBN expression is regulated, the promoter region of the mouse CRBN gene was characterized functionally. Deletion mutations and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of a functional NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-binding site. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis indicated that Nrf2 binds to a putative binding site in the CRBN promoter. Nrf2 overexpression and tert-butylhydroquinone treatment enhanced CRBN protein expression. These results imply that Nrf2 stimulates CRBN gene transcription under H/R conditions in neuronal cells.",

The results revealed a marked increase in the lyso-Gb3 level in most tissues of Fabry mice, and which decreased after the administration of a recombinant GLA as in the case of Gb3, which is usually used as a biomarker of Fabry disease. The response was more impressive for lyso-Gb3 compared with for Gb3, especially in kidney tissues, in which a defect significantly influences the morbidity and mortality in patients with this disease. The plasma level of lyso-Gb3 also decreased after the injection of the enzyme, and it was well related to the degradation of tissue lyso-Gb3.

To test our hypothesis, we tested the role of IGF in tumor growth in vitro by treatment with the tyrosine kinase small molecule inhibitor, picropodophyllin (PPP), which strongly inhibits the IGF pathway.

     "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are essential to the success of molecularly targeted therapies. Recently, numerous therapeutic antibodies have been developed for various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. Experimental systems to effectively evaluate these candidate antibodies are urgently needed. One of the mechanisms used by antibodies to kill tumor cells is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which natural killer cells (NK) are the main mediator. The capacity to induce ADCC has conventionally been assessed in the human\u2013mouse xeno-graft model, in which human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), containing NK cells along with antibodies, are administered to tumor-bearing immunodeficient mice. However, contamination from other cellular populations often affects tumor growth, making it difficult to evaluate the antibody\u2019s effect. In this study, we established a new NK-dependent ADCC assay model using a supra-immunodeficient strain of mice, NOD/SCID/\u03b3cnull (NOG). Our model system simply consisted of three elements: isolated human NK cells, a Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma cell line (Daudi), and an anti-CD20 antibody (Rituximab). In this experimental setting, human NK cells from healthy donors retained their killing activity and suppressed the growth of Daudi cells in NOG mice when they were administered along with Rituximab. This system, therefore, is useful for evaluating the in vivo function of human NK cells.",

     "abstract": "Eighty years ago, Burr and Burr, introduced for the first time the concept of essential fatty acids. Now is very well known that requirements for polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFAs can not be met by de novo metabolic processes within mammalian tissues. Animals are absolutely dependent on plants for providing the two major precursors of the n-6 and n-3 fatty acids, C18:2n-6; linoleic and C18:3n-3; \u03b1-linolenic acids. In animal tissues these precursors are transformed to fatty acids containing three to six double bonds. During the last four decades the interest in polyunsaturated fatty acids has augmented manifolds, and the number of published studies is rising each year. The current impetus for this interest has been mainly the observation that PUFAs and their metabolites have several physiological roles including: energy provision, membrane structure, cell signaling and regulation of gene expression. In addition the observation that PUFAs are targets of lipid peroxidation opens a new important area of investigation. Melatonin, the main secretory product of the pineal gland, efficiently scavenges both the hydroxyl and peroxyl radicals counteracting lipid peroxidation in biological membranes. In addition the two key pineal biochemical functions, lipoxygenation and melatonin synthesis may be synergistically regulated by the status of n-3 essential fatty acids. At the retina level, free radicals may preferentially react with the membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids leading to the release of lipoperoxide radicals. These lipoperoxides can induce oxidative stress linked to membrane lysis, damage to neuronal membranes may be related to alteration of visual function.",

We here observed that nuclear translocation of TPPII was dependent on signaling by MAP kinases, including p38MAPK. Further, this was caused by several types of DNA-damaging drugs, a DNA cross-linker (cisplatinum), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (etoposide), and to some extent also by nucleoside-analogues (5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea). In the minority of tumor cell lines where TPPII was not translocated into the nucleus in response to DNA damage we observed reduced intracellular ROS levels, and the expression levels of redox defense systems were increased. Further, treatment with the ROS-inducer \u03b3-hexa-chloro-cyclohexane (\u03b3-HCH, lindane), an inhibitor of GAP junctions, restored nuclear translocation of TPPII in these cell lines upon \u03b3-irradiation. Moreover, blocking nuclear translocation of TPPII in etoposide-treated cells, by using a peptide-derived inhibitor (Z-Gly-Leu-Ala-OH), attenuated expression of \u03b3-H2AX in \u03b3-irradiated melanoma cells.

We analyzed male knockout and C57BL6J mice fed normal or lithogenic diet for 6\u00a0weeks. On lithogenic diet, the prevalence rate of gallstone was significantly greater in knockout mice than C57BL6J mice. The molar percentages of \u03b2 and \u03c9-muricholic acid were significantly higher and hepatic sterol 12\u03b1-hydroxylase expression (cyp8b1) was significantly lower in knockout mice than C57BL6J mice fed normal diet. The bile apolipoprotein A-I protein levels were decreased in knockout mice. Histological examination showed gallbladder wall thickening and accumulation of glycoprotein in the gallbladder of knockout mice. Gallbladder phospholipase A2-IVA expression was significantly higher in knockout mice than in C57BL6J mice fed lithogenic diet. Our results indicate that lack of adiponectin promotes gallstone formation in mice.",

Here, we analyzed how the expression of the two active anti-angiogenic VASH-1 isoforms p36 and p42 was altered during physiological and pathological muscle angio-adaptation. Our results showed that VASH-1 protein expression was muscle-type specific, with higher levels detected in less vascularized muscles. In rat plantaris and heart muscles, the expression of VASH-1 protein was decreased in response to exercise training, a physiological pro-angiogenic stimulus leading to muscle capillary growth. Interestingly, expression patterns for p36 and p42 were different between plantaris and heart muscles. Next, we analyzed the time-course expression of VASH-1 isoforms in rat soleus muscles subjected to hindlimb unloading, a model that induces muscle capillary regression. Both p36 and p42 isoforms were increased, a signal in favor of some vessel destabilization and regression. Finally, we investigated VASH-1 expression in plantaris muscles from Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF) that develop obesity and type-2 diabetes associated with a loss of capillaries in skeletal muscle. VASH-1 expression was higher in sedentary ZDF rats when compared to lean animals, suggesting its potential role during capillary regression. Interestingly, a physiological VASH-1 level was efficiently restored in spontaneously active ZDF animals where muscle capillarization was preserved. In conclusion, our results bring evidence that endogenous VASH-1 isoforms p36 and p42 are key actors of physiological and pathological muscle angio-adaptation.",

Invasion of transformed keratinocytes through the basement membrane into the dermis results in invasive cSCC with substantial metastatic potential.

Keratin 8 (Krt8) and Krt18, not seen in normal keratinocytes, were coexpressed and formed Krt8/18 filaments in the metastatic line. The metastatic line efficiently invaded an artificial basement membrane in vitro owing to the Krt8/18-coexpression, since coexpression of exogenous Krt8/18 in the non-invasive parental line conferred invasiveness. To test whether the Krt8/18-coexpression is induced and is involved in cSCC invasion, we examined specimens from 21 pre-invasive and 24 invasive cSCC patients by immunohistochemistry, and the ectopic Krt8/18-coexpression was almost exclusively found in invasive cSCC.

Furthermore, knock-down of HIF-1\u03b1 using lentiviral RNA interference sensitized tumor cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death under hypoxic condition.

Ultrastructural analyses showed typical saucer-shaped exosomes in the culture supernatant from both the control and Hrs-depleted DCs. However, the amount of exosome secretion was significantly decreased in Hrs-depleted DCs following stimulations with ovalbumin (OVA) as well as calcium ionophore. Antigen-presentation activity was also suppressed in exsosomes purified from Hrs-depleted DCs, while no alteration in OVA degradation was seen in Hrs-depleted DCs.

     "abstract": "There are significant differences in the rate of neuronal death after peripheral nerve injury between species. The rate of neuronal death of motor neurons after nerve injury in the adult rats is very low, whereas that in adult mice is relatively high. However, the understanding of the mechanism underlying axotomy-induced motor neuron death in adult mice is limited. Cathepsin B (CB), a typical cysteine lysosomal protease, has been implicated in three major morphologically distinct pathways of cell death; apoptosis, necrosis and autophagic cell death. The possible involvement of CB in the neuronal death of hypogrossal nucleus (HGN) neurons after nerve injury in adult mice was thus examined. Quantitative analyses showed the mean survival ratio of HGN neurons in CB-deficient (CB\u2212/\u2212) adult mice after nerve injury was significantly greater than that in the wild-type mice. At the same time, proliferation of microglia in the injured side of the HGN of CB\u2212/\u2212 adult mice was markedly reduced compared with that in the wild-type mice. On the injured side of the HGN in the wild-type adult mice, both pro- and mature forms of CB markedly increased in accordance with the increase in the membrane-bound form of LC3 (LC3-II), a marker protein of autophagy. Furthermore, the increase in CB preceded an increase in the expression of Noxa, a major executor for axotomy-induced motor neuron death in the adult mouse. Conversely, expression of neither Noxa or LC3-II was observed in the HGN of adult CB\u2212/\u2212 mice after nerve injury. These observations strongly suggest that CB plays a critical role in axotomy-induced mortor neuron death in adult mice.",

Using cryo-electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy, we show that, in the presence of the protein, the lipid vesicles elongate, and form bead necklace-like structures that evolve toward small vesicles or thread-like structures. In the presence of multilamellar vesicles, where a large reservoir of lipid is available, the presence of BSP proteins lead to the formation of long nanotubes. Long spiral-like threads, associated with lipid/protein complexes, are also observed. The local curvature of lipid membranes induced by the BSP proteins may be involved in lipid domain formation and the extraction of some lipids during the sperm maturation process.",

A reporter assay identified a BMP6-responsive region 3.0\u00a0kb upstream of the transcription initiation site. The region showed sequence similarity to the mouse Id1 promoter and shared potential Smad binding sites with it, two GGCGCC palindromes and one GTCT element. Mutation analysis demonstrated the involvement of these elements in the BMP response. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed the physical binding of Smad proteins to these elements. The 3\u2032-positioned GGCGCC palindrome and the GTCT element were separated by 5-bp and conformed to the canonical BMP-responsive sequence. In addition, the 5\u2032-positioned GGCGCC was accompanied by a previously uncharacterized CGCC element, which were separated by a 5-bp space, and this configuration coincided with that of a similar but distinct sequence to which a Drosophila homolog of the Smad complex can bind.

The reason for its antileishmanial activity is believed to be its ability to bind ergosterol found in parasite membranes. In case of in vivo amphotericin B treatment, both host macrophages and parasites are exposed to amphotericin B. The effect of amphotericin B treatment could therefore be due to a combination of its interaction with both sterols i.e., ergosterol of Leishmania and cholesterol of host macrophages. We report here that cholesterol complexation by amphotericin B markedly inhibits binding of L. donovani promastigotes to macrophages. These results represent one of the first reports on the effect of amphotericin B on the binding of Leishmania parasites to host macrophages.

Incubation with 1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L sanguinarine for 4 and 24\u00a0h killed more efficiently MG-63 cells than SaOS-2 cells, while incubation with 5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L sanguinarine killed almost 100% of both cell populations within 24\u00a0h. This treatment also changed the mitochondrial membrane potential in both MG-63 and SaOS-2 cells within 1\u00a0h, caused chromatin condensation and the formation of apoptotic bodies. It activated multicaspases, and increased the activities of caspase-8 and caspase-9 in both MG-63 and SaOS-2 cells.

Endothelium-denuded rat aortic rings were treated with heat shock for 45\u00a0min at 42\u00a0\u00b0C and then subjected to assays for the production of force, ROS, and the expression of ROS-related enzymes. AngII-induced contraction was enhanced in heat shock-treated aorta. AngII-induced production of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide were elevated in response to the heat shock treatment. Pre-treatment with superoxide dismutases (SOD) mimetic and inhibitors for glutathione peroxidase and NADPH oxidase but not for xanthine oxidase eliminated an increase in the AngII-induced contraction in the heat shock-treated aorta. Heat shock increased the expression of p47phox, a cytosolic subunit of NADPH oxidase, but not Cu\u2013Zn\u2013SOD and Mn\u2013SOD. In addition, heat shock increased contraction that was evoked by hydrogen peroxide and pyrogallol.

Although rotenone is a potent inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, it can induce death of dopaminergic neurons independently of complex I inhibition. Here we describe effects of rotenone in the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which lacks complex I and carries out rotenone-insensitive cellular respiration. We show that rotenone induces generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as fragmentation of mitochondrial networks in treated S. pombe cells. While rotenone is only modestly inhibitory to growth of wild type S. pombe cells, it is strongly inhibitory to growth of mutants lacking the ERK-type MAP kinase, Pmk1, or protein kinase A (PKA). In contrast, cells lacking the p38 MAP kinase, Spc1, exhibit modest resistance to rotenone. Consistent with these findings, we provide evidence that Pmk1 and PKA, but not Spc1, are required for clearance of ROS in rotenone treated S. pombe cells. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of S. pombe for elucidating complex I-independent molecular targets of rotenone as well as mechanisms conferring resistance to the toxin.",

Serum IgA levels, renal IgA deposition, mesangial proliferation, and glomerulosclerosis were increased in 32-week-old HIGA mice in comparison to ddY animals. By microarray analysis, five genes were observed to be increased by more than 2.5-fold in 32-week-old HIGA in comparison to 16-week-old HIGA; these same five genes were decreased more than 2.5-fold in 32-week-old ddY in comparison to 16-week-old ddY mice.

     "abstract": "CD38 is a multifunctional enzyme that has both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities, being capable of cleaving NAD+ to cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR) and hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR. It has been reported that there is markedly a reduction of cADPR and elevation of NAD in many tissues from CD38 knockout (CD38\u2212/\u2212) mice. Cyclic ADPR is a potent second messenger for intracellular Ca2+ mobilization, and NAD is a key cellular metabolite for cellular energetic and a crucial regulator for multiple signaling pathways in cells. We hypothesize that CD38 knockout may have a protective effect in oxidative stresses through elevating NAD and decreasing cADPR. In the present study, we observed that the mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CD38\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly resistant to oxidative stress such as H2O2 injury and hypoxia/reoxygenation compared with wild type MEFs (WT MEFs). We further found that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and concentrations of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in CD38\u2212/\u2212 MEFs were markedly reduced compared with WT MEFs during hypoxia/reoxygenation. Coincidence with these results, a remarkably lower mRNA level of Nox1, one of the enzymes responsible for ROS generation, was observed in CD38\u2212/\u2212 MEFs. Furthermore, we found that transcription of Nox1 mRNA in WT MEFs could be elevated by calcium ionophore ionomycin in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the expression of Nox1 mRNA can be regulated by elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]. Therefore we concluded that CD38\u2212/\u2212 MEFs are resistant to oxidative stresses through inhibiting intracellular Ca2+ overload and ROS production which may be regulated by Ca2+-mediated inhibition of Nox1 expression. Our data should provide an insight for elucidating the roles of CD38 in oxidative stresses and a novel perspective of dealing with the ischemia/reperfusion-related diseases.",

It has been documented that moderate activation of Fas receptor may cause reversible inhibition of store-operated channels by ceramide released from hydrolyzed sphingomyelin. Here we show that activation of Fas receptor in T-cells results in caspase-dependent decrease of cellular STIM1 and Orai1 protein content. This effect may be responsible for the substantial inhibition of Ca2+ entry into Jurkat cells undergoing apoptosis. In turn, this inhibition might prevent overloading of cells with calcium and protect them against necrosis.",

Recent studies using gene array technology have attempted to apply a hypothesis-generating approach to elucidate the pathogenesis of PDR, but these studies rely on mRNA differences, which may or may not be related to significant biological processes. To better understand the basic mechanisms of PDR and to identify potential new biomarkers, we performed shotgun liquid chromatography (LC)/tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis on pooled protein extracts from neovascular membranes obtained from PDR specimens and compared the results with those from non-vascular epiretinal membrane (ERM) specimens. We detected 226 distinct proteins in neovascular membranes and 154 in ERM. Among these proteins, 102 were specific to neovascular membranes and 30 were specific to ERM. We identified a candidate marker, periostin, as well as several known PDR markers such as pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). We then performed RT-PCR using these markers. The expression of periostin was significantly up-regulated in proliferative membrane specimens. Periostin induces cell attachment and spreading and plays a role in cell adhesion. Proteomic analysis by LC/MS/MS, which permits accurate quantitative comparison, was useful in identifying new candidates such as periostin potentially involved in the pathogenesis of PDR.",

To characterize the upregulation of gene expression by MSL cis-spreading, we measured the expressional change of neighboring genes by microarray when the genes were bound by MSL complexes that spread from an autosomal roX transgene. Genes within a 200\u00a0kb region that includes roX transgenes were upregulated concurrently with MSL cis-spreading. Conversely, there was almost no expressional change in genes from other regions. RT-PCR and ChIP analyses confirmed that the approximately 2-fold gene hypertranscription was due to MSL cis-spreading. We also demonstrated that upregulation of the neighboring gene could rescue haplo-insufficient phenotypes of the Minute mutant, such as short bristle, delayed adult eclosion and decreased viability. These results indicate that the hypertranscription by MSL cis-spreading is a general mechanism that occurs in several tissue types.

Here we show the differing effects of tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination of both MVB12 proteins on their respective functions. As noted in our previous study, Tyr204 phosphorylation of MVB12A in response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation affects binding to CD2AP, which regulates the amounts of EGF receptor bound to ESCRT-I. Strikingly, ubiquitination of Lys264 and Lys290 of MVB12B was induced and led to the instability and inclusion of MVB12B in COS-7 cells. These ubiquitinations increased upon EGF stimulation, which was regulated by the phosphorylations of Tyr241 and Tyr243 of MVB12B. Furthermore, MVB12A was also involved in the aggregation-prone proteins of MVB12B. These results suggest that the expression of MVB12B may be normally suppressed through the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway that simultaneously regulates the fate of MVB12A and the functions of ESCRT-I.",

However, the complexity of TCF7L2 expression with numerous mRNA isoforms coding for proteins with distinct N- and C-termini allows variability in TCF7L2 functions and regulations. Here, we show that although TCF7L2 mRNA isoforms distinguish fetal, immortalized and adult differentiated endothelial cells (EC), they cannot explain the lack of significant \u03b2-catenin/TCF7 activities in ECs. Lithium, a Wnt-signaling activator, increases TCF7L2 mRNA levels and induces an RNA isoform switch favoring the expression of TCF7L2-short forms lacking the C-termini domains. Although the latter occurs in different cell types, its extent depends on the overall increase of TCF7L2 transcription, which correlates with cell responsiveness to Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. While GSK3\u03b2 down-regulation increases TCF7L2 expression, there is no concomitant change in TCF7L2 mRNA isoforms, which demonstrate the dual effects of lithium on TCF7L2 expression via a GSK3\u03b2-dependent up-regulation and a GSK3\u03b2-independent modulation of RNA splicing. TCF7L2E-long forms display a repressor activity on TCF7L2-promoter reporters and lithium induces a decrease of the endogenous TCF7L2 forms bound to native TCF7L2-promoter chromatin at two novel distal TCF7-binding sites. Altogether our data reveal a lithium-induced RNA switch favoring the expression of TCF7L2-short forms, which results in a transcriptional de-repression of lithium target genes negatively regulated by TCF7L2-long forms, like TCF7L2, and thus to an amplification of Wnt-signaling in responsive cells.",

We have previously identified the development of antibodies (Abs) following lung transplantation to K-\u03b11-tubulin (KAT), an epithelial surface gap junction cytoskeletal protein, in patients who develop BOS. However, the biochemical and molecular basis of the interactions and signaling cascades mediated by KAT Abs are yet to be defined. In this report, we investigated the biophysical basis of the epithelial cell membrane surface interaction between KAT and its specific Abs. Towards this, we analyzed the role of the lipid raft-domains in the membrane interactions which lead to cell signaling and ultimately increased growth factor expression. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, upon specific ligation with Abs to KAT obtained either from the serum of BOS(+) patients or monoclonal KAT Abs, resulted in upregulation of growth factors VEGF, PDGF, and bFGF (6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1-, 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9-, and 3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1-fold increase, respectively) all of which are important in the pathogenesis of BOS. To define the role for lipid raft in augmenting surface interactions, we analyzed the changes in the growth factor expression pattern upon depletion and enrichment with lipid raft following the ligation of the epithelial cell membranes with Abs specific for KAT. NHBE cells cultured in the presence of \u03b2-methyl cyclodextran (\u03b2MCD) had significantly reduced growth factor expression (1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3, vs \u03b2MCD untreated being 6.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1-fold increase) upon stimulation with KAT Abs. Depletion of cholesterol on NHBE cells upon treatment with \u03b2MCD also resulted in decreased partitioning of caveolin in the membrane fraction indicating a decrease in raft-domains. In conclusion, our results demonstrate an important role for lipid raft-mediated ligation of Abs to KAT on the epithelial cell membrane, which results in the upregulation of growth factor cascades involved in the pathogenesis of BOS following human lung transplantation.",

However, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms by which FAK modulation is controlled by XIAP. In this study, we show that XIAP modulates FAK activity through the control of FAK phosphorylation. In bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), phosphorylation of Tyr-576 in FAK is elevated by laminar shear stress. This elevated phosphorylation appears to be responsible for shear stress-stimulated ERK activation. We found that XIAP knockdown reduces shear stress-enhanced phosphorylation of Tyr-576 and induces shear stress-triggered translocation of FAK into nucleus. Nuclear translocation of FAK reduces contact between FAK and Src, a kinase which phosphorylates Tyr-576. This spatial segregation of FAK from Src decreases Tyr-576 phosphorylation and thus shear-stimulated ERK activation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that XIAP plays a key role in shear stress-stimulated ERK activation by maintaining the Src-accessible location of FAK.",

To elucidate the roles of different isoforms of NOS, we tested the effects of non-selective NOS inhibition and neuronal NOS (nNOS)- and inducible NOS (iNOS)-gene deficiency on the pulmonary oxidative and nitrosative stress reaction in a murine sepsis model. The injury was induced by four sets of cotton smoke using an inhalation chamber and subsequent intranasal administration of live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 colony-forming units). In wild type mice, the injury was associated with excessive releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma, enhanced neutrophil accumulation, increased lipid peroxidation, and excessive formation of reactive nitrogen species and vascular endothelial growth factor in the lung. Both nNOS- and iNOS-gene deficiency led to significantly reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress markers in the lung, but failed to significantly improve survival. Treatment with a non-selective NOS inhibitor failed to reduce the oxidative and nitrosative stress reaction to the same extent and even tended to increase mortality. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that both nNOS and iNOS are partially responsible for the pulmonary oxidative and nitrosative stress reaction in this model.

However, the polymers cannot be detected in cells, while TGase 2 over-expression depletes free I-\u03baB\u03b1, which raises the question of how the polymerized I-\u03baB\u03b1 can be metabolized in cells. Among proteasome, lysosome and calpain systems, calpain inhibition was found to effectively increase the accumulation of I-\u03baB\u03b1 polymers in MCF7 cells transfected with TGase 2, and induced high levels of I-\u03baB\u03b1 polymers as well in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that naturally express a high level of TGase 2. Inhibition of calpain also boosted the level of I-\u03baB\u03b1 polymers in HEK-293 cells in case of TGase 2 transfection either with I-\u03baB\u03b1 or I-\u03baB\u03b1 mutant (S32A, S36A). Interestingly, the combined inhibition of calpain and the proteasome resulted in an increased accumulation of both I-\u03baB\u03b1 polymers and I-\u03baB\u03b1, concurrent with an inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. This suggests that \u03bc-calpain proteasome-dependent I-\u03baB\u03b1 polymer degradation may contribute to cancer progression through constitutive NF-\u03baB activation.",

Here we report investigations of the mechanism of regulation of the binding properties of the SH3 domains of intersectin (ITSN1) and Src kinase by alternative splicing. Comparative sequence analysis of ITSN1 and Src genes revealed the conservation of alternatively spliced microexons affecting the structure of the SH3 domains in vertebrates. We show that neuron-specific ITSN1 transcripts containing the microexon 20 that encodes five amino acid residues within the SH3A domain are expressed in zebrafish from the earliest stages of the development of the nervous system. Models of alternative isoforms of the ITSN1 SH3A domain revealed that the insertion encoded by the microexon is located at the beginning of the n-Src loop of this domain causing a shift of negatively charged amino acids towards the interaction interface. Mutational analysis confirmed the importance of translocation of these negatively charged amino acids for interaction with dynamin 1. We also identified a residue within the microexon-encoded insert in the SH3 domain of brain-specific variant of Src that abolishes interaction of the domain with dynamin 1. Thus microexons provide a mechanism for the control of tissue-specific interactions of ITSN1 and Src with their partners.",

The over-expression of the catalytic subunit (hTERT) of human telomerase is a common method to generate cells with a greatly prolonged lifespan. These cells serve as models for cells that are either difficult to cultivate or have a limited lifespan in vitro. In addition, hTERT over-expressing cells are thought to be a useful resource for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.While tumour suppressors and cell cycle checkpoints are maintained for an extended period in most hTERT over-expressing cells we found that there is a gradual change in gene expression over a range of 130 population doublings (PD) for the majority of genes analysed. Seven genes were significantly down-regulated with increasing population doublings (PDs), while only two were up-regulated. One gene, stanniocalcin 2, was highly expressed in parental fibroblasts but completely diminished as a consequence of hTERT transgene expression.These data demonstrate that in hTERT over-expressing cells two different types of expression changes occur: one can be directly associated with hTERT transgene expression itself, while others might occur more gradual and with varying kinetics. These changes should be taken into account when these cells are used as functional models or for regenerative purposes.",

We investigated the effect of exercise on colon tumorigenesis associated with iNOS and COX-2 in azoxymethan (AOM)-injected mice. Balb/c mice (8\u00a0weeks old) were divided into three groups of 20 animals each, consisting of a sedentary control group, an AOM group, and an exercise plus AOM group. Mice in the groups receiving AOM were injected intraperitoneally with AOM weekly for 2\u00a0weeks. Six weeks of regular exercise suppressed the generation of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon by AOM. Expression of iNOS was decreased by exercise compared with that in sedentary mice along with lower nitrotyrosine level while COX-2 was not changed by either AOM or exercise. Additionally, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) was decreased by exercise in the colon and plasma. There was no effect of exercise on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and chaperon protein in the colon. Our results suggest that regular exercise prevents colon tumorigenesis, at least partly via the suppression of iNOS expression associated with anti-inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Neurotransmitter release is regulated by SNARE complex-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion. Tomosyn sequesters target SNAREs (t-SNAREs) through its C-terminal VAMP-like domain (VLD). Cumulative biochemical results suggest that the tomosyn\u2013SNARE complex is so tight that VAMP2 cannot displace tomosyn. Based on these results, the tomosyn\u2013SNARE complex has been believed to be a dead-end complex to inhibit neurotransmitter release. On the other hand, some studies using siRNA depletion of tomosyn suggest that tomosyn positively regulates exocytosis. Therefore, it is still controversial whether tomosyn is a simple inhibitor for neurotransmitter release. We recently reported that the inhibitory activity of tomosyn is regulated by the tail domain binding to the VLD. In this study, we employed the liposome fusion assay in order to further understand modes of action of tomosyn in detail. The tail domain unexpectedly had no effect on binding of the VLD to t-SNARE-bearing liposomes. Nonetheless, the tail domain decreased the inhibitory activity of the VLD on the SNARE complex-mediated liposome fusion. These results indicate that the tail domain controls membrane fusion through tomosyn displacement by VAMP2. Deletion of the tail domain-binding region in the VLD retained the binding to t-SNAREs and promoted the liposome fusion. Together, we propose here a novel mechanism of tomosyn that controls synaptic vesicle fusion positively by serving as a placeholder for VAMP2.",

The increase of podocyte motility results in podocyte foot process (FP) effacement, a typical form of podocyte injury. Our previous studies demonstrated that glomerular podocytes can express angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) and that the increase of ANGPTL3 in dysfunctional glomerulus is correlated with podocyte FP effacement. Little is known, however, about the role of ANGPTL3 in podocyte injury. In this study, we investigated ANGPTL3\u2019s effect on the motility and permeability of podocytes and on the expression of nephrin, a key molecule in podocytes. By scrape-wound and transwell migration assay, we found that ANGPTL3 over-expression significantly increased podocyte motility, whereas after ANGPTL3 knockdown by RNA interference, motility remained the same as that of the control group. Adriamycin (ADR) treatment significantly promoted podocyte motility. However, the same dose of ADR treatment could not promote motility after the knockdown of ANGPTL3. In addition, we assayed the diffusion of FITC-BSA across the podocytes\u2019 monolayer to investigate whether ANGPTL3 could promote protein loss by means of an increase in podocyte motility. The results showed that the changes in the FITC-BSA permeability of the podocytes corresponded to changes in motility. Furthermore, we found that ANGPTL3 over-expression dramatically increased the expression of nephrin but that the up-regulation of nephrin induced by ADR was significantly inhibited when ANGPTL3 was diminished by RNAi. In conclusion, we found ANGPTL3 to be capable of regulating the motility and permeability of podocytes and that the mechanism of ANGPTL3\u2019s regulation could be associated with the altered expression of nephrin.",

The cytoprotective effects of RGDSP scaffolds were assessed by exposure of MCSCs to anoxia in vitro. The efficacy of transplanting MCSCs in RGDSP scaffolds was evaluated in a female rat MI model. The designer self-assembling peptide self-assembled into RGDSP nanofiber scaffolds under physiological conditions. RGDSP scaffolds were beneficial for the growth of MCSCs and protected them from apoptosis and necrosis caused by anoxia. In a rat MI model, cardiac function was improved and collagen deposition was markedly reduced in the group receiving MCSCs in RGDSP scaffolds compared with groups receiving MCSCs alone, RGDSP scaffolds alone or MCSCs in RADA16 scaffolds. There were more surviving MCSCs in the group receiving MCSCs in RGDSP scaffolds than in the groups receiving MCSCs alone or MCSCs in RADA16 scaffolds. Most of the Y chromosome-positive cells expressed cardiac troponin T and connexin43 (Cx-43). These results suggest that RGDSP scaffolds provide a suitable microenvironment for the survival and differentiation of MCSCs.

Thus far, effective therapeutic agents for restoring the impaired motor and sensory nerve functions in diabetic neuropathy are still lacking. The antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of tanshinone IIA make it a promising candidate for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Therefore, the present study investigated the possible beneficial effect of tanshinone IIA on the impaired nerve functions displayed by a rat diabetic model. Insulin-dependent diabetes in rats was developed by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) at 50\u00a0mg/kg. The diabetic rats were randomly divided into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a010 in each group), and were intraperitoneally administrated daily for 4\u00a0weeks with tanshinone IIA (20\u00a0mg/kg, 50\u00a0mg/kg and 100\u00a0mg/kg), or normal saline from the fourth day after STZ injection, respectively. At the end of tanshinone IIA administration, thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold were determined by a hot plate test and Von Frey hairs; motor nerve conducting velocity (MNCV) was determined by an electrophysiological method; nerve blood flow (NBF) was detected using a laser Doppler flow meter; Na+,K+ATPase activity, the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) in sciatic nerves, and the serum total antioxidant capability were also determined. We found that tanshinone IIA was capable of restoring diabetes-induced deficit in nerve functions (MNCV and NBF), and impairment in thermal and mechanical nociceptive capability. In addition, tanshinone IIA significantly increased the serum total antioxidant capability, improved the activities of Na+,K+ATPase, increased the levels of SOD and catalase, and reduced the MDA level in sciatic nerves in diabetic rats.

We have previously demonstrated that the activation of Src family kinases (SFKs) is critical for BQ-induced oral cancer cell motility. Here we investigate whether this biological effect is mediated by specific membrane receptors in oral cancer cells. We found that BQ-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and cell migration could be inhibited by atropine, suggesting the involvement of the muscarinic receptor family. The enhanced activities of ERK1/2 and cell migration were significantly counteracted by PD102807, the selective antagonist of muscarinic M4 receptor. Moreover, cold BQ extract effectively competed with a known ligand, [3H]-N-methyl scopolamine, for binding to muscarinic M4 receptor in vitro, thereby implying that BQ could activate motility-promoting signaling pathways through direct interaction with the receptor. The requirement of muscarinic M4 receptor for BQ-induced oral cancer cell migration was demonstrated by knockdown of the receptor using RNA interference (RNAi). Remarkably, ectopic expression of muscarinic M4 receptor in two oral cancer cell lines, Ca9-22 and SCC-9, further augmented BQ-induced cell migration by 83% and 99%, respectively. Finally, we verified that BQ-induced oral cancer cell migration was mediated through a muscarinic M4 receptor\u00a0\u2192\u00a0SFKs\u00a0\u2192\u00a0ERK1/2 signaling pathway.

Expression of Akt1 and Akt2 was detected in all cells tested, but Akt3 was expressed only in cancer cells that did not express androgen receptors. All synthetic siRNAs against Akt isoforms suppressed their expression and inhibited the growth of cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, atelocollagen-mediated systemic administration of siRNAs significantly reduced the growth of tumors that had been subcutaneously xenografted. These results suggest that targeting Akt isoforms could be an effective treatment for prostate cancers.",

     "abstract": "Intensive cancer therapy strategies have thus far focused on sensitizing cancer cells to anticancer drug-mediated apoptosis to overcome drug resistance, and this strategy has led to more effective cancer therapeutics. Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), CDDP) is an effective anticancer drug used to treat many types of cancer, including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), and can be used in combination with various chemicals to enhance cancer cell apoptosis. Here, we introduce the use of elevated pressure (EP) in combination with CDDP for cancer treatment and explore the effects of EP on CDDP-mediated apoptosis in NSCLC cells. Our findings demonstrate that preconditioning NSCLC cells with EP sensitizes cells for CDDP-induced apoptosis. Enhanced apoptosis was dependent on p53 and HO-1 expression, and was associated with increased DNA damage and down-regulation of genes involved in nucleotide excision repair. The transcriptional levels of transporter proteins indicated that the mechanism by which EP-induced CDDP sensitization was intracellular drug accumulation. The protein levels of some antioxidants, such as hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), were decreased in A549 cells exposed to EP via the down-regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf-2). Furthermore, normal human fibroblasts were resistant to EP treatment, with no elevated DNA damage or apoptosis. Collectively, these data show that administration of EP is a potential adjuvant tool for CDDP-based chemosensitivity of lung cancer cells that may reduce drug resistance.",

Dietary restriction (DR) suppresses systemic inflammation to deter age-related chronic diseases. To examine whether DR delays the onset of stroke, 10-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) were assigned to either a control (ad libitum) or DR (50% diet of control) group, and day of stroke onset and lifespan were observed. DR markedly delayed the onset of stroke in SHRSP compared to control without affecting blood pressure. Day of stroke onset (median) in the control group was 34\u00a0days, whereas it was 70\u00a0days in the DR group. After 2\u00a0weeks of DR and before the onset of stroke, plasma levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and their mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue were significantly lower in the DR rats than in the control rats.

However, the consequences of sumoylation and its underlying molecular mechanism remain unclear. The domain structure of ERM TADn alone or modified by SUMO-1 was analyzed using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Low resolution shapes determined ab initio from the scattering data indicated an elongated shape and an unstructured conformation of TADn in solution. Covalent attachment of SUMO-1 does not perturb the structure of TADn as indicated by the linear arrangement of the SUMO moiety with respect to TADn. Thus, ERM belongs to the growing family of proteins that contain intrinsically unstructured regions.

We investigated the relationships between CXCR4 expression level and SDF-1\u03b1-induced vascular properties in vitro, and their in vivo contributions to neovascularization. We found that ECFCs isolated from different donors showed differences in CXCR4 expression that were linearly correlated with SDF-1\u03b1-induced migratory capacity.

In addition, SDF-1\u03b1-induced migration and ERK1/2, Akt, and eNOS activation were reduced by AMD3100, a CXCR4-specific peptide antagonist, or by siRNA-CXCR4. Administration of high-CXCR4-expressing ECFCs resulted in a significant increase in therapeutic potential for blood flow recovery, tissue healing and capillary density compared to low-CXCR4-expressing ECFCs in hindlimb ischemia.

The only known synthetic inhibitor of GBBH is mildronate (3-(2,2,2-trimethylhydrazinium) propionate dihydrate), which is a non-hydroxylatable analog of GBB.To aid in the discovery of novel GBBH inhibitors by rational drug design, we have solved the three-dimensional structure of recombinant human GBBH at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The GBBH monomer consists of a catalytic double-stranded \u03b2-helix (DBSH) domain, which is found in all 2KG oxygenases, and a smaller N-terminal domain. Extensive interactions between two monomers confirm earlier observations that GBBH is dimeric in its biological state. Although many 2KG oxygenases are multimeric, the dimerization interface of GBBH is very different from that of related enzymes.The N-terminal domain of GBBH has a similar fold to the DUF971 superfamily, which consists of several short bacterial proteins with unknown function. The N-terminal domain has a bound Zn ion, which is coordinated by three cysteines and one histidine. Although several other 2KG oxygenases with known structures have more than one domain, none of them resemble the N-terminal domain of GBBH. The N-terminal domain may facilitate dimer formation, but its precise biological role remains to be discovered.The active site of the catalytic domain of GBBH is similar to that of other 2KG oxygenases, and Fe(II)-binding residues form a conserved His\u2013X\u2013Asp\u2013Xn\u2013His triad, which is found in all related enzymes.",

Despite very low levels of apoB-82 (1\u20132%) in the media, a prominent N-terminal apoB protein of 85\u00a0kDa (apoB-15) was secreted that fractionated at d\u00a0>\u00a01.065 in density gradient ultracentrifugation. The mechanism of production of this short protein was studied by 35S-methionine pulse\u2013chase experiment. Oleate prevented presecretory degradation of apoB-100 in the cell and resulted in increased secretion of newly synthesized apoB-100 with decreases in the apoB-15, suggesting that rescue of pre-secretary intracellular degradation of apoB restricted the production and secretion of apoB-15. Further investigation on the degradation of transmembrane forms of apoB, in the presence and absence of a cysteine protease inhibitor, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), showed appearance of detectable levels of newly synthesized apoB-82 in the cell and the media together with increased apoB-100 secretion, and reduction in the secretion of apoB-15. Compared to ER membrane, the levels of apoB were higher in the luminal content, and presence of both oleate and ALLN had additive effect on apoB secretion. These results suggest that the presence of improper folding of apoB during translocation led to the cleavage of both apoB-100 and apoB-82 by ALLN-sensitive protease and generation of 85\u00a0kDa N-terminal fragment of apoB.",

Rimonabant, a type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1) antagonist, produces anti-atherosclerotic effects in humans and animals by mechanisms which are not completely understood. Rimonabant is structurally similar to two other cannabinoid receptor antagonists, AM251 and SR144528, recently identified as potent inhibitors of ACAT. Therefore, we examined the effects of Rimonabant on ACAT using both in vivo cell-based assays and in vitro cell-free assays. Rimonabant dose-dependently reduced ACAT activity in Raw 264.7 macrophages (IC50\u00a0=\u00a02.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0\u03bcM) and isolated peritoneal macrophages.

     "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated upon energy depletion and serves to restore energy balance by stimulating energy production and limiting energy utilization. Specifically, it enhances cellular glucose uptake by stimulating GLUT and SGLT1 and glucose utilization by stimulating glycolysis. During O2 deficiency glycolytic degradation of glucose leads to formation of lactate and H+, thus imposing an acid load to the energy-deficient cell. Cellular acidification inhibits glycolysis and thus impedes glucose utilization. Maintenance of glycolysis thus requires cellular H+ export. The present study explored whether AMPK influences Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) activity and/or Na+-independent acid extrusion. NHE1 expression was determined by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cytosolic pH (pHi) was estimated utilizing BCECF fluorescence and Na+/H+ exchanger activity from the Na+-dependent re-alkalinization (\u0394pHi) after an ammonium pulse. As a result, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells express NHE1. The pHi and \u0394pHi in those cells were significantly increased by treatment with AMPK stimulator AICAR (1\u00a0mM) and significantly decreased by AMPK inhibitor compound C (10\u00a0\u03bcM). The effect of AICAR on pHi and \u0394pHi was blunted in the presence of the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor cariporide (10\u00a0\u03bcM), but not by the H+ ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin (10\u00a0nM). AICAR significantly enhanced lactate formation, an effect significantly blunted in the presence of cariporide. These observations disclose a novel function of AMPK, i.e. regulation of cytosolic pH.",

However, the mechanism by which LPTS/PinX1 regulates telomerase activity remains unclear. Here we show, for the first time, that LPTS/PinX1 uses different domains to interact with Pin2/TRF1 and hTERT. The LPTS/PinX1254\u2013289 fragment specifically binds to Pin2/TRF1, and LPTS/PinX1290\u2013328 can associate with hTERT. Compared with the full-length LPTS/PinX1 protein, LPTS/PinX1290\u2013328 shows stronger in vitro telomerase inhibitory activity. Moreover, the LPTS/PinX1 protein was recruited to telomeres for binding to Pin2/TRF1. Overexpression of LPTS/PinX1290\u2013328, which contains a nucleolus localization signal, in cells resulted in telomere shortening and progressive cell death. Conversely, telomere elongation was induced by expression of the dominant-negative LPTS/PinX11\u2013289. Our results suggest that the C-terminal fragment of LPTS/PinX1 (LPTS/PinX1290\u2013328) contains a telomerase inhibitory domain that is required for the inhibition of telomere elongation and the induction of cell crisis. Our studies also provide evidence that LPTS/PinX1 interaction with Pin2/TRF1 may play a role in the stabilization of telomeres.",

Increased telomerase activity is correlated with upregulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression. In most human somatic cells, hTERT expression is suppressed by multiple factors. We have previously shown that human chromosome 5 carries a possible suppressor of mouse tert mtert expression in a mouse melanoma cell line, B16-F10 cells. However, the function of the transcriptional regulator of TERT on this chromosome remains unclear. To examine the functional role of a putative hTERT regulator(s) on this chromosome, we transferred human chromosome 5 in a human melanoma cell line, A2058 cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT). Microcell hybrid clones with an introduced chromosome 5, but not chromosome 10, showed a remarkable decrease in the growth rate with an obvious cellular morphological alteration and eventually cellular senescence. Moreover, this phenomenon was accompanied by a reduction of hTERT expression and telomerase activity. Most importantly, we found that transcriptional suppression of hTERT by the introduction of chromosome 5 is largely mediated by regulating hTERT promoter activity. Furthermore, the hTERT promoter region between \u22121623 and \u22121047 was responsible for this function. These results provide evidence that transcriptional regulator(s) of the hTERT is carried on human chromosome 5 as an endogenous mechanism of hTERT suppression.",

The nature of the cognate ligand of this receptor in Vertebrates is still a matter of debate. During synaptic transmission the release of ionic zinc found in vesicles of certain glutamatergic and gabaergic terminals may act as a neuromodulator by binding to pre- or post-synaptic receptors. Recently, zinc has been shown to activate the receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, independently of neurotrophins. This activation occurs via increasing the Src family kinase activity. In the present study, we investigated whether the ALK activity could be modulated by extracellular zinc. We first showed that zinc alone rapidly activates ALK. This activation is dependent of ALK tyrosine kinase activity and dimerization of the receptor but is independent of Src family kinase activity. In contrast, addition of sodium pyrithione, a zinc ionophore, led to a further activation of ALK. This stronger activation is dependent of Src family kinase but independent of ALK activity and dimerization. In conclusion, zinc could constitute an endogenous ligand of ALK in vertebrates.",

     "abstract": "Whereas acetylcholine (ACh) acts as a bronchoconstrictor and stimulator of mucus secretion from bronchial epithelium, it acts via \u03b17 nicotinic Ach receptors (nAChRs) on macrophages in the airways to exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Moreover, the effects of ACh are modified by secreted ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor-related peptide-1 (SLURP-1), a positive allosteric modulator of \u03b17 nAChR signaling. Our aim was to explore the roles played by SLURP-1 in the pathophysiology of asthma by assessing SLURP-1 expression in the OVA-sensitized murine asthma model and in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Using real-time PCR we found that expression of SLURP-1 mRNA is down-regulated in the lungs of asthmatic model mice, as compared to healthy mice. In addition, immunohistochemical studies confirmed the diminished expression of SLURP-1 in the bronchioles of asthmatic mice, and showed it was due to extensive metaplasia of mucus-secreting cells and the concomitant loss of ciliated epithelial cells. Expression of SLURP-1 mRNA and protein was also significantly down-regulated in human epithelial cells stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which is related to asthmatic condition. Thus SLURP-1 appears to be down-regulated in both an animal model of asthma and human epithelial cells treated with an inflammatory cytokine related to asthma. Those findings suggest that diminished expression of SLURP-1 in asthma attenuates its negative regulation of airway inflammation, and that perhaps changes in SLURP-1 expression could serve as a marker of airway damage in asthma.",

Thus, olfactory bulb axonal tracts play an important role in relaying information to the higher order of olfactory structures in the brain. Several classes of axon guidance molecules influence the pathfinding of the olfactory bulb axons. Draxin, a recently identified novel class of repulsive axon guidance protein, is essential for the formation of forebrain commissures and can mediate repulsion of diverse classes of neurons from chickens and mice. In this study, we have investigated the draxin expression pattern in the mouse telencephalon and its guidance functions for OB axonal projection to the telencephalon. We have found that draxin is expressed in the neocortex and septum at E13 and E17.5 when OB projection neurons form the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) rostrocaudally along the ventrolateral side of the telencephalon. Draxin inhibits axonal outgrowth from olfactory bulb explants in vitro and draxin-binding activity in the LOT axons in vivo is detected. The LOT develops normally in draxin\u2212/\u2212 mice despite subtle defasciculation in the tract of these mutants.

Plants possess an extended CaM family including numerous CaM-like proteins (CMLs), most of which appear to be unique to plants.

We report here the isolation of PRR2, a pseudo-response regulator as a CML9 interacting protein by screening an expression library prepared from Arabidopsis seedlings with CML9 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. PRR2 is similar to the response regulators of the two-component system, but lacks the invariant residue required for phosphorylation by which response regulators switch their output response, suggesting the existence of alternative regulatory mechanisms. PRR2 was found to bind CML9 and closely related CMLs but not a canonical CaM. Mapping analyses indicate that an almost complete form of PRR2 is required for interaction with CML9, suggesting a recognition mode different from the classical CaM-target peptide complex. PRR2 contains several features that are typical of transcription factors, including a GARP DNA recognition domain, a Pro-rich region and a Golden C-terminal box. PRR2 and CML9 as fusion proteins with fluorescent tags co-localized in the nucleus of plant cells, and their interaction in the nuclear compartment was validated in planta by using a fluorophore-tagged protein interaction assay.

A search of the genome database revealed that the gene locus and the sequence of exon 1 of this novel gene were similar to subgroup 1 mouse \u03b2-defensins. A small peptide, K17 (FSPQMLQDIIEKKTKIL), derived from the amino acid sequence of this novel gene was synthesized. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopic analysis of chemically synthesized peptide demonstrated that the peptide exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, but the peptide adopted helical conformation in the presence of trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate, a membrane-mimicking environment. The peptide exhibited bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Gram negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive); it was not cytotoxic in cultures of mammalian cells or hemolytic in cultures of erythrocytes. These results suggested that K17 may be a candidate therapeutic for the treatment of bacterial infection.",

In mice, LT lyses macrophages from certain inbred strains in less than 2\u00a0h by activating the Nlrp1b inflammasome and caspase-1, while macrophages from other strains remain resistant to the toxin\u2019s effects. We analyzed LT effects in toxin-sensitive and resistant rat macrophages to test if a similar pathway was involved in rat macrophage death. LT activates caspase-1 in rat macrophages from strains harboring LT-sensitive macrophages in a manner similar to that in toxin-sensitive murine macrophages. This activation of caspase-1 is dependent on proteasome activity, and sensitive macrophages are protected from LT\u2019s lytic effects by lactacystin. Proteasome inhibition also delayed the death of rats in response to LT, confirming our previous data implicating the rat Nlrp1 inflammasome in animal death. Quinidine, caspase-1 inhibitors, the cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me, and heat shock also protected rat macrophages from LT toxicity. These data support the existence of an active functioning LT-responsive Nlrp1 inflammasome in rat macrophages. The activation of the rat Nlrp1 inflammasome is required for LT-mediated rat macrophage lysis and contributes to animal death.",

     "abstract": "Rapamycin is a well known immunosuppressant drug for rejection prevention in organ transplantation. Numerous clinical trials using rapamycin analogs, involving both children and adults with various disorders are currently ongoing worldwide. Most recently, rapamycin gained much attention for what appears to be life-span extending properties when administered to mice. The risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) is strongly and positively correlated with advancing age and is characterized by deposition of \u03b2-amyloid peptides (A\u03b2) as senile plaques in the brain. We report that rapamycin (2.5\u00a0\u03bcM), significantly increases A\u03b2 generation in murine neuron-like cells (N2a) transfected with the human \u201cSwedish\u201d mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). In concert with these observations, we found rapamycin significantly decreases the neuroprotective amino-terminal APP (amyloid precursor protein) cleavage product, soluble APP-\u03b1 (sAPP-\u03b1) while increasing production of the \u03b2-carboxyl-terminal fragment of APP (\u03b2-CTF). These cleavage events are associated with decreased activation of a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain-10 (ADAM-10), an important candidate \u03b1-secretase which opposes A\u03b2 generation. To validate these findings in vivo, we intraperitoneal (i.p.) injected Tg2576 A\u03b2-overproducing transgenic mice with rapamycin (3\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 2\u00a0weeks. We found increased A\u03b2 levels associated with decreased sAPP-\u03b1 at an average rapamycin plasma concentration of 169.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a023.5\u00a0ng/mL by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These data suggest that although rapamycin may increase the lifespan in some mouse models, it may not decrease the risk for age-associated neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.",

Based on Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) data, Rv1364c was recently shown to be a homo-dimer and adopt an elongated conformation in solution. The PAS domain could not be modeled into the structural envelope due to poor sequence similarity with known PAS proteins. The crystal structure of the PAS domain described here provides a structural basis for the dimerization of Rv1364c. It thus appears likely that the PAS domain regulates the anti-\u03c3 activity of Rv1364c by oligomerization.

Four miRNA families dominated the 165 differentially expressed miRNAs between embryogenic and non-embryogenic callus. Of the four, miR171 was up-regulated, and miR159, miR169, and miR172 were down-regulated in the embryogenic callus. These four families are all abiotic stress-induced miRNAs, and all target transcription factors that regulate a group of genes important for cell differentiation and development, including scarecrow-like (SCL) transcription factor (miR171), apetala2 (miR172), MYB transcription factors (miR159), and NF-YA transcription factor (miR169). Three down-regulated miRNA families in the embryogenic callus are also regulated by ABA, which further shed light into the potential mechanisms underlying the transformation of the embryogenic competence in L. leptolepis.

The homeodomain transcription factor HoxB4 has been shown to be an important regulator of stem cell renewal and hematopoiesis; however, its effect on megakaryopoiesis is unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of HoxB4 overexpression or RNA silencing on megakaryocytic development in the human TF1 progenitor cell line; we then used recombinant tPTD-HoxB4 fusion protein to study the effect of exogenous HoxB4 on megakaryocytic development of human CD34 positively-selected cord blood cells. We found that ectopic HoxB4 in TF1 cells increased the antigen expression of CD61and CD41a, increased the gene expression of thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR), Scl-1, Cyclin D1, Fog-1 and Fli-1 while it decreased c-Myb expression. HoxB4 RNA silencing in TF1 cells decreased the expression of CD61 and CD41a and decreased Fli-1 expression while it increased the expression of c-Myb. Recombinant tPTD-HoxB4 fusion protein increased the percentages and absolute numbers of CD41a and CD61 positive cells during megakaryocytic differentiation of CD34 positively-selected cord blood cells and increased the numbers of colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-Mk). Adding tPTD-HoxB4 fusion protein increased the gene expression of TpoR, Cyclin D1, Fog-1 and Fli-1 while it inhibited c-Myb expression. Our data suggest that increased HoxB4 enhanced early megakaryocytic development in human TF1 cells and CD34 positively-selected cord blood cells primarily by upregulating TpoR and Fli-1 expression and downregulating c-Myb expression.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs) were induced to differentiate into insulin-producing cells by hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in our previous study, but the mechanism through which this induction occurs is still unknown. HGF is a ligand that activates a tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-Met proto-oncogene. This activation is followed by indirect activation of multiple downstream signal transduction pathways (including MAPKs and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathways) that initiate various biological effects. Therefore, we speculated that the differentiation of PDECs is through either the MAPK signaling pathway or the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, isolated PDECs from adult rats were stimulated by adding HGF to their medium for 28\u00a0days. Then, the expression levels of several protein kinases, including MAPKs (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK) and AKT, were determined by Western blotting to determine if specific protein kinases are activated in these pathways. Subsequently, re-isolated from adult rats and cultured PDECs were pre-treated with specific inhibitors of proteins shown to be activated in these signaling pathways; these cells were then induced to differentiate by the addition of HGF. The expression levels of protein kinases were determined by Western blotting, and the differentiation rate of insulin-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. The change of PDEC differentiation rates were compared between the groups in which cells with or without inhibitors pretreatment to determine the specific signaling pathway(s) that may be involved in HGF-induced differentiation of PDECs. After isolating PDECs and stimulating them with HGF for 28\u00a0days, the expression levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 as well as total and phosphorylated AKT of cultured cells were significantly increased compared to the normal control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), suggesting that the signaling pathways involving ERK1/2 and Akt (MEK\u2013ERK and PI3K\u2013AKT) are activated during HGF-induced PDEC differentiation. MEK1/2 or PI3K inhibitors were separately added to the culture medium of PDECs pre-treated with HGF. These results show that compared to the HGF-treated group, the differentiation rate of insulin-positive cells was significantly decreased in the HGF/LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor) group (13.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.57% vs. 33.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.34%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); however, the differentiation rate of insulin-positive cells was not significantly different in the HGF/PD98059 (MEK1/2 inhibitor) group.

     "abstract": "The 70\u00a0kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) plays important roles in the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth and metabolism. S6K1 is activated by the phosphorylation of multiple serine and threonine residues in response to stimulation by a variety of growth factors and cytokines. In addition to phosphorylation, we have recently shown that S6K1 is also targeted by lysine acetylation. Here, using tandem mass spectrometry we have mapped acetylation of S6K1 to lysine 516, a site close to the C-terminus of the kinase that is highly conserved amongst vertebrate S6K1 orthologues. Using acetyl-specific K516 antibodies, we show that acetylation of endogenous S6K1 at this site is potently induced upon growth factor stimulation. Although S6K1 acetylation and phosphorylation are both induced by growth factor stimulation, these events appear to be functionally independent. Indeed, experiments using inhibitors of S6K1 activation and exposure of cells to various stresses indicate that S6K1 acetylation can occur in the absence of phosphorylation and vice versa. We propose that K516 acetylation may serve to modulate important kinase-independent functions of S6K1 in response to growth factor signalling.",

We thus constructed a cDNA comprising C-CPE and a well characterised toxic domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (C-CPE-ETA\u2032). The recombinant C-CPE-ETA\u2032 fusion protein was shown to retain the specificity of binding to CLDN-4 and initiating rapid penetration into cytosol in five different CLDN-4 positive cancer cells (Breast-MCF7, Skin-A431, Colon-SW480, Prostate-PC3 and DU145) but not to CLDN-4 negative cells (Hela, HUVEC).

Subcutaneously implanted MCF7 and SW480 xenograft tumours were significantly decreased or abolished after three repeated injection of the hybrid toxin. Taken together, our results convincingly show that the hybrid toxin targets CLDN-4 positive cancer through receptor-binding, and causes significant tumour cell apoptosis, suggesting its potential as an alternative molecular targeted therapy against a plethora of CLDN-4 positive cancers.",

Although the expression and binding states of p120-catenin are thought to dynamically change due to morphological adaptation of endothelial cells (ECs) to fluid shear stress, these dynamics remain to be explored. In the present study, we examined the time course of changes in p120-catenin expression and its binding to vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin in ECs exposed to shear stress. Human umbilical vein ECs began to change their morphologies at 3\u20136\u00a0h, and became elongated and oriented to the direction of flow at 24\u00a0h after exposure to a shear stress of 1.5\u00a0Pa. Binding and co-localization of p120-catenin with VE-cadherin at the foci of cell\u2013cell adhesions were retained in ECs during exposure to shear stress, indicating that VE-cadherin was stabilized in the plasma membrane. In contrast, cytoplasmic p120-catenin that was dissociated from VE-cadherin was transiently increased at 3\u20136\u00a0h after the flow onset. These results suggest that the transient increase of cytoplasmic p120-catenin may stimulate RhoGTPase activities and act as a switch for the morphological changes in ECs in response to shear stress.",

The chimera 23/23-EGFP in which the reporter protein EGFP is connected to the C-terminus of the OEC23 precursor shows that a single Tat transport signal is sufficient to mediate transport of two distinct passenger proteins in a row. Replacing the transit peptide of OEC23 in 23/23-EGFP by its homolog from OEC16 yields the chimera 16/23-EGFP, which can likewise be fully translocated by the Tat pathway across the thylakoid membrane. However, transport of 16/23-EGFP is retarded at specific steps in the transport process leading to the temporary and consecutive accumulation of three translocation intermediates with distinct membrane topology. They are associated with two oligomeric membrane complexes presumably representing TatBC-receptor complexes. The composition of the translocation intermediates as determined by immunoprecipitation experiments suggests that the two passenger proteins are translocated in a stepwise manner across the membrane.",

The prenatal exposure to the drug misoprostol, a prostaglandin type E analogue, has also been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental defects. In the present study, we use ratiometric calcium imaging with fura-2AM as a calcium indicator to determine the effects of PGE2 and misoprostol on calcium homeostasis in growth cones of mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) cells. Our results show that both drugs increase the amplitude of calcium transients in growth cones of Neuro-2a cells and induce neurite retraction.

PC-3 cells were transfected with NKX3.1 expression plasmid (pcDNA3.1-NKX3.1) and LNCaP cells were transfected with siRNA expression plasmid (pRNAT-RNAi1) targeting NKX3.1.

The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that increases proinsulin biosynthesis, stimulates insulin secretion, and improves pancreatic beta-cell viability. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of GLP-1 on the function and viability of HIT-T 15 cells cultured with AGEs. HIT-T 15 cells were cultured for 5\u00a0days in presence of AGEs alone, or supplemented with 10\u00a0nmol/l GLP-1. Cell viability, insulin secretion, redox balance, and expression of the AGEs receptor (RAGE) were then determined. The results showed that GLP-1 protected beta cell against AGEs-induced cell death preventing both apoptosis and necrosis. Moreover, addition of GLP-1 to the AGEs culture medium restored the redox balance, improved the responsiveness to glucose, and attenuated AGEs-induced RAGE expression. These findings provide evidence that GLP-1 protects beta cells from the dangerous effects of AGEs.",

GULP is enriched around PS-coated beads for phagocytosis and co-localized with stabilin-1. Downregulation of endogenous GULP expression decreased stabilin-1-mediated phagocytosis.

YB-1 is linked to poor prognosis in breast carcinoma and is a strong predictor of relapse and disease-specific survival. Survival is directly tied to the extent of local invasion and distal metastasis, processes dependent upon the activity of the membrane type I-matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP. Non-invasive MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were transfected with YB-1/EGFP. YB-1 protein was detected in the invadopodia of cells with a migratory phenotype. There was increased expression of MT1-MMP protein concentrated at the leading edges of motile cells, which were highly invasive in collagen three-dimensional culture. The rates of MT1-MMP protein endocytosis and recycling to the cell surface were elevated in clones expressing higher levels of YB-1 protein. Control MCF-7 cells formed nonfatal, non-invasive, differentiated adenocarcinomas in vivo. MCF-7 cells expressing a twofold increase in YB-1 formed highly anaplastic tumors with local invasion, pulmonary metastases and high lethality.

In present study, we constructed and expressed two recombinant gp41 PFI mimetics, designated N46Fd and N46FdFc. N46Fd consists of N46 (residues 536\u2013581) in gp41 NHR and foldon (Fd), a trimerization motif. N46FdFc is composed of N46Fd fused with human IgG Fc fragment as an immunoenhancer. We immunized mice with N46 peptide, N46Fd and N46FdFc, respectively, and found that only N46FdFc elicited neutralizing antibody response in mice against infection by HIV-1 strains IIIB (clade B, X4), 92US657 (clade B, R5), and 94UG103 (clade A, X4R5). Anti-N46FdFc antibodies inhibited PIE7 binding to PFI, blocked gp41 six-helix bundle formation, and suppressed HIV-1 mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. These findings provide an important clue for developing recombinant gp41 PFI mimetics-based HIV vaccines.",

Defects in mice result in clinical features resembling disorders found in human aging. Although the importance of transmembrane-type \u03b1Kl has been demonstrated, less is known regarding the physiological importance of soluble-type \u03b1Kl (s\u03b1Kl) in circulation.The aims of this study were: (1) to establish a sandwich ELISA system enabling detection of circulating serum s\u03b1Kl, and (2) to determine reference values for s\u03b1Kl serum levels and relationship to indices of renal function, mineral metabolism, age and sex in healthy subjects.We successively developed an ELISA to measure serum s\u03b1Kl in healthy volunteers (n\u00a0=\u00a0142, males 66) of ages (61.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.5\u00a0year). The levels (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) in these healthy control adults were as follows: total calcium (Ca; 9.46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41\u00a0mg/dL), Pi (3.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51\u00a0mg/dL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN; 15.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u00a0mg/dL), creatinine (Cre; 0.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0mg/dL), 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D; 54.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.7\u00a0pg/mL), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH; 49.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.6\u00a0pg/mL), calcitonin (26.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.3\u00a0pg/mL) and intact fibroblast growth factor (FGF23; 43.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.6\u00a0pg/mL).Serum levels of s\u03b1Kl ranged from 239 to 1266\u00a0pg/mL (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD; 562\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0146\u00a0pg/mL) in normal adults. Although s\u03b1Kl levels were not modified by gender or indices of mineral metabolism, s\u03b1Kl levels were inversely related to Cre and age. However, s\u03b1Kl levels in normal children (n\u00a0=\u00a039, males 23, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD; 7.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8\u00a0years) were significantly higher (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD; 952\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0282\u00a0pg/mL) than those in adults (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD; 562\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0146, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A multivariate linear regression analysis including children and adults in this study demonstrated that s\u03b1Kl correlated negatively with age and Ca, and positively with Pi. Finally, we measured a serum s\u03b1Kl from a patient with severe tumoral calcinosis derived from a homozygous missense mutation of \u03b1-klotho gene. In this patient, s\u03b1Kl level was notably lower than those of age-matched controls.We established a detection system to measure human serum s\u03b1Kl for the first time.

Co-transfection analysis and mutation assays revealed that two conserved LEF1 responsive elements located at \u22121002 and \u2212597\u00a0bp upstream of the enamelin translation initiation site could augment transcriptional activity of the enamelin.

In addition, LiCl treatment induced nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin and elevated endogenous enamelin expression in mouse ameloblast-like cells.

     "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) is secreted as a latent complex, which consists of latency-associated peptide (LAP) and the mature ligand. The release of the mature ligand from LAP usually occurs through conformational change of the latent complex and is therefore considered to be the first step in the activation of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. So far, factors such as heat, pH changes, and proteolytic cleavage are reportedly involved in this activation process, but the precise molecular mechanism is still far from clear. Identification and characterization of the cell surface proteins that bind to LAP are important to our understanding of the latent TGF-\u03b2 activation process. In this study, we have identified heat shock protein 90 \u03b2 (HSP90\u03b2) from the cell surface of the MG63 osteosarcoma cell line as a LAP binding protein. We have also found that MG63 cells secrete HSP90\u03b2 into extracellular space which inhibits the activation of latent TGF-\u03b21, and that there is a subsequent decrease in cell proliferation. TGF-\u03b21-mediated stimulation of MG63 cells resulted in the increased cell surface expression of HSP90\u03b2. Thus, extracellular HSP90\u03b2 is a negative regulator for the activation of latent TGF-\u03b21 modulating TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the extracellular domain.",

Recent studies revealed that GluD2 induces presynaptic differentiation in a manner dependent on its N-terminal domain (NTD) through binding of Cbln1 secreted from cerebellar granule neurons. However, the underlying mechanism of the specific binding of the NTD to Cbln1 remains elusive. Here, we have identified the flap loop (Arg321-Trp339) in the NTD of GluD2 (GluD2-NTD) as a crucial region for the binding to Cbln1 and the induction of presynaptic differentiation. Both induction of presynaptic differentiation and binding of Cbln1 were abolished in the HEK cells expressing not wild-type GluD2 but GluD2 with mutations in the flap loop. Especially, single amino acid substitution of either Arg321 or Trp323 to alanine was sufficient to disable the GluD2 function. Finally, a homology model of GluD2-NTD suggested that the flap loop is located at the distal end, which appears consistent with an interaction with Cbln1 and a presynaptic varicosity.",

This study evaluated the role of H2O2 on the Na+-dependent [14C]-l-alanine uptake of ASCT2 in immortalized renal PTE cells from Wistar Kyoto rat (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). Na+ dependence of [14C]-l-alanine uptake was investigated replacing NaCl with an equimolar concentration of choline chloride in vehicle- and apocynin-treated cells. Na+ removal from the uptake solution abolished transport activity in both WKY and SHR PTE cells. Decreases in H2O2 levels in the extracellular medium significantly reduced Na+-Km and Vmax values of the low-affinity high-capacity component in SHR PTE cells, with no effect on the high-affinity low-capacity state of the Na+-dependent [14C]-l-alanine uptake. After removal of apocynin from the culture medium, H2O2 levels returned to basal values within 1 to 3\u00a0h in both WKY and SHR PTE cells and these were found stable for the next 24\u00a0h. Under these experimental conditions, the Na+-Km and Vmax of the high-affinity low-capacity state were unaffected and the low-affinity high-capacity component remained significantly decreased 1\u00a0day but not 4\u00a0days after apocynin removal. In conclusion, H2O2 in excess is required for the presence of a low-affinity high-capacity component for the Na+-dependent [14C]-l-alanine uptake in SHR PTE cells only. It is suggested that Na+ binding in renal ASCT2 may be regulated by ROS in SHR PTE cells.",

The HO-1 induction was associated with the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in RGM-1 cells. We also observed that sofalcone increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in the culture medium. Treatment of RGM-1 cells with an HO-1 inhibitor (tin-protoporphyrin), or HO-1 siRNA inhibited sofalcone-induced VEGF production, suggesting that the effect of sofalcone on VEGF expression is mediated by the HO-1 pathway.

Melanomas share some genetic features with IDH1/2-mutated gliomas, such as frequent TP53 mutation. We sought to test whether melanoma is associated with IDH1/2 mutations. Seventy-eight human melanoma samples were analyzed for IDH1R132 and IDH2R172 mutation status. A somatic, heterozygous IDH1 c.C394T (p.R132C) mutation was identified in one human melanoma metastasis to the lung. Having identified this mutation in one metastasis, we sought to test the hypothesis that certain selective pressures in the brain environment may specifically favor the cell growth or survival of tumor cells with mutations in IDH1/2, regardless of primary tumor site. To address this, we analyzed IDH1R132 and IDH2R172 mutation status 53 metastatic brain tumors, including nine melanoma metastases. Results revealed no mutations in any samples. This lack of mutations would suggest that mutations in IDH1R132 or IDH2R172 may be necessary for the formation of tumors in a cell-lineage dependent manner, with a particularly strong selective pressure for mutations in progressive gliomas; this also suggests the lack of a particular selective pressure for growth in brain tissue in general. Studies on the cell-lineages of tumors with IDH1/2 mutations may help clarify the role of these mutations in the development of brain tumors.",

     "abstract": "The conjugation of proteins with the ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 is an essential cellular process and an important anti-cancer therapeutic target. The major known role of Nedd8 is the attachment to and activation of Cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRL). The attachment of Nedd8 to its substrates occurs via a process analogous to ubiquitin transfer, involving a Nedd8 E1 activating enzyme and a Nedd8 E2 conjugating enzyme, Ubc12, which transfers Nedd8 onto lysine residues of target proteins. In this study, we utilize dominant-negative Ubc12 (dnUbc12) and the Nedd8 E1 inhibitor MLN4924 to inhibit cellular neddylation. We demonstrate that dnUbc12 functions by depleting cellular Nedd8 concentrations. Inhibition of cellular neddylation leads to rapid accumulation of CRL substrates and an enlarged and flattened morphology in HEK293 cells. Inhibiting Nedd8 conjugation also causes abnormalities in the actin cytoskeleton. This is likely at least partially mediated via accumulation of the small GTPase RhoA, a recently identified CRL substrate. We indeed found that siRNA mediated knockdown of RhoA can reverse the morphological changes observed upon inhibition of cellular neddylation. In conclusion, the Nedd8 pathway plays an important role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton and cellular morphology. Dysfunction of the actin cytoskeleton may contribute to the anti-cancer effect of Nedd8 inhibition.",

Twelve analogues of previously reported peptides BP76 (KKLFKKILKFL) and Pac-525 (KWRRWVRWI) were designed, synthesized, and tested for their antimicrobial activities. Two of our eleven amino acid peptides, P11-5 (GKLFKKILKIL) and P11-6 (KKLIKKILKIL), have very low MICs of 3.1\u201312.5\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 against all five pathogens. The MICs of these two peptides against S. aureus, C. albicans and F. solani are four to ten times lower than the corresponding MICs of the reference peptide BP76. P9-4 (KWRRWIRWL), our newly designed nine-amino acid analogue, also has particularly low MICs of 3.1\u20136.2\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121 against four of the tested pathogens; these MICs are two to eight times lower than those reported for Pac-525 (6.2\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0ml\u22121).These new peptides (P11-5, P11-6 and P9-4) also exhibit improved stability in the presence of salts, and have low cytotoxicity as shown by the hemolysis and MTT assays. From the results of field-emission scanning electron microscopy, membrane depolarization and dye-leakage assays, we propose that these peptides exert their action by disrupting membrane lipids. Molecular dynamics simulation studies confirm that P11-6 peptide maintains relatively stable helical structure and exerts more perturbation action on the order of acyl tail of lipid bilayer.",

By 5\u2032-RACE we identified four novel transcription initiation sites and initiating exons, and by luciferase activity assay we identified a new promoter region. Expression pattern analysis of the alternative transcripts containing specific initiation exons in mouse embryos suggests that there are co-operations between the initiation exons, their adjacent promoters and enhancer elements to orchestrate overlapping neural tube specific transcription profiles for Hoxb3. Furthermore, we showed that anti-sense transcripts derived from the Hoxb3 locus were expressed in the hindbrain with distinct rhombomere boundaries, in a pattern complementary to the sense coding mRNA transcripts. Our results suggest that the multiple non-coding RNAs could be involved in the regulation of Hoxb3.",

Additionally, we found that EID1 binds to pRB at the onset of adipocyte differentiation and may act to reduce pRB levels. Over-expression of EID1 in 3T3-L1 cells leads to increased expression of UCP1 and PGC-1\u03b1, both of which are involved in caloric dissipation and thermogenesis, in brown adipose tissue. These results indicate that EID1 is able to reduce fat accumulation in adipose cells and induce expression of brown fat genes in pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1 cells) normally destined to become white fat cells.

     "abstract": "Despite ERK1 and ERK2 were considered interchangeable isoforms for a long time, their roles are now emerging as only partially overlapping. We recently reported that the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of GFP-tagged ERK1 is slower than that of ERK2, this difference being caused by a unique domain of ERK1 located at its N-terminus (ERK1-Nt). In the present report we further investigated this issue by asking which were the specific aminoacids involved in such process. By photobleaching strategy, we demonstrated that ERK1-Nt is a domain capable to slow down the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling rate even of a small cargo protein. ERK1-Nt was then dissected into three regions as follows: 1 (aa 1\u20139), 2 (aa 10\u201329) and 3, (aa 30\u201339) that were deleted or mutated at specific sites. Dynamic imaging assessment of the role played by each region in determining the shuttling rate revealed that: region 1 has no significant role, region 2 and specific aminoacids of region 3 (V31, K33, P36) are critical, but singularly do not totally account for the difference in the shuttling rate between ERK1 and 2. Finally, we demonstrated that the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling rate of a passively diffusing protein (mRED) is inversely related to ERK1-Nt-GFP concentrations inside the cell, thus suggesting that ERK1-Nt-GFP occupies the nuclear pore perhaps because of an important affinity of ERK1-Nt for nucleoporins.In conclusion, ERK1-Nt is a domain able per se to confer a slower shuttling rate to a cargo protein. Specific regions within this domain were identified as responsible for this biophysical property.",

The biotinylated proteins were isolated using neutravidin beads, resolved by gel electrophoresis and analysed by western blotting using anti-ECE-1 antibodies.

The specificity of cleavage was confirmed using the ECE-1 inhibitor CGS35066.

In addition, naringenin did not have a significant effect on basal or insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation while significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation/activation. Furthermore, silencing of AMPK, using siRNA approach, abolished the naringenin-stimulated glucose uptake.

Preclinical studies demonstrated that the sunitinib effects are attributed to inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR phosphorylation. However, even in colon cancer cells lacking sunitinib-targeted RTKs, sunitinib effectively inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model, and this raises a question about the mechanism underlying the in vivo anticancer action of sunitinib. Since hypoxia is a critical microenvironment that tumors face, we addressed the possibility that sunitinib deregulates tumor adaptation to hypoxia. First we found that sunitinib limits the colony growth of HT-29, which is a colon adenocarcinoma cell line lacking the RTKs, and that HIF-1\u03b1 in the colonies is decreased by sunitinib. In cultured HT-29 cells, sunitinib suppressed HIF-1\u03b1 under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, sunitinib repressed the activity of HIF-1\u03b1 and subsequently decreased the expressions of HIF-1 downstream genes. Mechanistically, sunitinib blocked the 5\u2032-UTR-dependent translation of HIF-1\u03b1. The HIF-1\u03b1 suppression by sunitinib was also reproduced in a VHL-null renal cell carcinoma cell line, where HIF-1\u03b1 is not degradable. In conclusion, the sunitinib inhibition of HIF-1 signaling could restrain tumor progression in hypoxic regions, which may contribute to anticancer effect of sunitinib.",

It has been reported that depletion of a centrosomal protein kendrin (also named pericentrin) induces premature centrosome splitting in interphase, however, it remains unknown how kendrin contributes to the maintenance of centrosome cohesion. Here we show that kendrin associates with Nek2A kinase, which exhibits considerably low activity. Nek2A kinase activity is inhibited in vitro by addition of the Nek2A-binding region of kendrin in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the same region decreases the number of the cells with split centrosomes at late G2 phase. Taken together, these results suggest that kendrin anchors Nek2A and suppresses its kinase activity at the centrosomes, and thus, is involved in the mechanism to prevent premature centrosome splitting during interphase.",

     "abstract": "Human apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is a major structural and functional protein component of high-density lipoproteins. The expression of the apolipoprotein A-I gene (apoA-I) in hepatocytes is repressed by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. Recently, two novel additional (alternative) promoters for human apoA-I gene have been identified. Nothing is known about the role of alternative promoters in TNF\u03b1-mediated downregulation of apoA-I gene. In this article we report for the first time about the different effects of TNF\u03b1 on two alternative promoters of human apoA-I gene. Stimulation of HepG2 cells by TNF\u03b1 leads to activation of the distal alternative apoA-I promoter and downregulation of the proximal alternative and the canonical apoA-I promoters. This effect is mediated by weakening of the promoter competition within human apoA-I 5\u2032-regulatory region (apoA-I promoter switching) in the cells treated by TNF\u03b1. The MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade and nuclear receptors PPAR\u03b1 and LXRs are important for TNF\u03b1-mediated apoA-I promoter switching.",

These dynamic parameters clearly showed that the backbone dynamics of Cyt c are highly restricted due to the covalently bound heme that functions as the stable hydrophobic core. Upon oxidation of the heme iron in Cyt c, the average S2 value was increased from 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 to 0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, demonstrating that the mobility of the backbone is further restricted in the oxidized form. Such increases in the S2 values were more prominent in the loop regions, including amino acid residues near the thioether bonds to the heme moiety and positively charged region around Lys87. Both of the regions are supposed to form the interaction site for cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) and the electron pathway from Cyt c to CcO. The redox-dependent mobility of the backbone in the interaction site for the electron transfer to CcO suggests an electron transfer mechanism regulated by the backbone dynamics in the Cyt c\u2013CcO system.",

In the present study, we combined immunohistochemistry, immunoblot and tension recording to determine if the human fallopian tube express glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65/67), two isoforms for synthesis of GABA and functional GABAB receptors. Immunoblots showed that the human fallopian tube tissue contained GABABR1 protein which was localized in the epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells by immunohistochemistry. In addition, epithelial cells also expressed GAD65/67. Tension recording found that both GABA and baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist increased the spontaneous activity of human fallopian tube. The expressions of GABABR and GAD65/67 were significantly upregulated in the ectopic pregnancy group than in the intrauterine pregnancy group. We conclude that the human fallopian tube is capable of synthesizing GABA and expresses functionally active GABAB receptors.

Results showed that sphingomyelin (\u223c10,000\u00a0pmol/mg protein) was the predominant sphingolipid regardless of mitochondrial subpopulation, and measurable amounts of ceramide (\u223c70\u00a0pmol/mg protein) sphingosine, and sphinganine were also found in IFM and SSM. Both mitochondrial populations contained similar quantities of sphingolipids except for ceramide which was much higher in SSM. Analysis of sphingolipid isoforms revealed ten different sphingomyelins and six ceramides that differed from 16- to 24-carbon units in their acyl side chains. Sub-fractionation experiments further showed that sphingolipids are a constituent part of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Furthermore, inner membrane ceramide levels were 32% lower versus whole mitochondria (45\u00a0pmol/mg protein). Three ceramide isotypes (C20-, C22-, and C24-ceramide) accounted for the lower amounts.

PMVs are characterised by the expression of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the plasma membrane. PS, also expressed on apoptotic cells (ACs) enables macrophages to phagocytose ACs. As it is widely known that PMV production is increased during apoptosis, we were able to show that PMVs could compete dose dependently with ACs for the PS receptor on macrophages, so reducing phagocytosis of ACs. In a clinical setting this may result in secondary necrosis and further pathological conditions. In SLE in which there are raised PMV levels, there is an anti-phospholipid-mediated increase in PMV release, which can be abrogated by depletion of IgG.

However, how intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) is increased in response to LPS and how they affect cytokine production are poorly understood. Here we examined the role of transient receptor potential (TRP), a major Ca2+ permeation pathway in non-excitable cells, in the LPS-induced cytokine production in macrophages. Pharmacologic experiments suggested that TRPV family members, but neither TRPC nor TRPM family members, are involved in the LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production in RAW264 macrophages. RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses showed that TRPV2 is the sole member of TRPV family expressed in macrophages. ShRNA against TRPV2 inhibited the LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production as well as I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Experiments using BAPTA/AM and EGTA, and Ca2+ imaging suggested that the LPS-induced increase in [Ca2+]i involves both the TRPV2-mediated intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ mobilizations. BAPTA/AM abolished LPS-induced TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 production, while EGTA only partially suppressed LPS-induced IL-6 production, but not TNF\u03b1 production. These data indicate that TRPV2 is involved in the LPS-induced Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular Ca2+ store and extracellular Ca2+. In addition to Ca2+ mobilization through the IP3-receptor, TRPV2-mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization is involved in NF\u03baB-dependent TNF\u03b1 and IL-6 expression, while extracellular Ca2+ entry is involved in NF\u03baB-independent IL-6 production.",

     "abstract": "Background and aims: AT motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1), a homeotic transcription factor, was identified as a tumor suppressor, and loss of heterozygosity at ATBF1 locus occurs frequently in gastric cancers. We previously showed that ATBF1 expression inversely correlated with the malignant character of gastric cancer and that ATBF1 enhanced the promoter activity of p21Waf1/Cip1. We also found that ATBF1 moves between cytoplasm and nucleus, but the precise mechanism of translocation is unknown. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of ATBF1 translocation to the nucleus with the runt domain transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) in cooperation with TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction. Materials and methods: To analyze the expression of ATBF1 and RUNX3 in gastric cancer cells, we performed immunohistochemistry on 98 resected gastric cancer tissue samples and scored the nuclear staining intensity as grade 0 to grade 5. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of ATBF1 and RUNX3 was performed. Dual luciferase assays were performed by transfecting ATBF1 and RUNX3 with a p21Waf1/Cip1 reporter vector. To investigate the nuclear translocation of endogenous ATBF1 and RUNX3 in response to TGF-\u03b2 signal, we examined the subcellular localization of ATBF1 and RUNX3 in gastric cancer cells treated with recombinant TGF-\u03b21 using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: Strong immunohistochemical nuclear staining of ATBF1 was observed in 37 (37.8%) of the gastric cancer tissue samples, and RUNX3 nuclear staining was observed in 15 (15.3%). There was a statistically significant correlation between ATBF1 and RUNX3 nuclear localization (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.433, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Co-IP revealed a physical association between ATBF1 and RUNX3. ATBF1 and RUNX3 up-regulated p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter activity synergistically. In SNU16 gastric cancer cells, ATBF1 and RUNX3 were cytoplasmic before TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, but after 24\u00a0h of TGF-\u03b21 stimulation, endogenous ATBF1 and RUNX3 translocated to the nucleus. Conclusion: ATBF1 associates with RUNX3 and translocates to the nucleus in response to TGF-\u03b2 signal transduction and might function in the nucleus as tumor suppressor and transcriptional regulator.",

     "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE) interaction evokes oxidative stress generation and subsequently elicits inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions, thereby contributing to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. We have previously found that nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker (CCB), inhibits the AGE-induced mesangial cell damage in vitro. However, effects of nifedipine on proximal tubular cell injury remain unknown. We examined here whether and how nifedipine blocked the AGE-induced tubular cell damage. Nifedipine, but not amlodipine, a control CCB, inhibited the AGE-induced up-regulation of RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells, which was prevented by the simultaneous treatment of GW9662, an inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). GW9662 treatment alone was found to increase RAGE mRNA levels in tubular cells. Further, nifedipine inhibited the AGE-induced reactive oxygen species generation, NF-\u03baB activation and increases in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and transforming growth factor-beta gene expression in tubular cells, all of which were blocked by GW9662. Our present study provides a unique beneficial aspect of nifedipine on diabetic nephropathy; it could work as an anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory agent against AGEs in tubular cells by suppressing RAGE expression via PPAR\u03b3 activation.",

     "abstract": "Bitter taste signaling in humans is mediated by a group of 25 bitter receptors (T2Rs) that belong to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Previously, several bitter peptides were isolated and characterized from bitter tasting food protein derived extracts, such as pea protein and soya bean extracts. However, the molecular targets or receptors in humans for these bitter peptides were poorly characterized and least understood. In this study, we tested the ability of the bitter tasting tri- and di-peptides to activate the human bitter receptor, T2R1. In addition, we tested the ability of peptide inhibitors of the blood pressure regulatory protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to activate T2R1. Using a heterologous expression system, T2R1 gene was transiently expressed in C6-glioma cells and changes in intracellular calcium was measured following addition of the peptides. We found that the bitter tasting tri-peptides are more potent in activating T2R1 than the di-peptides tested. Among the peptides examined, the bitter tri-peptide Phe-Phe-Phe (FFF), is the most potent in activating T2R1 with an EC50 value in the micromolar range. Furthermore, to elucidate the potential ligand binding pocket of T2R1 we used homology molecular modeling. The molecular models showed that the bitter peptides bind within the same binding pocket on the receptor. The ligand binding pocket in T2R1 is present on the extracellular surface of the receptor, and is formed by the transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3 and 7 and with extracellular loops 1 and 2 forming a cap like structure on the binding pocket.",

The linker has been reported to bind myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), but it is not clear how this can occur in the context of a myosin II complex. We characterized MDR1-RLC interactions and determined that binding occurs via the amino terminal of the RLC, a domain that typically binds myosin heavy chain. MDR1-RLC interactions were sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the light chain in that phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) resulted in a loss of binding in vitro. We used ML-7, a specific inhibitor of MLCK, to study the functional consequences of disrupting RLC phosphorylation in intact cells. Pretreatment of polarized Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing MDR1 with ML-7 produced a significant increase in apical to basal permeability and a corresponding decrease in the efflux ratio (threefold; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of [3H]-digoxin, a classic MDR1 substrate. Together these data show that MDR1-mediated transport of [3H]-digoxin can be modulated by pharmacological manipulation of myosin RLC, but direct MDR1-RLC interactions are atypical and not explained by the structure of the myosin II holoenzyme.",

Two native, monomeric, 90\u00a0kDa nitrate reductase active proteins were resolved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography from aerobic cultures of Shewanella gelidimarina replete with reduced nitrogen compounds. The 90\u00a0kDa protein obtained in higher yield was characterized as NapA by electronic absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies and was identified by LC/MS/MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS as NapA from the napEDABC-type operon. The other 90\u00a0kDa protein, which was unstable and produced in low yields, was posited as NapA from the napDAGHB-type operon. Two napA genes have been sequenced from the napEDABC-type and napDAGHB-type operons of S. gelidimarina. Native NAP from S. putrefaciens was resolved as one NapA monomer and one NapAB heterodimer. Two amino acid substitutions in NapA correlated with the isolation of NAP as a NapA monomer or a NapAB heterodimer. The resolution of native, redox-active NapA isoforms in Shewanella provides new insight into the respiratory versatility of this genus, which has implications in bioremediation and the assembly of microbial fuel cells.",

Some chemotherapeutic agents cause MDM2 ubiquitination and degradation in a proteasome-dependent system. In addition to the proteasome system, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal pathway for selective misfolded protein degradation. Molecular chaperone heat shock cognate 70 protein (Hsc70) recognizes the misfolded proteins, which are then delivered to lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A) for lysosomal degradation. Our previous study reported that hispolon was able to induce cell apoptosis and downregulate MDM2 expression. In this study, our results showed that the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, could not inhibit hispolon-induced MDM2 downregulation. In contrast, both inhibition of lysosomes with NH4Cl and inhibition of LAMP2A using siRNA partially attenuated hispolon-induced MDM2 downregulation. To determine whether Hsc70 recognizes MDM2 on amino acids 135\u2013141, SMP14 antibody was used to compete with Hsc70 for interaction with MDM2. After Hsc70 knockdown, SMP14 antibody immunoprecipitated increased MDM2. We also found that hispolon induced increased association of Hsp70, Hsc70, Hsp90 and LAMP2A with MDM2. This association was inhibited in cells pretreated with geldanamycin (GA), an Hsp90 inhibitor. GA also attenuated hispolon-induced MDM2 downregulation.

Ascochlorin has a broad spectrum of anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities, but the molecular mechanism by which it inhibits cell cycle progression of cancer cells remains to be elucidated. We demonstrated that cytostatic G1 arrest by ascochlorin is mainly associated with the upregulation of p21WAF1/CIP1, and the downregulation of c-Myc. Furthermore, we used a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, RNA interference, and p53-deficient cells to verify that p21WAF1/CIP1 induction by ascochlorin is related to transcriptional repression of c-Myc. Ascochlorin abolished pRB hyperphosphorylation, which resulted in the inactivation of E2F transcriptional activity.

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by high mortality rates and resistance to conventional treatment. HCC tumors usually develop local hypoxia, which stimulates proliferation of cancer cells and renders them resilient to chemotherapy. Adaptation of tumor cells to the hypoxic conditions depends on the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1). Over-expression of its regulated HIF-1\u03b1 subunit, an important target of anti-cancer therapy, is observed in many cancers including HCC and is associated with severity of tumor growth and poor patient prognosis. In this report we investigate the effect of the dietary flavonoid kaempferol on activity, expression levels and localization of HIF-1\u03b1 as well as viability of human hepatoma (Huh7) cancer cells. Treatment of Huh7 cells with kaempferol under hypoxic conditions (1% oxygen) effectively inhibited HIF-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50\u00a0=\u00a05.16\u00a0\u03bcM). The mechanism of this inhibition did not involve suppression of HIF-1\u03b1 protein levels but rather its mislocalization into the cytoplasm due to inactivation of p44/42 MAPK by kaempferol (IC50\u00a0=\u00a04.75\u00a0\u03bcM). Exposure of Huh7 cells to 10\u00a0\u03bc\u039c kaempferol caused significant reduction of their viability, which was remarkably more evident under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, kaempferol, a non-toxic natural food component, inhibits both MAPK and HIF-1 activity at physiologically relevant concentrations (5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM) and suppresses hepatocarcinoma cell survival more efficiently under hypoxia.

The substratum-bound extracellular Nm23H1 was stimulatory for neurite outgrowth from chick DRG explants in a concentration-dependent manner. On high concentrations of Nm23H1, chick DRG neurite outgrowth was extensive and effectively limited to the location of the Nm23H1, i.e. neuronal growth cones turned away from adjacent collagen-coated substrata. Nm23H1-coated substrata also significantly enhanced rat DRG neuronal cell adhesion and neurite outgrowth in comparison to collagen-coated substrata. These effects were independent of NGF supplementation. Recombinant Nm23H1 (H118F), which does not possess NDP kinase activity, exhibited the same activity as the wild-type protein. Hence, a novel neuro-stimulatory activity for extracellular Nm23H1 has been identified in vitro, which may function in developing neuronal systems.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial fimbriae are an important pathogenic factor. It has been demonstrated that fimbrial protein encoded by fimA gene (FimA fimbriae) of Porphyromonas gingivalis not only contributes to the abilities of bacterial adhesion and invasion to host cells, but also strongly stimulates host innate immune responses. However, FimA fimbriae separated from P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 using a gentle procedure showed very weak proinflammatory activity compared with previous reports. Therefore, in the present study, biological characteristics of FimA fimbriae were further analyzed in terms of proinflammatory activity in macrophages. Macrophages differentiated from THP-1 cells were stimulated with native, heat-denatured, or either proteinase- or lipoprotein lipase-treated FimA fimbriae of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. Stimulating activities of these FimA fimbriae were evaluated by TNF-\u03b1-inducing activity in the macrophages. To clarify the mode of action of FimA fimbriae, anti-Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 blocking antibody was added prior to stimulation. Weak stimulatory activity of native FimA fimbriae was enhanced by heat treatment and low-dose proteinase K treatment. Higher dose of proteinase K treatment abrogated this up-regulation. The activity of treated FimA fimbriae was suppressed by anti-TLR2 antibody, and more substantially by lipoprotein lipase treatment. These results suggest that lipoproteins or lipopeptides associated with FimA fimbriae could at least in part account for signaling via TLR2 and subsequent TNF-\u03b1 production in macrophages.",

During this process, introduction of excess amount of exogenous siRNAs could lead to the saturation of cellular RNAi machinery. One consequence of RNAi machinery saturation is the competition between two simultaneously introduced siRNAs, during which one siRNA loses gene silencing activity. Although competition phenomena have been well characterized, the molecular and sequence features of siRNAs that specify the competition potency remain poorly understood. Here, for the first time, we performed a large-scale siRNA competition potency analysis by measuring the competition potency of 56 different siRNAs and ranking them based on their competition potency. We have also established an algorithm to predict the competition potency of siRNAs based upon the conserved sequence features of strong and weak competitor siRNAs. The present study supports our hypothesis that the competition potency of siRNAs is specified by the 5\u2032-half antisense sequence and provides a useful guideline to design siRNAs with minimal RNAi machinery saturation.",

Mutations in cardiac sodium channel \u03b1, \u03b21 and \u03b22 subunit genes (SCN5A, SCN1B, and SCN2B) have been identified in AF patients. We hypothesize that mutations in the sodium channel \u03b23 subunit gene SCN3B are also associated with AF. To test this hypothesis, we carried out a large scale sequencing analysis of all coding exons and exon\u2013intron boundaries of SCN3B in 477 AF patients (28.5% lone AF) from the GeneID Chinese Han population. A novel A130V mutation was identified in a 46-year-old patient with lone AF, and the mutation was absent in 500 controls. Mutation A130V dramatically decreased the cardiac sodium current density when expressed in HEK293/Nav1.5 stable cell line, but did not have significant effect on kinetics of activation, inactivation, and channel recovery from inactivation. When co-expressed with wild type SCN3B, the A130V mutant SCN3B negated the function of wild type SCN3B, suggesting that A130V acts by a dominant negative mechanism. Western blot analysis with biotinylated plasma membrane protein extracts revealed that A130V did not affect cell surface expression of Nav1.5 or SCN3B, suggesting that mutant A130V SCN3B may not inhibit sodium channel trafficking, instead may affect conduction of sodium ions due to its malfunction as an integral component of the channel complex. This study identifies the first AF-associated mutation in SCN3B, and suggests that mutations in SCN3B may be a new pathogenic cause of AF.",

     "abstract": "Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been used for cell-based therapies in degenerative disease and as vehicles for delivering therapeutic genes to sites of injury and tumors. Recently, umbilical cord blood (UCB) was identified as a source for MSCs, and human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) can serve as an alternative source of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). However, migration signaling pathways required for homing and recruitment of hUCB-MSCs are not fully understood. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a ligand for the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, plays a pivotal role in mobilization and homing of stem cells and modulates different biological responses in various stem cells. In this study, expression of CXCR4 in hUCB-MSCs was studied by western blot analysis and the functional role of SDF-1 was assessed. SDF-1 induced the migration of hUCB-MSCs in a dose-dependent manner. The induced migration was inhibited by the CXCR4-specific peptide antagonist (AMD3100) and by inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (LY294002), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal related kinase (PD98059) and p38MAPK inhibitor (SB203580). hUCB-MSCs treated with SDF-1 displayed increased phosphorylation of Akt, ERK and p38, which were inhibited by AMD3100. Small-interfering RNA-mediated knock-down of Akt, ERK and p38 blocked SDF-1 induced hUCB-MSC migration. In addition, SDF-1-induced actin polymerization was also blocked by these inhibitors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Akt, ERK and p38 signal transduction pathways may be involved in SDF-1-mediated migration of hUCB-MSCs.",

However, the secretion of Hsp90\u03b1 from endothelial cells and also its function in angiogenesis are still unclear. Here we investigated the role of extracellular Hsp90\u03b1 in angiogenesis using dermal endothelial cells in vitro and a wound healing model in vivo. We find that the secretion of Hsp90\u03b1 but not Hsp90\u03b2 is increased in activated endothelial cells with the induction of angiogenic factors and matrix proteins. Secreted Hsp90\u03b1 localizes on the leading edge of endothelial cells and promotes their angiogenic activities, whereas Hsp90\u03b1 neutralizing antibodies reverse the effect. Furthermore, using a mouse skin wound healing model in vivo, we demonstrate that extracellular Hsp90\u03b1 localizes on blood vessels in granulation tissues of wounded skin and promotes angiogenesis during wound healing. Taken together, our study reveals that Hsp90\u03b1 can be secreted by activated endothelial cells and is a positive regulator of angiogenesis, suggesting the potential application of Hsp90\u03b1 as a stimulator for wound repair.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of PINK1 genetic variants in 154 South African PD patients from all ethnic groups.

No homozygous exonic deletions were detected. The novel P305A variant was found in a female patient of Black Xhosa ethnicity who has a positive family history of the disease and an age at onset of 30\u00a0years. This variant has the potential to modulate enzymatic activity due to its location in the kinase domain. This is the first report on mutation screening of PINK1 in the South African population.

     "abstract": "System A-mediated amino acid transport across the placenta is important for the supply of neutral amino acids needed for fetal growth. All three system A subtypes (SNAT1, 2, and 4) are expressed in human placental trophoblast suggesting there is an important biological role for each. Placental system A activity increases as pregnancy progresses, coinciding with increased fetal nutrient demands. We have previously shown SNAT4-mediated system A activity is higher in first trimester than at term, suggesting that SNAT1 and/or SNAT2 are responsible for the increased system A activity later in gestation. However, the relative contribution of each subtype to transporter activity in trophoblast at term has yet to be evaluated. The purpose of this study was to identify the predominant subtype of system A in cytotrophoblast cells isolated from term placenta, maintained in culture for 66\u00a0h, by: (1) measuring mRNA expression of the three subtypes and determining the Michaelis\u2013Menten constants for uptake of the system A-specific substrate, 14C-MeAIB, (2) investigating the contribution of SNAT1 to total system A activity using siRNA. Results: mRNA expression was highest for the SNAT1 subtype of system A. Kinetic analysis of 14C-MeAIB uptake revealed two distinct transport systems; system 1: Km\u00a0=\u00a00.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0mM, Vmax\u00a0=\u00a027.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0\u00a0pmol/mg protein/20\u00a0min, which resembles that reported for SNAT1 and SNAT2 in other cell types, and system 2: Km\u00a0=\u00a045.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025.0\u00a0mM, Vmax\u00a0=\u00a01190\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0291\u00a0pmol/mg protein/20\u00a0min, which potentially represents SNAT4. Successful knockdown of SNAT1 mRNA using target-specific siRNA significantly reduced system A activity (median 75% knockdown, n\u00a0=\u00a07).

By contrast, little is known regarding addiction to glutamine. Using five melanoma lines and two normal cell types, addition of aminooxyacetate (AOA), an inhibitor of glutamate-dependent transaminase regulating glutaminolytic pathway, two lines underwent low levels of apoptosis (>30%), while the other three lines were resistant, as were normal cells to AOA. However, three resistant lines (but not normal cells), became sensitized to undergoing apoptosis when TRAIL was combined with AOA. TRAIL by itself had minimal effects on all cell lines and normal cells, and did not augment AOA-induced killing in the two sensitive melanoma lines. AOA plus TRAIL induced a caspase-dependent apoptotic response. AOA did not influence TRAIL DR4 or DR5 cell surface death receptor levels, but AOA enhanced pro-apoptotic protein levels of Noxa, while reducing pro-survival protein Mcl-1. To verify AOA was targeting glutamine pathway, depletion of glutamine produced similar results, because absence of glutamine sensitized three melanoma lines, but not fibroblasts to killing by TRAIL. Glutamine depletion also led to Noxa induction. These results indicate some lines are addicted to glutamine, and treatment with AOA or glutamine depletion sensitizes melanoma to TRAIL-mediated killing, while sparing normal cells. Future studies are indicated to translate these discoveries to metastatic melanoma as there is currently no treatment available to prolong survival.",

We have previously demonstrated that PIKfyve is phosphorylated in response to insulin in a PI3-kinase and protein kinase B (PKB)-dependent manner. However, it has been implied that this was not due to direct phosphorylation of PIKfyve by PKB, but as a result of an insulin-induced PIKfyve autophosphorylation event. Here we demonstrate that purified PIKfyve is phosphorylated in vitro by a recombinant active PKB on two separate serine residues, S318 and S105, which flank the N-terminal FYVE domain of the protein. Only S318, however, becomes phosphorylated in intact cells stimulated with insulin. We further demonstrate that S318 is phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress in a PI3-kinase- and PKB-independent manner. Importantly, the effects of insulin and sorbitol were not prevented by the presence of an ATP-competitive PIKfyve inhibitor (YM20163) or in a mutant PIKfyve lacking both lipid and protein kinase activity. Our results confirm, therefore, that PIKfyve is directly phosphorylated by PKB on a single serine residue in response to insulin and are not due to autophosphorylation of the enzyme. We further reveal that two stimuli known to promote glucose uptake in cells, both stimulate phosphorylation of PIKfyve on S318 but via distinct signal transduction pathways.",

     "abstract": "Ischemia damages the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), mediated in part by damage generated by the mitochondria themselves. Mitochondrial damage resulting from ischemia, in turn, leads to cardiac injury during reperfusion. The goal of the present study was to localize the segment of the ETC that produces the ischemic mitochondrial damage. We tested if blockade of the proximal ETC at complex I differed from blockade distal in the chain at cytochrome oxidase. Isolated rabbit hearts were perfused for 15\u00a0min followed by 30\u00a0min stop-flow ischemia at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Amobarbital (2.5\u00a0mM) or azide (5\u00a0mM) was used to block proximal (complex I) or distal (cytochrome oxidase) sites in the ETC. Time control hearts were buffer-perfused for 45\u00a0min. Subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) were isolated. Ischemia decreased cytochrome c content in SSM but not in IFM compared to time control. Blockade of electron transport at complex I preserved the cytochrome c content in SSM. In contrast, blockade of electron transport at cytochrome oxidase with azide did not retain cytochrome c in SSM during ischemia. Since blockade of electron transport at complex III also prevented cytochrome c loss during ischemia, the specific site that elicits mitochondrial damage during ischemia is likely located in the segment between complex III and cytochrome oxidase.",

     "abstract": "Integral membrane lysophospholipid acyltransferases (AT) are involved in many reactions that produce phospholipids and triglycerides. Enzymes that utilize lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as an acceptor substrate have been termed LPAATs, and several are members of the 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase (AGPAT) gene family. Amino acid sequence comparisons with other acyltransferases reveal that AGPATs contain four conserved motifs (I\u2013IV), whose invariant residues appear to be important for catalysis and/or substrate recognition. Although the enzymatic activities of many AGPATs are known, for many members their structural organization within membranes and their exact biological functions are unclear. Recently, a new function for AGPATs was discovered when it was determined that human AGPAT3/LPAAT3 is involved in the structure and function of the Golgi complex. Here we have determined the topological orientation of human AGPAT3/LPAAT3. AGPAT3/LPAAT3 possesses two transmembrane domains, one of which separates motifs I and II, which are thought to form a functional unit that is critical for enzymatic activity. This is a surprising result but similar to a recent study on the topology of human LPAAT 1. The data is consistent with a structural arrangement in which motif I is located in the cytoplasm and motif II is in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi lumen, suggesting a different model for AGPAT3/LPAAT3\u2019s enzymatic mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Malaria parasites undergo two rounding-up transformations in their life cycle: the ookinete-to-oocyst transformation in the mosquito midgut, and the sporozoite-to-EEF (exo-erythrocytic form) differentiation in the host hepatocyte. Both events are characterized by the loss of polarity, implying that cytoskeletal reorganization is involved. In other eukaryotes, regulation of the actin skeleton is fundamental to subcellular remodeling. Although filamentous actin is well known to be involved in the motility of apicomplexan parasites, its participation in their morphological regulation is still largely unexplored. Here we describe the fundamental role of Actin depolymerization factor 2 (ADF2), a vector-stage-specific ADF isoform, in morphological changes accompanying the parasite life cycle. Among protozoan parasites, Plasmodium is unique in having two actin and two ADF genes. Disruption of the ADF2 gene in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei had no effect on ookinete development or its subsequent invasion of the midgut. However, both the ookinete-to-oocyst and sporozoite-to-EEF transformations showed significant defects. These results indicated that Plasmodium ADF2 plays a pivotal role in transformation in the malaria parasite life cycle.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) is an essential component of ribosome biogenesis. In our present study, we characterize plant eIF6 genes for the first time. Although a single gene encodes eIF6 in yeast and animals, two genes were found to encode proteins homologous to animal and yeast eIF6 in Arabidopsis and rice, denoted At-eIF6;1 and At-eIF6;2, and Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2, respectively. Analysis of the yeast eif6 (tif6) mutant suggested that plant eIF6, at least in the case of At-eIF6;1, can complement the essential function of eIF6 in yeast. Evidence for the essential role of eIF6 in plants was also provided by the embryonic-lethal phenotype of the at-eif6;1 mutant. In contrast, At-eIF6;2 appears not to be essential due to its very low expression level and the normal growth phenotype of the eif6;2 mutants. Consistent with the putative role of plant eIF6 in ribosome biogenesis, At-eIF6;1 is predominately expressed in tissues where cell division actively proceeds under the control of intronic cis-regulatory elements. On the other hand, both Os-eIF6;1 and Os-eIF6;2 are probably active genes because they are expressed at significant expression levels. Interestingly, the supply of ammonium nitrate as a plant nutrient was found to induce specifically the expression of Os-eIF6;2. Our present findings indicate that the eIF6 genes have differently evolved in plant and animal kingdoms and also in distinct plant species.",

We isolated SDSCs from the ear skin of a gnotobiotic pig. During the proliferation period, the cells expressed stem-cell markers Oct-4, Sox-2, and CD90; nestin expression also increased significantly. The cells could differentiate into IPCs after treatments with activin-A, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and nicotinamide. After 15\u00a0days in the differentiation medium, controlled gSDSCs began expressing endocrine progenitor genes and proteins (Ngn3, Neuro-D, PDX-1, NKX2.2, NKX6.1, and insulin). The IPCs showed increased insulin synthesis after glucose stimulation.

The study of osteocalcin different circulating forms in mouse serum, however, has been hampered by the absence of quantitative methodology. Here we described a triple enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for quantification of mouse total, carboxylated and uncarboxylated osteocalcin. That carboxylation of osteocalcin was decreased in mouse osteoblasts cultures treated with warfarin, an inhibitor of carboxylation validated this assay. This ELISA could also detect elevated levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin in the serum of mice treated with warfarin and in the serum of Esp \u2212/\u2212 mice, a mouse model known to have more undercarboxylated, i.e., active osteocalcin. These results show that this new ELISA system is a reliable method to assess carboxylation status of osteocalcin in cell culture supernatants as well as in mouse serum.

Cryopreserved CD34+ UCB cells from twelve different human donors were transplanted into sublethally irradiated NOD/shi-scid Jic mice. In parallel, the gene expression profiles of the UCB cells were determined from oligonucleotide microarrays. UCB cells from three donors failed to establish an engraftment in the host mice, while the other nine succeeded to various extents. Gene expression profiling indicated that 71 genes, including HOXB4, C/EBP-\u03b2, and ETS2, were specifically overexpressed and 23 genes were suppressed more than 2-fold in the successful UCB cells compared to those that failed. Functional annotation revealed that cell growth and cell cycle regulators were more abundant in the successful UCB cells.

Here, we first demonstrated that Sox2 could contribute to the self-renewal and proliferation of glioma-initiating cells. The following experiments showed that Sox2 was activated at translational level in a subset of human glioma-initiating cells compared with the normal neural stem cells. Further investigation revealed there was a positive correlation between Sox2 and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in glioma tissues. Down-regulation of eIF4E decreased Sox2 protein level without altering its mRNA level in glioma-initiating cells, indicating that Sox2 was activated by eIF4E at translational level. Furthermore, eIF4E was presumed to regulate the expression of Sox2 by its 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) sequence.

Since calorie restriction (CR) is considered to prevent functional decline of various organs due to aging, we hypothesized that CR could prevent age-related lacrimal dysfunction. Six-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were randomly divided into ad libitum (AL) and CR (\u221235%) groups. After 6\u00a0months of CR, tear function was examined under conscious state. After euthanasia, lacrimal glands were subjected to histological examination, tear protein secretion stimulation test with Carbachol, and assessment of oxidative stress with 8-hydroxy-2 deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) antibodies. CR significantly improved tear volume and tended to increase tear protein secretion volume after stimulation with Carbachol compared to AL. The acinar unit density was significantly higher in the CR rats compared to AL rats. Lacrimal glands in the CR rats showed a lesser degree of interstitial fibrosis. CR reduced the concentration of 8-OHdG and the extent of staining with HNE in the lacrimal gland, compared to AL. Furthermore, our electron microscopic observations showed that mitochondrial structure of the lacrimal gland obtained from the middle-aged CR rats was preserved in comparison to the AL rats. Collectively, these results demonstrate for the first time that CR may attenuate oxidative stress related damage in the lacrimal gland with preservation of lacrimal gland functions. Although molecular mechanism(s) by which CR maintains lacrimal gland function remains to be resolved, CR might provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating dry eye syndrome.",

To investigate proteins/molecules related to the sociality of the European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.), we performed a proteomic analysis of the honeybee salivary system. The honeybee salivary system comprises two secretory glands: the postcerebral gland (PcG) and the thoracic gland (TG), both of which are connected to a common duct that opens in the mouthpart. Although most (31 out of 35) of the major proteins identified from the PcG and TG were housekeeping proteins, the spot intensities for aldolase and acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2 were stronger in the PcG than in the TG in the 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Immunoblotting confirmed that the expression of these proteins was stronger in the PcG than in the TG, whereas expression was almost not detectable in the hypopharyngeal gland (HpG), suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism is enhanced in the honeybee PcG. In addition, imaginal disc growth factor 4 (IDGF4) was synthesized in the honeybee salivary system. Immunoblotting indicated IDGF4 expression was very strong in the PcG, moderate in the TG, and very weak in the HpG. A considerable amount of IDGF4 was detected in the royal jelly, while less was detected in honey, strongly suggesting that the honeybee salivary system secretes IDGF4 into the royal jelly and honey.

Mechanism of this synergistic activation is a matter of debate. Here we review the existing literature to identify the possible binding site for YC-1 and BAY on bovine lung sGC and its mechanism of activation. These two exogenous compounds bind sGC on \u03b1 subunit inside a pocket and thus exert allosteric effect via subunit interface, which is relayed to the catalytic site. We used docking studies to further validate this hypothesis. We propose that the binding of YC-1/BAY inside the sensory domain of the \u03b1 subunit modulates the interactions on the subunit interface resulting in rearrangements in the catalytic site into active conformation and this partly induces the cleavage of Fe\u2013His bond.",

     "abstract": "Cardiac hypertrophy is a physiological adaptive response of the heart to diverse pathophysiological stimuli. Initially, it may be adaptive to normalize wall stress and to preserve contractile performance. This adaptive process may gradually progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, fibrotic diseases, arrhythmia, heart failure and even sudden death. Although various molecular pathways responsible for the coordinated control of the hypertrophic program, little is known about their underlying molecular mechanisms. Very recently, increasing evidence showed that miRNAs are key modulators of both cardiovascular development and function, which govern the process of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act in a complex functional network in which each single miRNAs might control thousands of distinct target genes, and each single protein-coding gene can be regulated by many different miRNAs. Identifying the roles of miRNAs, their target genes and signaling pathways in cardiac hypertrophy by bioinformatic analysis will provide more insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease process. Currently, bioinformatics resource such as GO and KEGG was applied to describe the miRNAs target genes function and identify the mRNA interaction networks that are responsible for various cellular processes. It provides a useful approach to observe the function of microRNA in physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we will give a discussion on the dysregulation of specific miRNAs in cardiac hypertrophy and signaling pathways linking the hypertrophy-regulating miRNAs to the pathological process of cardiac hypertrophy. Finally, we place special emphasis on the essential role of bioinformatics analysis to predict the target genes and miRNAs gene networks.",

Here, we show that the MTERF-domain of human MTERF3 forms a half-doughnut-shaped right-handed superhelix. The superhelix is built from \u03b1-helical tandem repeats that display a novel triangular three-helix motif. This repeat motif, which we denote the MTERF-motif, is a conserved structural element present in proteins from metazoans, plants, and protozoans. Furthermore, a narrow, strongly positively charged nucleic acid-binding path is found in the middle of the concave side of the half-doughnut. This arrangement suggests a half clamp nucleic acid-binding mode for MTERF-domains.",

Our earlier studies demonstrated that PKC\u03b1 is co-immunoprecipitated with Erk and the phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1 in this Erk\u2013PKC\u03b1 complex is dependent on the Erk pathway. Furthermore, the T638 residue, which must be phosphorylated for the complete activation of PKC\u03b1, is within an authentic Erk consensus domain (S/TP), and the PKC\u03b1 protein also contains two docking sites for Erk such as KRGRIYL and KRGIIYRDLKL. Using F\u00f6ster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) we have confirmed an association between Erk and PKC\u03b1. Employing PKC\u03b1 and Erk mutants we next demonstrated that Erk causes direct phosphorylation and activation of PKC\u03b1. By mutating the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1)-promoted phosphorylation site (S497) and the kinase site (K368) in PKC\u03b1, we observed that both of these autophosphorylation-deficient mutants are phosphorylated at T638 in an Erk-dependent manner. To confirm that Erk indeed catalyzes phosphorylation of PKC\u03b1 at T638, we used a mutant Erk construct in which a relatively large amino acid residue in the ATP binding site (Q103) had been replaced with glycine, enabling this mutant to utilize a bulky analog of ATP, cyclopentyl ATP. An in vitro kinase assay using this mutant Erk protein, radiolabeled cyclopentyl ATP, and a synthetic oligopeptide containing the S/TP site of PKC\u03b1 demonstrated phosphorylation of the peptide by Erk1/2. These results confirm the novel possibility that PKC\u03b1 is a direct substrate of Erk1/2 in neuronal cells and help link two important signaling molecules that regulate maturation and protection of hippocampal neurons as well as many other cell types.",

     "abstract": "Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has been successfully used in many species to produce live cloned offspring, albeit with low efficiency. The low frequency of successful development has usually been ascribed to incomplete or inappropriate reprogramming of the transferred nuclear genome. Elucidating the genetic differences between normal fertilized and cloned embryos is key to understand the low efficiency of SCNT. Here, we show that expression of HSPC117, which encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function, was absent or very low in cloned mouse blastocysts. To investigate the role of HSPC117 in embryo development, we knocked-down this gene in normal fertilized embryos using RNA interference. We assessed the post-implantation survival of HSPC117 knock-down embryos at 3 stages: E9 (prior to placenta formation); E12 (after the placenta was fully functional) and E19 (post-natal). Our results show that, although siRNA-treated in vivo fertilized/produced (IVP) embryos could develop to the blastocyst stage and implanted without any difference from control embryos, the knock-down embryos showed substantial fetal death, accompanied by placental blood clotting, at E12. Furthermore, comparison of HSPC117 expression in placentas of nuclear transfer (NT), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and IVP embryos confirmed that HSPC117 deficiency correlates well with failures in embryo development: all NT embryos with a fetus, as well as IVP and ICSI embryos, had normal placental HSPC117 expression while those NT embryos showing reduced or no expression of HSPC117 failed to form a fetus. In conclusion, we show that HSPC117 is an important gene for post-implantation development of embryos, and that HSPC117 deficiency leads to fetal abnormalities after implantation, especially following placental formation. We suggest that defects in HSPC117 expression may be an important contributing factor to loss of cloned NT embryos in vivo.",

U46619 enhanced the expression and secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a major inducer of vascular permeability, in endothelial cells. Promoter analysis showed that the U46619-induced expression of IL-8 was mainly regulated by nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB).

If an intracellular antigen that was specific to a particular cell type could be stained with a florescent dye and then the cells can be sorted without causing RNA degradation, a more simple and universal method for sorting and analyzing cells with a specific gene expression pattern could be established since the biological characteristics of the sorted cells could then be determined by analyzing their gene expression profile.

Evidence indicates that chromium has a role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and may improve insulin sensitivity. In this study, we report that chromium supplementation has a beneficial effect against NAFLD. We found that KK/HlJ mice developed obesity and progressed to NAFLD after feeding with high-fat diet for 8\u00a0weeks. High-fat-fed KK/HlJ mice showed hepatocyte injury and hepatic triglyceride accumulation, which was accompanied by insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Chromium supplementation prevented progression of NAFLD and the beneficial effects were accompanied by reduction of hepatic triglyceride accumulation, elevation of hepatic lipid catabolic enzyme, improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism, suppression of inflammation as well as resolution of oxidative stress, probably through enhancement of insulin signaling. Our findings suggest that chromium could serve as a hepatoprotective agent against NAFLD.",

     "abstract": "So far, the content and accumulation of ATP in isolated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are little understood. First, we confirmed using electron microscopic and Western blotting techniques that the samples extracted from MDCK cells are endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The amounts of ATP in the extracted ER were measured from the filtrate after a spinning down of ultrafiltration spin column packed with ER. When the ER sample (5\u00a0\u03bcg) after 3\u00a0days freezing was suspended in intracellular medium (ICM), 0.1% Triton X and ultrapure water (UPW), ATP amounts from the ER with UPW were the highest and over 10 times compared with that from the control with ICM, indicating that UPW is the most effective tool in destroying the ER membrane. After a 10-min-incubation with ICM containing phosphocreatine (PCr)/creatine kinase (CK) of the fresh ER. ATP amounts in the filtrate obtained by spinning down were not changed from that in the control (no PCr/CK). However, ATP amounts in the filtrate from the second spinning down of the ER (treated with PCr/CK) suspended in UPW became over 10-fold compared with the control. When 1\u00a0\u03bcM inositol(1,4,5)trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) was added in the incubation medium (ICM with PCr/CK), ATP amounts from the filtrate after the second spinning down were further enhanced around three times. This enhancement was almost canceled by Ca2+-removal from ICM and by adding thapsigargin, a Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, but not by 2-APB and heparin, Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor antagonists. Administration of 500\u00a0\u03bcM adenosine to the incubation medium (with PCr/CK) failed to enhance the accumulation of ATP in the ER. These findings suggest that the ER originally contains ATP and ATP accumulation in the ER is promoted by PCr/CK and Ins(1,4,5)P3.",

But the factors inducing ER stress in human adipose tissue are unknown. The common factors increased in obesity and linked to insulin resistance are hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidemia and also endotoxemia. Therefore, our aims were to investigate: (1) the role of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), high glucose (HG) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) as inducers of ER stress in primary human adipocytes and (2) whether salicylate, a known anti-inflammatory compound, can alleviate this effect. Components of the ER stress pathways were studied in human abdominal subcutaneous (AbSc) adipose tissue (AT) from obese and lean. Following the culture and differentiation of primary human preadipocytes, these adipocytes were treated with LPS, HG, tunicamycin (Tun) and SFA either alone or in combination with sodium salicylate (Sal). Markers of ER stress were significantly increased in AbSc AT of obese. Differentiated human adipocytes treated with LPS, Tun, HG and SFA showed significant activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and their down-stream targets. Sal alleviated this effect and activated AktSer473 phosphorylation. This study presents important evidence that: (1) there is increased ER stress in adipose tissue of obese individuals, (2) LPS, hyperglycaemia and saturated fatty acids induce significant ER stress in primary human adipocytes and (3) this induction is alleviated by salicylate.",

SMN is a ubiquitously expressed house keeping protein that is involved in RNA production and processing. However, although SMN is expressed in every cell type, only the lower motor neurons of the spinal cord are degraded in SMA. It remains unclear why this is the case.

However, it remains unclear which known SMN-binding partners are present in these SMN-NGs. To address this we have analysed SMN-NGs in a human neuronal cell line, SH-SY5Y, using antibodies against the majority of reported SMN-binding partners, including: Gemin2, Gemin3, Gemin4, Gemin5, Gemin6, Gemin7, Sm core proteins, fibrillarin, EWS, PFNII, Unrip and ZPR1.

Phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) and serine/threonine kinase (Akt) proteins are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. In addition, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) has been identified as a negative regulator of cytokine signaling that inhibits the PI3K\u2013Akt pathway. However, little is known about the role of PTEN/Akt signaling in hypoxia-associated vascular remodeling. In this study, we found that hypoxia-induced the expression of Akt1 mRNA and phosphorylated protein by at least twofold in rat PASMCs. Phospho-PTEN significantly decreased in the nuclei of PASMCs after hypoxic stimulation. After forcing over-expression of PTEN by adenovirus-mediated PTEN (Ad-PTEN) transfection, the expression of phospho-Akt1 was significantly suppressed in PASMCs at all time-points measured. Additionally, we showed here that hypoxia increased proliferation of PASMCs by nearly twofold and over-expression of PTEN significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced PASMCs proliferation. These findings suggest that phospho-PTEN loss in the nuclei of PASMCs under hypoxic conditions may be the major cause of aberrant activation of Akt1 and may, therefore, play an important role in hypoxia-associated pulmonary arterial remodeling. Finally, the fact that transfection with Ad-PTEN inhibits the phosphorylation of Akt1 in PASMCs suggests a potential therapeutic effect on hypoxia-associated pulmonary arterial remodeling.",

The concentration of copper in serum is about 20\u00a0\u03bcM. Since copper accumulates in the liver in certain disease states, the purpose of these studies was to assess the effects of copper on P2Y2 receptors in a model liver cell line. Exposure to a P2Y2 agonist UTP increased [Ca2+]i by stimulating Ca2+ release from thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Pretreatment of HTC cells for several minutes with copper did not affect cell viability, but potently inhibited increases in [Ca2+]i evoked by UTP and thapsigargin. During this pretreatment, copper was not transported into the cytosol, and inhibited P2Y2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner with the IC50 of about 15\u00a0\u03bcM. These results suggest that copper inhibits P2Y2 receptors through the effects on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores by acting from an extracellular side. Further experiments indicated that these effect of copper may lead to inhibition of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) evoked by hypotonic solution. Thus, copper may contribute to defective regulation of purinergic signaling and liver cell volume in diseases associated with the increased serum copper concentration.",

No data are available on NPM expression in thyroid cells. In this work, we analyzed both NPM mRNA and protein levels in a series of human thyroid tumor tissues and cell lines. By using immunohistochemistry, NPM overexpression was detected in papillary, follicular, undifferentiated thyroid cancer, and also in follicular benign adenomas, indicating it as an early event during thyroid tumorigenesis. In contrast, various levels of NPM mRNA levels as detected by quantitative RT-PCR were observed in tumor tissues, suggesting a dissociation between protein and transcript expression. The same behavior was observed in the normal thyroid FRTL5 cell lines. In these cells, a positive correlation between NPM protein levels, but not mRNA, and proliferation state was detected. By using thyroid tumor cell lines, we demonstrated that such a post-mRNA regulation may depend on NPM binding to p-Akt, whose levels were found to be increased in the tumor cells, in parallel with reduction of PTEN. In conclusion, our present data demonstrate for the first time that nucleophosmin is overexpressed in thyroid tumors, as an early event of thyroid tumorigenesis. It seems as a result of a dysregulation occurring at protein and not transcriptional level related to an increase of p-Akt levels of transformed thyrocytes.",

We employed UNC-31 null mutant C. elegans worms to examine whether UNC-31 functions could be rescued by ectopic expression of full length UNC-31 vs each of these four domain-deleted mutants. Full length UNC-31 cDNA rescued the phenotypes of C. elegans null mutants in response to Ca2+-elevation in ALA neurons. Surprisingly, MHD deletion also rescued UNC-31 exocytotic function in part because the relatively high Ca2+ level (pre-flash Ca2+ was 450 nM) used in the capacitance study could bypass the MHD defect. Nonetheless, the three other domain-truncation cDNAs had almost no rescue on Ca2+ evoked secretion. Importantly, this genetic null mutant rescue strategy enabled physiological studies at levels of whole organism to single cells, such as locomotion assay, pharmacological study of neurotransmission at neuromuscular junction, in vivo neuropeptide release measurement and analysis of vesicular docking. Our results suggest that each of these UNC-31 domains support distinct sequential molecular actions of UNC-31 in vesicular exocytosis, including steps in vesicle tethering and docking that bridge vesicle with plasma membrane, and subsequently priming vesicle by initiating the formation of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) core complex.",

Crossing of CD11c-iDTR mice with CAG-Cre transgenic mice, expressing Cre recombinase under control of the cytomegalovirus immediate early enhancer-chicken beta-actin hybrid promoter, led to the generation of mice, in which DTR was selectively expressed in CD11c+ cells (iDTR\u0394 mice). We successfully deleted CD11c+ cells in bone marrow-derived DCs in vitro and splenic CD11c+ cells in vivo after DT treatment in iDTR\u0394 mice. This mouse strain will be a useful tool for generating mice lacking a specific subset of DCs using a transgenic mouse strain, in which the Cre gene is expressed by a DC subset-specific promoter.",

     "abstract": "Neuronal gap junctions are receiving increasing attention as a physiological means of intercellular communication, yet our understanding of them is poorly developed when compared to synaptic communication. Using microfluorimetry, we demonstrate that differentiation of SN56 cells (hybridoma cells derived from murine septal neurones) leads to the spontaneous generation of Ca2+ waves. These waves were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (1\u00a0\u03bcM), but blocked by removal of extracellular Ca2+, or addition of non-specific Ca2+ channel inhibitors (Cd2+ (0.1\u00a0mM) or Ni2+ (1\u00a0mM)). Combined application of antagonists of NMDA receptors (AP5; 100\u00a0\u03bcM), AMPA/kainate receptors (NBQX; 20\u00a0\u03bcM), nicotinic AChR receptors (hexamethonium; 100\u00a0\u03bcM) or inotropic purinoceptors (brilliant blue; 100\u00a0nM) was also without effect. However, Ca2+ waves were fully prevented by carbenoxolone (200\u00a0\u03bcM), halothane (3\u00a0mM) or niflumic acid (100\u00a0\u03bcM), three structurally diverse inhibitors of gap junctions, and mRNA for connexin 36 was detected by PCR. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings revealed spontaneous inward currents in voltage-clamped cells which we inhibited by Cd2+, Ni2+ or niflumic acid. Our data suggest that differentiated SN56 cells generated spontaneous Ca2+ waves which are propagated by intercellular gap junctions. We propose that this system can be exploited conveniently for the development of neuronal gap junction modulators.",

In the present research, we showed that levels of SIRT1 mRNA and protein expression increased in TNF-\u03b1-treated VSMCs. Overexpression of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-\u03baB, a TNF-\u03b1-activated inflammatory transcription factor, in A7r5 cells, upregulated SIRT1 mRNA and protein expression as well as SIRT1 promoter activity, while knockdown of endogenous p65/RelA expression by RNAi not only led to a decrease in SIRT1\u2019s basal protein expression and promoter activity, but almost abolished the TNF-\u03b1-induced elevation of SIRT1 protein expression and SIRT1 promoter activity. Furthermore, using promoter deletion analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we found that p65/RelA bound to the SIRT1 promoter at a consensus NF-\u03baB binding site.

The CYP3A5 genotype was related with blood pressure in the general population, but the effect on the risk for hypertension in pregnancy has not been evaluated.We compared the allele and genotype frequencies of three functional SNPs in the CYP3A5 (rs776746), CYP3A4 (rs2740574), and CYP21A2 (rs6471) genes between pregnant women who developed hypertension (n\u00a0=\u00a0250) or who remained normotensive (control group, n\u00a0=\u00a0250). In addition, we sequenced the full CYP3A5 coding sequence in 40 women from the two groups to determine whether some gene variants could explain the risk for hypertensive pregnancies in our population.Allele and genotype frequencies did not differ between hypertensive and normotensive women for the three CYP variants. We did not find CYP3A5 nucleotide changes that could explain a higher risk for hypertension in pregnancy.

Among various antivirals, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are considered important passive therapeutics having an immediate effect against viral pathogens. Here we report a pseudovirus neutralization assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs targeting hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. In this study, we generated six pseudoviruses with an HIV-1 backbone, respectively, expressing HA of four clades of H5N1 IAV and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV. The resulting pseudoviruses were able to infect a variety of human and non-human cells, with 293T cells from human kidney as the most susceptible target cells. Using the established pseudovirus neutralization assay, we showed that three of ten selected mAbs specific to HA could potently neutralize infection of a pseudovirus bearing HA from the homologous IAV A/VietNam/1194/2004(H5N1) strain. This was highly consistent with the result of a microneutralization assay testing the same strain of a live IAV. Since the pseudovirus neutralization assay does not involve an infectious virus and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory, it may be applied for safe and rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs and antiviral agents targeting HA of IAVs.",

Reduction of GSK-3 activity, either by small molecule inhibitors or siRNA targeting GSK-3 alpha and beta mRNA, resulted in increased permeability to both ions and bulk solutes.

The decrease in Occludin and E-cadherin protein expression correlated with downregulation of the corresponding mRNA levels for these respective proteins following GSK-3 inhibition.

This alteration of W62 decreases the \u03b2-domain stability of HEWL, induces a noncooperative unfolding of the secondary structures, and produces a partially unfolded intermediate. This intermediate containing relatively rich \u03b1-helix and less \u03b2-sheet structures has a great tendency to aggregate.

Hydrogen molecules have been shown to exert organ protective effects through selective reduction of hydroxyl radicals. As oxidative stress is one of the key insults promoting cell senescence in vivo as well as in vitro, we hypothesized that hydrogen molecules prevent senescent process during MSC expansion. Addition of 3% hydrogen gas enhanced preservation of colony forming early progenitor cells within MSC preparation and prolonged the in vitro replicative lifespan of MSCs without losing differentiation potentials and paracrine capabilities. Interestingly, 3% hydrogen gas treatment did not decrease hydroxyl radical, protein carbonyl, and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, suggesting that scavenging hydroxyl radical might not be responsible for these effects of hydrogen gas in this study.",

Here we investigated the ability of caffeine to stimulate CREB-dependent gene transcription in primary cultures of developing mouse cortical neurons. Using the CREB-dependent reporter gene CRE-luciferase we show that stimulation of CREB activity by caffeine exhibits a bell-shaped dose\u2013response curve. Maximal stimulation occurred at 10\u00a0mM caffeine, which is known to release Ca2+ from ryanodine sensitive internal stores. In our immature neuronal cultures, 10\u00a0mM caffeine was more effective at stimulating CREB activity than depolarization with high extracellular KCl (50\u00a0mM). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that transcripts derived from endogenous CREB target genes, such as the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF, are increased following caffeine treatment. The dose\u2013response curves of CREB target genes to caffeine exhibited gene-specificity, highlighting the importance of promoter structure in shaping genomic responses to Ca2+ signaling. In the presence of a weak depolarizing stimulus (10\u00a0mM KCl), concentrations of caffeine relevant for premature infants undergoing caffeine treatment increased CRE-luciferase activity and Bdnf transcript levels. The ability of caffeine to enhance activity-dependent Bdnf expression may contribute to the neurological benefit observed in infants receiving caffeine treatment.",

Expression study using synchronized HeLa cells demonstrated that, like the mitotic kinase Plk1, NFBD1 expression level is maximal in G2/M-phase of the cell cycle. siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFBD1 resulted in G2/M arrest as well as simultaneous apoptosis in association with a significant increase in the amounts of \u03b3H2AX and pro-apoptotic p73. Since a remarkable down-regulation of mitotic phospho-histone H3 was detectable in NFBD1-knocked down cells, it is likely that knocking down of NFBD1 inhibits G2/M transition.

Furthermore, naringenin reduced CD69 (the protein level) and cytokines such as IL-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 (the mRNA level) expressions which highly expressed by activated T cells. Meanwhile, naringenin also induced T cell apoptosis by upregulation of Bax, Bad, PARP, cleaved-caspase 3 and downregulation of phosphorylated Akt, Bcl-2.

This stimulatory effect occurred at the transcriptional level, and SubAB induced activation of the A20 promoter. We found that, in the early phase, SubAB triggered activation of NF-\u03baB in a dose-dependent manner. Blockade of NF-\u03baB abrogated expression of A20 by SubAB. SubAB rapidly triggered the unfolded protein response (UPR), and induction of the UPR by other agents (thapsigargin and A23187) mimicked the stimulatory effects of SubAB, both on NF-\u03baB and on A20. The induction of A20 by thapsigargin was correlated with activation of the A20 promoter, which was not observed in the \u03baB-mutated A20 promoter. Furthermore, induction of A20 by SubAB was substantially attenuated by treatment with different chemical chaperones.

To achieve this, therapeutic agents need to be delivered into the innermost mitochondrial space (mitochondrial matrix), which contains the mtDNA pool. We previously reported on the development of MITO-Porter, a liposome-based carrier that introduces macromolecular cargos into mitochondria via membrane fusion. In this study, we provide a demonstration of mitochondrial matrix delivery and the visualization of mitochondrial genes (mtDNA) in living cells using the MITO-Porter. We first prepared MITO-Porter containing encapsulated propidium iodide (PI), a fluorescent dye used to stain nucleic acids to detect mtDNA.

Furthermore, we reported that implanted wild-type MEFs could develop into adipocytes, whereas fad104-deficient MEFs could not. Interestingly, bone-like tissues were only observed in the implants derived from fad104-deficient MEFs. This result implies that fad104 is involved in osteoblast differentiation. However, the functions of fad104 during osteogenesis are unknown. In this paper, we show that fad104 negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation. During the differentiation process, the level of fad104 expression decreased. Deletion of fad104 facilitated osteoblast differentiation in MEFs, and elevated the level of runx2, a master regulator of osteoblast differentiation. Disruption of fad104 suppressed BMP-2-mediated adipocyte differentiation in MEFs.

Previous studies suggested that Snf1 contains an additional segment, a regulatory sequence (RS, corresponding to residues 392\u2013518), which may also have an important role in regulating the activity of the enzyme. The crystal structure of the heterotrimer core of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SNF1 showed interactions between a part of the RS (residues 460\u2013498) and the \u03b3 subunit Snf4. Here we report biochemical and functional studies on the regulation of SNF1 by the RS. GST pulldown experiments demonstrate strong and direct interactions between residues 450\u2013500 of the RS and the heterotrimer core, and single-site mutations in the RS\u2013Snf4 interface can greatly reduce these interactions in vitro. On the other hand, functional studies appear to show only small effects of the RS\u2013Snf4 interactions on the activity of SNF1 in vivo.

Recent studies have shown that uroepithelial cells aid innate immune cells in fighting off infection, although the exact mechanism by which the uroepithilium participates in immunity remains unclear. TLR4 has been implicated to possess antimicrobial activities specific for bladder epithelial cells (BECs). TLR4 promotes secretion of IL-6 and IL-8, mediates inhibition of bladder epithelial cell (BEC) bacterial invasion, and mediates expulsion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli from BECs. In this study, cultured 5637 cells and Balb/C mice were treated with Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) against invading E. coli. To determine the contribution of TLR4 upregulation to immune response, TLR4 expression and bacterial colony numbers were monitored. After 24 h incubation, only 5637 cells treated with 500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml APS expressed higher levels of TLR4 compared with the untreated group. However, after 48\u00a0h, all 5637 cells treated by APS showed higher levels of TLR4 expression than the control cells. The TLR4 expression in the bladder and macrophages mice that received APS was higher than that in the controls. Bacterial colonization in 5637 cells and the bladders of mice treated with APS was significantly reduced compared with the controls. These results demonstrate that at certain concentrations, APS can induce increased TLR4 expression in vivo and in vitro. Further, TLR4 expression upregulation can enhance innate immunity during mucosal bacterial infection. The findings establish the use of APS to modulate the innate immune response of the urinary tract through TLR4 expression regulation as an alternative option for UTI treatment.",

We found that shRNA depletion of the 55K CDK9 protein in HeLa cells induces apoptosis and double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). The levels of apoptosis and DSBs induced by the depletion were reduced by expression of a 55K CDK9 protein variant resistant to the shRNA, indicating that these phenotypes are the consequence of depletion of the 55K protein and not off-target effects. We also found that the 55K CDK9 protein, but not the 42K CDK9 protein, specifically associates with Ku70, a protein involved in DSB repair.

We demonstrate that mICAM-1 on exosomes retained its topology similar to that of cell surface ICAM-1, and could bind to leukocytes. In addition, we show that exosomal mICAM-1 exhibits potent anti-leukocyte adhesion activity to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-activated endothelial cells compared to that of sICAM-1.

Since calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, plays a critical role in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, we therefore, asked whether calcineurin is involved in the AT1 receptor-mediated but AngII-independent cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanical stretch failed to elicit hypertrophic responses in COS7 cells co-transfected with plasmid of AT1 receptor and siRNA of calcineurin. Mechanical stresses for 2\u00a0weeks in vivo and for 24\u00a0h in vitro significantly induced upregulation of calcineurin expression and hypertrophic responses, such as the increases in cardiomyocytes size and specific gene expressions, in cardiomyocytes of angiotensinogen gene knockout (ATG\u2212/\u2212) mice, both of which were significantly suppressed by a specific calcineurin inhibitor FK506, suggesting a critical role of calcineurin in mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy in the ATG\u2212/\u2212 mice. Furthermore, an AT1 receptor blocker Losartan not only attenuated cardiac hypertrophy but also abrogated upregulation of cardiac calcineurin expression induced by mechanical stresses in the AngII-lacking mice, indicating that calcineurin expression is regulated by AT1 receptor without the involvement of AngII after mechanical stress. These findings collectively suggest that mechanical stress-evoked but AngII-independent activation of AT1 receptor induces cardiac hypertrophy through calcineurin pathway.",

We showed that HpHSP60 enhanced cell migration and tube formation, but not cell proliferation, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HpHSP60 also indirectly promoted HUVEC proliferation when HUVECs were co-cultured with supernatants collected from HpHSP60-treated AGS or THP-1 cells. The angiogenic array showed that HpHSP60 dramatically induced THP-1 cells and HUVECs to produce the chemotactic factors IL-8 and GRO. Inhibition of CXCR2, the receptor for IL-8 and GRO, or downstream PLC\u03b22/Ca2+-mediated signaling, significantly abolished HpHSP60-induced tube formation. In contrast, suppression of MAP K or PI3 K signaling did not affect HpHSP60-mediated tubulogenesis.

Immunohistochemistry for constitutive (\u03b14 and \u03b21) and inducible (LMP2 and LMP7) proteasome subunits, and for the PA28\u03b1\u03b2 regulator, was performed in liver samples from 38 normal subjects, 6 fetuses, 2 pediatric cases, and 19 pathological cases (10 chronic active hepatitis and 9 cirrhosis).

The most striking result we found was the concomitant presence in hepatocyte cytoplasm of all healthy subjects, including the pediatric cases, of constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome subunits, as well as PA28\u03b1\u03b2. At variance, immunoproteasome was not present in hepatocytes from fetuses, while a strong cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity for LMP2 and LMP7 was found in pathological samples, directly correlated to the histopathological grade of inflammation. At variance from other organs such as the brain, immunoproteasome is present in livers from normal adult and pediatric cases, in apparent absence of pathological processes, suggesting the presence of a peculiar regulation of the proteasome/immunoproteasome system, likely related to the physiological stimuli derived from the gut microbiota after birth.

Here, we provide the first evidence that MUC3A gene expression is controlled by the CpG methylation status of the proximal promoter region. We show that the DNA methylation pattern is intimately correlated with MUC3A expression in breast, lung, pancreas and colon cancer cell lines. The DNA methylation status of 30\u00a0CpG sites from \u2212660 to +273 was mapped using MassARRAY analysis. MUC3A-negative cancer cell lines and those with low MUC3A expression (e.g., MCF-7) were highly methylated in the proximal promoter region, corresponding to 9\u00a0CpG sites (\u2212345 to \u221275\u00a0bp), whereas MUC3A-positive cell lines (e.g., LS174T) had low methylation levels. Moreover, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A treatment of MUC3A-negative cells or those with low MUC3A expression caused elevation of MUC3A mRNA.

     "abstract": "Proteins are folded properly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Various stress such as hypoxia, ischemia and starvation interfere with the ER function, causing ER stress, which is defined by the accumulation of unfolded protein (UP) in the ER. ER stress is prevented by the UP response (UPR) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). These signaling pathways are activated by three major ER molecules, ATF6, IRE-1 and PERK. Using HaCaT cells, we investigated ER signaling in human keratinocytes irradiated by environmental doses of ultraviolet B (UVB). The expression of Ero1-L\u03b1, an upstream signaling molecule of ER stress, decreased at 1\u20134\u00a0h after 10\u00a0mJ/cm2 irradiation, indicating that the environmental dose of UVB-induced ER stress in HaCaT cells, without growth retardation. Furthermore, expression of intact ATF6 was decreased and it was translocated to the nuclei. The expression of XBP-1, a downstream molecule of IRE-1, which is an ER chaperone whose expression is regulated by XBP-1, and UP ubiquitination were induced by 10\u00a0mJ/cm2 UVB at 4\u00a0h. PERK, which regulates apoptosis, was not phosphorylated. Our results demonstrate that UVB irradiation generates UP in HaCaT cells and that the UPR and ERAD systems are activated to protect cells from UVB-induced ER stress. This is the first report to show ER signaling in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes.",

However, the function of IGFBP2 in the restricted, self-renewing, and tumorigenic GBM cell population comprised of tumor-initiating stem cells has yet to be determined. Herein we demonstrate that IGFBP2 is overexpressed within the stem cell compartment of GBMs and is integral for the clonal expansion and proliferative properties of glioma stem cells (GSCs). In addition, IGFBP2 inhibition reduced Akt-dependent GSC genotoxic and drug resistance. These results suggest that IGFBP2 is a selective malignant factor that may contribute significantly to GBM pathogenesis by enriching for GSCs and mediating their survival. Given the current dearth of selective molecular targets against GSCs, we anticipate our results to be of high therapeutic relevance in combating the rapid and lethal course of GBM.",

This result indicates that melittin adopts the N-terminal-outside transmembrane topology within the liposome. The time course of acetylation followed the first-order kinetics at any examined temperatures (6\u201330\u00a0\u00b0C). The rate constant was less than that of the acetylation of melittin in aqueous solution. The activation energy for acetylation (74\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) was comparable to that for dissociation of a lipid monomer from the membrane, suggesting a float-like longitudinal motion of melittin within the liposome.

Glycated albumin has been shown to increase NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide formation in mesangial cells. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. Therefore, in the present studies, we determined the mechanisms by which glycated albumin activates NADPH oxidase in primary rat mesangial cells and its contribution to glycated albumin-induced TGF-\u03b2 expression and extracellular matrix protein production. Our data showed that glycated albumin treatment stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and increased the formation of superoxide formation in rat mesangial cells. Moreover, glycated albumin treatment stimulated the expression and phosphorylation of p47phox, one of the cytosolic regulatory subunits of the NADPH oxidase. However, the levels of other NADPH oxidase subunits including Nox1, Nox2, Nox4, p22phox, and p67phox were not altered by glycated albumin. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of p47phox inhibited glycated albumin-induced NADPH oxidase activity and superoxide formation. Glycated albumin-induced TGF-\u03b2 expression and extracellular matrix production (fibronectin) was also inhibited by p47phox knock down. Taken together, these data suggest that up-regulation of p47phox is involved in glycated albumin-mediated activation of NADPH oxidase, leading to glycated albumin-induced expression of TGF-\u03b2 and extracellular matrix proteins in mesangial cells and contributing to the development of diabetic nephropathy.",

As regenerative therapies continue to explore ways to control mesenchymal progenitor cells to recreate desirable tissues, it is increasingly necessary to characterize the vast nature of biological responses imposed by physical phenomena. Murine adipose-derived stromal cells (mASCs) migrated toward the cathode in direct current (DC) fields of physiologic strength and show a dose dependence of migration rate to stronger fields. Electric fields also caused mASCs to orient perpendicularly to the field vector and elicited a transient increase in cytosolic calcium. Additionally, their galvanotactic response appears to share classic chemotactic signaling pathways that are involved in the migration of other cell types. Galvanotaxis is one predominant result of electric fields on mASCs and it may be exploited to engineer adult stem cell concentrations and locations within implanted grafts or toward sites of wound repair.",

We investigated whether de novo refractoriness to the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Tzb; Herceptin) may relate to the dynamic regulation of the mesenchymal CD44pos/CD24neg/low phenotype in HER2-positive BC. We observed that the subpopulation of Tzb-refractory JIMT-1 BC cells exhibiting CD44pos/CD24neg/low-surface markers switched with time. Low-passage JIMT-1 cell cultures were found to spontaneously contain \u223c10% of cells bearing the CD44pos/CD24neg/low immunophenotype. Late-passage (>60) JIMT-1 cultures accumulated \u223c80% of CD44pos/CD24neg/low cells and closely resembled the CD44pos/CD24neg/low-enriched (\u223c85%) cell population constitutively occurring in HER2-negative MDA-MB-231 mesenchymal BC cells. Dynamic expression of mesenchymal markers was not limited to CD44/CD24 because high-passages of JIMT-1 cells exhibited also reduced expression of the HER2 protein and over-secretion of pro-invasive/metastatic chemokines and metalloproteases. Accordingly, late-passage JIMT-1 cells displayed an exacerbated migratogenic phenotype in plastic, collagen, and fibronectin substrates. Intrinsic genetic plasticity to efficiently drive the emergence of the CD44pos/CD24neg/low mesenchymal phenotype may account for de novo resistance to HER2 targeting therapies in basal-like BC carrying HER2 gene amplification.",

Using this assay we investigated the cytosol to membrane targeting of several small GTPases to compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways. We found that all Rabs tested were targeted directly to the membrane on which they reside at steady-state and not via an intermediate location as reported for Ras and Rho proteins. However, we observed that the kinetics of cytosol to membrane targeting differed for each Rab tested. Comparison of the mevastatin sensitivity and kinetics of membrane targeting of Rab23, Rab23 prenylation motif mutants and H-Ras revealed that these parameters are strongly dependent upon the prenyl transferase with Rab geranylgeranyl transferase substrates exhibiting higher sensitivity and requiring greater time to recover from mevastatin inhibition than farnesyl transferase substrates.

Clinical evaluation revealed intense phenotypic variability in Chinese WS patients. Heterochromia iridis and sensorineural hearing loss were the most frequent features (100% and 88.9%, respectively) of the two subtypes. Many brown freckles on normal skin could be a special subtype of cutaneous pigment disturbances in Chinese WS patients. PAX3, MITF, SNAI2, and SOX10 genes mutations were screened for in all the patients. A total of nine mutations in 11 families were identified and seven of them were novel. The SOX10 mutations in WS2 were first discovered in the Chinese population, with an estimated frequency similar to that of MITF mutations, implying SOX10 is an important pathogenic gene in Chinese WS2 cases and should be considered for first-step analysis in WS2, as well as MITF.",

Although its structure and physiological function in intercellular adhesion is relatively well understood, we have little information about its possible involvement in early development of vertebrates. We found Xclaudin 1 is expressed maternally in the oocyte of Xenopus laevis and the zygotic expression initiates stage 9 in the animal hemisphere but not in the vegetal hemisphere, limited on the ectoderm and mesoderm until the end of gastrulation. We have investigated a potential role for claudin 1 at gastrulation by gain and loss-of-function studies. Over-expression of Xclaudin 1 resulted in gastrulation defect in a dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of Xclaudin 1 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) blocked convergent extension, whereas ectopic expression of Xclaudin 1-myc mRNA rescued these defects. However, altered expression of Xclaudin 1 did not inhibit mesodermal gene expression. Taken together, our results suggest that Xclaudin 1 is required for proper convergent extension movement during Xenopus gastrulation.",

In addition, when the enzyme was incubated with 5% maltotriose (G3), a series of transfer products were produced. The resulting major transfer products, annotated as T1, T2, and T3, were purified and their structures were determined by TLC, MALDI-TOF/MS, 13C NMR, and enzymatic analysis.

These results indicated that MalZ transferred sugar moiety mainly to C-3 or C-6\u2013OH of glucose of the acceptor molecule. To obtain highly concentrated transfer products, the enzyme was reacted with 10% liquefied cornstarch, and then glucose and maltose were removed by immobilized yeast.

Despite a high level of sequence conservation, individual chromodomains manifest substantial differences in binding preference for methylated forms of histone H3, suggesting that posttranslational modification of the chromodomain might be an important determinant of binding specificity. We now show that mouse Cbx2 (also known as M33), a homolog of Drosophila Polycomb protein, is highly phosphorylated in some cell lines. A low-mobility band of Cbx2 observed on SDS\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was thus converted to a higher-mobility band by treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed serine-42, a conserved amino acid in the chromodomain, as a phosphorylation site of Cbx2. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 on this residue in vitro resulted in a reduced level of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-9 as well as an increase in the extent of binding to an H3 peptide containing trimethylated lysine-27, suggesting that such phosphorylation changes the binding specificity of Cbx2 for modified histone H3. Phosphorylation of the chromodomain of Cbx2 may therefore serve as a molecular switch that affects the reading of the histone modification code and thereby controls epigenetic cellular memory.",

However, the physiological conditions that modulate AIMP1\u2013gp96 interaction and cell surface expression of gp96 are not known. In this study, we investigated the process that which can modulate dissociation of AIMP1 and gp96 by using Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation. MyD88 pathway by LPS-mediated TLR4 activation induced the cell surface presentation of gp96 through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). AIMP1 was phosphorylated by JNK upon LPS stimulation and gp96 was dissociated from phosphorylated AIMP1. We further demonstrated that serine-140 residue of AIMP1 was phosphorylated by JNK and alanine mutation of serine-140 suppressed LPS-induced cell surface expression of gp96. Altogether, these results suggest that AIMP1 is phosphorylated by JNK through TLR-MyD88 pathway and lose the regulatory activity for ER retention of gp96, resulting in the increase of cell surface expression of gp96, and provide a new molecular mechanism underlying TLR-mediated gp96 regulation.",

A general limitation of in vivo applications of recombinant soluble TNF ligands is their notoriously rapid clearance from circulation.

The serum albumin-TNF ligand fusion proteins were found to be of similar bioactivity as the corresponding HSA-less counterparts. Upon intravenous injection (i.v.), serum half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins, as determined by ELISA, was around 15\u00a0h as compared to approximately 1\u00a0h for all of the recombinant control TNF ligands without HSA domain. Moreover, serum samples collected 6 or 24\u00a0h after i.v. injection still contained high TNF ligand bioactivity, demonstrating that there is only limited degradation/inactivation of circulating HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins in vivo. In a xenotransplantation model, significantly less of the HSA-TRAIL fusion protein compared to the respective control TRAIL protein was required to achieve inhibition of tumor growth indicating that the increased half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins translates into better therapeutic action in vivo.

Interestingly, the hydrophobic collapses were not stabilized by long-range tertiary interactions among the clusters that were typically observed in non-amyloidogenic unfolded states of various proteins. The lack of the long-range interactions may be a critical property of the amyloidogenic unfolded state.

CpG islands in the flanking region of the transcription start site were predominantly methylated in exponentially growing cells, resulting in silencing of Osr2 expression. In addition, CpG demethylation in quiescence caused activation of Osr2 expression, while acetylation of the H3 and H4 histones during quiescence also led to an increase in Osr2 expression. These results suggest that epigenetically regulated Osr2 plays an important role in cellular quiescence and proliferation.",

     "abstract": "It has been reported that melanocytes play important roles in skin and hair pigmentation and are differentiated from melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) residing in the bulge area of hair follicles. Recently, interest has been growing in MSCs because regulation of the upstream of differentiated melanocytes is essential for the determination of skin and hair pigmentation; however, their precise characteristics remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to explore cell-surface markers expressed on MSCs in order to understand their characteristics.To explore genes specifically expressed in the bulge region, we classified a hair follicle into four areas, hair bulb, hair bulb to bulge (lower bulge), bulge, and epidermis to bulge (upper bulge), and collected these areas from back skin sections of C57BL/6 mice by laser microdissection. Real-time RT-PCR performed on these areas revealed that Frizzled (Fzd)-4, Fzd7, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5), and Lrp6, receptors for Wnt molecules, were expressed higher in the bulge area than other areas. Furthermore, FACS analysis showed that populations of Fzd4+ cells and Fzd7+ cells were different from those of Kit+ cells (precursor of melanocytes: melanoblasts). Fzd4+ and Fzd7+ cells isolated by FACS required a longer culture period to differentiate into mature melanocytes than Kit+ cells. Up-regulation of mRNA expressions of melanocyte markers (dopa chrometautomerase: Dct, tyrosinase: Tyr, tyrosinase-related protein 1: Tyrp1) was observed in Fzd4+ and Fzd7+ cells following Kit+ cells during differentiation. These results suggested that Fzd4+ and Fzd7+ cells were more immature than melanoblasts, therefore raising the possibility that Fzd4+ and Fzd7+ cells are MSCs.",

Utilizing in-vitro assay, we found only ALDHhigh AdCC cells have tumorsphere-forming ability in anchorage-independent cultures. Finally, we showed ALDHhigh AdCC cells possess highly invasive capability and are responsible for mediating metastasis.

In this study we investigated whether an NO-induced pathway can enhance the ability of the melanocyte to respond to \u03b1-MSH on melanogenesis in alpaca skin melanocytes in vitro. It is important for us to know how to enhance the coat color of alpaca. We set up three groups for experiments using the third passage number of alpaca melanocytes: the control cultures were allowed a total of 5\u00a0days growth; the UV group cultures like the control group but the melanocytes were then irradiated everyday (once) with 312\u00a0mJ/cm2 of UVB; the UV\u00a0+\u00a0L-NAME group is the same as group UV but has the addition of 300\u00a0\u03bcM L-NAME (every 6\u00a0h). To determine the inhibited effect of NO produce, NO produces were measured. To determine the effect of the NO to the key protein and gene of \u03b1-MSH pathway on melanogenesis, the key gene and protein of the \u03b1-MSH pathway were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and Western immunoblotting. The results provide exciting new evidence that NO can enhance \u03b1-MSH pathway in alpaca skin melanocytes by elevated MC1R. And we suggest that the NO pathway may more rapidly cause the synthesis of melanin in alpaca skin under UV, which at that time elevates the expression of MC1R and stimulates the keratinocytes to secrete \u03b1-MSH to enhance the \u03b1-MSH pathway on melanogenesis.

We first constructed the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter-driven expression vectors, each of which expresses microRNA mir-30-mimicked shRNA specifically targeting X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), Akt, or Bcl-2. Adenovirus harbouring each shRNA expression cassette silenced corresponding target gene expression. Using these mono-cistronic shRNA cassettes, we again constructed the CMV promoter-driven expression vector, into which multi-cistronic shRNAs for XIAP, Akt and Bcl-2 in order were cloned. Adenovirus delivering this multi-cistronic expression cassette silenced each of the target genes as effectively as adenovirus containing individual shRNA did. Our data indicate that single promoter-driven multi-cistronic shRNAs effectively silence multiple target genes.

Mutation of several putative di-acidic ER export motifs in the carboxyl-tail of the receptor revealed no apparent defect in cell surface expression. Truncated mutants lacking most of the carboxyl-terminal sequences or all intracellular domains also showed no impairment in cell surface expression at steady state. A truncated receptor containing only the large amino-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD) is secreted into the culture medium and Sar1H79G inhibits this secretion.

The mammalian LIM protein Ajuba is a well-studied centrosomal protein that regulates cell division but its role in ciliogenesis is unknown. In this study, we isolated the medaka homolog of Ajuba and showed that Ajuba localizes to basal bodies of cilia in growth-arrested cells. Knockdown of Ajuba resulted in randomized left\u2013right organ asymmetries and altered expression of early genes responsible for left\u2013right body axis determination.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1\u03b1) is a multi-functional coactivator that is involved in the regulation of cardiac mitochondrial functional capacity and cellular energy metabolism. However, the regulation of PGC-1\u03b1 in cardiac Ca2+ signaling has not been fully elucidated. To address this issue, we combined confocal line-scan imaging with off-line imaging processing to characterize calcium signaling in cultured adult rat ventricular myocytes expressing PGC-1\u03b1 via adenoviral transduction. Our data shows that overexpressing PGC-1\u03b1 improved myocyte contractility without increasing the amplitude of Ca2+ transients, suggesting that myofilament sensitivity to Ca2+ increased. Interestingly, the decay kinetics of global Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ waves accelerated in PGC-1\u03b1-expressing cells, but the decay rate of caffeine-elicited Ca2+ transients showed no significant change. This suggests that sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a), but not Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX) contribute to PGC-1\u03b1-induced cytosolic Ca2+ clearance. Furthermore, PGC-1\u03b1 induced the expression of SERCA2a in cultured cardiac myocytes. Importantly, overexpressing PGC-1\u03b1 did not disturb cardiac Ca2+ homeostasis, because SR Ca2+ load and the propensity for Ca2+ waves remained unchanged. These data suggest that PGC-1\u03b1 can ameliorate cardiac Ca2+ cycling and improve cardiac work output in response to physiological stress. Unraveling the PGC-1\u03b1-calcium handing pathway sheds new light on the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the therapy of cardiac diseases.",

Cultured cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), a potent inducer of both Nox and NF-\u03baB, up to 24\u00a0h.

In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of the conjugation of Dox to Pen in term of apoptosis induction. When tested on CHO cells, Dox\u2013Pen generated a typical apoptotic phenotype but at lower dose that needed for unconjugated Dox.

These cells also have abilities to differentiate into three germ layers in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, no chromosomal abnormalities are found even after sequential passage. Therefore this system will dramatically simplify genetic engineering of these human pluripotent stem cells or defining process of their signal pathway.",

In this study, we elaborated a structural explanation for this auto-inhibitory effect of IQ2 on myosin function. We employed analytical ultracentrifugation, circular dichroism, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy to investigate structural and functional properties of a myosin heavy chain (MYH) head-rod fragment aa664\u2013915. MYH664\u2013915 was monomeric, adopted a closed shape, and bound essential myosin light chains (HIS-MLC-1) with low affinity to IQ1. Deletion of IQ2, however opened MYH664\u2013915. Four amino acids present in IQ2 could be identified to be responsible for this auto-inhibitory structural effect: alanine mutagenesis of I814, Q815, R819, and W827 stretched MYH664\u2013915 and increased 30-fold the binding affinity of HIS-MLC-1 to IQ1. In this study we show, that denuded IQ2 favours a closed conformation of myosin with a low HIS-MLC-1 binding affinity. The collapsed structure of myosin with denuded IQ2 could explain the auto-inhibitory effects of IQ2 on enzymatic activity of myosin.",

     "abstract": "LOX, the principal enzyme involved in crosslinking of collagen, was the first of several lysyl oxidase isotypes to be characterized. Its active form was believed to be exclusively extracellular. Active LOX was later reported to be present in cell nuclei; its function there is unknown. LOX expression opposes the effect of mutationally activated Ras, which is present in about 30% of human cancers. The mechanism of LOX in countering the action of Ras is also unknown. In the present work, assessment of nuclear protein for possible effects of lysyl oxidase activity led to the discovery that proliferating cells dramatically increase their nuclear protein content when exposed to BAPN (\u03b2-aminopropionitrile), a highly specific lysyl oxidase inhibitor that reportedly blocks LOX inhibition of Ras-induced oocyte maturation. In three cell types (PC12 cells, A7r5 smooth muscle cells, and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts), BAPN caused a 1.8-, 1.7-, and 2.1-fold increase in total nuclear protein per cell, respectively, affecting all major components in both nuclear matrix and chromatin fractions. Since nuclear size is correlated with proliferative status, enzyme activity restricting nuclear growth may be involved in the lysyl oxidase tumor suppressive effect. Evidence is also presented for the presence of apparent lysyl oxidase isotype(s) containing a highly conserved LOX active site sequence in the nuclei of PC12 cells, which do not manufacture extracellular lysyl oxidase substrates. Results reported here support the hypothesis that nuclear lysyl oxidase regulates nuclear growth, and thereby modulates cell proliferation.",

Here, we address the role of BMP6, Smad1, Smad2 and APT mRNA and protein expression in hMDDCs obtained from Ortho\u00a0+\u00a0SS patients, employing RT-PCR, qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Interestingly, we observed that SCD pathology exhibited significantly up-regulated expression of those signaling components at the level of mRNA and protein. Furthermore, exogenous BMP6 induced apoptosis was observed to be significantly associated in Ortho\u00a0+\u00a0SS complication and markedly increased the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis as compared to healthy group. Interestingly, the non-stimulated cells have shown higher apoptotic nuclei percentage than the stimulated cells in pathological condition. Thus, expression of BMP-SMAD signaling components augments apoptosis and up regulates the transcription of these genes and it suggests that induction is due to transcriptional regulation. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that BMP-SMAD signaling components along with APT were over expressed, mediates apoptosis and may play an important role in the SCD pathology with orthopedic complications.",

We have also demonstrated the presence of leptin receptor and leptin signaling in normal human trophoblastic cells, activating JAK-STAT, PI3K and MAPK pathways. In the present work we have employed dominant negative forms of MAPK and PKB constructs to find out the signaling pathways that specifically mediates the effect of leptin on protein synthesis. As previously shown, leptin stimulates protein synthesis as assessed by 3H-leucine incorporation. However, both dominant negative forms of MAPK and PKB inhibited protein synthesis in JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. The inhibition of PKB and MAPK activity by transfection with the dominant negative kinases prevented the leptin stimulation of p70 S6K, which is known to be an important kinase in the regulation of protein synthesis. Moreover, leptin stimulation of phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and EIF4E, which allows the initiation of translation was also prevented by MAPK and PI3K dominant negative constructs. Therefore, these results demonstrate that both PI3K and MAPK are necessary to observe the effect of leptin signaling that mediates protein synthesis in choriocarcinoma cells JEG-3.",

To elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which AMPK regulates glucose and fat metabolism, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its interacting partners. A yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen a mouse embryo cDNA library for proteins able to bind mouse AMPK\u03b11. We also demonstrated an endogenous interaction between AMPK\u03b11 and its interacting partner by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins using specific antibodies in HepG2 cells, and in rat kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, and fat tissue. We show that secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is an AMPK-interacting protein, and the two proteins enhance each other. AMPK activation increases SPARC expression, and knockdown of AMPK to inhibit endogenous AMPK expression reduces SPARC protein levels. On the other hand, SPARC siRNA reduces AICAR-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation. SPARC affects AMPK-mediated glucose metabolism through regulation of Glut4 expression in L6 myocytes. Our findings suggest that SPARC may be involved in regulating glucose metabolism via AMPK activation.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in cellular glucose and lipid homeostasis. We found that ascofuranone improves ER stress-induced insulin resistance by activating AMPK through the LKB1 pathway. In L6 myotube cells, ascofuranone treatment increased the phosphorylation of the Thr-172 residue of the AMPK\u03b1 subunit and the Ser-79 subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and cellular glucose uptake. Ascofuranone-induced phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was not increased in A549 cells lacking LKB1.

These effects were all reversed by pretreatment with Compound C, an AMPK inhibitor or with adenoviral-mediated dominant-negative AMPK\u03b12.

In the present study, we performed a survey of avian influenza virus in ostriches and H5N1 virus (A/Ostrich/SuZhou/097/03, China097) was isolated. This H5N1 virus is highly pathogenic to both chickens and mice. It is also able to replicate in the lungs of, and to cause death in, BALB/c mice following intranasal administration. It forms plaques in chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells in the absence of trypsin. The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus is genetically similar to A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96(H5N1) and belongs to clade 0. The HA sequence contains multiple basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site, a motif associated with HPAI viruses.

Hypertrophy was induced by banding of the ascending aorta of male rats. After 14\u00a0days, the heart left ventricle weight relative to body weight of animals with aortic banding had increased 65% compared to matched control rats. Furthermore, RNA was extracted from left ventricles and reverse transcription qPCR showed that expression of the hypertrophic markers atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide was highly induced in animals with aortic banding.Out of 13 miRs that have previously been reported to be associated with late-stage pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy and heart failure only four (miR-23a, miR-27b, miR-125b and miR-195) were induced during early hypertrophic growth. These miRs were previously associated with angiogenesis and cell growth and their expression in early hypertrophic growth was accompanied by a twofold upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D2 that is a marker of cardiac growth.Our results indicate that different miRNAs are involved in early hypertrophic growth than in late stage pressure-overload induced heart failure.",

Two adaptors which function as negative regulators of T cell activation are ALX and LAX. ALX constitutively associates with LAX in T cells, and T cells from mice deficient in ALX and LAX display similar hyper-responsiveness upon T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 stimulation, including increased production of interleukin-2. During T cell activation, ALX is inducibly phosphorylated, however the site of ALX phosphorylation had not been previously identified and the role of phosphorylation in the inhibitory function of ALX was not known. Here, using mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that ALX is phosphorylated on a serine at position 318. Substitution of alanine for serine at this position (ALX S318A) leads to an abrogation of the mobility shift in ALX induced upon TCR/CD28 stimulation. However, ALX S318A retained the ability to bind to and stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of LAX. In addition, overexpression of ALX S318A inhibited RE/AP activation upon TCR/CD28 stimulation to a similar extent as wild-type ALX. Therefore, although ALX is inducibly phosphorylated upon TCR/CD28 stimulation, this phosphorylation is not required for ALX to inhibit T cell activation.",

Further, we found that H2O2, one type of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accelerated autofluorescence enhancement under both continuous and pulsed UVI. In contrast, continuous and pulsed visible light did not result in erythrocyte autofluorescence enhancement in the presence or absence of H2O2.

A series of mutant actin genes in which glycine residues in actin were systematically substituted by valine residues were constructed, and were expressed individually in yeast cells that carry a wild-type endogenous actin gene. Six dominant negative actin mutations were identified on the basis of growth inhibition. Among them, G146V mutation was chosen for further biochemical analysis because the Gly146 residue is located at the strategic hinge position connecting the large and small domains of an actin molecule. We found that G146V actin filaments hardly bind cofilin, consistent with a previous suggestion that cofilin binding causes conformational changes of actin around Gly146 (Galkin et al. [3]). Notably, copolymer that consists of 1:10 mixture of the mutant and wild-type actin molecules showed significantly reduced affinity for cofilin, suggesting that G146V mutant actin affects the conformation of neighboring wild-type actin within a filament, and inhibits cofilin binding.",

Although this x-linked muscle disease is extremely progressive, not all subtypes of skeletal muscles are affected in the same way. While extremities and trunk muscles are drastically weakened, extraocular muscles are usually spared in Duchenne patients. In order to determine the global protein expression pattern in these naturally protected muscles we have performed a comparative proteomic study of the established mdx mouse model of x-linked muscular dystrophy. Fluorescence difference in-gel electrophoretic analysis of 9-week-old dystrophin-deficient versus age-matched normal extraocular muscle, using a pH 4\u20137 gel range, identified out of 1088 recognized protein spots a moderate expression change in only seven protein species. Desmin, apolipoprotein A-I binding protein and perilipin-3 were found to be increased and gelsolin, gephyrin, transaldolase, and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase were shown to be decreased in mdx extraocular muscles. Immunoblotting revealed a drastic up-regulation of utrophin, comparable levels of \u03b2-dystroglycan and key Ca2+-regulatory elements, and an elevated concentration of small stress proteins in mdx extraocular muscles. This suggests that despite the lack of dystrophin only a limited number of cellular systems are perturbed in mdx extraocular muscles, probably due to the substitution of dystrophin by its autosomal homolog. Utrophin appears to prevent the loss of dystrophin-associated proteins and Ca2+-handling elements in extraocular muscle tissue. Interestingly, the adaptive mechanisms that cause the sparing of extraocular fibers seem to be closely linked to an enhanced cellular stress response.",

Although sequences for two alternative splice variants of the human GPR120 receptor have been reported, there have been no studies which directly compare the signaling of these isoforms. We have identified an additional 16 amino acid gap containing four phospho-labile serine/threonine residues which is localized to the third intracellular loop of the GPR120-long (GPR120-L) isoform. Based on this finding, we hypothesized that the agonist-stimulated phosphorylation profiles of this isoform would be distinct from that of the short isoform (GPR120-S). Using a clonal HEK293 cell model, we examined agonist-mediated phosphorylation of GPR120-S and GPR120-L with the omega-3 fatty acids \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Our results show rapid phosphorylation of both isoforms following agonism by either ALA or DHA. Moreover, we show no significant difference in the degree or rate of phosphorylation of both isoforms upon agonism with either ALA or DHA, suggesting that the additional gap in the longer variant is not phosphorylated. Importantly, our results demonstrate that the shorter variant exhibits significantly more pronounced basal phosphorylation in the absence of agonist, suggesting that the additional gap in the long variant may contribute to masking of constitutive phosphorylation sites. These are the first results which demonstrate specific phosphorylation of GPR120 isoforms upon agonism by free fatty acids and the first which distinguish the phosphorylation profiles of the two GPR120 isoforms.",

We found that when ngn-3 was inhibited in an E11.5 pancreas, using either morpholino antisense or siRNA, it led to a significant decrease in endocrine differentiation after seven days in culture. Endocrine differentiation was rescued when ngn-3 inhibition was withdrawn after three days of culture, suggesting that the embryonic pancreas retains progenitor cells with the ability to differentiate into endocrine cell types when ngn-3 expression recurs. To determine whether the rescue phenomenon observed after withdrawing ngn-3 antisense treatment was the result of the original endocrine-committed cells reinitiating endocrine differentiation, or was instead due to new recruitment of later progenitor cells, we blocked ngn-3 expression for only the last four days of a seven-day culture. Here, insulin-positive differentiation was slightly reduced, but there was a normal number of glucagon-positive cells. In addition, there was an increase in SOX9-positive cells in ngn-3 inhibited, as well as in ngn-3 rescued pancreata, with a significant proportion of these SOX9-positive cells co-localized with DBA, an early ductal marker. This increased number of cells with co-localization of SOX9 and DBA could indicate an increased number of endocrine progenitor cells.",

Treatment with sildenafil for 8\u00a0days significantly promoted adipogenesis characterized by increased lipid droplet and triglyceride content in 3T3L1 cells. Meanwhile, sildenafil induced a pronounced up-regulation of the expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as aP2 and GLUT4. The results by RT-PCR and Western blotting further showed that sildenafil increased the sequential expression of C/EBP\u03b2, PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1. Additionally, we found that the other two PDE5 inhibitors (vardenafil and tadalafil) and the cGMP analog 8-pCPT-cGMP also increased adipogenesis. Likewise, 8-pCPT-cGMP could up-regulate the expression of adipogenic and adipocyte-specific genes. Importantly, the PKG inhibitor Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP was able to inhibit both sildenafil and 8-pCPT-cGMP-induced adipogenesis. Furthermore, sildenafil promoted basal and insulin-mediated glucose uptake in 3T3L1 cells, which was counteracted by Rp-8-pCPT-cGMP.

UV irradiation of squamous cell carcinoma cells induced up-regulation of gene expression of chemokine BRAK/CXCL14, stimulated p38 phosphorylation, and down-regulated the phosphorylation of ERK. Human p38 MAPKs exist in 4 isoforms: p38\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 and \u03b4. The UV stimulation of p38 phosphorylation was not inhibited by the presence of SB203580 or PD169316, inhibitors of p38\u03b1 and \u03b2, suggesting p38 phosphorylation was not dependent on these 2 isoforms and that p38\u03b3 and/or \u03b4 was responsible for the phosphorylation. In fact, inhibition of each of these 4 p38 isoforms by the introduction of short hairpin (sh) RNAs for respective isoforms revealed that only shRNA for p38\u03b4 attenuated the UV-induced up-regulation of BRAK/CXCL14 gene expression. In addition, over-expression of p38 isoforms in the cells showed the association of p38\u03b4 with ERK1 and 2, concomitant with down-regulation of ERK phosphorylation. The usage of p38\u03b4 isoform by UV irradiation is not merely due to the abundance of this p38 isoform in the cells. Because serum deprivation of the cells also induced an increase in BRAK/CXCL14 gene expression, and in this case p38\u03b1 and/or \u03b2 isoform is responsible for up-regulation of BRAK/CXCL14 gene expression. Taken together, the data indicate that the respective stress-dependent action of p38 isoforms is responsible for the up-regulation of the gene expression of the chemokine BRAK/CXCL14.",

Here we report the effects of A769662, a pharmacological activator of AMPK, on cytoskeletal organization and signalling in epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. We show that AMPK activation induced shortening or radiation of stress fibers, uncoupling from paxillin and predominance of cortical F-actin. In parallel, Rho-kinase downstream targets, namely myosin regulatory light chain and cofilin, were phosphorylated. These effects resembled the morphological changes in MDCK cells exposed to hyperosmotic shock, which led to Ca2+-dependent AMPK activation via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-\u03b2(CaMKK\u03b2), a known upstream kinase of AMPK. Indeed, hypertonicity-induced AMPK activation was markedly reduced by the STO-609 CaMKK\u03b2 inhibitor, as was the increase in MLC and cofilin phosphorylation. We suggest that AMPK links osmotic stress to the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.",

The secretion of IL-12p70 was significantly reduced in the siNDRG2 introduced DC cells. The intracellular signaling of IL-10 secretion was markedly inhibited by SB203580, inhibitor of p38 MAPK, in the LPS-activated DCs and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was decreased in the NDRG2 introduced U937 cells under PMA-stimulation. Taken together, NDRG2 might have a pivotal role as one of intrinsic factors for the modulation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and subsequently involve in controlling of IL-10 production.",

Therefore, we expressed N-terminal ZAP (NZAP, 254 amino acids) in E. coli as a fusion protein with several different cleavage sites and protein tags. Cleaved ZAP in soluble form strongly bound to RNA through its four CCCH zinc-finger motifs. Here, we provide evidence indicating that ZAP directly interacted with viral RNA.

When mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with KML-C, both transcription and translation of TLR4 were upregulated. KML-C-induced TLR4 downstream events were similar to those activated by LPS: the upregulation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1); resulting in macrophage activation and TNF-\u03b1 production. When TLR4 was blocked using a TLR4-specific neutralizing antibody, TNF-\u03b1 production from the macrophages was significantly inhibited. Moreover, TLR4-deficient mouse macrophages treated with KML-C also secreted greatly reduced level of TNF-\u03b1 secretion. Finally, TLR4 molecules were co-precipitated with KML-C, to which agarose beads were conjugated, indicating that those molecules are associated.

Previous studies suggested the importance of two histidine residues for the taste-modifying activity of miraculin. In this work, we have conducted molecular dynamics simulations on wild type miraculin and on three mutated dimers (H29A, H59A and H29A/H59A) both at neutral and acidic pH to investigate the structural and functional role of these two His residues. Our results suggested that at acidic pH the presence of two charged His at the interface induced a structural rearrangement of the two monomers, thus leading to their relative opening and the following adaptation of their conformation to the receptor surface. On the other hand the simulations on three mutants showed that the mutated dimers had a closed form, and highlighted the important role of H29 in stabilizing/destabilizing the dimer arrangement and also a cooperative effect of the two histidines.",

In particular, the potential role of TRAIL in type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been studied by several research groups. A previous study found that TRAIL did not have significant cytotoxic effects on the insulin-secreting pancreatic \u03b2 cell line, INS-1. However, the mechanism was not clear. Here we demonstrate that INS-1 cells are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis and show alteration in the expression of death and decoy receptors upon TRAIL treatment. To compare TRAIL-resistant INS-1 cells with TRAIL-sensitive cells, we utilized U87MG cells, which are known to be TRAIL-sensitive. TRAIL treatment showed NF-\u03baB translocation to the nucleus in TRAIL-resistant INS-1 cells, and TRAIL-induced NF-\u03baB activation was preceded by I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. A pharmacological inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, Bay 11-7082, blocked TRAIL-induced NF-\u03baB translocation to the nucleus and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Four related receptors bind TRAIL: two death receptors (DR4 and DR5) that promote apoptosis, and two decoy receptors (DcR1 and DcR2) that act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In the present study, TRAIL treatment in INS-1 cells upregulated DcR1 and downregulated DR5 without altering the expression of DcR2 and DR4. The resistance to apoptosis in INS-1 cells might therefore, be a consequence of DcR1 upregulation and DR5 downregulation, and the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, could regulate the sensitivity of cells to TRAIL by controlling the ratio of decoy to death receptors. Thus, TRAIL may play an important role in the survival of pancreatic \u03b2 cells by regulating receptor expression in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner.",

Thrombin not only elevated transcripts for IL-6, CXCL8, and CCL11 genes but also enhanced release of IL-6 and CXCL8 protein from human aortic smooth muscle cell (HAoSMC).

     "abstract": "The contraction of adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes is triggered by the influx of Ca2+ ions through sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs). However, the gating properties of unitary LCCs under physiologic conditions have remained elusive. Towards this end, we investigated the voltage-dependence of the gating kinetics of unitary LCCs, with a physiologic concentration of Ca2+ ions permeating the channel. Unitary LCC currents were recorded with 2\u00a0mM external Ca2+ ions (in the absence of LCC agonists), using cell-attached patches on K-depolarized adult rat ventricular myocytes. The voltage-dependence of the peak probability of channel opening (Po vs. Vm) displayed a maximum value of 0.3, a midpoint of \u221212\u00a0mV, and a slope factor of 8.5. The maximum value for Po of the unitary LCC was significantly higher than previously assumed, under physiologic conditions. We also found that the mean open dwell time of the unitary LCC increased twofold with depolarization, ranging from 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0ms at \u221230\u00a0mV to 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0ms at 0\u00a0mV. The increase in mean LCC open time with depolarization counterbalanced the decrease in the single LCC current amplitude; the latter due to the decrease in driving force for Ca2+ ion entry. Thus, the average amount of Ca2+ ions entering through an individual LCC opening (\u223c300\u2013400 ions) remained relatively constant over this range of potentials. These novel results establish the voltage-dependence of unitary LCC gating kinetics using a physiologic Ca2+ ion concentration. Moreover, they provide insight into local Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and a more accurate basis for mathematical modeling of excitation\u2013contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes.",

     "abstract": "Fat cell accumulation in skeletal muscle is a major characteristic of various disorders, such as obesity, sarcopenia and dystrophies. Moreover, these fat cells could be involved in muscle homeostasis regulation as previously described for adipocytes in bone marrow. Despite recent advances on the topic, no clearly characterized mouse model is currently available to study fat accumulation within skeletal muscle. Here, we report a detailed characterization of a mouse model of skeletal muscle fat cell accumulation after degeneration induced by intra-muscular injection of glycerol. Information is provided on the kinetics of degeneration/fat deposition, including the quantity of fat deposited based on various parameters such as glycerol concentration, age, sex and strain of mice. Finally, these fat cells are characterized as true white adipocytes morphologically and molecularly. Our study shows that the mouse adipocyte accumulation within skeletal muscle after glycerol degeneration is a reproducible, transposable and easy model to use. This mouse model should allow a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of adipocyte accumulation in skeletal muscle pathophysiology.",

We examined genes that are expressed less in ICC-deficient W/W mice than in wild type (WT) at embryonic day 14 (E14) in order to clarify the genes associated with the ICC development using subtractive hybridization and microarray. Among them, we identified msh-like 2 (msx2) and neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 (ntrk2). Using real-time PCR, msx2 and ntrk2 were found to be expressed at significantly lower levels in W/W than in WT during embryogenesis. Msx2 immunoreactivity was high in the WT small intestine. These data suggest that the gene expressions of ntrk2 and msx2 were significantly suppressed in KIT mutant mouse embryo and neonate and that these genes are likely to regulate ICC development.",

Natural antisense transcripts (NATs), as a new member of regulatory RNAs, occur ubiquitously in prokaryote and eukaryote, and play significant roles in physiological or pathological processes. NATs, mostly non-coding RNAs, are involved in transcriptional interference, genomic imprinting, X inactivation, RNA editing, translational regulation, RNA export, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and so on. NATs regulate gene expression through direct interaction with the sense transcripts or indirect interaction with other targets, such as DNA methyltransferases, histone acetylases and histone deacetylases. There may be a direct link among NATs, DNA methylaton and histone modifications. Through formation of sense\u2013antisense duplex structures, NATs exert a widespread impact on conventional gene expression at the mRNA and/or protein level and regulate sense transcripts in a concordant or discordant manner.

Methods and results: We observed that metformin significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels induced by PA. Additionally, metformin increased the expression of the antioxidant thioredoxin (Trx), which mediated metformin\u2019s effects on ROS reduction. Metformin increased Trx expression through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Metformin-regulated Trx at the transcriptional level and forkhead transcription factor 3 (FOXO3) was involved in this process.

The mRNA sequence of Atlantic salmon MAFbx-\u03b1 is 1698 nucleotides long including a 134\u00a0bp 5\u2032 UTR and 1065\u00a0bp coding sequence which encodes a 355 amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 41,657\u00a0Da and pI 8.74. Two different 3\u2032 UTRs were identified of 495 and 314\u00a0bp in length. MAFbx-\u03b2 is produced by the removal of the 116\u00a0bp exon 2 from MAFbx-\u03b1, resulting in a frame shift mutation and introduction of a premature stop codon. In contrast to mammals, MAFbx-\u03b1 and \u03b2 were ubiquitously expressed in all salmon tissues examined. In vivo, expression was 600-fold (MAFbx-\u03b1) and 200-fold (MAFbx-\u03b2) higher in fasted individuals than following 21\u00a0days refeeding to satiation. In primary myogenic cell cultures, MAFbx-\u03b1 mRNA was highest in differentiated myotubes while MAFbx-\u03b2 mRNA had peak expression in mono-nucleated cells. Starving cells of serum and amino acids resulted in a 6-fold increase in MAFbx-\u03b1, whereas MAFbx-\u03b2 remained similar to control levels. In starved cells, MAFbx-\u03b1 mRNA levels declined in response to amino acid, IGF-I and IGF-II treatments whereas MAFbx-\u03b2 levels only decreased in response to IGF-I.

     "abstract": "Chemokine receptors control leukocyte chemotaxis and cell\u2013cell communication but have also been associated with pathogen entry. GPR33, an orphan member of the chemokine-like receptor family, is a pseudogene in most humans. After the appearance of GPR33 in first mammalian genomes, this receptor underwent independent pseudogenization in humans, other hominoids and some rodent species. It was speculated that a likely cause of GPR33 inactivation was its interplay with a rodent\u2013hominoid-specific pathogen. Simultaneous pseudogenization in several unrelated species within the last 1 million years (myr) caused by neutral drift appears to be very unlikely suggesting selection on the GPR33 null-allele. Although there are no signatures of recent selection on human GPR33 we found a significant increase in the pseudogene allele frequency in European populations when compared with African and Asian populations. Because its role in the immune system was still hypothetical expression analysis revealed that GPR33 is highly expressed in dendritic cells (DC). Murine GPR33 expression is regulated by the activity of toll-like receptors (TLR) and AP-1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathways in cell culture and in vivo. Our data indicate an important role of GPR33 function in innate immunity which became dispensable during human evolution most likely due to past or balancing selection.",

Nerve growth factor (NGF) is known to be critical for the development and maintenance of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Our previous studies have shown that sustained activation of NGF/PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB signaling is essential for NGF-induced dor gene expression during neuronal differentiation and that the epigenetic modifications at histone 3 lysine 9 temporally correlate with the dor gene transcription. In this study, we cloned the rat dor gene promoter and identified an NGF-responsive region similar to that from the mouse dor gene promoter. We further identified p300, a known NF-\u03baB binding partner with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, to be dynamically associated with the dor gene. We also found that assembling of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at the promoter took place before NGF stimulation, indicating that p300 could only interact with preassembled Pol II at the promoter after NGF stimulation. Taken together, these results implicate that preassembly of the Pol II preinitiation complex, sustained activation of PI3K/Akt/NF-\u03baB signaling, and dynamic p300 association at the promoters sequentially is one of the mechanisms of induction of the late phase genes during NGF-induced neuronal differentiation.",

Tamoxifen (TAM) antagonizes ER\u03b1 activity and has been applied in breast cancer treatment. TAM-bound ER\u03b1 associates with nuclear receptor-corepressors. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been elucidated to result in cross-talk between growth factor and ER\u03b1 mediated signaling. We show that activated MAPK represses interaction of TAM-bound ER\u03b1 with silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and inhibits the recruitment of SMRT by ER\u03b1 to certain estrogen target genes. Blockade of MAPK signaling cascade with MEK inhibitor U0126 promotes the interaction and subsequently inhibits ER\u03b1 activity via enhanced recruitment of SMRT, leading to reduced expression of ER\u03b1 target genes. The growth rate of MCF-7 cells was decelerated when treated with both TAM and U0126. Moreover, the growth of MCF-7 cells stably expressing SMRT showed a robust repression in the presence of TAM and U0126. These results suggest that activated MAPK signaling cascade attenuates antagonist-induced recruitment of SMRT to ER\u03b1, suggesting corepressor mediates inhibition of ER\u03b1 transactivation and breast cancer cell growth by antagonist.

We previously reported that the Kv channel is regulated by glucose metabolism, particularly by MgATP. We examined whether the regulation of Kv channels is voltage-dependent and mechanistically related with phosphorylation of the channels. In rat pancreatic \u03b2-cells, suppression of glucose metabolism with low glucose concentrations of 2.8\u00a0mM or less or by metabolic inhibitors decreased the Kv2.1-channel activity at positive membrane potentials, while increased it at potentials negative to \u221210\u00a0mV, suggesting that modulation of Kv channels by glucose metabolism is voltage-dependent. Similarly, in HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant Kv2.1 channels, 0\u00a0mM but not 10\u00a0mM MgATP modulated the channel activity in a manner similar to that in \u03b2-cells. Both steady-state activation and inactivation kinetics of the channel were shifted toward the negative potential in association with the voltage-dependent modulation of the channels by cytosolic dialysis of alkaline phosphatase in \u03b2-cells. The modulation of Kv-channel current\u2013voltage relations were also observed during and after glucose-stimulated electrical excitation. These results suggest that the cellular metabolism including MgATP production and/or channel phosphorylation/dephosphorylation underlie the physiological modulation of Kv2.1 channels during glucose-induced insulin secretion.",

Consequently, it has been more important in cancer therapy to determine the molecular mechanisms that are related to cell-killing effects of anti-cancer agents or cancer resistance against them. Consequently, we examined whether abrogation of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) expression by anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) potentiates the efficacy of paclitaxel in human maxillary cancer IMC-3 cells. Here, we showed that paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was enhanced significantly by addition of ASOs for HDAC3 in cultured cells. Furthermore, paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in IMC-3 tumors transplanted in nude mice was enhanced significantly by administration of ASOs for HDAC3, thereby suppressing tumor growth.

Treatment of these cells with an anti-Thy1 monoclonal antibody inhibited proliferation more strongly than the therapeutic Ab rituximab.

Isoforms of the TAp63 subfamily show pro-apoptotic activities, whereas members of the N-terminally truncated (\u0394N) p63 subfamily have anti-apoptotic functions. We have previously shown an important role for TAp63\u03b1 in the induction of apoptosis and chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms accounting for the oncogenic role of \u0394Np63\u03b1 in HCC. \u0394Np63\u03b1 can directly interfere with the transcriptional activation function of the TA (containing the transactivation domain) isoforms of the p53 family and consequently inhibit transactivation of pro-apoptotic target genes. \u0394Np63\u03b1 negatively regulates the genes encoding for the death receptor CD95 and the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BAX. Thus, \u0394Np63\u03b1 expression in HCC interferes with both the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis activity of the TA isoforms. In addition and of clinical relevance, \u0394Np63\u03b1 inhibits activation of p53 family target genes and apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Chemotherapeutic treatment induces expression of Bax, Bim, Noxa, Puma and Perp; this is antagonized by \u0394Np63\u03b1.

     "abstract": "Chicken B cell line DT40 continuously accumulates mutations in the immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene by gene conversion and point mutation, both of which are mediated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), thereby producing an antibody (Ab) library that is useful for screening monoclonal Abs (mAbs) in vitro. We previously generated an engineered DT40 line named DT40-SW, whose AID expression can be reversibly switched on or off, and developed an in vitro Ab generation system using DT40-SW cells. To efficiently create an Ab library with sufficient diversity, higher hypermutation frequency is advantageous. To this end, we generated a novel cell line DT40-SW\u0394C, which conditionally expresses a C-terminus-truncated AID mutant lacking the nuclear export signal. The transcription level of the mutant AID gene in DT40-SW\u0394C cells was similar to that of the wild-type gene in DT40-SW cells. However, the protein level of the truncated AID mutant was less than that of the wild type. The mutant protein was enriched in the nuclei of DT40-SW\u0394C cells, although the protein might be highly susceptible to degradation. In DT40-SW\u0394C cells, both gene conversion and point mutation occurred in the IgV gene with over threefold higher frequency than in DT40-SW cells, suggesting that a lower level of the mutant AID protein was sufficient to increase mutation frequency. Thus, DT40-SW\u0394C cells may be useful for constructing Ab libraries for efficient screening of mAbs in vitro.",

In addition, the inhibition of PHD2 by hinokitiol is reversed by the addition of 2-OG and iron(II), suggesting that the underlying inhibitory mechanism involves displacement of 2-OG and a chelate formation with iron(II) at the enzyme active site by hinokitiol.

NDRG1/Cap43 is phosphorylated at serine/threonine sites in its C-terminal domain by serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). In this study, we attempted to clarify the domain or site of NDRG1/Cap43 responsible for its suppression of CXC chemokine expression in pancreatic cancer cells.

We identified genes that showed significant difference in transcript levels from long telomere-containing worms.\u00a0We examined the expression patterns of these genes and measured lifespan of the worms over-expressing each of the up-regulated genes. Most up-regulated genes, when over-expressed, extended lifespan of C. elegans. In particular, over-expression of rnh-1.3 in the intestine extended lifespan in the daf-16-dependent manner and increased stress resistance. Interestingly, genes up-regulated in long telomeric worms partially overlapped with the genes whose transcription was increased by the rde-3 mutations, and the over-expression of each of these genes also extended the longevity of worms, raising the possibility that the telomere effect may involve molecular players shared with the RNAi machinery.",

In C57BL/6 mice with CS exposure, HO-1 was greatly increased in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar inflammatory cells. In primary cultured mouse lung fibroblasts and RAW264.7 cells exposed to cigarette smoke water extract (CSE), an increase in HO-1 protein level was detected. In addition, CSE induced HO-1 expression was decreased in Egr-1 deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (Egr-1\u2212/\u2212 MEFs). Nuclear localization of EGR-1 was examined in mouse lung fibroblasts after exposure to CSE. Luciferase reporter activity assays showed that the enhancer region of the Ho-1 gene containing a proposed EGR-1 binding site was responsible for the induction of HO-1. A higher increase of alveolar mean linear intercept (Lm) was observed in lung tissues, and a larger increase in the number of total cells and monocytes/macrophages from bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was found in CS-exposed mice by loss of function of EGR-1 treatment. In summary, the present data demonstrate that EGR-1 plays a critical role in HO-1 production induced by CS.",

We first isolated and cultured rhBMSCs from female and male donors (n\u00a0=\u00a06, 2\u00a0years old), identified their sex origin by karyotype assay, and assessed their expression of nestin and CD34 at passage 1 and 10.

After induction, the neurogenic potential of these cells was assessed by morphological observation and protein expression analysis of neural markers, including class III \u03b2-tubulin, neurofilament light polypeptide, tau, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter. Furthermore, GABA content was assayed using high-pressure liquid chromatography. The results showed that F-rhBMSCs produced significantly more nestin-positive cells compared with M-rhBMSCs at P10 and that nestin-positive F-rhBMSCs acquired higher neurogenic potential accompanied by increased synthesis and excretion of GABA compared with nestin-positive M-rhBMSCs under conditions of differentiation. These results indicated that gender may play an important role in the neurogenic potential of BMSCs, and a further understanding of the cellular biology underlying these differences may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for neurological repair and regeneration.",

Moreover, there was positive three-way interaction among maternal hypoxia, high-fat diet and postnatal hypoxia on MBP, NF-H+L or GFAP expression (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The current study examined whether transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) activity contributes to Egr-1 binding to the OPN promoter, and whether other signaling pathways act downstream of OPN to regulate Egr-1 expression. ChIP assays using an anti-Egr-1 antibody showed that amplification of the OPN promoter sequence decreased in TGF-\u03b2 DNA enzyme-transfected VSMCs relative to control VSMCs. Treatment of VSMCs with PD98059 (ERK inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), or SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) significantly inhibited OPN-induced Egr-1 expression, and PD98059 treatment was associated with the most significant decrease in Egr-1 expression. OPN-stimulated VSMC cell migration was inhibited by SP600125 or SB203580, but not by PD98059. Furthermore, MTT assays showed that OPN-mediated cell proliferation was inhibited by PD98059, but not by SP600125 or SB203580. Taken together, the results of the current study show that Egr-1 binding to the OPN promoter is positively regulated by TGF-\u03b2, and that the p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK pathways are involved in OPN-mediated Egr-1 upregulation.",

We performed a series of experiments in C2C12 muscle cells to determine the role of palmitate and an inflammatory state in regulation of PTP1B. Palmitate (0.75\u00a0mM) induced PTP1B mRNA and protein level only at 16\u00a0h. The combination of palmitate and macrophages, accompanied by a great increase of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the culture media, additively caused a higher level of PTP1B protein levels in the muscle. Higher concentrations of palmitate reduced insulin stimulated glucose uptake in myotubes. A specific inhibitor of PTP1B partly increased insulin stimulated glucose uptake in palmitate treated cells. In conclusion, our results showing the additive influence of palmitate and the inflammatory state in the expression of PTP1B imply the involvement of these factors in the overexpression of PTP1B in insulin resistance state.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from ERR\u03b1 deficient mice and their differentiation capacities were compared to that of the wild-type cells. ERR\u03b1 deficient cultures displayed reduced cellular proliferation, osteoblastic differentiation, and mineralization. In the complementary experiment, overexpression of ERR\u03b1 in MC3T3-E1 cells increased the expression of osteoblastic markers and mineralization. Alterations in the expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP) may at least partially explain the effects on mineralization as BSP expression was reduced in ERR\u03b1 deficient MSCs and enhanced upon ERR\u03b1 overexpression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter construct driven by the BSP promoter was efficiently transactivated by ERR\u03b1.

We hypothesize that VEGFA may be a potential candidate gene associated with the spectrum of LVOTO lesions. However, it remains unclear whether the VEGFA gene is responsible for the development of LVOTO malformations. In this study, we identified three exon mutations in the VEGFA gene in three of 192 nonsyndromic LVOTO patients, and the overall mutation frequency was 1.6% (3/192). The c.454C>T (p.Arg152X) nonsense mutation and c.19_22dupGACA (p.Thr8ArgfsX78) internal tandem duplication mutation each introduced a premature stop codon and are predicted to produce a truncated VEGFA protein. The c.998G>A missense mutation changes a highly conserved arginine to a glutamine at residue 333 (p.Arg333Gln). These mutations were carried by some family members, and average penetrance was 33.3%. The present study suggests, for the first time to our knowledge, that VEGFA mutations may be associated with congenital LVOTO malformations. We provide evidence that LVOTO is likely oligogenic.",

However, the mechanism behind the effect of DHEA on VSMC is not clear. Previously we reported that low molecular weight-protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMW-PTP) dephosphorylates PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-\u03b2 via a redox-dependent mechanism involving glutathione (GSH)/glutaredoxin (GRX)1. Here we demonstrate that the redox regulation of PDGFR-\u03b2 is involved in the effect of DHEA on VSMC. DHEA suppressed the PDGF-BB-dependent phosphorylation of PDGFR-\u03b2. As expected, DHEA increased the levels of GSH and GRX1, and the GSH/GRX1 system maintained the redox state of LMW-PTP. Down-regulation of the expression of LMW-PTP using siRNA restored the suppression of PDGFR-\u03b2-phosphorylation by DHEA. A promoter analysis of GRX1 and \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (\u03b3-GCS), a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH synthesis, showed that DHEA up-regulated the transcriptional activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) response element, suggesting PPAR\u03b1 plays a role in the induction of GRX1 and \u03b3-GCS expression by DHEA. In conclusion, the redox regulation of PDGFR-\u03b2 is involved in the suppressive effect of DHEA on VSMC proliferation through the up-regulation of GSH/GRX system.",

To take advantage of this altered metabolome, 3-bromopyruvate (BrPA) was used to overcome the notorious resistance of melanoma to cell death. Using four melanoma cell lines, BrPA triggered caspase independent necrosis in two lines, whilst the other two lines were resistant to killing. Mechanistically, sensitive cells differed from resistant cells by; constitutively lower levels of glutathione, reduction of glutathione by BrPA only in sensitive cells; increased superoxide anion reactive oxygen species, loss of outer mitochondrial membrane permeability, and rapid ATP depletion. Sensitive cell killing was blocked by N-acetylcysteine or glutathione. When glutathione levels were reduced in resistant cell lines, they became sensitive to killing by BrPA. Taken together, these results identify a metabolic-based Achilles\u2019 heel in melanoma cells to be exploited by use of BrPA.

The effects were examined in HepG2 cells transfected with a plasmid containing 1.3-fold HBV genome.

Southern blot analysis showed that the replicative intermediates of HBV in the cells were also inhibited. It was confirmed that GW9662, an antagonist of PPAR\u03b3, reduced the suppressive effect of rosiglitazone on HBV. Moreover, rosiglitazone showed a synergistic effect on HBV replication with lamivudine or interferon-\u03b1-2b.

     "abstract": "We have recently shown that stimulation of cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes with endothelin-1 (ET-1) first produces conformational disorder within the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and diastolic Ca2+ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), then develops hypertrophy (HT) in the cardiomyocytes (Hamada et al., 2009 [3]). The present paper addresses the following question. By what mechanism does crosstalk between defective operation of RyR2 and activation of the HT gene program occur? Here we show that the immuno-stain of calmodulin (CaM) is localized chiefly in the cytoplasmic area in the control cells; whereas, in the ET-1-treated/hypertrophied cells, major immuno-staining is localized in the nuclear region. In addition, fluorescently labeled CaM that has been introduced into the cardiomyocytes using the BioPORTER system moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus with the development of HT. The immuno-confocal imaging of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) also shows cytoplasm-to-nucleus shift of the immuno-staining pattern in the hypertrophied cells. In an early phase of hypertrophic growth, the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients increases, which accompanies with cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of CaM. In a later phase of hypertrophic growth, further increase in the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients results in the appearance of trains of Ca2+ spikes, which accompanies with nuclear translocation of CaMKII. The cardio-protective reagent dantrolene (the reagent that corrects the de-stabilized inter-domain interaction within the RyR2 to a normal mode) ameliorates aberrant intracellular Ca2+ events and prevents nuclear translocation of both CaM and CaMKII, then prevents the development of HT. These results suggest that translocation of CaM and CaMKII from the cytoplasm to the nucleus serves as messengers to transmit the pathogenic signal elicited in the surface membrane and in the RyR2 to the nuclear transcriptional sites to activate HT program.",

Various defense responses, such as H2O2 burst, callose deposition, cell death, PR1 (pathogenesis-related 1) and PAL1 (Phe ammonia-lyase 1) gene expression, have been investigated in quercetin-pretreated Pst-inoculated Arabidopsis Col-0 and there was a strong defensive response in quercetin-pretreated Arabidopsis against virulent Pst. However, with the presence of catalase, the protective effects of quercetin on pathogen resistance to virulent Pst disappeared in Arabidopsis, suggesting that H2O2 may play a key role in plant defense responses. In addition, we confirmed that quercetin did not show any beneficial effect on pathogen-free leaves in Arabidopsis, indicating that pathogen challenge is also required to induce the defense responses in quercetin-pretreated Arabidopsis. Furthermore, strong defense responses have been observed in quercetin-pretreated Arabidopsis mutant jar1, ein2, and abi1-2 under Pst challenge, whereas no protective effect has been observed in quercetin-pretreated Arabidopsis mutant NahG and npr1.

Activation energies of the movements were determined by Arrhenius plots at high and low concentrations of ATP. As a result, the thermal activation energy of the movement away from the central bare zone was significantly higher than that of the movement toward the zone.

Kinetic studies (kcat(app)/Km(app)) indicated that phosphorylation of the TYK-2-KD (pY1054) increased the catalytic efficiency 4.4-fold compared to its non-phosphorylated form, while further phosphorylation to generate the di-phosphorylated enzyme imparted no further increase in activity. These results are in contrast to those obtained with the JAK-2-KD and JAK-3-KD, where little or no increase in activity occurred upon mono-phosphorylation, while di-phosphorylation resulted in a 5.1-fold increase in activity for the JAK-2-KD. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibitors demonstrated 10\u201330-fold shifts in potency (Ki(app)) as a result of the TYK-2-KD phosphorylation state, while the shifts for JAK-3-KD were only 2\u20133-fold and showed little or no change for JAK-2-KD. Thus, the phosphorlyation state imparted differential effects on both activity and inhibition within the JAK family of kinases.",

We observed upregulated FGL2 expression in alveolar macrophages from peripheral lungs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and found a correlation between FGL2 expression and increased macrophage activation markers (CD11b and CD14). The role of FGL2 in the activation of macrophages was confirmed by the detection of significantly decreased macrophage activation marker (CD11b, CD11c, and CD71) expression as well as the inhibition of cell migration and inflammatory cytokine (IL-8 and MMP-9) production in an LPS-induced FGL2 knockdown human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1). Increased FGL2 expression co-localized with upregulated phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) in the lung tissues from COPD patients. Moreover, FGL2 knockdown in THP-1 cells significantly downregulated LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38-MAPK while upregulating phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).

     "abstract": "Phosphatidic acid (PA), the primary metabolite of the phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine, has been shown to act as a tumor promoting second messenger in many cancer cell lines. A key target of PA is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine\u2013threonine kinase that has been widely implicated in cancer cell survival signals. In agreement with its ability to relay survival signals, it has been reported that both PLD and mTOR are required for the stabilization of the p53 E3 ubiquitin ligase human double minute 2 (HDM2) protein. Thus, by stabilizing HDM2, PLD and mTOR are able to counter the pro-apoptotic signaling mediated by p53 and promote survival. mTOR exists in at least two distinct complexes\u2014mTORC1 and mTORC2\u2014that are both dependent on PLD-generated PA. Although PLD and its metabolite PA are clearly implicated in the transduction of survival signals to mTOR, it is not yet apparent which of the two mTOR complexes is critical for the stabilization of HDM2. We report here that the PLD/mTOR-dependent stabilization of HDM2 involves mTORC2 and the AGC family kinase serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). This study reveals that mTORC2 is a critical target of PLD-mediated survival signals and identifies SGK1 as a downstream target of mTORC2 for the stabilization of HDM2.",

AGE significantly up-regulated monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), type III collagen and receptor for AGE (RAGE) mRNA levels in MRC-5 cells, all of which were completely blocked by nifedipine or an MR antagonist spironolactone.

Further, AGE significantly stimulated aldosterone generation in MRC-5 cells, which was partially blocked by nifedipine or spironolactone. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that AGE could evoke inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions in MRC-5 cells via aldosterone production, which were blocked by the MR antagonistic activity of nifedipine.

In addition, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress markers were also assessed. Results showed that cell viability was reduced by CuO NPs and degree of reduction was dose dependent.

GFR\u03b11 partners with transmembrane proteins, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase RET or the cell adhesion molecule NCAM, for intracellular transmission of the GDNF signal. In addition to this canonical role, GFR\u03b11 can also engage in horizontal interactions and thereby modify the function of other cell surface components. GFR\u03b11 can also function as a ligand-induced adhesion cell molecule, mediating homophilic cell\u2013cell interactions in response to GDNF. Finally, GFR\u03b11 can also be released from the cell surface and act at a distance as a soluble factor together with its ligand.

The virus co-evolved with man and has established a largely harmless and highly complex co-existence. It is carried as silent infection by almost all human adults. A serendipitous discovery established that it is the causative agent of infectious mononucleosis.Still, EBV became known first in 1964, in a rare, geographically prevalent malignant lymphoma of B-cell origin, Burkitt lymphoma BL. Its association with a malignancy prompted intensive studies and its capacity to immortalize B-lymphocytes in vitro was soon demonstrated. Consequently EBV was classified therefore as a potentially tumorigenic virus. Despite of this property however, the virus carrier state itself does not lead to malignancies because the transformed cells are recognized by the immune response. Consequently the EBV induced proliferation of EBV carrying B-lymphocytes is manifested only under immunosuppressive conditions.The expression of EBV encoded genes is regulated by the cell phenotype. The virus genome can be found in malignancies originating from cell types other than the B-lymphocyte. Even in the EBV infected B-cell, the direct transforming capacity is restricted to a defined window of differentiation. A complex interaction between virally encoded proteins and B-cell specific cellular proteins constitute the proliferation inducing program.In this short review we touch upon aspects which are the subject of our present work.We describe the mechanisms of some of the functional interactions between EBV encoded and cellular proteins that determine the phenotype of latently infected B-cells.The growth promoting EBV encoded genes are not expressed in the virus carrying BL cells. Still, EBV seems to contribute to the etiology of this tumor by modifying events that influence cell survival and proliferation. We describe a possible growth promoting mechanism in the genesis of Burkitt lymphoma that depends on the presence of EBV.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in a growing number of biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis, autophagy, metabolism, and aging. Activation of p53 in response to oncogenic stress eliminates nascent tumor cells by apoptosis or senescence. p53 is regulated at the protein level by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. A p53 antisense gene, Wrap53, enhances p53 mRNA levels via the 5\u2032UTR. Lack of Wrap53 transcripts that overlap with p53 abrogates the p53 DNA damage response. Around half of all human tumors carry p53 mutation that disrupt p53 specific DNA binding, and transcriptional transactivation of target genes. Reactivation of mutant p53 is a promising strategy for novel cancer therapy. The small molecule PRIMA-1 restores wild type conformation and DNA binding to mutant p53, induces mutant p53-dependent apoptosis, and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. The PRIMA-1 analog APR-246 is currently tested in a phase I clinical trial. Improved understanding of the p53 pathway should lead to better diagnosis and treatment of cancer in the future.",

Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) was discovered as the first protein that mediated caspase-independent cell death. Initially, it was regarded as a soluble protein residing in the intermembrane space of mitochondria, from where it could be exported to the nucleus to participate in large-scale DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. However, later it was demonstrated that AIF is N-terminally anchored to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Hence, AIF must be liberated from its membrane anchor prior to being released into the cytosol. The current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms regulating the processing and release of AIF from the mitochondria will be summarized and discussed in this review.",

Owing to the cardiovascular and metabolic disorders associated with obesity, and the epidemic of obesity facing most countries today, life expectancy in the developed world may start to decrease for the first time in recent history. Other conditions, such as anorexia nervosa and cachexia, are characterised by subnormal levels of adipose tissue and as with obesity lead to morbidity and mortality. Given the significant personal and economic costs of these conditions and their increasing prevalence in society, understanding the factors that determine the fat mass is therefore of prime interest and may lead to effective treatments and/or interventions for these disorders. Fat mass can be regulated in two ways. The lipid filling of pre-existing fat cells could be altered and the number of fat cells could be changed by the generation of new fat cells or the dying of old ones (i.e. adipocyte turnover).

We have found that pathogens are able to turn off the endogenous expression of AMPs, resulting in serious infections such as shigellosis. A therapeutic rationale to prevent microbial invasion would be to strengthen the epithelial line of defence through enhancing AMP expression. We have identified several inducers of AMP-production, including butyrate, phenylbutyrate and vitamin D, which have been investigated in animal models of shigellosis as well as in clinical trials.

Second, transplantation of human ventral midbrain tissue from aborted fetuses has lead to proof of principle that CRT may work, however, it has also pointed out to important patient-, surgery- and cell preparation-related variables, which need to be improved. Third, while some patients have developed dyskinesias and, with time, Lewy bodies in the grafted cells, other patients have experienced remarkable improvement and have been able to stop their medication.

In recent years the structural coverage of the enzymes involved in human nucleotide metabolism has been dramatically improved and is approaching completion. An important factor has been the contribution from the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) at Karolinska Institutet, which recently has solved 33 novel structures of enzymes and enzyme domains in human nucleotide metabolism pathways and homologs thereof.

Large-scale approaches, such as microarray profiling, have also given data about molecules involved in the biology and pathology of the glomerulus. In the coming decade, the use of global expression profiling platforms, transgenic mouse lines, and other in vivo gene delivery methods will rapidly expand our understanding of biology and pathology of the glomerular filtration barrier, and hopefully expose novel target molecules for therapy in progressive renal diseases.",

We have now further investigated the localization of Sema3A in the normal rat corneal epithelium as well as changes in its expression pattern during wound healing after central corneal epithelial debridement. The expression pattern of Sema3A was compared with that of the tight-junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), the gap-junction protein connexin43 (Cx43), or the cell proliferation marker Ki67. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Sema3A was present predominantly in the membrane of basal and wing cells of the intact corneal epithelium. The expression of Sema3A at the basal side of basal cells was increased in the peripheral epithelium compared with that in the central region. Sema3A was detected in all layers at the leading edge of the migrating corneal epithelium at 6\u00a0h after central epithelial debridement. The expression of Sema3A was markedly up-regulated in the basal and lateral membranes of columnar basal cells apparent in the thickened, newly healed epithelium at 1\u00a0day after debridement, but it had largely returned to the normal pattern at 3\u00a0days after debridement. The expression of ZO-1 was restricted to superficial epithelial cells and remained mostly unchanged during the wound healing process. The expression of Cx43 in basal cells was down-regulated at the leading edge of the migrating epithelium but was stable in the remaining portion of the epithelium. Ki67 was not detected in basal cells of the central epithelium at 1\u00a0day after epithelial debridement, when Sema3A was prominently expressed. Immunoblot analysis showed that the abundance of Sema3A in the central cornea was increased 1\u00a0day after epithelial debridement, whereas that of ZO-1 or Cx43 remained largely unchanged. This increase in Sema3A expression was accompanied by up-regulation of the Sema3A coreceptor neuropilin-1. Our observations have thus shown that the expression of Sema3A is increased markedly in basal cells of the newly healed corneal epithelium, and that this up-regulation of Sema3A is not associated with cell proliferation. They further suggest that Sema3A might play a role in the regulation of corneal epithelial wound healing.",

Augmenter of liver regeneration (ALR) is a hepatotrophic growth factor which has been shown to stimulate hepatic regeneration after partial hepatectomy and therefore seems to be regulated during the regenerative process in the liver. Our aim was to analyze how ALR is regulated in hepatic tissues and which transcription factors might regulate its tissue-specific expression. Promoter studies of ALR (\u2212733/+527\u00a0bp) revealed potential regulatory elements for various transcription factors like Foxa2, IL-6 RE-BP and C/EBP\u03b2. Analysis of the promoter activity by performing luciferase assays revealed that co-transfection with Foxa2 significantly induced the activity of ALR promoter in HepG2 cells. EMSA and Supershift analysis using anti-Foxa2 antibody confirmed the specific binding of Foxa2 to ALR promoter and this binding was inducible when the cells were simultaneously stimulated with IL-6. The increased binding after activation with IL-6 and/or Foxa2 was confirmed by elevated ALR protein levels using Western blot technique. In addition, we could not detect any binding of C/EBP\u03b2 and IL-6 RE-BP to the promoter of ALR. In conclusion, these results indicate that ALR is regulated by Foxa2, and this regulation may be amplified by IL-6.",

In HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged LC3, activation of protein kinase C inhibited the autophagic processing of LC3-I to LC3-II induced by amino acid starvation or rapamycin. PKC inhibitors dramatically induced LC3 processing and autophagosome formation. Unlike autophagy induced by starvation or rapamycin, PKC inhibitor-induced autophagy was not blocked by the PI-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin. Using orthophosphate metabolic labeling, we found that LC3 was phosphorylated in response to the PKC activator PMA or the protein phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A. Furthermore, bacterially expressed LC3 was directly phosphorylated by purified PKC in vitro. The sites of phosphorylation were mapped to T6 and T29 by nanoLC-coupled tandem mass spectrometry. Mutations of these residues significantly reduced LC3 phosphorylation by purified PKC in vitro. However, in HEK293 cells stably expressing LC3 with these sites mutated either singly or doubly to Ala, Asp or Glu, autophagy was not significantly affected, suggesting that PKC regulates autophagy through a mechanism independent of LC3 phosphorylation.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiological studies suggest that insulin resistance is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, there is little information on the role of insulin resistance in atherosclerogenesis independent of LDL cholesterol level. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of systemic insulin resistance on monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and atherosclerotic lesions independent of LDL cholesterol level. KKAy mice are obese mice with spontaneous diabetes and insulin resistance, and normal levels of LDL cholesterol. In parallel with systemic insulin resistance, decreased insulin signal, and the increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were noted in macrophages isolated from KKAy mice. These mice showed enhanced monocyte adhesion to the endothelial cells of the thoracic artery. Furthermore, these mice showed expanded atherosclerotic lesions when fed high cholesterol diet. Our data indicate that insulin resistance promotes the atherosclerogenesis independent of LDL cholesterol level. Decreased insulin signaling in macrophages associated with systemic insulin resistance could be involved, at least in part, in this pathological process.",

Exogenous treatment of 3D8 scFv, prior to or post-CSFV infection, was also shown to suppress CSFV replication at the viral RNA level.

The question arises what happens when kinesin encounters blockages. The present study describes the movement of kinesin labeled by 20-nm gold beads along immobilized microtubules artificially decorated with blocking proteins. To guarantee that exactly the kinesin-binding sites were occupied and to avoid steric effects exerted by large molecules, the KIF5A motor domain was used for blocking. After binding, the blockages were irreversibly cross-linked to the microtubules to make them non-exchangeable. Under such conditions, kinesin movement became a non-continuous one. As a rule, after temporary stopping the kinesin moved on without being released from the microtubule. The results strongly suggest a bypassing mechanism based on the postulation that kinesin changes to and continues movement along a neighbouring protofilament. Bypassing is considered to ensure an efficient long-distance transport of cellular cargoes by kinesins.",

Shedding of the old cuticle takes place on the surface of hypodermal cells, which are also responsible for secretion and synthesis of a new cuticle. Here, we use the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to show that muscle cells, laying beneath and mechanically linked to the hypodermis, play an important role during molting. We followed the molecular composition and distribution of integrin mediated adhesion structures called dense bodies (DB), which indirectly connect muscles to the hypodermis. We found the concentration of two DB proteins (PAT-3/\u03b2-integrin and UNC-95) to decrease during the quiescent phase of molting, concomitant with an apparent increase in lateral movement of the DB. We show that levels of the E3-ligase RNF-5 increase specifically during molting, and that RNF-5 acts to ubiquitinate the DB protein UNC-95. Persistent high levels of RNF-5 driven by a heatshock or unc-95 promoter lead to failure of ecdysis, and in non-molting worms to a progressive detachment of the cuticle from the hypodermis. These observations indicate that increased DB dynamics characterizes the lethargus phase of molting in parallel to decreased levels of DB components and that temporal expression of RNF-5 contributes to an efficient molting process.",

Four glycoproteins (ZP1\u2013ZP4) compose the human ZP, being ZP3 the physiological inductor of the AR. This process requires changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) involving not fully understood mechanisms. Even in mouse sperm, the pharmacologically documented participation of voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels and store-operated channels (SOCs) in the ZP-induced AR is being debated. The situation in human sperm is even less clear due to the limited availability of human ZP. Here, we used recombinant human ZP3 (rhZP3) produced in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells to investigate the involvement of CaV channels in the human sperm AR. Our findings showed that Ni2+ and mibefradil at concentrations that block T-type or CaV3 channels, and nimodipine and diltiazem that block L-type or CaV1 channels, significantly inhibited the rhZP3-initiated AR. On the other hand, the AR was insensitive to concentrations of \u03c9-Agatoxin IVA, \u03c9-Conotoxin GVIA and SNX-482 that block P/Q, N and R-type channels, respectively (CaV2 channels). Our overall findings suggest that CaV1 and CaV3 channels participate in human sperm AR.

Being first reported as a nonhistone chromosomal protein, high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is now implicated as a mediator of inflammation. We hypothesized that HMGB1 could trigger the release of cytokines in the spinal dorsal horn and contribute to bone cancer pain. To test this hypothesis, we first built a bone cancer pain model induced by intratibal injection of Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma cells. The structural damage to the tibia was monitored by radiological analysis. The mechanical allodynia was measured and the expression of spinal HMGB1 and IL-1\u03b2 was evaluated. We observed that inoculation of cancer cells, but not heat-killed cells, induced progressive bone destruction from 9 d to 21 d post inoculation. Behavioral tests demonstrated that the significant nociceptive response in the cancer cells-injected rats emerged on day 9 and this kind of mechanical allodynia lasted at least 21 d following inoculation. Tumor cells inoculation significantly increased HMGB1 expression in the spinal dorsal horn, while intrathecal injecting a neutralizing antibody against HMGB1 showed an effective and reliable anti-allodynia effect with a dose-dependent manner. IL-1\u03b2 was significantly increased in caner pain rats while intrathecally administration of anti-HMGB1 could decrease IL-1\u03b2. Together with previous reports, we predict that bone cancer induces HMGB1 production, enhancing spinal IL-1\u03b2 expression and thus modulating spinal excitatory synaptic transmission and pain response.",

     "abstract": "The function of the central nervous system largely depends on growth and differentiation (neurite outgrowth) of neural cells and it is well established that growth factors, especially nerve growth factor NGF stimulate neurite outgrowth. However, additional factors are implicated in this process notably the redox state of the cells. For the first time we could demonstrate that the application of recombinant thioredoxin stimulates neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells to the same extend as NGF. Thioredoxin, a small redox protein is a major player in the cellular protein reduction system. An increased expression and secretion of thioredoxin is achieved by the application of the novel sialic acid precursor N-propionylmannosamine (ManNProp). From earlier studies it is known that this N-acylmannosamine analog stimulates significantly the neurite outgrowth in cell cultures. This finding would give new insights into the mechanism of the nerve-stimulatory action of ManNProp and demonstrates the novel role of thioredoxin during the regulation of nerve growth, encouraging further studies.",

     "abstract": "Stress fibers (SFs) composed of nonmuscle actin and myosin II play critical roles in various cellular functions such as structural remodeling in response to changes in cell stress or strain. Previous studies report that SFs rapidly disassemble upon loss of tension caused by reduced myosin activity or sudden cell shortening, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we showed that Rho-kinase inhibition with Y-27632 led to detachment of intact actin filaments from the SFs rather than depolymerization. Loss of tension may allow SFs to shorten via MgATP-driven cross-bridge cycling, thus we investigated the effects of MgATP concentration on SF shortening and stability. We performed the experiments using extracted SFs to allow control over MgATP concentration. SF contraction and disassembly rates each increased with increasing MgATP concentration. SFs transitioned from conventional SF shortening to rapid disassembly as MgATP concentration increases from 2 to 5\u00a0mM, which is within the physiological range of intracellular MgATP concentrations. Thus, we submit that SFs in intact cells are inherently on the verge of disassembly, which is likely due to the small number of actomyosin cross-bridges in SFs compared to those found in relatively stable myofibrils. Given that recent studies have revealed that loss of resistive force against myosin II could lower the fraction of the MgATPase cycle time that the myosin head is attached to actin (i.e., the duty ratio), binding of cytoplasmic levels of MgATP to myosin II may be sufficient to cause the disassembly of unloaded SFs. The present study thus describes a putative mechanism for rapid SF disassembly caused by decreased myosin activity or sudden cell shortening.",

The role of ATP7B overexpression for MSC survival and selection in high copper was investigated. Hepatoma cell line HepG2 that has a high intrinsic expression of ATP7B served as a control. Using retroviral vector a significant higher expression level of ATP7B could be achieved in MSCs. Whereas copper treatment resulted in cell death in untransduced MSCs, viability assays demonstrated a unique copper resistance of ATP7B overexpressing MSCs that outcompeted HepG2. In long-term cell culture stable transgene expression for up to 9\u00a0weeks was shown for ATP7B overexpressing MSCs which rapidly overgrew untransduced cells. Our findings suggest that ATP7B overexpression provides an important selection advantage to MSCs in high copper microenvironments, and may represent novel cell transplants for therapy of WD.",

In co-immunoprecipitation assays and GST pull-down assays, NS1 directly interacted with Akt. The interaction was mediated primarily through the Akt-PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain and the RNA-binding domain of NS1. NS1 preferentially interacted with phosphorylated Akt, but not with non-phosphorylated Akt. Functionally, the NS1\u2013Akt interaction enhanced Akt activity both in the intra-cellular context and in in vitro Akt kinase assays. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that phosphorylated Akt interacted with NS1 during the interphase of the cell cycle predominantly within the nucleus. Finally, mass spectrometric analysis demonstrated the position at Thr215 of NS1 protein is primary phosphorylation target site through Akt activation. The results together supported the functional importance of influenza virus NS1 with Akt, a core intra-cellular survival regulator.",

Here we present evidence that FGF receptors and underlying signaling pathways transmit the FGF-2 signals that regulate astrocyte specification aside from its mitogenic activity. Application of FGF-2 to cortical progenitors suppressed neurogenesis whereas treatment with an FGFR antagonist in vitro promoted neurogenesis. Introduction of chimeric FGFRs with mutated tyrosine residues into cortical progenitors and drug treatments to specifically block individual downstream signaling pathways revealed that the overall activity of FGFR rather than individual autophosphorylation sites is important for delivering signals for glial specification. In contrast, a signal for cell proliferation by FGFR was mainly delivered by MAPK pathway. Together our findings indicate that FGFR activity promotes astrocyte specification in the developing CNS.",

     "abstract": "Aims: To investigate dynamic changes in the expression of HCN2, HCN4, as well as KCNE1, and KCNE2 mRNA and protein levels in ventricular cells from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) rat hearts. Main methods: An AMI model was induced by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. The rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups: 24-hour (24\u00a0h) post-AMI, 1-week (1w) post-AMI, 2-week (2w) post-AMI, and 4-week (4w) post-AMI; sham-operated control rat groups were established in parallel for each time point. HCN2, HCN4, KCNE1, and KCNE2 mRNA and protein levels were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. Key findings: Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in all the post-AMI groups, particularly in the 1w and 2w post-AMI groups. Although HCN2, HCN4, KCNE1, and KCNE2 genes were expressed in the left ventricular myocardium of sham-operated control rats, their expression increased in rat ischemic left ventricular myocardium, with dynamic changes in expression observed 4\u00a0weeks after AMI. HCN2, HCN4, and KCNE2 protein levels were highest at 1w and KCNE2 protein levels peaked at 2w post-AMI. Significance: The expression of the HCN2, HCN4, as well as KCNE1, and KCNE2 genes in ventricular cells from AMI rat hearts underwent dynamic changes, reaching peak levels at 1 or 2\u00a0weeks post-AMI. The increased expression maybe related to ventricular arrhythmogenesis after AMI.",

     "abstract": "Testicular torsion is associated with damage to the testicular tissue as a result of ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury (IRI) and induction of apoptosis leading to progressive damage to spermatogenesis. Survivin is suggested to be an important regulator in the control of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, although its role in torsion-induced IRI is unknown. Therefore, we sought to evaluate testicular survivin expression after long term IRI induced by testicular torsion. Survivin expression was measured by real-time PCR in 6\u201312\u00a0month old New Zealand white rabbits divided into three groups (4 animals/group): group (A) sham control, group (B) ischemia alone for 60\u00a0min and group (C) ischemia for 60\u00a0min followed by reperfusion for 6\u00a0months. Germ cell apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL assay, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and DNA fragmentation. The Johnsen score was used to assess testicular morphological damage, while lipid peroxidation was used as an indicator for oxidative stress. Survivin expression was detected in all testicular tissue samples. The rate of survivin expression after IRI was significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared with ischemic only and sham control testes. Its expression in IRI samples was inversely correlated with the significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in apoptosis, oxidative levels and spermatogenic damage. In conclusion, down-regulation of testicular survivin expression after long term IRI to the testis and its association with apoptosis induction suggests its involvement in the regulation of this apoptotic pathway. These findings also identify survivin as a potential new target for the prevention of germ cell death during testicular torsion.",

In this study, we have undertaken steady-state kinetics, circular dichroism and mutational analysis to examine the role of a disulphide bond in this protein. By mutational analysis, we show that the disulphide bond is not important for catalytic activity; rather it plays an important role for the stability of the protein as observed from thermal denaturation studies.

Our study shows that EAhy926 endothelial cells express S1P1, S1P3 and S1P5 receptors. Furthermore, S1P upregulates both ZNF580 mRNA and protein levels in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. SB203580, the specific inhibitor of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathway, blocks the S1P-induced upregulation of ZNF580.

     "abstract": "Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) is a Mondo family transcription factor that activates a number of glycolytic and lipogenic genes in response to glucose stimulation. We have previously reported that high glucose can activate the transcriptional activity of ChREBP independent of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated increase in nuclear entry and DNA binding. Here, we found that formation of glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) is essential for glucose activation of ChREBP. The glucose response of GAL4-ChREBP is attenuated by d-mannoheptulose, a potent hexokinase inhibitor, as well as over-expression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase); kinetics of activation of GAL4-ChREBP can be modified by exogenously expressed GCK. Further metabolism of G-6-P through the two major glucose metabolic pathways, glycolysis and pentose-phosphate pathway, is not required for activation of ChREBP; over-expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) diminishes, whereas RNAi knockdown of the enzyme enhances, the glucose response of GAL4-ChREBP, respectively. Moreover, the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), which is phosphorylated by hexokinase, but not further metabolized, effectively upregulates the transcription activity of ChREBP. In addition, over-expression of phosphofructokinase (PFK) 1 and 2, synergistically diminishes the glucose response of GAL4-ChREBP. These multiple lines of evidence support the conclusion that G-6-P mediates the activation of ChREBP.",

Recent studies indicate that the intermediate filament vimentin is necessary for endothelial cell morphogenesis e.g. in the context of leukocyte transmigration. Here, we present evidence, that the scaffold provided by vimentin is essential for VASP localization and PKG mediated VASP phosphorylation and thus controls endothelial cell migration and proliferation. Vimentin suppression using siRNA technique significantly decreased migration velocity by 50% (videomicroscopy), diminished transmigration activity by 42.5% (Boyden chamber) and reduced proliferation by 43% (BrdU-incorporation). In confocal microscopy Vimentin colocalized with VASP and PKG in endothelial cells. Vimentin suppression was accompanied with a translocation of VASP from focal contacts to the perinuclear region. VASP/Vimentin and PKG/Vimentin colocalization appeared to be essential for proper PKG mediated VASP phosphorylation because we detected a diminished expression of PKG and pSer239-VASP in vimentin-suppressed cells, Furthermore, the induction of VASP phosphorylation in perfused arteries was markedly decreased in vimentin knockout mice compared to wildtypes. A link is proposed between vimentin, VASP phosphorylation and actin dynamics that delivers an explanation for the important role of vimentin in controlling endothelial cell morphogenesis.",

This study examines the effect of MK-801, Glu on the pain-evoked response of pain-excitation neurons (PENs) and pain-inhibition neurons (PINs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats. The trains of electric impulses applied to the sciatic nerve were used as noxious stimulation. The electrical activities of PENs or PINs in NAc were recorded by a glass microelectrode. Our results revealed that the lateral ventricle injection of Glu increased the discharged frequency and shortened the discharged latency of PEN, and decreased the discharged frequency and prolonged the discharged inhibitory duration (ID) of PIN in NAc of rats evoked by the noxious stimulation, while intra-NAc administration of MK-801 produced the opposite response. On the basis of above findings we can deduce that Glu, MK-801 and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are involved in the modulation of nociceptive information transmission in NAc.",

These substitutions did not have large effects on hE3 activity when measured in its free form. However, when these hE3 mutants were reconstituted in the complex, the PDC activity was significantly reduced to 9% for Y438A, 20% for Y438H, and 18% for D413A. The binding of hE3 mutants with L3S1 determined by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the binding affinities of the Y438A, Y438H, and D413A mutants to L3S1 were severely reduced (1019-, 607-, and 402-fold, respectively). Unlike wild-type hE3 the binding of the Y438A mutant to L3S1 was accompanied by an unfavorable enthalpy change and a large positive entropy change.

Each of the two homologous halves of P-gp is composed of a transmembrane domain (TMD) with six TM segments followed by a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The drug- and ATP-binding sites reside at the interface between the TMDs and NBDs, respectively. Crystal structures show drug pumps in the open and closed conformations, where the drug-binding pocket and NBDs are open or closed at the cytoplasmic side, respectively. Although it has been postulated that drug substrates enter the drug-binding pocket in the open conformation, it is unknown if they can enter in the closed conformation. To determine this, we introduced cysteines into regions of TM3 (residues 175\u2013178) and TM9 (residues 820\u2013822) that extend into the cytoplasm and are 4 \u00c5 and 20 \u00c5 apart in the closed and open conformations, respectively.

Cross-linking was not increased in the presence of ATP or drug substrates. Cross-linking increased its basal ATPase activity about 3-fold.

Full length murine CX3CL1 was expressed and shed by the metalloproteinase ADAM10 as described for human CX3CL1. Truncation of murine CX3CL1 led to reduced maturation and impaired trafficking to the surface. Truncation of CX3CL1 also abrogated localization to early endosomal vesicles, but increased shedding from the surface by ADAM10. Once truncated CX3CL1 was expressed on the surface, it mediated cell contact and induced leukocyte transmigration similar as full length CX3CL1.

In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT)-sensitive mitochondrial autophagy can protect against heat-induced apoptosis through reduction of cytosolic cytochrome c release and downstream caspase-3 activation. With confocal microscopy, it was revealed that as autophagosomes increased, mitochondrial content was mass decreased after heat shock. Detailed analysis shows that a single swelling mitochondrion could be entrapped into autophagosome. The depolarization of mitochondria preceded the mitochondrial loss, and both could be abolished by MPT inhibitor cyclosporine (CsA). In addition, along with the decrease of mitochondrial content, the level of total cytochrome c was also reduced, resulting in a reduction of its release to cytoplasm. When heat shock was combined with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), an inhibitor of autophagy, the mitochondrial loss and the reduction of total cytochrome c were both inhibited, and then caspase-3 activation and cell apoptosis were increased. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that, heat shock-induced cellular events can be modulated by controlling autophagy, and this may represent a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of hyperthermia.",

However, the inactive form of GSK3\u03b2 which is phosphorylated at serine-9 is increased in AD brains. This is also inconsistent with phosphorylation status of other GSK3\u03b2 substrates, such as \u03b2-catenin and collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP2) since their phosphorylation is all increased in AD brains. Thus, we addressed this paradoxical condition of AD in rat neurons treated with okadaic acid (OA) which inhibits protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) and induces tau hyperphosphorylation and cell death. Interestingly, OA also induces phosphorylation of GSK3\u03b2 at serine-9 and other substrates including tau, \u03b2-catenin and CRMP2 like in AD brains. In this context, we observed that GSK3\u03b2 inhibitors such as lithium chloride and 6-bromoindirubin-3\u2032-monoxime (6-BIO) reversed those phosphorylation events and protected neurons.

Forced expression of wild-type but not mutant tumor suppressor PTEN in CEF decreased survivin mRNA levels. PI3K regulates survivin expression through Akt activation. To further investigate downstream target of PI3K and Akt in regulating the expression of survivin mRNA, we found that PI3K and Akt-induced p70S6K1 activation and that overexpression of p70S6K1 alone was sufficient to induce survivin expression.

First, to examine whether maternal passive immunity by the transportation of antigen-specific IgG via FcRn regulates allergic airway inflammation, ovalbumin-immunized FcRn+/\u2212 female mice were bred with FcRn\u2212/\u2212 male mice to evaluate the degree of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation of FcRn\u2212/\u2212 offspring.

The offspring were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Antigen-specific IgG1 administered to lactating mice reduced allergic airway inflammation in their offspring in an FcRn-dependent manner. Last, to exclude the factor of maternal passive immunity other than ovalbumin-specific IgG1, we administered ovalbumin-specific IgG1 orally to offspring after birth.

An acquired state was studied by expression of immature-related surface antigens, Tra-1-60, Tra-1-81, Tra-2-49, and Ssea-4; and epigenetic trimethyl modification at lysine 4 of histone H3. Sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and tumorigenicity were studied in Lc-iPC cells.Whereas the introduction of defined factors of iPC cells once induced an immature state and sensitized cells to therapeutic reagents, the endogenous expression of the ES-like genes except for activated endogenous c-MYC was down-regulated in a long-term culture, suggesting a high magnitude of the reprogramming induction by defined factors and the requirement of therapeutic maintenance in Lc-iPC cells from cholangiocellular carcinoma HuCC-T1 cells, which harbor TP53R175H and KRASG12D. The Lc-iPC cells showed resistance to 5-fluorouracil in culture, and high tumorigenic ability with activated endogenous c-MYC in immunodeficient mice.The Lc-iPC cells from HuCC-T1 might be prone to an undesirable therapeutic response because of an association with the activated endogenous c-MYC.

     "abstract": "Arachidonic acid derived endogenous electrophile 15d-PGJ2 has gained much attention in recent years due to its potent anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory actions mediated through thiol modification of cysteine residues in its target proteins. Here, we show that 15d-PGJ2 at 1\u00a0\u03bcM concentration converts normal mitochondria into large elongated and interconnected mitochondria through direct binding to mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 and partial inhibition of its GTPase activity. Mitochondrial elongation induced by 15d-PGJ2 is accompanied by increased assembly of Drp1 into large oligomeric complexes through plausible intermolecular interactions. The role of decreased GTPase activity of Drp1 in the formation of large oligomeric complexes is evident when Drp1 is incubated with a non-cleavable GTP analog, GTP\u03b3S or by a mutation that inactivated GTPase activity of Drp1 (K38A). The mutation of cysteine residue (Cys644) in the GTPase effector domain, a reported target for modification by reactive electrophiles, to alanine mimicked K38A mutation induced Drp1 oligomerization and mitochondrial elongation, suggesting the importance of cysteine in GED to regulate the GTPase activity and mitochondrial morphology. Interestingly, treatment of K38A and C644A mutants with 15d-PGJ2 resulted in super oligomerization of both mutant Drp1s indicating that 15d-PGJ2 may further stabilize Drp1 oligomers formed by loss of GTPase activity through covalent modification of middle domain cysteine residues. The present study documents for the first time the regulation of a mitochondrial fission activity by a prostaglandin, which will provide clues for understanding the pathological and physiological consequences of accumulation of reactive electrophiles during oxidative stress, inflammation and degeneration.",

KID syndrome is inherited as an autosomic dominant disease, due to mutations in the gene encoding gap junction protein GJB2 (connexin 26, Cx26). Cx26 is a component of gap junction channels in the epidermis and in the stria vascularis of the cochlea. These channels play a role in the coordinated exchange of molecules and ions occurring in a wide spectrum of cellular activities.

This study was aimed to delineate the antimicrobial mechanism of S-thanatin and identify its interaction with bacterial membranes. In this study, membrane phospholipid was found to be the target for S-thanatin. In the presence of vesicles, S-thanatin interestingly led to the aggregation of anionic vesicles and sonicated bacteria. Adding S-thanatin to Escherichia coli suspension would result in the collapse of membrane and kill bacteria. The sensitivity assay of protoplast elucidated the importance of outer membrane (OM) for S-thanatin\u2019s antimicrobial activity. Compared with other antimicrobial peptide, S-thanatin produced chaotic membrane morphology and cell debris in electron microscopic appearance. These results supported our hypothesis that S-thanatin bound to negatively charged LPS and anionic lipid, impeded membrane respiration, exhausted the intracellular potential, and released periplasmic material, which led to cell death.",

The mammalian N-glycosylation pathway involves the step-wise assembly of sugars onto a dolichol phosphate (P-Dol) carrier, forming a lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO), followed by the transfer of the completed oligosaccharide onto the protein of interest. In order to better understand how deficiencies in this pathway affect the availability of the completed LLO donor for use in N-glycosylation, we used a non-radioactive, HPLC-based assay to examine the intermediates in the LLO synthesis pathway for CHO-K1 cells and for three different glycosylation-deficient CHO cell lines. B4-2-1 cells, which have a mutation in the dolichol phosphate-mannose synthase (DPM2) gene, accumulated LLO with the structure Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol, while MI8-5 cells, which lack glucosyltransferase I (ALG6) activity, accumulated Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol. CHO-K1 and MI5-4 cells both produced primarily the complete LLO, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol, though the relative quantity was lower in MI5-4. MI5-4 cells have reduced hexokinase activity which could affect the availability of many of the substrates required for LLO synthesis and, consequently, impair production of the final LLO donor. Increasing hexokinase activity by overexpressing hexokinase II in MI5-4 caused a decrease in the relative quantities of the incomplete LLO intermediates from Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol through Glc1Man9GlcNAc2-PP-Dol, and an increase in the relative quantity of the final LLO donor, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol. This study suggests that metabolic engineering may be a useful strategy for improving LLO availability for use in N-glycosylation.",

We propose that the removal of RNA from the bacterial nucleoid affects nucleoid compaction by altering the branching density and molecular weight of the nucleoid. We show that a common detergent in nucleoid preparations, Brij 58, plays a previously unrecognized role as a macromolecular crowding agent. RNA-free nucleoids adopt a compact structure similar in size to exponential-phase nucleoids when the concentration of Brij 58 is increased, consistent with our hypothesis. We present evidence that control and protein-free nucleoids behave similarly in solutions containing a macromolecular crowding agent. These results show that the contribution to DNA compaction by nucleoid-associated proteins is small when compared to macromolecular crowding effects.",

Although it is widely accepted that NP signals via the LIFR, our studies reveal that NP results in phosphorylation of gp130, but not LIFR.

A lack of this system in phagocytes is known to cause serious life-threatening infections. Here, we describe that curcumin, a polyphenol responsible for the yellow color of curry spice turmeric, dramatically activates the O 2 - -generating system during retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of human monoblastic leukemia U937 cells to macrophage-like cells. When U937 cells were cultured in the presence of RA and curcumin, the O 2 - -generating activity increased more than 4-fold compared with that in the absence of the latter. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that co-treatment with RA and curcumin slightly enhanced gene expressions of the five components compared with those of the RA-treatment only. On the other hand, immunoblot analysis revealed that co-treatment with RA and curcumin caused remarkable accumulation of protein levels of p47-phox (to 7-fold) and p67-phox (to 4-fold) compared with those of the RA-treatment alone. These results suggested that curcumin dramatically enhances RA-induced O 2 - -generating activity via accumulation of cytosolic p47-phox and p67-phox proteins in U937 cells.

In this study, we screened a commercially available bacteriophage-displayed random peptide library using Bacillus cereus 4342 cells as bait to identify peptides that could be used for detection of Bacillus. The method enabled us to identify two 12-amino acid consensus peptide sequences that specifically bind to B. cereus 4342 and B. anthracis Sterne, the nonpathogenic surrogates of B. anthracis strain. The two Bacillus-binding peptides (named BBP-1 and BBP-2) were synthesized with biotin tag to confirm their binding by four independent detection assays. Dot-blot analysis revealed that the peptides bind specifically to B. cereus 4342 and B. anthracis Sterne. Quantitative analysis of this interaction by ELISA and fluorometry demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 102 colony forming U/ml (CFU/ml) by both assays. When the peptides were used in combination with Qdots, the sensitivity was enhanced further by enabling detection of even a single bacterium by fluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis and protein sequencing showed that BBP-1 and BBP-2 bound to the S-layer protein of B. anthracis Sterne.

Three doxorubicin-resistant AML cell lines (AML-2/DX30, AML-2/DX100, AML-2/DX300) were prepared via long-term exposure to doxorubicin for more than 3\u00a0months. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that many genes were differentially expressed in the resistant cells, as compared with the wild type AML-2/WT cells. In particular, the expression level of the MRP1 gene was significantly increased in the AML-2/DX300 cells, as compared to that detected in AML-2 cells. Importantly, the resveratrol was shown not only to induce cell growth arrest and apoptotic death in doxorubicin-resistant AML cells, but was also shown to downregulate the expression of an MRP1 gene. Furthermore, resveratrol treatment induced a significant increase in the uptake of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, a MRP1 substrate, into the doxorubicin-resistant AML-2/DX300 cells. The results of this study show that resveratrol may facilitate the cellular uptake of doxorubicin via an induced downregulation of MRP1 expression, and also suggest that it may prove useful in overcoming doxorubicin resistance, or in sensitizing doxorubicin-resistant AML cells to anti-leukemic agents.",

In the present study, we have performed mutational screening of entire 12S rRNA gene in 250 unrelated patients with non-syndromic and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. Twenty-one different homoplasmic sequence variants were identified, including eight common polymorphisms, one deafness-associated mutation m.1555 A>G and three putatively pathogenic variants: m.669 T>C, m.827 A>G, m.961 delT+C(n)ins. The incidence of m.1555 A>G was estimated for 3.6% (9/250); however, where aminoglycoside exposure was taken as a risk factor, the frequency was 5.5% (7/128). Substitution m.669 T>C was identified only in patients with hearing impairment and episode of aminoglycoside exposure, which may suggest that such additional risk factors must appear to induce clinical phenotype. Moreover, two 12S rRNA sequence variants: m.988 G>A and m.1453 A>G, localized at conserved sites and affected RNA secondary structure, may be new candidates for non-syndromic and aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss associated mutations.",

     "abstract": "Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs) are generated by the covalent interaction of reducing sugars with proteins, lipids or nucleic acids. AGEs are implicated in diabetic complications and pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. We previously demonstrated that exposure of the pancreatic islet cell line HIT-T15 to high concentrations of AGEs leads to a significant decrease of insulin secretion and content. Insulin gene transcription is positively regulated by the beta cell specific transcription factor PDX-1 (Pancreatic and Duodenal Homeobox-1). On the contrary, the forkhead transcription factor FoxO1 inhibits PDX-1 gene transcription. Activity of FoxO1 is regulated by post-translational modifications: phosphorylation deactivates FoxO1, and acetylation prevents FoxO1 ubiquitination. In this work we investigated whether AGEs affect expression and subcellular localization of PDX-1 and FoxO1. HIT-T15 cells were cultured for 5\u00a0days in presence of AGEs. Cells were then lysed and processed for subcellular fractionation. We determined intracellular insulin content, then we assessed the expression and subcellular localization of PDX-1, FoxO1, phosphoFoxO1 and acetylFoxO1. As expected intracellular insulin content was lower in HIT-T15 cells cultured with AGEs. The results showed that AGEs decreased expression and nuclear localization of PDX-1, reduced phosphorylation of FoxO1, and increased expression and acetylation of FoxO1. These results suggest that AGEs decrease insulin content unbalancing transcription factors regulating insulin gene expression.",

     "abstract": "The role of Na+\u2013Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in vascular endothelium is still matter of debate. Depending on both the endothelial cell (EC) type and the extracellular ligand, NCX has been shown to operate in either the forward (Ca2+ out)- or the reverse (Ca2+ in)-mode. In particular, acetylcholine (Ach) has been shown to promote Ca2+ inflow in the intact endothelium of excised rat aorta. Herein, we assessed the involvement of NCX into the Ca2+ signals elicited by ATP in such preparation. Removal of extracellular Na+ (0Na+) causes the NCX to switch into the reverse-mode and induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which disappeared in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, and in the presence of benzamil, which blocks both modes of NCX, and KB-R 7943, a selective inhibitor of the reverse-mode. ATP induced a transient Ca2+ signal, whose decay was significantly prolonged by 0Na+, benzamil, DCB, and monensin while it was unaffected by KB-R 7943. Notably, lowering extracellular Na+ concentration increased the sensibility to lower doses of ATP. These date suggest that, unlike Ach-stimulated ECs, NCX promotes Ca2+ extrusion when the stimulus is provided by ATP in intact endothelium of rat aorta. These data show that, within the same preparation, NCX operates in both modes, depending on the chemical nature of the extracellular stimulus.",

We identified cargo receptor family member p24A in yeast two-hybrid screens with the CaSR carboxyl terminus. Interactions were confirmed by immunoprecipitation of either p24A or CaSR in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Only the immaturely glycosylated form of CaSR interacts with p24A. Dissociation likely occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) or cis-Golgi, since only the uncleaved form of a CaSR mutant sensitive to the trans-Golgi enzyme furin was co-immunoprecipitated with p24A. p24A and p24A(\u0394GOLD) significantly increased total and plasma membrane CaSR protein but p24A(FF/AA) did not. The CaSR carboxyl terminus distal to T868 is required for differential sensitivity to p24A and its mutants. Interaction with p24A therefore increases CaSR stability in the ER and enhances plasma membrane targeting. Neither wt Sar1p or the T39N mutant increased CaSR maturation or abundance while the H79G mutant increased abundance but prevented maturation of CaSR. These results suggest that p24A is the limiting factor in CaSR trafficking in the early secretory pathway, and that cycling between the ER and ERGIC protects CaSR from degradation.",

Wingless Int-1 (Wnt)/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway regulates the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through enhancing \u03b2-catenin/T-cell transcription factor 1 (TCF) mediated transcription. The objective of this study was to determine whether AMPK cross-talks with Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling through phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were used. Chemical inhibition of AMPK and the expression of a dominant negative AMPK decreased phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin at Ser 552. The \u03b2-catenin/TCF mediated transcription was correlated with AMPK activity. In vitro, pure AMPK phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin at Ser 552 and the mutation of Ser 552 to Ala prevented such phosphorylation, which was further confirmed using [\u03b3-32P]ATP autoradiography. In conclusion, AMPK phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin at Ser 552, which stabilizes \u03b2-catenin, enhances \u03b2-catenin/TCF mediated transcription, expanding AMPK from regulation of energy metabolism to cell differentiation and development via cross-talking with the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.",

Moreover, no formal evidence suggests that C. albicans Cdc4 functions through the ubiquitin E3 ligase of the Skp1-Cul1/Cdc53-F-box complex. To elucidate the role of C. albicans CDC4, C. albicans Cdc4-associated proteins were sought by affinity purification. A 6\u00d7His epitope-tagged C. albicans Cdc4 expressed from Escherichia coli was used in affinity purifications with the cell lysate of C. albicans cdc4 homozygous null mutant. Candida albicans Cdc4 and its associated proteins were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized by silver staining. The candidate proteins were recovered and trypsin-digested to generate MALDI-TOF spectra profiles, which were used to search against those of known proteins in the database to reveal their identities. Two out of four proteins encoded by GPH1 and THR1 genes were further verified to interact with C. albicans Cdc4 using a yeast two-hybrid assay. We conclude that in vitro affinity purification using C. albicans Cdc4 generated from E. coli as the bait and proteins from cell lysate of C. albicans cdc4 homozygous null mutant as a source of prey permit the identification of novel proteins that physically interact and functionally associate with C. albicans Cdc4.",

The mutation status of the KRAS gene determines the benefits of molecular targeting drugs in patients with advanced colorectal cancer, although many methods are available to detect such mutations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of assay sensitivity on the detection frequency of mutated genes. Methods: Colorectal tumors in 224 colorectal cancer patients were characterized for KRAS mutations using PCR amplification following by direct sequencing as well as a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-clamp real-time PCR-based assay. Results: KRAS mutations were observed in 32.1% (72/224) patients by direct sequencing, and 43.3% (97/224) by PNA-clamp PCR. The chi-square test revealed that the difference in the frequency of KRAS mutations determined by direct sequencing and PNA-clamped PCR (threshold for 1% detection) was statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.015). Conclusions: Our data suggest that assay method sensitivity clearly influences the detection frequency of mutated genes.

To address this issue, a new animal model for anemia is required. We established a reversible anemic model in zebrafish by keeping fish at 17\u00a0\u00b0C, a low water temperature. In zebrafish kidney marrow, expression of several genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors (Runx1, scl, c-myb and GATA-2) and particularly erythropoiesis-related factors (klfd, hbaa1, ba1, GATA-1, EPO, and EPOr) was down-regulated, whereas myelopoiesis-related factors (csf1a and csf3) was up-regulated in low temperature conditions.

Addition of this monosaccharide is essential for forming a functional complex. However, in spite of the abundance of OGT in the nucleus, the impact of nuclear O-glycosylation by OGT remains largely unclear. To address this issue, the present study was undertaken to test the impact of nuclear O-glycosylation in a monocytic cell line, THP-1. Using a cytokine array, MIP-1\u03b1 and -1\u03b2 genes were found to be regulated by nuclear O-glycosylation. Biochemical purification of the OGT interactants from THP-1 revealed that OGT is an associating partner for distinct co-regulatory complexes. OGT recruitment and protein O-glycosylation were observed at the MIP-1\u03b1 gene promoter; however, the known OGT partner (HCF-1) was absent when the MIP-1\u03b1 gene promoter was not activated. From these findings, we suggest that OGT could be a co-regulatory subunit shared by functionally distinct complexes supporting epigenetic regulation.",

Transplantation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) has recently become a possible therapeutic approach for retinal degeneration. In the present study, we investigated the induction of photoreceptors by coculturing primate embryonic stem cells (ESCs) with ESC-derived RPE cells. Methods: RPE cells were derived by coculturing ESCs and Sertoli cells. Photoreceptors were then induced by using ESC-derived RPE cells and retinoic acid (RA) Results: RPE cell generation was confirmed by morphological analysis, which revealed highly pigmented polygonal cells with a compact cell\u2013cell arrangement. After coculturing ESCs and RPE cells, some ESC derivatives became immunopositive for rhodopsin. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated the expression of retina-related gene markers such as Pax6, CRX, IRBP, rhodopsin, rhodopsin kinase, and Muschx10A. When RA was added, a distinct increase in the expression of photoreceptor-specific proteins and genes was found. In addition, the differentiation of bipolar horizontal cells was demonstrated by protein and gene expression. The ESCs that were cocultured with RPE cells and treated with RA were transplanted into the renal capsule or intra-vitreal space of nude mice. Grafted ESC derivatives demonstrated extensive rhodopsin expression, and they survived and organized into recipient tissues, although they formed teratomas. Conclusion: These results indicate that coculturing ESCs with ESC-derived RPE cells is a useful and efficient method for inducing photoreceptors and providing an insight into the use of ESCs for retina regeneration.",

Induction of proliferation was analyzed in phh and several cell lines of hepatic and extrahepatic origin by the MTT and [3H]-thymidine assay.The kinetics of ERK phosphorylation showed clear differences, whereby rhALR caused a transient and EGF a permanent increase during the observation period of 60\u00a0min. For both, Akt and ERK phosphorylation, EGF caused a faster effect with maximal levels observed already after 2\u00a0min, whereas rhALR caused maximal phosphorylation between 10 and 15\u00a0min. Using the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478 we provide evidence of an EGF receptor independent induction of proliferation by rhALR. Furthermore, rhALR induced proliferation only in phh and the human liver derived cell lines HepG2 and Chang.

Increasing evidence indicates that miR regulate both the development and function of the nervous system. Moreover, deficiency in miR function has also been implicated in a number of neurological disorders. Expression profile analysis of miR is necessary to understand their complex role in the regulation of gene expression during the development and differentiation of cells. Here we present a comparative study of miR expression profiles in neuroblastoma, in cortical development, and in neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells. By microarray profiling in combination with real time PCR we show that miR-7 and miR-214 are modulated in neuronal differentiation (as compared to miR-1, -16 and -133a), and control neurite outgrowth in vitro.

The physiological roles of endocannabinoids in periodontal healing remain unknown. We observed upregulation of the expression of CB1/CB2 receptors localized on fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells in granulation tissue during wound healing in a wound-healing model in rats, as well as an increase in AEA levels in gingival crevicular fluid after periodontal surgery in human patients with periodontitis. In-vitro, the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) by AEA was significantly attenuated by AM251 and AM630, which are selective antagonists of CB1 and CB2, respectively. CP55940 (CB1/CB2 agonist) induced phosphorylation of the extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), and Akt in HGFs.

Increasing evidence indicates that tumor endothelial cells (TECs) are more relevant to the study of tumor angiogenesis than normal endothelial cells (NECs) because their morphologies and gene expression are different from NECs. However, it is challenging to isolate and culture large numbers of pure ECs from tumor tissue since the percentage of ECs is only about 1\u20132% and tumor cells and fibroblasts easily overgrow them. In addition, there has been concern that isolated TECs may lose their special phenotype once they are dissociated from tumor cells.In this study, we have successfully purified murine TECs from four different human tumor xenografts and NECs from murine dermal tissue. Isolated ECs expressed endothelial markers, such as CD31, VE-cadherin (CD144), and endoglin (CD105), for more than 3\u00a0months after isolation. TECs maintained tumor endothelial-specific markers, such as tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) and aminopeptidase N (APN), as in tumor blood vessels in vivo. In addition, TECs were more proliferative and motile than NECs. TECs showed a higher response to VEGF and higher expression of VEGF receptors-1 and -2 than NECs did. Stem cell antigen-1 was up-regulated in all four TECs, suggesting that they have a kind of stemness. Cultured TECs maintain distinct biological differences from NECs as in vivo. In conclusion, it was suggested that TECs are relevant material for tumor angiogenesis research.",

TRP channels are expressed in cardiomyocytes. Calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is also expressed in rat cardiac tissue and plays an important role in mediating cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, there are no data regarding the link between CaR and TRP channels in rat heart. In this study, in rat neonatal myocytes, by Ca2+ imaging, we found that the depletion of ER/SR Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin (TG) elicited a transient rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), followed by sustained increase depending on extracellular Ca2+. But, TRP channels inhibitor (SKF96365), not L-type channels or the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitors, inhibited [Ca2+]i relatively high. Then, we found that the stimulation of CaR with its activator gadolinium chloride (GdCl3) or by an increased extracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]o) increased the concentration of intracelluar Ca2+, whereas, the sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i was reduced in the presence of SKF96365. Similarly, the duration of [Ca2+]i increase was also shortened in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Western blot analysis showed that GdCl3 increased the expression of TRPC6, which was reversed by SKF96365. Additionally, SKF96365 reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by GdCl3. Our results suggested that CCE exhibited in rat neonatal myocytes and CaR activation induced Ca2+-permeable cationic channels TRPCs to gate the CCE, for which TRPC6 was one of the most likely candidates.

Here, we show that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Knock-down of endogenous HIPK2 increases the stability of \u03b2-catenin and results in the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus, consequently enhancing the expression of Wnt target genes and cell proliferation both in vivo and in cultured cells. HIPK2 inhibits TCF/LEF-mediated target gene activation via degradation of \u03b2-catenin. HIPK2 phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin at its Ser33 and Ser37 residues without the aid of a priming kinase. Substitutions of Ser33 and Ser37 for alanines abolished the degradation of \u03b2-catenin associated with HIPK2. In ex vivo mouse model, HIPK2 knock-down resulted in accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, thereby potentiated \u03b2-catenin-mediated cell proliferation and tumor formation. Furthermore, the axis duplication induced by the ectopic expression of \u03b2-catenin was blocked by co-injection of HIPK2 mRNAs into Xenopus embryos. Taken together, HIPK2 appears to function as a novel negative regulator of \u03b2-catenin through its phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation.",

We demonstrated that vitamin E was a novel nutritional enhancer of autophagy in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells. Supplementation of fresh hepatocytes with vitamin E (up to 100\u00a0\u03bcM) increased proteolysis significantly in the presence or absence of amino acids in a dose-dependent manner. The cytosolic LC3 ratio, a newly established index of autophagic flux, was significantly increased by vitamin E, strongly suggesting that the possible site of action is the LC3 conversion step, an early step in autophagosome formation. A typical antioxidant, \u03b1-lipoic acid, exerted autophagy suppression, while H2O2 stimulated autophagy. It is conceivable that autophagy was stimulated by oxidative stress and this stimulation was cancelled by cellular antioxidative effects. However, in our studies, vitamin E could have enhanced autophagy over-stimulation by H2O2, rather than suppress it. From these results, using a new cytosolic LC3 ratio, vitamin E increases autophagy by accelerating LC3 conversion through a new signaling pathway, emerging as a novel enhancer of autophagy.",

Recent findings give neurochemical evidence that extended cocaine self-administration in the rat give rise to an up-regulation of functional A2ARs in the nucleus accumbens that return to baseline expression levels during cocaine withdrawal. In the present work, the acute in vitro effects of a concentration of cocaine known to fully block the dopamine (DA) transporter without exerting any toxic actions were investigated on A2AR and D2LR formed heteromers in transiently co-transfected HEK-293T cells. In vitro treatment of cocaine was found to produce changes in D2R homodimers and in A2AR\u2013D2R heterodimers detected through bioluminescent energy transfer (BRET). Cocaine was found to produce a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in the BRETmax between A2AR\u2013D2LR heterodimers and D2LR homodimers, but not A2AR homodimers, indicating its effect on D2R. Cocaine was evaluated with regard to D2R binding using a human D2LR stable expressing CHO cell line and was found to produce an increase in the affinity of hD2LR for DA. At the level of G protein-coupling, cocaine produced a small, but significant increase in DA-stimulated binding of GTP\u03b3S. However, cocaine failed to modulate D2R agonist-induced inhibition of cAMP in stable hD2LR CHO cells or the gating of GIRK channels in oocytes. Taken together, these results indicate a direct and specific effect of a moderate concentration of cocaine on the DA D2LR, that results in enhanced agonist recognition, G protein-coupling and an altered conformational state of D2R homodimers and A2AR\u2013D2R heterodimers.",

Despite the absence of most immune processes and a substantive blood brain barrier, potent immune responses form during infection and autoimmunity. Astrocytes are innate immune sentinels that ensheath parenchymal blood vessels and sit at the gateway to the CNS parenchyma. Viral and bacterial infections trigger the influx of distinct leukocyte subsets. We show that astrocytes alone are sufficient for distinguishing between these two main types of infection and triggers release of relevant chemokines that relate to the microbe recognised. Bacterial-associated molecules induced the preferential expression of CCL2, CXCL1, CCL20 and CCL3 whilst a virus-associated dsRNA analogue preferentially up-regulated CXCL10 and CCL5. Thus, astrocytes can respond to infection in a distinct and appropriate manner suggesting they have the capacity to attract appropriate sets of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma. Astrocytes themselves are unable to respond to these chemokines since they were devoid of most chemokine receptors but expressed CXCR4, CXCR7 and CXCR6 at rest.

Microarray analysis results that are publically available were investigated and found transcript level of MYBC1 was not altered by overexpression of CBF1, CBF2, and CBF3, suggesting that MYBC1 is not down regulated by these CBF family members. Together, these results suggested that MYBC1is capable of negatively regulating the freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis in the CBF-independent pathway. In transgenic Arabidopsis carrying an MYBC1 promoter driven \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) construct, GUS activity was observed in all tissues and was relatively stronger in the vascular tissues. Fused MYBC1 and GFP protein revealed that MYBC1 was localized exclusively in the nuclear compartment.",

Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we isolated Xenopus ZMYND8 (Zinc finger and MYND domain containing 8) as an XRCOR2 interacting factor. XRCOR2 and XZMYND8 bind each other in co-immunoprecipitation assays and both of them can function as transcriptional repressors. XZMYND8 is co-expressed with XRCOR2 in the nervous system and overexpression of XZMYND8 inhibits neural differentiation in Xenopus embryos.

Inhibitors targeting them are vigorously developed and some of them are tested in the clinical setting. Amplifications of certain RTKs (c-Met, FGFR2 and ErbB2) have been associated with human gastric cancer progression. According to our genome-wide scans of genetic lesions in 34 gastric cancer cell lines using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping microarrays, we confirmed that the c-met locus was amplified in four gastric cancer cell lines (Hs746T, MKN45, NUGC4 and SNU5). It was reported that somatic mutation is occasionally detected in tumor samples of a certain type of cancer with gene amplification. Previous reports showed gastric cancers harbored mutations of FGFR2 and ErbB2, but c-Met oncogenic mutation had not yet been reported. We performed mutational analysis of the cytoplasmic domains of c-Met using the genome DNA of the gastric cancer cell lines, and found that Hs746T cells had a splice site mutation of exon 14. By cDNA sequencing and Western blotting, we showed that the mutation caused juxtamembrane domain deletion. Previously, this mutation had been detected only in lung cancer specimens and this deletion resulted in the loss of Cbl E3-ligase binding causing decreased ubiquitination and delayed down-regulation. In conclusion, four gastric cancer cell lines harbored amplification of c-met locus, and among them, Hs746T had a putative oncogenic mutation with amplification. This information will be useful for screening of inhibitors targeting gastric cancer with c-Met aberration.",

We found that up-regulation of SOX4 was inversely associated with the epigenetic silencing of miR-129-2 in gastric cancer, and restoration of miR-129-2 down-regulated SOX4 expression.

Therefore, we wanted to determine if extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) signaling is regulated by N/OFQ and associated with the effect of N/OFQ on the IK. In the current study, we tested if N/OFQ and two PKC activators [phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) and ingenol 3,20-dibenzoate (IDB)] affected the phosphorylation level of ERK-1/2 and its nuclear substrate, ETS-like transcription factor-1 (Elk-1), using western blots. In addition, we tested if ERK-1/2 affected the N/OFQ-induced inhibition of the IK by using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in acutely dissociated rat parietal cortical neurons. We found that N/OFQ, PDBu, and IDB increased the amount of phosphorylated ERK-1/2 and Elk-1; U0126, a specific inhibitor for ERK-1/2, attenuated the inhibitory effect of N/OFQ on the IK.

Sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by a four-subunit cohesin complex that connects sister chromatids by encircling them as molecular rings. Eco1 is an essential acetyltransferase required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Eco1 acetylates Smc3 and Mcd1 (Rad21) to establish cohesion during S phase and in response to DNA damage, respectively. Here, we show that Eco1 repress transcription in a dose-dependent manner. Mutations of zinc-finger domain or acetyltransferase domain did not significantly affect the transcriptional repression activity of Eco1. We observed that histone demethylase, Lsd1 interacts with Eco1 and is required for the transcriptional repression activity of Eco1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments show that Eco1 facilitates the demethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that Eco1 represses transcription by interacting with histone demethylase, LSD1 to convert chromatin to inactive state.",

The topological model shows that PglB possesses 11 transmembrane segments and two relatively large periplasmic regions other than the C-terminal domain, which is consistent with the proposal of the common Ncyt\u2013Cperi topology with 11 transmembrane segments for the STT3 family proteins.",

HXKII is extruded from the nucleus, at least in part, by the activity of the exportin 1/CrmA system, as demonstrated by increased nuclear expression and decreased cytoplasmic expression after incubation with leptomycin B, a bacterially-derived exportin inhibitor. Furthermore, cytoplasmic localization of HXKII is dependent on its enzymatic activity, as inhibiting HXKII activity using 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) increased nuclear localization.

We observed red edge excitation shift (REES) of 7\u00a0nm for the tryptophans in native BLA. Interestingly, we show here that BLA tryptophans exhibit considerable REES (8\u00a0nm) in its molten globule state. Taken together, these results indicate that tryptophan residues in BLA in native as well as molten globule states experience motionally restricted environment. We further show that even the denatured form of BLA exhibits a modest REES of 3\u00a0nm, indicating that the tryptophans are shielded from bulk solvent, even when denatured, due to the presence of residual structure around tryptophan(s). This is further supported by wavelength-dependent changes in fluorescence anisotropy and lifetime for BLA tryptophans.

     "abstract": "The most common heritable genetic disease in the United States, cystic fibrosis (CF), is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a chloride channel that interacts with and regulates a number of other proteins. The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa infects 80% of patients causing decreased pulmonary function and life expectancy. It is not known how malfunction of the chloride channel allows for preferential colonization of patients by a single pathogen. The hypothesis that CFTR interacts with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) to phagocytize bacteria was tested. A competitive antagonist of TLR4, MKLPS, was studied for its effect in gentamicin-protection-based bacterial invasion assays. Pre-incubation (15\u00a0min 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) with MKLPS did not alter the rate of phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by cultured epithelia. However, further studies with GFP-transfected P. aeruginosa revealed prominent antibiotic resistant microcolonies were formed. If CFTR is involved in phagocytosis of the bacteria, then internalization was predicted to decrease in iodide efflux. Surprisingly, cultured epithelia exposed to P. aeruginosa for 15\u00a0min showed increased cAMP-activated iodide efflux through CFTR. In addition, 15-min exposure to bacterial cell wall component, LPS, purified from P. aeruginosa also increased CFTR iodide efflux in a dose-dependent manner (50, 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL LPS had 25%, 37% and 47% increase). In a reversal of this phenomenon, shorter 5-min exposure to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL LPS resulted in a 25% decrease in forskolin-activated CFTR channel activity compared to controls. This data is consistent with a model in which CFTR is removed from the plasma membrane during phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa followed by recruitment of channels to the membrane to replace those removed during phagocytosis. More studies are needed to confirm this model, but this is the first report of a bacterial product causing a biphasic time-dependent and a dose-dependent alteration of CFTR channel activity.",

Elevated extracellular Ca2+ Ca o 2 + has been implicated in osteogenesis by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts; however, the role of Ca o 2 + signaling in odontogenesis remains unclear. We found that elevated Ca o 2 + increases bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 gene expression in human dental pulp cells. The increase was modulated not only at a transcriptional level but also at a post-transcriptional level, because treatment with Ca2+ increased the stability of BMP-2 mRNA in the presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of transcription. A similar increase in BMP-2 mRNA level was observed in other human mesenchymal cells from oral tissue; periodontal ligament cells and gingival fibroblasts. However, the latter cells exhibited considerably lower expression of BMP-2 mRNA compared with dental pulp cells and periodontal ligament cells. The BMP-2 increase was markedly inhibited by pretreatment with an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor, PD98059, and partially inhibited by the L-type Ca2+ channels inhibitor, nifedipine. However, pretreatment with nifedipine had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation triggered by Ca2+, suggesting that the Ca2+ influx from Ca2+ channels may operate independently of ERK signaling. Dental pulp cells do not express the transcript of Ca2+-sensing receptors (CaSR) and only respond slightly to other cations such as Sr2+ and spermine, suggesting that dental pulp cells respond to Ca o 2 + to increase BMP-2 mRNA expression in a manner different from CaSR and rather specific for Ca o 2 + among cations.",

Consequently, KG-1a cells display resistance to the induction of apoptosis by various chemotherapeutic drugs. Resistance to apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic drugs can be reversed by cyclosporine A, which effectively inhibits the activity of P-glycoprotein and BCRP, thus demonstrating ABC transporter-mediated drug resistance in KG-1a cells. However, KG-1a are highly sensitive to apoptosis induction by salinomycin, a polyether ionophore antibiotic that has recently been shown to kill human breast cancer stem cell-like cells and to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells displaying multiple mechanisms of drug and apoptosis resistance. Whereas KG-1a cells can be adapted to proliferate in the presence of apoptosis-inducing concentrations of bortezomib and doxorubicin, salinomycin does not permit long-term adaptation of the cells to apoptosis-inducing concentrations.

Rosiglitazone or ciglitazone, synthetic PPAR\u03b3 agonists, did not induce HtrA3 expression, and the PPAR\u03b3 antagonist GW9662 did not prevent 15dPGJ2 induction, suggesting that the up-regulation of HtrA3 by 15dPGJ2 is independent of PPAR\u03b3. The MEK/ERK inhibitor PD98059 dramatically repressed HtrA3 induction. Altogether, these data indicate that 15dPGJ2 is able to stimulate the expression of HtrA3 through an indirect mechanism involving the MEK/ERK pathway but independent of PPAR\u03b3. Our results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of HtrA3, a potential tumor suppressor gene.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) plays an important role in the detoxification of menadione (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, also known as vitamin K3). However, menadiol (2-methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol) formed from menadione by NQO1-mediated reduction continues to be an unstable substance, which undergoes the reformation of menadione with concomitant formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hence, we focused on the roles of phase II enzymes, with particular attention to UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), in the detoxification process of menadione. In this study, we established an HEK293 cell line stably expressing NQO1 (HEK293/NQO1) and HEK293/NQO1 cell lines with doxycycline (DOX)-regulated expression of UGT1A6 (HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A6) and UGT1A10 (HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A10), and evaluated the role of NQO1 and UGTs against menadione-induced cytotoxicity. Our results differed from those of previous studies. HEK293/NQO1 was the most sensitive cell line to menadione cytotoxicity among cell lines established in this study. These phenomena were also observed in HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A6 and HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A10 cells in which the expression of UGT was suppressed by DOX treatment. On the contrary, HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A6 and HEK293/NQO1/UGT1A10 cells without DOX treatment were resistant to menadione-induced cytotoxicity. These results demonstrated that NQO1 is not a detoxification enzyme for menadione and that UGT-mediated glucuronidation of menadiol is the most important detoxification process.",

To clarify the catalytic functions of PcALDHs, we isolated full-length cDNAs encoding these proteins and heterologously expressed the recombinant enzymes using a pET/Escherichia coli system. The open reading frames of both PcALDH1 and PcALDH2 consisted of 1503 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequences of both proteins showed high homologies with aryl-aldehyde dehydrogenases from other organisms and contained ten conserved domains of ALDHs. Moreover, a novel glycine-rich motif \u201cGxGxxxG\u201d was located at the NAD+-binding site. The recombinant PcALDHs catalyzed dehydrogenation reactions of several aryl-aldehyde compounds, including vanillin, to their corresponding aromatic acids.

Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is a member of the family of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase regulated Ser/Thr kinases. The active Akt regulates cell survival and proliferation; and inhibits apoptosis. In this study we found that curcumin induces apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells, as assessed by MTT assay, DNA ladder formation, PARP cleavage, p53 and Bax induction. At apoptotic inducing concentration, curcumin induces a dramatic Akt phosphorylation, accompanied by an increased phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2), which has been considered to be a pro-growth signaling molecule. Combining curcumin with PI3K inhibitor, LY290042, synergizes the apoptotic effect of curcumin. The inhibitor LY290042 was capable of attenuating curcumin-induced Akt phosphorylation and activation of GSK3\u03b2. All together, our data suggest that blocking the PI3K/Akt survival pathway sensitizes the curcumin-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells.",

Results show that for 20\u201330% GM1, hydrated BMP:GM1 mixtures spontaneously form small spherical vesicles with diameters \u223c100\u00a0nm and a narrow size distribution profile.

All samples were prepared at pH 5.5 to mimic the lumen acidity of the late endosome where BMP is an essential component of intraendosomal vesicle budding, lipid sorting and trafficking. These findings indicate that GM1 and BMP under a limited concentration range spontaneously form small vesicles of homogeneous size in an energy independent manner without the need of protein templating.

Flavin reductase accompanied by the ferric reductase activities of the two FHbs were observed in correspondence with this expression. The reductase activities of the FHbs were attributed to their C-terminal flavin reductase domains. The reduced intracellular free iron can subsequently promote oxidative damage by accelerating the Fenton reaction in the cytosol and mitochondria (corresponding to the subcellular localizations of the two FHbs). This study is the first to show that fungal FHbs have a deleterious effect on oxidative protection, and suggests that the accelerated Fenton reaction induced by FHbs might be responsible for this effect.",

     "abstract": "Leptin can enhance thymopoiesis and modulate the T-cell immune response. However, it remains controversial whether these effects correlate with the expression of leptin receptor, ObR. We herein addressed this issue by using in vivo animal models and in vitro culture systems. Leptin treatment in both ob/ob mice and normal young mice induced increases of CD4 SP thymocytes in thymus and CD4 T cells in the periphery. Interestingly, expression of the long form ObR was significantly restricted to DN, DP and CD4 SP, but not CD8 SP thymocytes. Moreover, in the reaggregated DP thymocyte cultures with leptin plus TSCs, leptin profoundly induced differentiation of CD4 SP but not CD8 SP thymocytes, suggesting that the effects of leptin on thymocyte differentiation might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor in developing thymocytes. Surprisingly, ObR expression was markedly higher in peripheral CD4 T cells than that in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, leptin treatment with or without IL-2 and PHA had preferential effects on cell proliferation of CD4 T cells compared to that of CD8 T cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the effects of leptin on differentiation and proliferation of CD4 T cells might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor.",

Here, we report a cell-based assay system for detecting inhibitory activity against tankyrase 1. We found that overexpression of the human tankyrase 1 gene causes a growth defect in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Chemicals that restore the growth defect phenotype can be identified as potential tankyrase 1 inhibitors. We performed a high-throughput screen using this system, and identified flavone as a compound that restores the growth of yeast cells overexpressing tankyrase 1. Indeed, flavone inhibited poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins caused by overexpression of tankyrase 1 in yeast cells. This system allows rapid identification of inhibitory activity against tankyrase 1 and is amenable to high-throughput screening using robotics.",

We investigated viral mutations occurring during transition and elucidated their virological and immunological significance. Full-length HBV DNA sequences were serially determined in a chronic HBV carrier from the immunotolerant to immunoactive phase. Viral replicative competence was examined by transfection analysis. HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response was evaluated by coculture of CD8+ T cells with autologous dendritic cells followed by interferon-\u03b3 Elispot assay. Eleven point mutations and two deletions appeared around the onset of the immunoactive phase. Viral replicative competence declined significantly after the onset of active hepatitis. Examination of the CD8+ T cell response against two putative T-cell epitopes, which contained substituted amino acids from the immunotolerant to immunoactive phase, showed that mutant HBV epitopes gave a lesser T cell response than wild-type HBV ones. In summary, point mutations and deletions may occur prior to or concurrent with the onset of the immunoactive phase during chronic HBV infection. These mutations may result in a significant decrease in both viral replicative competence and HBV-specific CD8+ T cell response, suggesting a possible adaptation for the maintenance of viral persistence.",

However, it is difficult to confirm this hypothesis because both the EMD and the amelogenins are complex mixtures of multiple proteins. Further adding to the difficulties is the fact that periodontal tissue regeneration involves various types of cells and a sequence of associated cellular events including the attachment, migration and proliferation of various cells. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of a 25-kDa recombinant porcine amelogenin (rPAm) on primarily cultured periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLF), gingival fibroblasts (GF) and gingival epithelial cells (GEC). The cells were treated with 25-kDa recombinant porcine amelogenin at a concentration of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. We found that rPAm significantly promoted the proliferation and migration of PDLF, but not their adhesion. Similarly, the proliferation and adhesion of GF were significantly enhanced by treatment with rPAm, while migration was greatly inhibited. Interestingly, this recombinant protein inhibited the growth rate, cell adhesion and migration of GEC. These data suggest that rPAm may play an essential role in periodontal regeneration through the activation of periodontal fibroblasts and inhibition of the cellular behaviors of gingival epithelial cells.",

Furthermore, we generated cisplatin-resistant cells and found that resistant cells express a higher level of activated Akt as compared to their cisplatin sensitive counterparts. Importantly, inhibition of Akt or mTOR sensitized resistant cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

To further investigate the role of miRNAs in cell growth and differentiation, we focused on miR-22, a miRNA induced by TPA in the HL-60 leukemia cell line model of monocytic differentiation. TPA-induced miR-22 transcription was found to be downstream of the protein kinase c (PKC)\u2013extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling module, a pathway central to the growth and differentiation of many different cell types. Enforced miR-22 expression inhibited the growth of several different cancer cell lines, causing an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.

In this study, we investigated the state of RyR2-bound CaM and channel dysfunctions using a knock-in (KI) mouse model with CPVT-linked RyR2 mutation (R2474S). Without added effectors, the affinity of CaM binding to the RyR2 was indistinguishable between KI and WT hearts. In response to cAMP (1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), the RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser2808 increased in both WT and KI hearts to the same extent. However, cAMP caused a significant decrease of the CaM-binding affinity in KI hearts, but the affinity was unchanged in WT. Dantrolene restored a normal level of CaM-binding affinity in the cAMP-treated KI hearts, suggesting that defective inter-domain interaction between the N-terminal domain and the central domain of the RyR2 (the target of therapeutic effect of dantrolene) is involved in the cAMP-induced reduction of the CaM-binding affinity. In saponin-permeabilized cardiomyocytes, the addition of cAMP increased the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks to a significantly larger extent in KI cardiomyocytes than in WT cardiomyocytes, whereas the addition of a high concentration of CaM attenuated the aberrant increase of Ca2+ sparks. In conclusion, CPVT mutation causes defective inter-domain interaction, significant reduction in the ability of CaM binding to the RyR2, spontaneous Ca2+ leak, and then lethal arrhythmia.",

BLT1 mRNA was highly upregulated in the spinal cord of EAE mice, especially during the induction phase. BLT1\u2212/\u2212 mice had delayed onset and less severe symptoms of EAE than BLT1+/+ mice. Additionally, inflammatory cells were recruited to the spinal cord of asymptomatic BLT1+/+, but not BLT1\u2212/\u2212 mice before the onset of disease. Ex vivo studies showed that both the proliferation and the production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-17 and IL-6 were impaired in BLT1\u2212/\u2212 cells, as compared with BLT1+/+ cells. Thus, we suggest that BLT1 exacerbates EAE by regulating the migration of inflammatory cells and TH1/TH17 immune responses. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other TH17-mediated diseases.",

     "abstract": "The expression of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli often leads to inactive aggregated proteins known as the inclusion bodies. To date, the best available tool has been the use of fusion tags, including the carbohydrate-binding protein; e.g., the maltose-binding protein (MBP) that enhances the solubility of recombinant proteins. However, none of these fusion tags work universally with every partner protein. We hypothesized that galectins, which are also carbohydrate-binding proteins, may help as fusion partners in folding the mammalian proteins in E. coli. Here we show for the first time that a small soluble lectin, human galectin-1, one member of a large galectin family, can function as a fusion partner to produce soluble folded recombinant human glycosyltransferase, \u03b2-1,4-galactosyltransferase-7 (\u03b24Gal-T7), in E. coli. The enzyme \u03b24Gal-T7 transfers galactose to xylose during the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide linker sequence attached to a Ser residue of proteoglycans. Without a fusion partner, \u03b24Gal-T7 is expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. We have designed a new vector construct, pLgals1, from pET-23a that includes the sequence for human galectin-1, followed by the Tev protease cleavage site, a 6\u00d7 His-coding sequence, and a multi-cloning site where a cloned gene is inserted. After lactose affinity column purification of galectin-1-\u03b24Gal-T7 fusion protein, the unique protease cleavage site allows the protein \u03b24Gal-T7 to be cleaved from galectin-1 that binds and elutes from UDP-agarose column. The eluted protein is enzymatically active, and shows CD spectra comparable to the folded \u03b24Gal-T1. The engineered galectin-1 vector could prove to be a valuable tool for expressing other proteins in E. coli.",

In this report, we show that serine282 residue of Nox activator 1 (NoxA1) is phosphorylated by Erk in response to EGF resulting in desensitization of Nox1 activity. Specifically, murine NoxA1 is detected as two independent protein bands in SDS PAGE, and the form of protein with higher mobility shifted to and merged with the one with lower mobility in response to EGF treatment. Pretreatment with PD98059 resulted in inhibition of NoxA1 migration in response to EGF indicating that Erk was involved in the process. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that S282A mutant but not S239A mutant failed to respond to EGF, demonstrating that serine282 is the target amino acid of Erk. Expression of S282A mutant of NoxA1 in these cells led to increased superoxide anion production in response to EGF compared to expression of the wild type, whereas the expression of S282E, a phosphomimetic mutant, resulted in significantly decreased superoxide anion generation. We also tested whether the phosphorylation of serine282 of NoxA1 affects Rac activation. Expression of S282A mutant NoxA1 up-regulated the Rac activity, whereas expression of S282E mutant led to the abrogation of Rac activation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that phosphorylation of NoxA1 is a part of the feedback mechanism that functions through activation of Rac with a net outcome of negative modulation of Nox1 activity.",

Previously, we reported that IRS-3 is localized to both cytosol and nucleus, and possesses transcriptional activity. In the present study, we identified Bcl-3 as a novel binding protein to IRS-3. Bcl-3 is a nuclear protein, which forms a complex with the homodimer of p50 NF-\u03baB, leading to enhancement of transcription through p50 NF-\u03baB. We found that Bcl-3 interacts with the pleckstrin homology domain and the phosphotyrosine binding domain of IRS-3, and that IRS-3 interacts with the ankyrin repeat domain of Bcl-3. In addition, IRS-3 augmented the binding activity of p50 to the NF-\u03baB DNA binding site, as well as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB. Lastly, IRS-3 enhanced NF-\u03baB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene induction and consequently inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced cell death.

The P56S missense mutation of the VAPB protein is linked to a hereditary form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS8), and the pathogenesis of ALS8 has remained enigmatic. We report the cloning of five novel splice variants of the human VAPB gene, all of which are expressed at the mRNA level in the human nervous system. When transfected into human HEK293 or SH-SY5Y cells, two of these variants (VAPB-2 and VAPB-4,5) were readily detectable by immunoblotting whereas two variants (VAPB-3 and VAPB-3,4) became detectable after proteasomal inhibition, a condition commonly found in neurodegenerative diseases. Interestingly, one of these novel VAPB variants, VAPB-2, co-immunoprecipitated with wt-VAPB. However, so far none of these splice variants could be detected by immunoblotting of lysates from selected human tissues, suggesting that in vivo, the proteins translated from the variant VAPB mRNAs are quickly degraded or, alternatively, the expressed proteins are below detection limit of the available antibodies. We speculate that under conditions of proteasomal inhibition, as encountered in many neurodegenerative diseases including ALS, variant VAPB proteins might accumulate in affected cells and contribute to ALS pathogenesis.",

Molecular processes underlying the ischemic injury of inhibitory neurons remain to be elusive, which we investigated by biochemical manipulations with cellular imaging and patch clamp at GFP-labeled GABAergic cells in cortical slices. Ischemia induces Ca2+ elevation, acidosis and dysfunction in GABAergic cells. An elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ or H+ impairs the encoding of action potentials in these neurons. The effects of Ca2+ and H+ are additive in nature and occlude ischemic outcomes. Ischemia impairs spike production through prolonging spike refractory periods and raising threshold potentials. Therefore, calcium toxicity and acidosis during ischemia synergistically impair the dynamics of sodium channels and function of cortical GABAergic neurons, which lead to neural excitotoxicity.

Moreover, we demonstrate that high expression levels of COX-2 and PGE2 promote the secretion of Wnt inhibitors from prostate cancer cells.

First, artificial analogs of mycalamide A in a chemical array bound specifically with high affinity to NP. Second, the compounds inhibited multiplication of the influenza virus. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance imaging experiments demonstrated that the binding activity of each compound to NP correlated with its antiviral activity. Finally, it was shown that these compounds bound NP within the N-terminal 110-amino acid region but their binding abilities were dramatically reduced when the N-terminal 13-amino acid tail was deleted, suggesting that the compounds might bind to this region, which mediates the nuclear transport of NP and its binding to viral RNA. These data suggest that compound binding to the N-terminal 13-amino acid tail region may inhibit viral replication by inhibiting the functions of NP. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that chemical arrays are convenient tools for the screening of viral product inhibitors.",

These flavonoids block the TNF-\u03b1-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB and ERK pathways. Moreover, hesperetin and naringenin prevent TNF-\u03b1 from downregulating the transcription of two antilipolytic genes, perilipin and PDE3B.

In contrast, the inhibition of the NF-\u03baB pathway by hesperetin and naringenin suppresses the transcription of IL-6, which induces FFA secretion in an autocrine manner.

Three siblings aged 10, 9 and 7\u00a0years from a consanguineous family were found to be affected by severe or profound hearing impairment that was only present when they were febrile. The non-febrile patients had only mild if any hearing impairment. Electrophysiological tests revealed auditory neuropathy. Mapping with microsatellite markers revealed a compatible linkage in the DFNB9/OTOF region in the family, prompting us to run a molecular analysis of the 48 exons and of the OTOF intron\u2013exon boundaries. This study revealed a novel mutation p.Glu1804del in exon 44 of OTOF. The mutation was found to be homozygous in the three patients and segregated with the hearing impairment within the family.

Two signal transduction pathways, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signal transduction pathway, have been shown to have an important role in regulating osteoblast and osteoclast function and to be involved in mechanotransduction. Therefore, dysfunction of these pathways can lead to osteoporotic bone loss. However, less is known about the modulation of gene expression by the interaction of these pathways in response to mechanical strain. We performed in vitro stretch experiments using osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells to study the effect of both pathways and mechanical strain on the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2), which is involved in the synthesis of prostaglandins, modulators of bone formation and resorption. Using specific agonists and antagonists, we demonstrated a regulation by an interaction of these pathways in mechantransduction. Estradiol (E2) had a sensitizing effect on mechanically induced Cox-2 expression, which seemed to be ligand-specific as it could be abolished using the antiestrogen ICI182,780. However, mechanical strain in the presence of Wnt signaling activators diminished both the E2 sensitizing effect and the stimulatory effect of Wnt signaling in the absence of strain.

Rosiglitazone, a synthetic ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors \u03b3 used in the treatment of type-2 diabetes, has been shown to reduce tumor growth and metastasis in human cancer cells, and may have the potential to be used as a radiosensitizer in radiotherapy for human colorectal cancer cells. In this study, rosiglitazone treatment significantly reduced the cell viability of p53-wild type HCT116 cells but not p53-mutant HT-29 cells. Interestingly, rosiglitazone pretreatment enhanced radiosensitivity in p53-mutant HT-29 cells but not HCT116 cells, and prolonged radiation-induced G2/M arrest and enhanced radiation-induced cell growth inhibition in HT-29 cells. Pretreatment with rosiglitazone also suppressed radiation-induced H2AX phosphorylation in response to DNA damage and AKT activation for cell survival; on the contrary, rosiglitazone pretreatment enhanced radiation-induced caspase-8, -9, and -3 activation and PARP cleavage in HT-29 cells. In addition, pretreatment with a pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, attenuated the levels of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in radiation-exposed cancer cells in combination with rosiglitazone pretreatment. Our results provide proof for the first time that rosiglitazone suppresses radiation-induced survival signals and DNA damage response, and enhances the radiation-induced apoptosis signaling cascade. These findings can assist in the development of rosiglitazone as a novel radiosensitizer.",

Its function in macrophage motility, however, remains to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of IGF-1 on macrophage migration, its signaling pathways and the involvement of integrins and/or matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).Migration checker-box experiments demonstrated that IGF-1 induced chemotaxis in human THP-1/macrophages. IGF-1 induced migration was inhibited by RGD-containing peptides and the \u03b1v\u03b23-blocking antibody LM609, but was unaffected by the MMP-inhibitor GM6001. Immunoblotting demonstrated that IGF-1 did not affect the activation of MMPs or TIMPs, nor did it increase \u03b1v-integrin protein levels. However, IGF-1 induced recruitment of \u03b1v\u03b23, as well as trans-location of the integrin adaptor protein phospho-paxillin to focal adhesion sites. Pharmacological blocking experiments with specific inhibitors of Akt, PKC and p38 MAP-kinase revealed that IGF-1-dependent activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, and consecutively IGF-1 facilitated migration, required IGF-1/IGF-1R-mediated PI3-kinase/PKC/p38-dependent integrin inside-out signaling.IGF-1 plays a vital role in macrophage migration critically implicated in tissue inflammation. This involves activation of integrins and focal adhesion formation via inside-out PI3-kinase/PKC/p38-dependent signaling, but does not require MMP activation.",

Here, we explored the potential of microRNAs as biomarkers for coronary artery disease (CAD) and acute coronary syndromes.Using real-time PCR-based profiling, we determined the microRNA signature of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from stable and unstable CAD patients and unaffected controls. 129 of 157 microRNAs measured were expressed by PBMCs and low variability between separate PBMC pools was observed. The presence of CAD in general coincided with a marked 5-fold increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the relative expression level of miR-135a, while the expression of miR-147 was 4-fold decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in PBMCs from CAD patients as compared to controls, resulting in a 19-fold higher miR-135a/miR-147 ratio (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in CAD. MicroRNA/target gene/biological function linkage analysis suggested that the change in PBMC microRNA signature in CAD patients is probably associated with a change in intracellular cadherin/Wnt signaling. Interestingly, unstable angina pectoris patients could be discriminated from stable patients based upon their relatively high expression level of a cluster of three microRNAs including miR-134, miR-198, and miR-370, suggesting that the microRNA signatures can be used to identify patients at risk for acute coronary syndromes.The present study is the first to show that microRNA signatures can possibly be utilized to identify patients exhibiting atherosclerotic CAD in general and those at risk for acute coronary syndromes.

To initiate apoptosis and certain other forms of cell death, mitochondria become permeable such that cytochrome c and other pre-apoptotic molecules resident inside the mitochondria enter the cytosol and activate apoptotic cascades. We have shown recently that VDAC1 interacts directly with never-in-mitosis A related kinase 1 (Nek1), and that Nek1 phosphorylates VDAC1 on Ser193 to prevent excessive cell death after injury. How this phosphorylation regulates the activity of VDAC1, however, has not yet been reported. Here, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) and cytochrome c conductance studies to examine the configuration of VDAC1 before and after phosphorylation by Nek1. Wild-type VDAC1 assumes an open configuration, but closes and prevents cytochrome c efflux when phosphorylated by Nek1. A VDAC1-Ser193Ala mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by Nek1 under identical conditions, remains open and constitutively allows cytochrome c efflux. Conversely, a VDAC1-Ser193Glu mutant, which mimics constitutive phosphorylation by Nek1, remains closed by AFM and prevents cytochrome c leakage in the same liposome assays. Our data provide a mechanism to explain how Nek1 regulates cell death by affecting the opening and closing of VDAC1.",

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is refractory autoimmune disease characterized by the production of a wide variety of autoantibodies and immune complex (IC)-mediated lupus nephritis. Among several SLE-prone strains of mice, BXSB is unique in terms of the disease-associated monocytosis in periphery and the reduced frequency of marginal zone B (MZ B) cells in spleen. In the present study, we examined the effect of FTY720 on lupus nephritis of BXSB mice. FTY720 treatment resulted in a marked decrease in lymphocytes, but not monocytes, in peripheral blood, and caused relocalization of marginal zone B (MZ B) cells into the follicle in the spleen. These changes did not affect the production of autoantibodies, thus IgG and C3 were deposited in glomeruli in FTY720-treated mice. Despite these IC depositions, FTY720-treated mice showed survival advantage with the improved proteinuria. Histological analysis revealed that FTY720 suppressed mesangial cell proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration.

     "abstract": "Whereas the hallmark of wild-type p53 is its tumor suppressor activity, tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins can exert novel anti-apoptotic gain-of-function activities, which confer a selective advantage upon tumor cells harboring such mutations. We investigated the molecular mechanisms of mutant p53 gain-of-function in hepatocellular carcinoma with special emphasis on the interaction of mutant p53 gain-of-function proteins with the p53 family members p63 and p73. Mutant forms of p53, namely the hot-spot mutants p53R143A, p53R175D, p53R175H, p53R248W, and p53R273H, acquire anti-apoptotic gain-of-function in hepatocellular carcinoma by repressing the activity of genes regulating both, the extrinsic apoptosis pathway initiated by ligation of death receptors and the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. In the presence of mutated p53, the CD95L-CD95 apoptotic pathway is markedly attenuated. This is due to repression of CD95 gene transcription by mutant p53. In addition, these mutants repress the expression of the Bax gene and attenuate mitochondria-mediated apoptosis signaling. Furthermore, and of clinical relevance, these gain-of-function mutants are anti-apoptotic due to their inhibitory interaction with the pro-apoptotic p53 family members TAp63 and TAp73. p53 gain-of-function mutants significantly decrease activation of pro-apoptotic target genes by wild-type p53, TAp63, and TAp73. This contributes to the ability of cancer cells to withstand DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Interference with the interaction of p53 gain-of-function mutants with TAp63 or TAp73 may thus sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma to elimination by therapy.",

However, few studies have explored the effect of Th17/Treg balance in plaque destabilization and the onset of ACS. To explore the shift of Th17/Treg balance in ACS patients and the effect of ox-LDL on the balance, we examined the frequencies of Th17 and Treg cells, key transcription factors and relevant cytokines in patients with AMI, UA, stable angina (SA) and controls. We analysed the correlations of serum ox-LDL to Th17/Treg frequency, and the effects of ox-LDL on Th17/Treg cells in vitro.

Serum ox-LDL positively correlated with the frequency of Th17 cells and negatively correlated with the frequency of Treg cells. In vitro incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls with ox-LDL resulted in a significant reduction of Treg cells and a significant elevation of Th17 cells in a dose- and time-dependant manner. Treg and Th17 cells from ACS patients were significantly more susceptible to ox-LDL-mediated alterations.

We examined the effects of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), an important regulator of bone formation, on osteoblastic differentiation of VSMC. Stimulation of cultured rat aortic SMC (RASMC) with FGF-2 induced the expression of the osteoblastic markers osteopontin (OPN) and osteocalcin. Luciferase assays showed that FGF-2 induced osteocyte-specific element (OSE)-dependent transcription. Downregulation of Runx2 by siRNA repressed the basal and FGF-2-stimulated expression of the OPN gene in RASMC. FGF-2 produced hydrogen peroxide in RASMC, as evaluated by fluorescent probe. Induction of OPN expression by FGF-2 was inhibited not only by PD98059 (MEK1 inhibitor) and PP1 (c-Src inhibitor), but also by an antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine. Nuclear extracts from FGF-2-treated RASMC exhibited increased DNA-binding of Runx2 to its target sequence. Immunohistochemistry of human coronary atherectomy specimens and calcified aortic tissues showed that expression of FGF receptor-1 and Runx2 was colocalized. In conclusion, these results suggest that FGF-2 plays a role in inducing osteoblastic differentiation of VSMC by activating Runx2 through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent- and oxidative stress-sensitive-signaling pathways.",

     "abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax, caused by the bacterial infection of Bacillus anthracis, posts a significant bioterrorism threat by its relatively high mortality rate in humans. Different from inhalational anthrax by the route of infection, accumulating evidence indicates the bypass of vegetative bacteria across GI epithelium is required to initiate GI anthrax. Previously, we reported that purified anthrolysin O (ALO), instead of tripartite anthrax edema and lethal toxins, is capable of disrupting gut epithelial tight junctions and barrier function in cultured cells. Here, we show that ALO can disrupt intestinal tissue barrier function in an ex vivo mouse model. To explore the effects of ALO in a cell culture model of B. anthracis infection, we showed that anthrax bacteria can effectively reduce the monolayer integrity of human Caco-2 brush-border expressor (C2BBE) cells based on the reduced transepithelial resistance and the increased leakage of fluorescent dye. This disruption is likely caused by tight junction dysfunction observed by the reorganization of the tight junction protein occludin. Consequently, we observe significant passage of vegetative anthrax bacteria across C2BBE cells. This barrier disruption and bacterial crossover requires ALO since ALO-deficient B. anthracis strains fail to induce monolayer dysfunction and allow the passage of anthrax bacteria. Together these findings point to a pivotal role for ALO within the establishment of GI anthrax infection and the initial bypass of the epithelial barrier.",

Here we performed a comprehensive study of the LEDGF 361\u2013370 mechanism of action in vitro, in cells and in vivo. Alanine scan, fluorescence anisotropy binding studies, homology modeling and NMR studies demonstrated that all residues in LEDGF 361\u2013370 contribute to IN binding and inhibition. Kinetic studies in cells showed that LEDGF 361\u2013370 specifically inhibited integration of viral cDNA.

The mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension is incompletely understood and has traditionally been attributed to promiscuous activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol. Multiple lines of evidence, however, point to the glucocorticoid receptor as an important mediator as well. We have developed a mouse model of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension, which is dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor. To determine the site(s) of glucocorticoid receptor action relevant to the development of hypertension, we studied glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in a mouse with a tissue-specific knockout of the glucocorticoid receptor in the distal nephron. Although knockout mice had similar body weight, nephron number and renal histology compared to littermate controls, their baseline blood pressure was mildly elevated. Nevertheless, distal nephron glucocorticoid receptor knockout mice and controls had a similar hypertensive response to dexamethasone. Urinary excretion of electrolytes, both before and after administration of glucocorticoid was also indistinguishable between the two groups. We conclude that the glucocorticoid receptor in the distal nephron is not necessary for the development or maintenance of dexamethasone-induced hypertension in our model.",

Maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial for initiation of primary immune responses and is regulated by several stimuli. In this study, the role of OSM in the phenotypic and functional maturation of DCs was evaluated in vitro. Stimulation with OSM upregulated the expression of CD80, CD86, MHC class I and MHC class II and reduced the endocytic capacity of immature DCs. Moreover, OSM induced the allogeneic immunostimulatory capacity of DCs by stimulating the production of the Th1-promoting cytokine IL-12. OSM also increased the production of IFN-\u03b3 by T cells in mixed-lymphocyte reactions, which would be expected to contribute to the Th1 polarization of the immune response. The expression of surface markers and cytokine production in DCs was mediated by both the MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways. Taken together, these results indicate that OSM may play a role in innate immunity and in acquired immunity by enhancing DCs maturation and promoting Th1 immune responses.",

In RTT patients and Mecp2-null (Mecp2\u2212/Y) mice, norepinephrine (NE) content drops significantly, which may play a role in breathing arrhythmia, sleep disorders and sudden death. However, the underlying mechanisms for the NE defect are not fully understood. The NE defect may result from decreased NE biosynthesis, loss of catecholaminergic neurons or both. Although deficiency in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) has been demonstrated, it is possible that dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase (DBH), the critical enzyme converting dopamine to NE, is also affected. To test these possibilities, we studied DBH expressions in pontine catecholaminergic neurons of Mecp2\u2212/Y mice identified with breathing abnormalities. In comparison to the wild type, Mecp2\u2212/Y mice at 2\u00a0months of age showed \u223c50% decrease in the expressions of DBH and TH, at both protein and mRNA levels in the locus coeruleus (LC) region. Consistently, DBH and TH immunoreactivity was markedly decreased in LC neurons of Mecp2\u2212/Y mice. No evidence was found for selective deficiency in TH- or DBH-containing neurons in Mecp2\u2212/Y mice, as almost all TH-positive cells expressed DBH. By counting TH-immunoreactive cells in the LC, we found that the Mecp2\u2212/Y mice lost only \u223c5% of the catecholaminergic neurons as compared to wild-type, although their LC volume shrank by \u223c15%.

The present study demonstrates that the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin selectively inhibits androgen-responsive growth of prostate cancer cells. Camptothecin strikingly inhibited mutated and wild-type AR protein expression in LNCaP and PC-3/AR cells. This inhibition coincided with decreased androgen-mediated AR phosphorylation at Ser81 and reduced androgen-mediated AR transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, camptothecin disrupted the association between AR and heat shock protein 90 and impeded binding of the synthetic androgen [3H]R1881 to AR in LNCaP cells. Camptothecin also blocked androgen-induced AR nuclear translocation, leading to downregulation of the AR target gene PSA. In addition to decreasing the intracellular and secreted prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, camptothecin markedly inhibited androgen-stimulated PSA promoter activity. Collectively, our data reveal that camptothecin not only serves as a traditional genotoxic agent but, by virtue of its ability to target and disrupt AR, may also be a novel candidate for the treatment of prostate cancer.",

Since it takes 2\u20133\u00a0weeks for hMSCs to differentiate into adipocytes using conventional culture methods, the development of methods to induce faster differentiation into adipocytes is required. In this study we optimized the culture conditions for adipocyte induction to achieve a shorter cultivation time for the induction of adipocyte differentiation in bone marrow-derived hMSCs. Briefly, we used a cocktail of dexamethasone, insulin, methylisobutylxanthine (DIM) plus a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 agonist, rosiglitazone (DIMRo) as a new adipogenic differentiation medium. We successfully shortened the period of cultivation to 7\u20138\u00a0days from 2\u20133\u00a0weeks. We also found that rosiglitazone alone was unable to induce adipocyte differentiation from hMSCs in vitro. However, rosiglitazone appears to enhance hMSC adipogenesis in the presence of other hormones and/or compounds, such as DIM. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of TGF-\u03b21 on adipogenesis could be investigated using DIMRo-treated hMSCs. We conclude that our rapid new culture method is very useful in measuring the effect of molecules that affect adipogenesis in hMSCs.",

This approach fails completely for about 30% of genes, and only 3% have any supporting experimental evidence. According to supporting evidence, genes are known to be regulated by a common transcriptional regulatory element if the expression profiles of the coregulated genes are highly correlated. We propose a new conceptual approach and method for nonhomology-based function-prediction methods for putative genes and hypothetical proteins. We have established patterns, also considered to be combinations, of common transcriptional regulatory elements for functional classes of mouse (Mus musculus) transcripts (the TREP_DB).

We demonstrate that galectin-9 induces osteoblast differentiation through the CD44/Smad signaling pathway in the absence of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Galectin-9 increases alkaline phosphatase activities in human osteoblasts and induces the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and translocation of Smad4 to the nucleus in the absence of BMPs. Galectin-9 also induces binding of Smad4 to the Id1 promoter and increases its activity. Anti-CD44 antibody inhibits Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation by galectin-9. Galectin-9 binds to CD44 and induces the formation of a CD44/BMP receptor complex. Because Smad1 is phosphorylated by BMP receptors, we propose that formation of the CD44/BMP receptor complex induced by galectin-9 may provide a trigger for the activation of Smads.",

The compound has low affinity (Ki\u00a0=\u00a07600\u00a0nM) for human CB2 receptors. In vivo, CP-945,598 reverses four cannabinoid agonist-mediated CNS-driven responses (hypo-locomotion, hypothermia, analgesia, and catalepsy) to a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist. CP-945,598 exhibits dose and concentration-dependent anorectic activity in two models of acute food intake in rodents, fast-induced re-feeding and spontaneous, nocturnal feeding. CP-945,598 also acutely stimulates energy expenditure in rats and decreases the respiratory quotient indicating a metabolic switch to increased fat oxidation. CP-945,598 at 10\u00a0mg/kg promoted a 9%, vehicle adjusted weight loss in a 10\u00a0day weight loss study in diet-induced obese mice. Concentration/effect relationships combined with ex vivo brain CB1 receptor occupancy data were used to evaluate efficacy in behavioral, food intake, and energy expenditure studies. Together, these in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo data indicate that CP-945,598 is a novel CB1 receptor competitive antagonist that may further our understanding of the endocannabinoid system.",

This function requires the sensing of such stresses by a hitherto unknown mechanism. Here, we characterized Grx3/PICOT as iron\u2013sulfur protein. The protein binds two bridging [2Fe\u20132S] clusters in a homodimeric complex with the active site cysteinyl residues of its two monothiol glutaredoxin domains and glutathione bound non-covalently to the Grx domains. Co-immunoprecipitation of 55-iron with Grx3/PICOT from Jurkat cells suggested the presence of these cofactors under physiological conditions. The [2Fe\u20132S]2+ clusters were not redox active, instead they were lost upon treatment of the holo protein with ferricyanide or S-nitroso glutathione. This redox-induced dissociation of the Grx3/PICOT holo complex may be a mechanism of Grx3/PICOT activation in response to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.",

LDL is mainly oxidized in the subendothelial layer of the vascular wall and then can be taken up by vascular endothelial cells. However, little is known about the intracellular processing of the damaged LDL. Previous studies found that autophagy is involved in degrading oxidized proteins under oxidative stress conditions in Arabidopsis thaliana, while ox-LDL can activate autophagy in EA.hy926 endothelial cells, suggesting a possible role of autophagy in the degradation of ox-LDL by endothelial cells. The present study showed that ox-LDL aggregated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and brought about an increase in the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Ox-LDL-induced increase in the autophagic level was blocked by treatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine and increased by the autophagy inducer rapamycin, while the aggregation of Dil-labled ox-LDL was increased by 3-methyladenine and decreased by rapamycin. In addition, Dil-labeled ox-LDL colocalized with the autophagy marker MDC, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (MAP1-LC3), and lysosome-associated membrane protein 2a (lamp2a). HUVECs treated with Dil-labeled-ox-LDL showed a much greater degree of overlap of MAP1-LC3 and Lamp2a than control. The results suggest that ox-LDL activates the autophagic lysosome pathway in HUVECs through the LC3/beclin1 pathway, leading to the degradation of ox-LDL.",

A frequency distribution of the molecular volumes of antibody decorated channels had a peak at 1305\u00a0nm3, close to the expected size of a TRPM8 tetramer. The frequency distribution of angles between pairs of bound antibodies had two peaks, at 93\u00b0 and 172\u00b0, confirming that the channel assembles as a tetramer.

As part of these attempts, we report here, the design and characterization of a non-amyloidogenic homologue of A\u03b2 (A\u03b2-KEK).

However, in vitro passages could induce mutation(s). In this study, we established a system for the characterization of low-passage viral isolates using an infectious cDNA clone. We used R05-624, a plaque derived from type 2 (DENV-2) Thai strain, for the construction of the cDNA clone, named pmMW/R05-624. We found that transfection of both of mammalian Vero cells and mosquito C6/36 cells with viral RNA derived from the cDNA clone produced a significant amount of progeny virus: 3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 focus-forming units (FFU) production per ml of cultured fluid only 3\u00a0days after transfection with 2\u00a0\u03bcg RNA. Conversely, no detectable level of viruses was produced by conventional methods using a single cell line, Vero or C6/36. When this system was applied for the characterization of eight low-passage clinical viral isolates by placing their 5\u2032-half or 3\u2032-half in the above cDNA clone, we found that all the isolates, except for L04-225, produced similar levels of progeny virus. Among a total of eight cDNA clones reconstructed with the NS4A\u20133\u2032NCR region derived from L04-225, one clone carried an insertion and produced a low level of progeny virus. Thus, our system to efficiently rescue clinical samples or low-passage viral isolates could be useful for assessing the virological and molecular characteristics of DENV that could be related to disease pathogenesis.",

Our study demonstrates that archaeosomes have superior stability in simulated GI fluids, and enable fluorescent labeled peptides to reside for longer periods in the GI tract after oral administration.

It has been well recognized that ESC genomes are maintained in a globally transcriptional hyperactive state, which genetically poised ESCs to the high differentiation potential. However, the transcription factors regulating the global transcription activities in ESCs are not well defined. We show here that mouse and human ESCs express two transcription factors, Aire and Deaf1. Previously known to function in the thymus stromal cells and peripheral lymphoid organs respectively, Aire and Deaf1 help regulate the ectopic expression of diverse tissue-specific antigens to establish self-immune tolerance. Differentiation of ESCs greatly reduced Aire and Deaf1 expression, in a pattern similar to the pluripotent factors, Oct4 and Nanog. Knockdown of Aire in mouse ESCs resulted in significantly decreased clone-forming efficiency as well as attenuated cell cycle, suggesting Aire plays a role in ESC self-renewal. In addition, some differentiation-associated genes that are sporadically expressed in ESCs were reduced in expression upon Aire knockdown. These results suggest that transcription factors such as Aire and Deaf1, which exert global transcriptional regulatory functions, may play important roles in self-renewal of ESCs and maintaining ESC in a transcriptionally hyperactive state.",

One of these residues that in TOP crystallographic structure are far from the catalytic residues, but, moves toward the substrate considering this possible structural reorganization is His600. In the present work, the role of His600 of TOP was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. TOP H600A mutant was characterized through analysis of S1 and S1\u2032 specificity, pH-activity profile and inhibition by JA-2. Results showed that TOP His600 residue makes important interactions with the substrate, supporting the prediction that His600 moves toward the substrate due to a hinge movement similar to the Dcp and ACE-2. Furthermore, the mutation H600A affected both Km and kcat, showing the importance of His600 for both substrate binding and/or product release from active site.

Our objective was to determine the effect of maternal obesity on development of NAFPD in offspring and ascertain contributions of the intra/extra-uterine periods.Female C57BL/6J mice were fed either a standard chow (3% fat, 7% sugar) or a hypercalorific diet (16% fat, 33% sugar) for six weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy and lactation.

     "abstract": "We reported the identification of a novel gene termed TDRP (encoding testis development-related protein) that might be involved in spermatogenesis. The human TDRP gene had two distinct transcripts, TDRP1 and TDRP2, which encoded proteins of 183 aa and 198 aa respectively. Tdrp mRNA was predominantly expressed in testis tissue. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific against human TDRP1. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed TDRP1 was expressed in spermatogenic cells, especially with high expression in spermatocytes. We provided evidence that TDRP1 distributed in both cytoplasm and nuclei of spermatogenic cells. Expression patterns of Tdrp1 mRNA and its protein were investigated in the rat testis tissues of different developmental stages. Both Tdrp1 mRNA and its protein were barely detected in the testis of neonatal rats, increased remarkably at 3\u00a0weeks postpartum, and peaked at 2\u00a0months postpartum. We also investigated TDRP1 expressions in testis tissues of azoospermic men with defective spermatogenesis. Western blot analysis showed that TDRP1 expressions were significantly lower in the testis tissues of azoospermic men compared with normal controls. These current data demonstrated that as a nuclear factor, TDRP1 might play an important role in spermatogenesis.",

Mass spectrometric analysis revealed the presence of many protein peaks around m/z 11,000, separated by 129 atomic mass units; this value corresponds to that of glutamate, which is strongly suggestive of heterogeneous polyglutamylation. Polyglutamylation has long been known as the functionally important post-translational modification of tubulins, which carry poly(l-glutamic acid) chains of heterogeneous length branching off from the main chain at the \u03b3-carboxy groups of a few specific glutamate residues. In Artemia PSP, however, Edman degradation of enzymatic peptides revealed that at least 13, and presumably 16, glutamate residues were modified by the attachment of a single l-glutamate, representing a hitherto undescribed type of post-translational modification: namely, multiple \u03b3-glutamylation or the addition of a large number of glutamate residues along the polypeptide chain. Although biological significance of PSP and its modification is yet to be established, suppression of in vitro thermal aggregation of lactate dehydrogenase by glutamylated PSP was observed.",

We show here that radiolabeled ribonucleoside triphosphates, such as [\u03b1-33P]UTP, in culture medium were also incorporated efficiently not only into cells but also into de novo RNA, particularly rRNA. Using this method, we first revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers such as tunicamycin and thapsigargin suppressed de novo rRNA synthesis, and that PERK, but not IRE1\u03b1 or ATF6, mediated the suppression. PERK is known to mediate the suppression of de novo protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Consistently, other translational inhibitors such as PSI, proteasomal inhibitor, and cycloheximide suppressed de novo rRNA synthesis. eIF2\u03b1 knockdown also suppressed both de novo protein and rRNA syntheses. Furthermore, ER stress reduced cellular ATP levels, and the suppression of rRNA synthesis apparently mitigated their reduction. These observations provided a close link between ATP levels and suppression of de novo rRNA synthesis at ER stress, and we proposed a novel feedback mechanism, in which ATP levels were maintained via suppression of de novo rRNA synthesis in ATP-demanding stresses, such as ER stress.",

Therefore, the development of functionally modified CTL, such as tumor-targeting CTL, is widely desired. Here, we designed the tumor-targeting CTL expressing a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv-CTL) specific for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/flk1) by transducing the CTL with a retroviral vector. The scFv-CTL bound to VEGFR2/flk1-expressing cells and retained their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. In addition, adoptive transfer of scFv-CTL into tumor-bearing mice effectively suppressed tumor growth due to the augmented accumulation of the transferred CTL in the tumor tissue.

Here, we define a method to directly examine vacuole membrane Cdc42p and Rho1p activation based on their affinity to probes derived from effectors. Cdc42p and Rho1p showed unique temporal activation which aligned with distinct subreactions of in vitro vacuole fusion. Cdc42p was rapidly activated in an ATP-independent manner while Rho1p activation was kinetically slower and required ATP. Inhibitors that are known to block vacuole membrane fusion were examined for their effect on Cdc42p and Rho1p activation. Rdi1p, which inhibits the dissociation of GDP from Rho proteins, blocked both Cdc42p and Rho1p activation. Ligands of PI(4,5)P2 specifically inhibited Rho1p activation while pre-incubation with U73122, which targets Plc1p function, increased Rho1p activation. These results define unique activation mechanisms for Cdc42p and Rho1p, which may be linked to the vacuole membrane fusion mechanism.",

We investigated whether Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats, which are a strain of hyperphagia-induced obese rats, develop leptin resistance and whether caloric restriction reversed this leptin resistance-induced leptin receptor (ObRb) deficit. Twenty male OLETF rats, 20 male Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, and 10 male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used. All rats were initially studied at 10\u00a0weeks of age and were freely fed with standard rat chow and water until they were 38\u00a0weeks of age. Daily food intake, body weight, and plasma leptin levels of OLETF rats were remarkably increased compared to LETO or SD rats from 10 to 38\u00a0weeks of age. When they were 38\u00a0weeks of age, all OLETF rats were randomly divided into two groups. One group was freely fed with standard rat chow (FD, or free diet group), and the other group (RD, or restricted diet group) was fed with only 70% of the amount consumed by the FD group. The LETO and SD rats were dismissed from further study. After 4\u00a0weeks of caloric restriction, the average body weight (636\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033\u00a0g vs. 752\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024\u00a0g, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and abdominal adipose tissue weight (10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2\u00a0g vs. 15.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0g, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of the RD group were decreased compared with those of the FD group.

The mRNA expression of ObRb and leptin-related suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in the hypothalamus, liver, and skeletal muscles of the RD group were significantly decreased compared with those of the FD group. Caloric restriction did not improve leptin receptor (ObRb) deficit or the downstream signaling of leptin in the liver, skeletal muscles, and hypothalamus. Thus, we demonstrated that OLETF rats, which are a strain of hyperphagia-induced obese rats, did not develop central or peripheral leptin resistance. We suggest that hyperleptinemia in OLETF rats is a compensatory mechanism to overcome obesity induced by hyperphagia.",

     "abstract": "SMCT1 is a Na+-coupled monocarboxylate transporter expressed in a variety of tissues including kidney, thyroid, small intestine, colon, brain, and retina. We found recently that several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the activity of SMCT1. Here we evaluated the effect of diclofenac, also a NSAID, on SMCT1. SMCT1 cDNA was expressed heterologously in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell lines HRPE and ARPE-19, the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF7, and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Transport was monitored by substrate uptake and substrate-induced currents. Na+-dependent uptake/current was considered as SMCT1 activity. The effect of diclofenac was evaluated for specificity, dose\u2013response, and influence on transport kinetics. To study the specificity of the diclofenac effect, we evaluated the influence of this NSAID on the activity of several other cloned transporters in mammalian cells under identical conditions. In contrast to several NSAIDs that inhibited SMCT1, diclofenac stimulated SMCT1 when expressed in HRPE and ARPE-19 cells. The stimulation was marked, ranging from 2- to 5-fold depending on the concentration of diclofenac. The stimulation was associated with an increase in the maximal velocity of the transport system as well as with an increase in substrate affinity. The observed effect on SMCT1 was selective because the activity of several other cloned transporters, when expressed in HRPE cells and studied under identical conditions, was not affected by diclofenac. Interestingly, the stimulatory effect on SMCT1 observed in HRPE and ARPE-19 cells was not evident in MCF7 cells nor in the X. laevis expression system, indicating that SMCT1 was not the direct target for diclofenac. The RPE-specific effect suggests that the target of diclofenac that mediates the stimulatory effect is expressed in RPE cells but not in MCF7 cells or in X. laevis oocytes. Since SMCT1 is a concentrative transporter for metabolically important compounds such as pyruvate, lactate, \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, and nicotinate, the stimulation of its activity by diclofenac in RPE cells has biological and clinical significance.",

This is the first report to show that IL-33 can be induced by CpG ODNs. The strong induction of IL-33 by MsST suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic ODN for the treatment of inflammatory disease.

We studied longitudinally the viruses obtained before and after fulminant liver disease in a patient with chronic HBV infection showing fatal exacerbation. HBV strains were obtained before and after exacerbation (designated as FEP1 and FEP2). Their virological features were investigated by in vitro transfection. FEP1 and FEP2 possessed higher activity of overall HBV DNA synthesis than the wild-type. FEP1 lacked competence for relaxed circular (RC) HBV DNA synthesis and RC HBV DNA-containing virion secretion, but FEP2 maintained it. Chimeric analysis revealed that the preS/S gene, where FEP1 had a considerable number of mutations and deletions but FEP2 did not, was responsible for impaired RC HBV DNA synthesis and virion secretion. Furthermore, incompetence of FEP1 strain was transcomplemented by the preS/S protein of wild-type strain. In conclusion, the viral strain after exacerbation showed resurgent RC HBV DNA synthesis and virion secretion, which was caused by conversion of the preS/S gene from a hypermutated to hypomutated state. This may have been responsible for disease deterioration in the patient. This is a novel type of HBV genomic variation associated with the development of fulminant liver disease.",

In the present paper, we performed an analysis of an intracellular mechanical field by observation of the deformation behaviors of living ECs exposed to shear stress with a novel experimental method. Lateral images of human umbilical vein ECs before and after the onset of flow were obtained by confocal microscopy, and image correlation and finite element analysis were performed for quantitative analyses of subcellular strain due to shear stress. The shear strain of the cells changed from 1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.09% (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) to 4.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.79% as the magnitude of the shear stress increased from 2 to 10\u00a0Pa. The nuclei of ECs also exhibited shear deformation, which was similar to that observed in cytoplasm, suggesting that nuclei transmit forces from apical to intracellular components, as well as cytoskeletons. The obtained strain\u2013stress relation resulted in a mean shear modulus of 213\u00a0Pa for adherent ECs.

AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a sensor of cellular energy status activated by metabolic stress that accelerates AMP/ATP ratio, regulating cell polarity, metabolic homeostasis and sensitivity to stress resistance. AMPK could be therapeutic targets for cancer, diabetic mellitus and obesity, providing a possible link to metabolic syndrome. However, little is known how functional deficiency of AMPK affects longevity and stress resistance in vivo due to its redundancy and lethality in null-mutant. SNF1A/dAMPK\u03b1 (CG3051) is a single orthologue for its mammalian counterparts in Drosophila melanogaster. Using time- and tissue-specific RNAi system in D. melanogaster, we found that adult-onset inhibition of dAMPK\u03b1 especially in muscle shortens lifespan. In addition, inhibition of dAMPK\u03b1 in muscle enhances sensitivity to paraquat and starvation stress. Real-time PCR analysis showed that inhibition of dAMPK\u03b1 in muscle affected the transcriptional regulation of various genes in response to starvation. These results raise the possibility that muscle is one of major tissues in which AMPK plays a critical role on longevity and stress resistance and the intervention to activate AMPK in muscle could be a prominent treatment strategy for longevity.",

     "abstract": "A new evidence on the regulatory function of twitchin, a titin-like protein of molluscan muscles, at muscle contraction has been obtained at studying the movements of IAF-labeled mussel tropomyosin in skeletal ghost fibers during the ATP hydrolysis cycle simulated using nucleotides and non-hydrolysable ATP analogs. For the first time, myosin-induced multistep changes in mobility and in the position of mussel tropomyosin strands on the surface of the thin filament during the ATP hydrolysis cycle have been demonstrated directly. Unphosphorylated twitchin shifts the tropomyosin towards the position typical for muscle relaxation, decreases the tropomyosin affinity to actin and inhibits its movements during the ATPase cycle. Phosphorylation of twitchin by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A reverses this effect. These data imply that twitchin is a thin filament regulator that controls actin\u2013myosin interaction by \u201cfreezing\u201d tropomyosin in the blocked position, resulting in the inhibition of the transformation of weak-binding states into strong-binding ones during ATPase cycle.",

     "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor is a rotary motor driven by the electrochemical potential of a coupling ion. The interaction between a rotor and stator units is thought to generate torque. The overall structure of flagellar motor has been thought to be static, however, it was recently proved that stators are exchanged in a rotating motor. Understanding the dynamics of rotor components in functioning motor is important for the clarifying of working mechanism of bacterial flagellar motor. In this study, we focused on the dynamics and the turnover of rotor components in a functioning flagellar motor. Expression systems for GFP-FliN, FliM-GFP, and GFP-FliG were constructed, and each GFP-fusion was functionally incorporated into the flagellar motor. To investigate whether the rotor components are exchanged in a rotating motor, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. After photobleaching, in a tethered cell producing GFP-FliN or FliM-GFP, the recovery of fluorescence at the rotational center was observed. However, in a cell producing GFP-FliG, no recovery of fluorescence was observed. The transition phase of fluorescence intensity after full or partially photobleaching allowed the turnover of FliN subunits to be calculated as 0.0007\u00a0s\u22121, meaning that FliN would be exchanged in tens of minutes. These novel findings indicate that a bacterial flagellar motor is not a static structure even in functioning state. This is the first report for the exchange of rotor components in a functioning bacterial flagellar motor.",

Male Fischer-344 rats were subjected to fasting for 1, 2, or 3\u00a0days. Greater weight loss was observed in plantaris muscle than in soleus muscle in response to fasting. Western blot analysis demonstrated that LC3-II, a marker protein for macroautophagy, was expressed at a notably higher level in plantaris than in soleus muscle, and that the expression level was fasting duration-dependent. To identify factors related to LC3-II enhancement, autophagy-related signals were examined in both types of muscle. Phosphorylated mTOR was reduced in plantaris but not in soleus muscle. FOXO3a and ER stress signals were unchanged in both muscle types during fasting. These findings suggest that preferential atrophy of fast-twitch muscle is associated with induction of autophagy during fasting and that differences in autophagy regulation are attributable to differential signal regulation in soleus and plantaris muscle.",

Multiple lines of evidence have implicated CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine headache making the CGRP receptor an attractive target for development of small-molecule antagonists as a novel treatment for this debilitating condition. The CGRP receptor antagonists telcagepant and olcegepant (BIBN4096BS) have demonstrated clinical efficacy in the treatment of migraine and there is now a need to better understand how these molecules interact with the receptor. Previous work has shown the extracellular portion of RAMP1 to be important for binding of these antagonists, with tryptophan-74 being a key interaction site. The crystal structure of the extracellular portion of human RAMP1 placed tryptophan-74 in a hydrophobic patch hypothesized to interact with CGRP receptor ligands and also identified nearby residues that may be important for ligand binding. In this study we explored the role played by these residues of RAMP1 using an alanine replacement strategy. We confirmed a role for tryptophan-74 in antagonist binding and also identified arginine-67 as being important for binding of telcagepant but not compound 3, a close analog of BIBN4096BS. We also identified tryptophan-84 as being critical for both high-affinity binding of the non-peptide antagonists as well as the peptides CGRP and CGRP(8\u201337). These data for the first time pinpoint a specific RAMP1 residue important for both antagonist and agonist potency and are consistent with the N-terminal domain of RAMP1 forming the binding pocket interface with CLR.",

Using immunofluorescence assays, Western blot analysis, and real-time PCR methods, we observed angiogenesis and the proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Immunofluorescence assays showed that the number of vWF-positive areas peaked at day 7, and they were highest in the VEGF up-regulation group and lowest in the VEGF down-regulation group at every time point. The number of neural stem cells, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes in the subventricular zone gradually increased over time in the VEGF up-regulation group. Among the three groups, the number of these cells was highest in the VEGF up-regulation group and lowest in the VEGF down-regulation group at the same time point.

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 enhanced the expression of naofen mRNA in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, naofen siRNA, which predominantly knocked down the expression of naofen mRNA, significantly reduced both TNF-\u03b1-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in HEK293 cells. Overexpression of naofen in HEK293 cells (FLAG-NF) spontaneously induced caspase -3 activation and apoptosis, and showed extremely high susceptibility to TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis. These results indicated that naofen may function as a novel modulator activating caspase-3, and promoting TNF-\u03b1-stimulated apoptosis.",

We generated islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP)-specific regulatory CD8+ T cells from 8.3-NOD transgenic mice. CD8+ T cells from 8.3-NOD splenocytes were cultured with IGRP, splenic dendritic cells (SpDCs), TGF-\u03b2, and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for 5\u00a0days. CD8+ T cells cultured with either IGRP alone or IGRP and SpDCs in the absence of TGF-\u03b2 and ATRA had low Foxp3+ expression (1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% and 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5%, respectively). In contrast, CD8+ T cells induced by exposure to IGRP, SpDCs, TGF-\u03b2, and ATRA showed the highest expression of Foxp3+ in IGRP-reactive CD8+ T cells (36.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6%), which was approximately 40-fold increase compared with that before induction culture. CD25 expression on CD8+ T cells cultured with IGRP, SpDCs, TGF-\u03b2, and ATRA was only 7.42%, whereas CD103 expression was greater than 90%. These CD8+ T cells suppressed the proliferation of diabetogenic CD8+ T cells from 8.3-NOD splenocytes in vitro and completely prevented diabetes onset in NOD-scid mice in cotransfer experiments with diabetogenic splenocytes from NOD mice in vivo. Here we show that exposure to ATRA and TGF-\u03b2 induces CD8+Foxp3+ T cells ex vivo, which suppress diabetogenic T cells in vitro and in vivo.",

Controversial evidence suggests that CRP may play a causal role in cardiovascular disease. CRP synthesis inhibition is a potential approach for reducing cardiovascular mortality.We show here that endogenous and plant-derived inhibitors of the Na+/K+-ATPase, i.e. the cardiac glycosides ouabain and digitoxin, inhibit IL-1\u03b2- and IL-6-induced APP expression in human hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHH) at nanomolar concentrations. Inhibition is demonstrated on transcriptional and on protein level. The molecular target of cardiac glycosides, i.e. the \u03b11 subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase, is strongly expressed in human hepatocytes. Inhibition of APP synthesis correlates with the potency of cardiac glycosides at the Na+/K+-ATPase. The trigger for APP expression inhibition is an increase in intracellular calcium since the calcium ionophore calcimycin is also active. Qualified specificity of oubain for hepatocellular APP synthesis inhibition is demonstrated by lack of effectivity on IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6 release from primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells.The inhibitory activity of cardiac glycosides on CRP expression may have important implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Cardiac glycosides may be used for CRP synthesis inhibition in the future.",

From some candidate genes related with IgAN, we confirmed the apolipoprotein B messenger RNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptides 2 (APOBEC2) gene expression in the tonsil and we also analyzed its expression levels and clinical features.Up-regulated genes seem to be categorized into two groups. One group belongs to the muscle related genes which might be caused by structural differences. The other group includes the immune system-related genes, such as APOBEC2, CALB2, DUSP27, and CXCL11. APOBEC2 was positively stained in the epithelium and the peripheral region of the germinal center in both tonsils. APOBEC2 expression level was negatively related with serum igg level, but did not correlate with clinical course after tonsillectomy.We confirmed gene expression differences related with immune system and muscle structure. The APOBEC2 was confirmed to be elevated in the tonsils with IgAN patients, and the gene expression level was negatively related with serum igg level in overall patients. These results might be helpful to reveal the mechanism of IgAN.",

However, effective differentiation of these mesenchymal cells, called adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), towards cardiomyogenic lineage has been limited to a small number of isolated clones in an extended culture. Previously, we reported that treatment with phorbol ester induces the expression of several cardiomyogenic genes in the absence of serum. This study was performed to identify the roles of PKC isoforms in cardiomyogenic gene expression of ADSCs. Treatment with 10\u00a0nM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) for 24\u00a0h caused sustained increases in mRNA levels for various cardiomyogenic genes, such as Mef2C, cardiac actin and troponin, for at least 6\u00a0days following the drug removal. The use of various inhibitors specific for PKC isoforms demonstrated that the novel PKC-theta/delta isoforms mediate the PMA effects. RT-PCR revealed that ADSCs express significant mRNA for PKC-delta, but not theta isoform. Overexpression of cDNA for PKC-delta resulted in marked increases in cardiac mRNA expression.

Suppression of survivin mRNA by RNAi and anti-sense nucleotides has proved to be a powerful anti-tumor therapy in both animal models and human investigations. In this communication, we tested an alternative approach to silence survivin by knocking down its gene transcription through a short methylated oligonucleotide (SurKex) that is complementary to the survivin gene promoter. Treatment of NCI-H460 cells with SurKex significantly suppressed the production of survivin mRNA and its oncoprotein. DNA bisulfite sequencing showed that SurKex induced site-specific de novo CpG methylation in the complementary region of survivin promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay also demonstrated that SurKex induced histone hypermethylation at histone H3K9 and H3K27 as well as deacetylation of histone H4 in the same regulatory region. SurKex remarkably inhibited tumor growth in nude mice bearing xenograft tumors. This study demonstrates that the synthetic methylated oligonucleotide SurKex inhibits tumor growth by silencing the survivin gene using a mechanism of altering the epigenotype in the survivin promoter. Thus, targeted epigenetic modification in the gene promoter may offer a new general strategy to silence tumor-related genes in tumor therapy.",

The neck region and carbohydrate recognition domain of the two proteins are important for efficient binding to the HIV-1 envelope protein. DC-SIGNR is polymorphic in Exons 4 and 5 that encode the neck region and carbohydrate recognition domain, respectively; the former contains a variable number of tandem repeats, and the latter the SNP (rs2277998). Since it remains unclear whether the DC-SIGNR polymorphism is related to the risk of HIV-1 infection, we tested possible effects of the polymorphism on HIV-1 trans-infection efficiency, by constructing six kinds of cDNAs encoding DC-SIGNR variants with various numbers of repeat units and various SNP. We were able to express the variants on the surface of Raji cells, a human B cell line. Flow cytometry showed that all the tested DC-SIGNR molecules were efficiently expressed on the cell surface at various levels; the assay for HIV trans-infection efficacy showed that all the tested variants had that activity with different efficacy levels. We found a correlation between the HIV trans-infection efficiency and the mean fluorescent intensity of DC-SIGNR expression (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Thus, our results suggest that the variation of the tested DC-SIGNR genotypes affects the efficacy of trans-infection by affecting the amounts of the protein expressed on the cell surface.",

We found that the major components of the mammalian Hippo pathway including Yap are all expressed in skeletal muscles, C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. In C2C12 myoblasts, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is low and Yap localises to nuclei. Upon differentiation, Yap Ser127 phosphorylation increases \u224820-fold and Yap translocates from the nucleus to the cytosol. To test whether the observed increase of Yap Ser127 phosphorylation is required for differentiation we overexpressed hYAP1 S127A, a mutant that can not be phosphorylated at Ser127, in C2C12 myoblasts. We found that overexpression of hYAP S127A prevented myotube formation, whereas the overexpression of wildtype hYAP1 or empty vector had no effect. In addition, more hYAP1 S127A overexpressing cells progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle and the expression of MRFs (myogenin, Myf5), Mef2c and cell cycle regulators (p21, cyclin D1) was significantly changed when compared to wildtype hYAP1 and empty vector overexpressing cells.

     "abstract": "Mechanical forces associated with blood flow play an important role in regulating vascular signaling and gene expression in endothelial cells (ECs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate the expression of genes involved in diverse cell functions, including differentiation, growth, proliferation, and apoptosis. miRNAs are known to have an important role in modulating EC biology, but their expression and functions in cells subjected to shear stress conditions are unknown. We sought to determine the miRNA expression profile in human ECs subjected to unidirectional shear stress and define the role of miR-21 in shear stress-induced changes in EC function. TLDA array and qRT-PCR analysis performed on HUVECs exposed to prolonged unidirectional shear stress (USS, 24\u00a0h, 15 dynes/cm2) identified 13 miRNAs whose expression was significantly upregulated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The miRNA with the greatest change was miR-21; it was increased 5.2-fold (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) in USS-treated versus control cells. Western analysis demonstrated that PTEN, a known target of miR-21, was downregulated in HUVECs exposed to USS or transfected with pre-miR-21. Importantly, HUVECs overexpressing miR-21 had decreased apoptosis and increased eNOS phosphorylation and nitric oxide (NO) production. These data demonstrate that shear stress forces regulate the expression of miRNAs in ECs, and that miR-21 influences endothelial biology by decreasing apoptosis and activating the NO pathway. These studies advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which shear stress forces modulate vascular homeostasis.",

Although brain was the organ containing the lowest quantity of injected GNPs, our data suggest that GNPs are able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and accumulate in the neural tissue. Importantly, no evidence of toxicity was observed in any of the diverse studies performed, including survival, behavior, animal weight, organ morphology, blood biochemistry and tissue histology.

During reepithelialization, epidermal cells permanently change shape from pentagonal or hexagonal to irregular forms. This process requires zipper, a gene encoding the Drosophila nonmuscle myosin II heavy chain. Following wounding, myosin II is localized at the wound margin and at the rear end of individual cells located within several rows from the wound hole. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway is essential for this myosin II localization. These results suggest that not only the wound leading edge but also the cells lying distal to the leading edge cells actively participate in epithelial cell sheet migration during wound hole closure.",

In the present study, we showed that Notch ligands Delta-like 1 (Dll1) and Delta-like 4 (Dll4) are expressed in a goblet cell-specific manner in human colonic tissue. Additionally, we found that Dll1 and Dll4 expression was regulated in-parallel with Atoh1 and MUC2, which are both under the control of the Notch-Hes1 signaling pathway. Because knockdown of Dll1 expression completely abrogated the acquisition of the goblet cell phenotype in Notch-inactivated colonic epithelial cells, we postulate that Dll1 might function as a cis-acting regulatory element that induces undifferentiated cells to become goblet cells. Our results suggest a link between Dll1 expression and human goblet cell differentiation that might be mediated by a function that is distinct from its role as a Notch receptor ligand.",

     "abstract": "Most olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons are derived from neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and migrate to the OB via the rostral migratory stream (RMS). Mature dopaminergic interneurons in the OB glomerular layer are readily identified by their synaptic activity-dependent expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Paradoxically, TH is not expressed in neural progenitors migrating in the RMS, even though ambient GABA and glutamate depolarize these progenitors. In forebrain slice cultures prepared from transgenic mice containing a GFP reporter gene under the control of the Th 9\u00a0kb upstream regulatory region, treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (either sodium butyrate, Trichostatin A or Scriptaid) induced Th-GFP expression specifically in the RMS independently of depolarizing conditions in the culture media. Th-GFP expression in the glomerular layer was also increased in slices treated with Trichostatin A, but this increased expression was dependent on depolarizing concentrations of KCl in the culture media. Th-GFP expression was also induced in the RMS in vivo by intra-peritoneal injections with either sodium butyrate or valproic acid. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of neurosphere cultures confirmed that HDAC inhibitors de-repressed Th expression in SVZ-derived neural progenitors. Together, these findings suggest that HDAC function is critical for regulating Th expression levels in both neural progenitors and mature OB dopaminergic neurons. However, the differential responses to the combinatorial exposure of HDAC inhibitors and depolarizing culture conditions indicate that Th expression in mature OB neurons and neural progenitors in the RMS are regulated by distinct HDAC-mediated mechanisms.",

PPAR\u03b3 has recently been implicated in the catabolism of surfactant by alveolar macrophages, specifically the cholesterol component of surfactant while the mechanism remains unclear. Studies from other tissue macrophages have shown that PPAR\u03b3 regulates cholesterol influx, efflux, and metabolism. PPAR\u03b3 promotes cholesterol efflux through the liver X receptor-alpha (LXR\u03b1) and ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1). We have recently shown that macrophage-specific PPAR\u03b3 knockout (PPAR\u03b3 KO) mice accumulate cholesterol-laden alveolar macrophages that exhibit decreased expression of LXR\u03b1 and ABCG1 and reduced cholesterol efflux. We hypothesized that in addition to the dysregulation of these cholesterol efflux genes, the expression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and influx was also dysregulated and that replacement of PPAR\u03b3 would restore regulation of these genes. To investigate this hypothesis, we have utilized a Lentivirus expression system (Lenti-PPAR\u03b3) to restore PPAR\u03b3 expression in the alveolar macrophages of PPAR\u03b3 KO mice. Our results show that the alveolar macrophages of PPAR\u03b3 KO mice have decreased expression of key cholesterol synthesis genes and increased expression of cholesterol receptors CD36 and scavenger receptor A-I (SRA-I). The replacement of PPAR\u03b3 (1) induced transcription of LXR\u03b1 and ABCG1; (2) corrected suppressed expression of cholesterol synthesis genes; and (3) enhanced the expression of scavenger receptors CD36.

     "abstract": "Induction of the major drug metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 by xenobiotics contributes to the pronounced interindividual variability of its expression and often results in clinically relevant drug\u2013drug interactions. It is mainly mediated by PXR, which regulates CYP3A4 expression by binding to several specific elements in the 5\u2032 upstream regulatory region of the gene. Induction itself shows a marked interindividual variability, whose underlying determinants are only partly understood. In this study, we investigated the role of nuclear receptor binding to PXR response elements in CYP3A4, as a potential non-genetic mechanism contributing to interindividual variability of induction. By in vitro DNA binding experiments, we showed that several nuclear receptors bind efficiently to the proximal promoter ER6 and distal xenobiotic-responsive enhancer module DR3 motifs. TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, COUP-TFI, and COUP-TFII further demonstrated dose-dependent repression of PXR-mediated CYP3A4 enhancer/promoter reporter activity in transient transfection in the presence and absence of the PXR inducer rifampin, while VDR showed this effect only in the absence of treatment. By combining functional in vitro characterization with hepatic expression analysis, we predict that TR\u03b11, TR\u03b21, COUP-TFI, and COUP-TFII show a strong potential for the repression of PXR-mediated activation of CYP3A4 in vivo. In summary, our results demonstrate that nuclear receptor binding to PXR response elements interferes with PXR-mediated expression and induction of CYP3A4 and thereby contributes to the interindividual variability of induction.",

Two suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) forward libraries were constructed from 21-day old seedlings of tolerant cv. Prasad at 0.5 and 6\u00a0h PEG-induced dehydration stress. A total of 327 unique ESTs were identified from both libraries and were classified into 11 different categories according to their putative functions.

PGE2 results in increased Abeta production, initiating a cell-injuring cycle. Using rat primary cortical neurons, a 48\u00a0h treatment with Abeta 1\u201342 (5\u00a0\u03bcM) resulted in the enhanced extracellular PGE2 levels up to about 1\u00a0ng/mL, which was attenuated by treatment with a BACE-1 inhibitor (200\u00a0nM). A synthetic peptide sequence of 20-amino acids that included the cleavage site of mPGES-2 (HTARWHL RAQDLHERS AAQLSLSS) was cleaved by recombinant BACE-1, confirmed using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Cleaved or activated mPGES-2 augments the generation of PGE2. In addition, mPGES-2 was determined to be colocalized with BACE-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 in the perinuclear region in cells after exposure to Abeta.

Their strict control of these fluxes is required for oxidative phosphorylation. Understanding the ternary complex transport mechanism with which most of these transporters function requires an accounting of the number and interactions of their subunits. The phosphate transporter (PTP, Mir1p) subunit readily forms homodimers with intersubunit affinities changeable by mutations. Cys28, likely at the subunit interface, is a site for mutations yielding transport inhibition or a channel-like transport mode. Such mutations yield a small increase or decrease in affinity between the subunits. The PTP inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide decreases subunit affinity by a small amount. PTP mutations that yield the highest (40%) and the lowest (2%) liposome incorporation efficiencies (LIE) are clustered near Cys28. Such mutant subunits show the lowest and highest subunit affinities respectively. The oxaloacetate transporter (Oac1p) subunit has an almost twofold lower affinity than the PTP subunit. The Oac1p, dicarboxylate (Dic1p) and PTP transporter subunits form heterodimers with even lower affinities. These results form a firm basis for detailed studies to establish the effect of subunit affinities on transport mode and activity and for the identification of the mechanism that prevents formation of heterodimers that surely will negatively impact oxidative phosphorylation and ATP levels with serious consequences for the cell.",

As South Africa is currently facing a tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, with an increasing number of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections, the use of aminoglycosides is on the increase. It is therefore important to determine whether the mitochondrial mutations associated with aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss occur at high frequencies in particular ethnic groups in our population. A total of 115 mainly MDR-TB patients all on aminoglycosides and 439 controls representative of the main ethnic groups in South Africa were screened for six mutations using the SNaPshot technique. Furthermore, the mitochondrial genomes of eight patients with ototoxicity were sequenced. Homoplasmic mutations were found in controls (A1555G in 0.9% of Black controls and A827G in 1.1% of Afrikaner controls) which reveal that a significant proportion of the South African population is genetically predisposed to developing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss. The 961delT+insC(n) and T961G variants were found at frequencies of >1% indicating that both are probably non-pathogenic polymorphisms. Sequencing of the entire mitochondrial genome in eight patients did not reveal any mutations in the MT-RNR1 gene. However, two potentially pathogenic variants, T10114C (I19T in MT-ND3) and T15312C (I189T in MT-CYB) were found that may impact on the oxidative phosphorylation capacity and warrant further investigation for their possible role in this disorder. It is imperative that the genetic basis of this potentially preventable condition be investigated, particularly in countries where aminoglycosides are still commonly used, in order to identify individuals and/or ethnic groups who are at risk for this type of hearing loss.",

TGF-\u03b2 inducible early gene (TIEG) 1 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and has been implicated in the modulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. These findings prompted us to investigate the effect of TIEG1 on myostatin and TGF-\u03b2 signaling using C2C12 myoblasts. Myostatin and TGF-\u03b2 induced the expression of TIEG1 and Smad7 mRNAs, but not TIEG2 mRNA, in proliferating C2C12 cells. When differentiating C2C12 myoblasts were stimulated by myostatin, TIEG1 mRNA was up-regulated at a late stage of differentiation. In contrast, TGF-\u03b2 enhanced TIEG1 expression at an early stage. Overexpression of TIEG1 prevented the transcriptional activation of Smad by myostatin and TGF-\u03b2 in both proliferating or differentiating C2C12 cells, but the expression of Smad2 and Smad7 mRNAs was not affected. Forced expression of TIEG1 inhibited myogenic differentiation but did not cause more inhibition than the empty vector in the presence of myostatin or TGF-\u03b2. These results demonstrate that TIEG1 is one possible feedback regulator of myostatin and TGF-\u03b2 that prevents excess action in myoblasts.",

In mammalian cells transfected with GFP2-tagged 5-HT1A receptor and YFP-tagged GalR1 receptor, a proximity-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique was used and it has been demonstrated that GalR1-5-HT1A receptors heteromerize. Furthermore, signaling by either the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or adenylyl cyclase (AC) pathways by these heteromers indicates a trans-inhibition phenomenon through their interacting interface via allosteric mechanisms that block the development of an excessive activation of Gi/o and an exaggerated inhibition of AC or stimulation of MAPK activity.

ROS activates the apoptotic cascade through mitochondrial dysfunction and damage to lipids, proteins and DNA. Recently, fruit and tea-derived polyphenols have been found to be beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress and increasing overall health. Further, polyphenols including epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) have been reported to inhibit apoptotic signaling and increase neural cell survival. In an effort to better understand the beneficial properties associated with polyphenol consumption, the aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effects of EGCG, methyl gallate (MG), gallic acid (GA) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on H2O2-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells and elucidate potential protective mechanisms. Cell viability data demonstrates that MG and NAC pre-treatments significantly increase viability of H2O2-stressed cells, while pre-treatments with EGCG and GA exacerbates stress. Quantitation of apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential shows that MG pre-treatment prevents mitochondria depolarization, however does not inhibit apoptosis and is thus evidence that MG can inhibit mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Subsequent analysis of DNA degradation and caspase activation reveals that MG inhibits activation of caspase 9 and has a partial inhibitory effect on DNA degradation. These findings confirm the involvement of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways in H2O2-induced apoptosis and suggest that MG may have potential therapeutic properties against mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

The expression of RPL6 in gastric cancer tissues and normal gastric mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. It was found RPL6 was expressed at a higher level in gastric cancer tissues than that in normal gastric mucosa. RPL6 was then genetically overexpressed or knocked down in human immortalized gastric mucosa epithelial GES cells. It was demonstrated that upregulation of RPL6 accelerated the growth and enhanced in vitro colony forming ability of GES cells whereas downregulation of RPL6 showed adverse effects. Moreover, over-expression of RPL6 could promote G1 to S phase transition of GES cells. It was further evidenced that upregulation of RPL6 resulted in elevated cyclin E expression while downregulation of RPL6 caused decreased cyclin E expression in GES cells.

By performing the GST pull-down assay, we defined the interaction domains in HAX-1 and XIAP, showing that HAX-1 binds to the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP whereas XIAP binds to the C-terminal domain of HAX-1. In addition, surface plasma resonance experiments showed that both BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP bind to HAX-1 with affinity similar to that of full-length XIAP, indicating that either domain is necessary and sufficient for tight binding to HAX-1.

The recent proteomics data using the post-ischemic hippocampal CA1 tissues and glaucoma-suffered retina from the primates suggested that heat shock protein (Hsp) 70.1 might be the in-vivo substrate of activated \u03bc-calpain at the lysosomal membrane of neurons.

Immunofluorescence histochemistry showed a colocalization of the activated \u03bc-calpain and upregulated Hsp70.1 at the lysosomal membrane of the post-ischemic CA1 neurons. In-vitro cleavage assay of hippocampal Hsp70.1 by Western blotting demonstrated that Hsp70.1 in the CA1 tissue is an in-vivo substrate of activated \u03bc-calpain, and that carbonylated Hsp70.1 in the CA1 tissue by artificial oxidative stressors such as hydroxynonenal (HNE) or hydrogen peroxide is much more vulnerable to the calpain cleavage.

     "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by a distinct set of motor symptoms. Loss-of-function mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) or parkin have been linked to early-onset autosomal recessive forms of familial PD. We have recently shown that parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase) and PINK1 (a serine/threonine kinase) affect one other\u2019s stability, solubility, and tendency to form cytoprotective aggresomes (Um et al., 2009, [16]). Here we validated the functional relevance of this mutual interaction under pathologic PD conditions, by investigating the changes of expression and solubility of these factors in response to PD-linked toxins. Consistent with our previous cell culture data, exposure of human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells to PD-linked toxins (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion, 6-hydroxydopamine, or MG132) reduced Nonidet P-40-soluble parkin levels and induced PINK1 accumulation. Consistent with our previous findings from parkin knockout mice, rat models of PD (6-hydroxydopamine-, rotenone-, or MG132-induced PD) were also associated with an increase in soluble and insoluble PINK1 levels as well as enhanced formation of parkin aggregates. These findings suggest that both PINK1 and parkin play important roles in regulating the formation of Lewy bodies during the pathogenesis of sporadic and familial PD.",

However, it is unknown whether Smad7, the other inhibitory Smad, also has a role in regulating IL-1R/TLR signaling. Here, we demonstrate that endogeneous Smad7 and Smad6 simultaneously bind to discrete regions of Pellino-1 upon TGF-\u03b21 treatment, via distinct regions of the Smad MH2 domains. In addition, the Smad7-Pellino-1 interaction abrogated NF-\u03baB activity by blocking formation of the IRAK1-mediated IL-1R/TLR signaling complex, subsequently causing reduced expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Double knock-down of endogenous Smad6 and Smad7 genes by RNA interference further reduced the anti-inflammatory activity of TGF-\u03b21 than when compared with single knock-down of Smad7. These results provide evidence that the I-Smads, Smad6 and Smad7, act as critical mediators for effective TGF-\u03b21-mediated suppression of IL-1R/TLR signaling, by simultaneous binding to discrete regions of Pellino-1.",

Phosphorylation of NCC was necessary for its plasma membrane localization. Previously, angiotensin II infusion was shown to increase apical membrane expression of NCC in rats. Therefore, we investigated whether angiotensin II was an upstream regulator for the WNK-OSR1/SPAK-NCC cascade in cultured cells and in vivo kidney. In mpkDCT cells, the phosphorylation of OSR1 and NCC was increased 30\u00a0min after the addition of angiotensin II (10\u20139\u201310\u22127\u00a0M) but returned to baseline after 18\u00a0h. In mice, a 5-min infusion of angiotensin II (5\u00a0ng/g/min) increased NCC phosphorylation in the kidney at 30\u00a0min and 2\u00a0h after the injection but returned to baseline 24\u00a0h later. This increase was inhibited by angiotensin II receptor blocker (valsartan) but not by aldosterone receptor blocker (eplerenone). Ten-day infusions of angiotensin II (720\u00a0ng/day) also increased phosphorylation of OSR1 and NCC in the mouse kidney, and both valsartan and eplerenone inhibited the increased phosphorylation. Although angiotensin II is identified as an upstream regulator for the WNK-OSR1/SPAK-NCC cascade in vivo, aldosterone appears to be the major regulator of this signal cascade in the long-term regulation by angiotensin II.",

This study examined whether Lefty can antagonise TGF-\u03b21 mediated EMT. A rat tubular epithelial cell line (NRK52E) was stably transfected with a Lefty expression plasmid (52E-Lefty) or control plasmid (52E-Control). 52E-Control cells underwent TGF-\u03b21 induced EMT with up-regulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA), down-regulation of E-cadherin, and transition to an elongated fibroblast-like morphology. In contrast, 52E-Lefty cells were substantially protected from TGF-\u03b21 induced EMT. Analysis of signalling pathways showed that 52E-Lefty cells had a marked reduction in TGF-\u03b21 induced Smad activity and suppression of the secondary phase of JNK (but not p38) signalling. Treatment of NRK52E cells with a JNK inhibitor was shown to suppress TGF-\u03b21 induced EMT. In conclusion, Lefty can antagonise TGF-\u03b21 mediated EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells.

During neurogenesis these Type-1 progenitors matures to GFAP\u2212ve/nestin+ve Type-2 progenitors and then to Type-3 neuroblasts and finally differentiates into granule cell neurons. In our study, using pilocarpine-induced seizure model, we showed that seizure initiated activation of multiple progenitors in the entire hippocampal area such as DG, CA1 and CA3. Seizure induction resulted in activation of two subtypes of Type-1 progenitors, Type-1a (GFAP+ve/nestin+ve/BrdU+ve) and Type-1b (GFAP+ve/nestin+ve/BrdU\u2212ve). We showed that majority of Type-1b progenitors were undergoing only a transition from a state of dormancy to activated form immediately after seizures rather than proliferating, whereas Type-1a showed maximum proliferation by 3\u00a0days post-seizure induction. Type-2 (GFAP\u2212ve/nestin+ve/BrdU+ve) progenitors were few compared to Type-1. Type-3 (DCX+ve) progenitors showed increased expression of immature neurons only in DG region by 3\u00a0days after seizure induction indicating maturation of progenitors happens only in microenvironment of DG even though progenitors are activated in CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampus. Also parallel increase in growth factors expression after seizure induction suggests that microenvironmental niche has a profound effect on stimulation of adult neural progenitors.",

In the cytosol, it acts as a scaffold protein in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt pathway. In the nucleus, it is a transcriptional repressor of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor. In the centrosome, it regulates spindle pole localization of the cohesin subunit Scc1, thereby mediating centriole cohesion during mitosis. Although the function of Aki1 has been well clarified, the regulatory machinery of Aki1 is poorly understood. We previously found that Aki1 in mitotic cells displayed reduced mobility on immunoblot analysis, but the reason for this was unclear. Here we show that the electrophoretic mobility shift of Aki1 is derived from mitotic phosphorylation. The cyclin B1\u2013cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) complex was found to be one of the kinases responsible for Aki1 phosphorylation during mitosis. We identified the Ser208 residue of Aki1 as a cyclin B1\u2013Cdk1 phosphorylation site. Furthermore, cyclin B1\u2013Cdk1 inhibitor treatment was shown to attenuate the level of Aki1 in complex with Scc1, suggesting that Aki1 phosphorylation by cyclin B1\u2013Cdk1 contributes to Aki1\u2013Scc1 complex formation. Our results indicate that cyclin B1\u2013Cdk1 is a kinase of Aki1 during mitosis and that its phosphorylation of Aki1 may regulate mitotic function.",

The recent progress in ESC technologies is noteworthy, but ESC differentiation into renal lineages is relatively less established. The present study aims to differentiate mouse ESCs (mESCs) into a renal progenitor pool, the intermediate mesoderm (IM), without addition of exogenous cytokines and embryoid formation. First, we treated mESCs with a combination of small molecules (Janus-associated tyrosine kinase inhibitor 1, LY294002, and CCG1423) and differentiated them into BMP7-positive cells, BMP7 being the presumed inducing factor for IM. When these cells were cultured with adding retinoic acid, expression of odd-skipped related 1 (Osr1), which is essential to IM differentiation, was enhanced. To simplify the differentiation protocol, the abovementioned four small molecules (including retinoic acid) were combined and added to the culture. Under this condition, more than one-half of the cells were positive for Osr1, and at the same time, Pax2 (another IM marker) was detected by real-time PCR. Expressions of ectodermal marker and endodermal marker were not enhanced, while mesodermal marker changed. Moreover, expression of genes indispensable to kidney development, i.e., Lim1 and WT1, was detected by RT-PCR. These results indicate the establishment of a specific, effective method for differentiation of the ESC monolayer into IM using a combination of small molecules, resulting in an attractive cell source that could be experimentally differentiated to understand nephrogenic mechanisms and cell-to-cell interactions in embryogenesis.",

The acceleration of the generation of bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrases (CA) has been suggested as one of the pathways used by ameloblasts cells to regulate extracellular pH yet only two isozymes (CA II and CA VI) have been reported to date during enamel formation. The mammalian CA family contains 16 different isoforms of which 13 are enzymatically active. We have conducted a systematic screening by RT-PCR on the expression of all known CA isoforms in mouse enamel organ epithelium (EOE) cells dissected from new born, in secretory ameloblasts derived from 7-day-old animals, and in the LS8 ameloblast cell line. Results show that all CA isoforms are expressed by EOE/ameloblast cells in vivo. The most highly expressed are the catalytic isozymes CA II, VI, IX, and XIII, and the acatalytic CA XI isoform. Only minor differences were found in CA expression levels between 1-day EOE cells and 7-day-old secretory-stage ameloblasts, whereas LS8 cells expressed fewer CA isoforms than both of these. The broad expression of CAs by ameloblasts reported here contributes to our understanding of pH homeostasis during enamel development and demonstrates its complexity.

     "abstract": "Recent studies reported that bone marrow cavity offers a widely distributed and well-vascularized microenvironment which is a considerable implantation site for bioartificial pancreas (BAP). In this study, the in vivo performance of BAPs in bone marrow was further demonstrated in a spontaneous diabetes animal. Mouse insulinoma cells encapsulating in agarose gel were enclosed in a calcium phosphate cement chamber to create a BAP. Ten BAPs were implanted into the femur bone marrow cavity of a diabetic feline. The preprandial blood glucose level, 2\u00a0h glucose curve, serum C-peptide level and physiological conditions of the recipient were recorded perioperatively. Results showed that the cat still suffered from hyperglycemia postoperatively. However, the physiological conditions of feline were improved with an increase of serum C-peptide level. The peak point of 2\u00a0h glucose curve decreased from 400 to 165\u2013290\u00a0mg/dl. The efficiency of exogenous insulin extended from 2 to 10\u201314\u00a0h postoperatively which reveals that the implanted BAPs had partial function. This case report revealed that BAPs implanted in the bone marrow cavity for the spontaneous diabetic is effective. The implanted BAPs provided therapeutic benefit despite sustained hyperglycemia. Further study shall be considered to improve the outcomes of BAPs transplantation.",

For this purpose, an 830\u00a0bp cDNA fragment of muskmelon sucrose phosphate synthase was expressed in antisense orientation behind the 35S promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus. The phenotype of the antisense plants clearly differed from that of control plants. The transgenic plant leaves were markedly smaller, and the plant height and stem diameter were obviously shorter and thinner. Transmission electron microscope observation revealed that the membrane degradation of chloroplast happened in transgenic leaves and the numbers of grana and grana lamella in the chloroplast were significantly less, suggesting that the slow growth and weaker phenotype of transgenic plants may be due to the damage of the chloroplast ultrastructure, which in turn results in the decrease of the net photosynthetic rate. The sucrose concentration and levels of sucrose phosphate synthase decreased in transgenic mature fruit, and the fruit size was smaller than the control fruit. Together, our results suggest that sucrose phosphate synthase may play an important role in regulating the muskmelon plant growth and fruit development.",

Importantly, gingival MSCs display stable morphology and do not loose MSC characteristic at higher passages. In addition, gingival MSCs maintain normal karyotype and telomerase activity in long-term cultures, and are not tumorigenic.

Combining the advantages of the existence of a complete range of enzymes required for LC-PUFA biosynthesis and the well established developmental biology tools in zebrafish, we examined the expression patterns of three LC-PUFA biosynthesis genes, Elovl2-like elongase (elovl2), Elovl5-like elongase (elovl5) and fatty acyl desaturase (fad) in different zebrafish developmental stages. The presence of all three genes in the brain as early as 24\u00a0hours post fertilization (hpf) implies LC-PUFA synthesis activity in the embryonic brain. This expression eventually subsides from 72\u00a0hpf onwards, coinciding with the initiation of elovl2 and fad expression in the liver and intestine, 2 organs known to be involved in adult fish LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Collectively, these patterns strongly suggest the necessity for localized production of LC-PUFA in the brain during in early stage embryos prior to the maturation of the liver and intestine. Interestingly, we also showed a specific expression of elovl5 in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the zebrafish pronephros, suggesting a possible new role for LC-PUFA in kidney development and function.",

In this work we tested whether cholesterol accumulation upon NPC1 dysfunction, which causes Niemann Pick type C disease (NPC), causes increased partitioning of APP into lipid rafts leading to increased CTF/A\u03b2 formation in these cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains. To test this we used CHO NPC1\u2212/\u2212 cells (NPC cells) and parental CHOwt cells. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation we observed a shift in fl-APP/CTF compartmentalization into lipid raft fractions upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC vs. wt cells. Furthermore, \u03b3-secretase inhibitor treatment significantly increased fl-APP/CTF distribution in raft fractions in NPC vs. wt cells, suggesting that upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-null cells increased formation of APP\u2013CTF and its increased processing towards A\u03b2 occurs in lipid rafts. Our results support that cholesterol overload, such as in NPC disease, leads to increased partitioning of APP/CTF into lipid rafts resulting in increased amyloidogenic processing of APP in these cholesterol-rich membranes. This work adds to the mechanism of the cholesterol-effect on APP processing and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and supports the role of lipid rafts in these processes.",

Here, we report the structure of a thermostable OYE homolog in its holoform at 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 as well as its complex with p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (pHBA). The enzyme crystallized as octamers with the monomers showing a classical TIM barrel fold which upon dimerization yields the biologically active form of the protein. A sulfate ion is bound above the si-side of the non-covalently bound FMN cofactor in the oxidized solved structure but is displaced upon pHBA binding. The active-site architecture is highly conserved as with other members of this enzyme family. The pHBA in the CrS complex is positioned by hydrogen bonding to the two conserved catalytic-site histidines. The most prominent structural difference between CrS and other OYE homologs is the size of the \u201ccapping domain\u201d. Thermostabilization of the enzyme is achieved in part through increased proline content within loops and turns as well as increased intersubunit interactions through hydrogen bonding and complex salt bridge networks. CrS is able to reduce the CC bonds of \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds with a preference towards cyclic substrates however no activity was observed towards \u03b2-substituted substrates. Mutational studies have confirmed the role of Tyr177 as the proposed proton donor although reduction could still occur at a reduced rate when this residue was mutated to phenylalanine.",

Although immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling is critical for osteoclast differentiation, the significance of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) has not been well understood. Here we report the function of Ly49Q, an Ly49 family member possessing an ITIM motif, in osteoclastogenesis. Ly49Q is selectively induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) ligand (RANKL) stimulation in bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells (BMMs) among the Ly49 family of NK receptors. The knockdown of Ly49Q resulted in a significant reduction in the RANKL-induced formation of tartrate-resistance acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells, accompanied by a decreased expression of osteoclast-specific genes such as Nfatc1, Tm7sf4, Oscar, Ctsk, and Acp5. Osteoclastogenesis was also significantly impaired in Ly49Q-deficient cells in vitro. The inhibitory effect of Ly49Q-deficiency may be explained by the finding that Ly49Q competed for the association of Src-homology domain-2 phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) with paired immunoglobulin-like receptor-B (PIR-B), an ITIM-bearing receptor which negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation. Unexpectedly, Ly49Q deficiency did not lead to impaired osteoclast formation in vivo, suggesting the existence of a compensatory mechanism. This study provides an example in which an ITIM-bearing receptor functions as a positive regulator of osteoclast differentiation.",

A small subset of PrPC molecules, however, can be integrated into the ER-membrane via a transmembrane domain (TM), which also harbors the most highly conserved regions of PrPC, termed the hydrophobic core (HC). A mutation in HC is associated with prion disease resulting in an enhanced formation of a transmembrane form (CtmPrP), which has thus been postulated to be a neurotoxic molecule besides PrPSc. To elucidate a possible physiological function of the transmembrane domain, we created a set of mutants carrying microdeletions of 2\u20138 aminoacids within HC between position 114 and 121. Here, we show that these mutations display reduced propensity for transmembrane topology. In addition, the mutants exhibited alterations in the formation of the C1 proteolytic fragment, which is generated by \u03b1-cleavage during normal PrPC metabolism, indicating that HC might function as recognition site for the protease(s) responsible for PrPC \u03b1-cleavage. Interestingly, the mutant G113V, corresponding to a hereditary form of prion disease in humans, displayed increased CtmPrP topology and decreased \u03b1-cleavage in our in vitro assay.

However, its expression in skin, bone, heart and liver, but not in gut, brain and spinal cord, became relatively weak on ED19 and disappeared after birth (ND2). Ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin facilitated the proliferation of cultured fetal (ED17, 19), but not neonatal (ND2), skin cells. On the other hand, with regard to cells from the spinal cord and hypothalamus, the proliferative effect of ghrelin continued after birth, whereas the effect of des-acyl ghrelin on neurogenesis in these tissues was lost at the ED19 fetal and ND2 neonatal stages. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the cells in the hypothalamus induced to proliferate by ghrelin at the ND2 stage were positive for nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein. These results suggest that in the period immediately prior to, and after birth, rat fetal cells showing proliferation in response to ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin are at a transitional stage characterized by alteration of the expression of GHS-R1a and an undefined des-acyl ghrelin receptor, their responsiveness varying among different tissues.",

However, the presence of numerous proton-containing groups in the heme cofactors and the magnetic properties of the heme iron, in particular in the oxidised state, complicates significantly the assignment of the NMR signals. Consequently, the multiheme proteins superfamily is extremely under-represented in structural databases, which constitutes a severe bottleneck in the elucidation of their structural\u2013functional relationships. In this work, we present a strategy that simplifies the assignment of the NMR signals in multiheme proteins and, concomitantly, their solution structure determination, using the triheme cytochrome PpcA from the bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens as a model. Cost-effective isotopic labeling was used to double label (13C/15N) the protein in its polypeptide chain, with the correct folding and heme post-translational modifications. The combined analysis of 1H\u201313C HSQC NMR spectra obtained for labeled and unlabeled samples of PpcA allowed a straight discrimination between the heme cofactors and the polypeptide chain signals and their confident assignment.

Enhancing the uptake function of astrocytic glutamate transport 1 (GLT1) may be a potential treatment for this disease. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) are capable of secreting a large number of cytokines which exhibit diverse pharmacological effects. Therefore, we investigate the influence of the soluble factors released by hADSCs on the GLT1 in primary astrocytes cultured from SOD1G93A mice, a widely studied mutant human SOD1 transgenic model of ALS. Our data indicate that soluble factors from hADSCs significantly upregulate the expression of GLT1 in SOD1G93A-bearing astrocytes, which result in enhanced glutamate uptake function. The upregulation of GLT1 is accompanied by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation in mutant astrocytes. In addition, we find that hADSCs cocultured with SOD1G93A-bearing astrocytes produce more VEGF, HGF and IGF-1, which are reported to have neuroprotective effects. Our results suggest that hADSCs may be a potential candidate in cellular therapy for ALS.",

Although detailed structural characterization is crucial for further understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the OPN functions, its intrinsically disordered property hampers in-depth conformational analyses. Here we report an NMR study of mouse OPN and its N-terminal thrombin-cleavage product to characterize intramolecular interaction of this molecule. Paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiment revealed that OPN exhibits a long-range intramolecular interaction between the N- and C-terminal regions. Furthermore, our NMR data showed that anti-OPN antibody OPN1.2, whose reactivity is impaired by deletion or amino acid substitutions of the arginine-aspartate-glycine integrin-binding motif, binds the N-terminal side of the integrin-binding motifs suggesting the existence of intramolecular interaction.

Here, auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1), one of the auxin receptors in Arabidopsis, was identified as a potential substrate of AtRma2 through a yeast two-hybrid assay. An in vitro pull-down assay confirmed the interaction of full-length AtRma2 with ABP1. AtRma2 was transiently expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants through an Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration method and bound ABP1 in vivo. In vitro ubiquitination assays revealed that bacterially-expressed AtRma2 ubiquitinated ABP1. ABP1 was poly-ubiquitinated in tobacco cells and its stability was significantly increased in the presence of MG132, a 26S proteasome inhibitor.

Here, we used a bicistronic vector expressing a target gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP) to create a system in which the effect of an siRNA sequence was reflected in the GFP expression level. Cells were transduced with the bicistronic vector, expression vectors for siRNA and red fluorescent protein (RFP). Flow cytometric analysis of the transduced cells revealed that siRNAs for the target gene silenced GFP from the bicistronic vector, but did not silence GFP transcribed without the target gene sequence. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensities of GFP on RFP-expressing cells correlated well with the target gene mRNA and protein levels. These results suggest that this flow cytometry-based method enables us to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy and specificity of siRNAs.

HIV-1 PR was shown to act invitro as acyl-donor and -acceptor for both guinea pig liver transglutaminase (TG, EC 2.3.2.13) and human Factor XIIIa. These preliminary evidences suggested that the HIV-1 PR contains at least three TG-reactive glutaminyl and one lysyl residues. We report here that the incubation of HIV-1 PR with TG increases its catalytic activity. This increase is dependent upon the time of incubation, the concentration of TG and the presence of Ca2+. Identification of \u03b5-(\u03b3-glutamyl)lysine in the proteolytic digest of the TG-modified HIV-1 PR suggested intramolecular covalent cross-linking of this protease which may promote a non-covalent dimerization and subsequent activation of this enzyme via a conformational change. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the TG-catalyzed activation of HIV-1 PR was completely abolished by spermidine (SPD) which acts as a competitive inhibitor of \u03b5-(\u03b3-glutamyl)lysine formation. Indeed, in the presence of 1\u00a0mM SPD the formation of the isopeptide was decreased of about 80%. The main products of the TG-catalyzed modification of HIV-1 PR in the presence of SPD were N1-mono(\u03b3-glutamyl)SPD and N8-mono(\u03b3-glutamyl)SPD.

     "abstract": "Apocynin has been extensively used as an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (NOX) in many experimental models using phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells. Currently, there is some controversy about the efficacy of apocynin in non-phagocytic cells, but in phagocytes the reported results are consistent, which could be due to the presence of myeloperoxidase in these cells. This enzyme has been proposed as responsible for activating apocynin by generating its dimer, diapocynin, which is supposed to be the active compound that prevents NADPH oxidase complex assembly and activation.Here, we synthesized diapocynin and studied its effect on inhibition of gp91phox RNA expression. We found that diapocynin strongly inhibited the expression of gp91phoxmRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Only at a higher concentration, apocynin was able to exert the same effect. We also compared the apocynin and diapocynin efficacy as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated PBMC. Although apocynin did inhibit TNF-\u03b1 production, diapocynin had a much more pronounced effect, on both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 production. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the bioconversion of apocynin to diapocynin is an important issue not limited to enzymatic activity inhibition, but also for other biological effects as gp91phox mRNA expression and cytokine production. Hence, as diapocynin can be easily prepared from apocynin, a one-step synthesis, we recommend its use in studies where the biological effects of apocynin are searched.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in the genes for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) have been recently identified in glioblastoma. In the present study, we investigated IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), with the latter, like glioblastoma, having a rapidly aggressive and lethal clinical course. By direct genomic DNA sequencing, we analyzed exon 4 of the IDH1 and IDH2 genes that harbored the mutation hot spots codon 132 and 172 of the two genes in glioblastoma, respectively, in 12 thyroid cancer cell lines, 20 FTC, and 18 ATC tumor samples. A novel homozygous G367A IDH1 mutation, resulting in a G123R amino acid change in codon 123, was identified in a case of ATC. A previously described IDH1 V71I mutation was found in a case of FTC and a case of ATC and no mutations were found in the cell lines. The overall prevalence of mutations was thus 1/20 (5%) in FTC and 2/18 (11%) in ATC. We did not find mutation in the IDH2 gene in these thyroid cancer cell lines and tumor samples. Sequence alignment analysis of 16 species revealed that the novel IDH1 G123R mutation was located in a highly conserved region, raising the possibility of a serious functional consequence as could also be predicted by the occurrence of a positively charged amino acid from this mutation. To test this, we created a G123R mutant by site-directed mutagenesis and demonstrated a decreased enzymatic activity of IDH1, similar to the expected reduction in the enzymatic activity of the previously described R132H IDH1 mutant measured as a control. Thus, functionally relevant IDH1 mutations can also occur in thyroid cancer, particularly ATC, suggesting a potential tumorigenic role of the IDH1 system that could represent a new therapeutic target for thyroid cancer.",

The ligand-binding subunit GABAB1 is at first retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported to the cell surface only upon assembly with GABAB2. Here, we report that GABAB1, via the coiled-coil domain, can also bind to soluble proteins of unknown function, that are affected in 22q11 deletion/DiGeorge syndrome and are therefore referred to as DiGeorge critical region 6 (DGCR6). In transfected neurons the GABAB1\u2013DGCR6 association resulted in a redistribution of both proteins into intracellular clusters. Furthermore, the C-terminus of GABAB2 interfered with the novel interaction, consistent with heterodimer formation overriding transient DGCR6-binding to GABAB1.

In HT1080 cells, positive both in MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP, the migration as well as the invasion was impaired by MT1-MMP or MT2-MMP suppression.

To better understand regulation of Cu homeostasis in plants, we use adult plant of Arabidopsis thaliana to provide an integrated view of how Cu status affects the expression of genes involved in cellular Cu homoeostasis. In doing so, we use real-time RT-PCR to compare shoot and roots transcriptional responses to Cu. We measure changes in the abundance of transcripts encoding transporters, chaperones and P-type ATPases and correlated those changes with variation of Cu content in both tissues. Our results indicated that in both tissues transcript levels of COPT2, 4, and ZIP2 transporters and CCH chaperone were significantly down-regulated comparing to controls plants in response to Cu excess. In contrast, Cu chaperones ATX1, CCS, COX17-1 including two putative mitochondrial chaperones (At3g08950; At1g02410) were up-regulated under similar conditions. Regarding P-type ATPases, a reduction of HMA1, PAA1, PAA2, and RAN1 transcript levels in shoot after Cu exposure was observed, while HMA5 transcripts increased exclusively in roots. In plants growing under Cu-deficient conditions, COPT2, ZIP2, HMA1, andPAA2, were significantly up-regulated in shoots. Thus, our results indicated a common transcriptional regulation pattern of transporters and chaperone components, in particular transcriptional changes of COPT2, ZIP2, and CCH showed an inverse relation with Cu content suggesting that these proteins are required to avoid excess and deficit of Cu.",

Omi-deficient mitochondria are more sensitive to mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), which raises the possibility that mPT plays a role in motor neurodegeneration in mnd2 mice. Given that cyclophilin D (CypD)-deficient mitochondria are resistant to mPT, we examined whether CypD-dependent mPT is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders in mnd2 mice by generating CypD-deficient mnd2 mice. Brain mitochondria isolated from CypD-deficient mnd2 mice were more resistant to Ca2+-induced mPT than those of mnd2 mice. However, both mnd2 mice and CypD-deficient mnd2 mice showed similar survival periods and phenotypes, including the lack of weight gain, muscle wasting, and resting tremor. Our data suggest that CypD-dependent mPT does not play a major role in neurodegeneration in mnd2 mice.",

NAD(P)H oxidase, producing superoxide anion, is the main source of ROS in diabetic podocytes and their production contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy. We have investigated the effect of an antidiabetic drug, metformin on the production of superoxide anion in cultured podocytes and attempted to elucidate underlying mechanisms.The experiments were performed in normal (NG, 5.6\u00a0mM) and high (HG, 30\u00a0mM) glucose concentration. Overall ROS production was measured by fluorescence of a DCF probe. Activity of NAD(P)H oxidase was measured by chemiluminescence method. The AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK) activity was determined by immunobloting, measuring the ratio of phosphorylated AMPK to total AMPK. Glucose accumulation was measured using 2-deoxy-[1,2-3H]-glucose.ROS production increased by about 27% (187\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 vs. 238\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 arbitrary units AU, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in HG. Metformin (2\u00a0mM, 2\u00a0h) markedly reduced ROS production by 45% in NG and 60% in HG. Metformin decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity in NG (36%) and HG (86%). AMPK activity was increased by metformin in NG and HG (from 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 to. 0.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06, and from 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 to 0.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The effects of metformin on the activities of NAD(P)H oxidase and AMPK were abolished in the presence of AMPK inhibitor, compound C.We have shown that metformin decreases production of ROS through reduction of NAD(P)H oxidase activity.

LDs are believed to be generated between the two leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and to play various roles, such as high effective energy storage. However, it remains largely unknown how LDs are generated and grow in the cytoplasm. We have previously shown that the Atg conjugation system that is essential for autophagosome formation is involved in LD formation in hepatocytes and cardiac myocytes. We show here that LC3 itself is involved in LD formation by using RNA interference (RNAi). All cultured cell lines examined, in which the expression of LC3 was suppressed by RNAi, showed reduced LD formation. Triacylglycerol, a major component of LDs, was synthesized and degraded in LC3 mRNA-knockdown cells as well as in control cells. Interestingly, potential of the bulk protein degradation in the knockdown-cells was also evident in the control cells. These findings indicate that LC3 is involved in the LD formation regardless of the bulk degradation, and that LC3 has two pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis mediated by autophagy and lipid metabolism.",

The functional effect of iodide occurs at multiple steps, which include inhibition of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) expression, transient block of organification, and inhibition of hormonal release. The vascular effect likely involves suppression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene. In this report, we show that excess iodide coordinately suppresses the expression of the NIS and VEGF genes in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. We also demonstrate that the mechanism of iodide suppression of NIS gene expression is transcriptional, which is synergized by the addition of thyroglobulin. Based on the findings of reporter gene assays and electrophoretic gel mobility shift analysis, we also report two novel DNA binding proteins that responded specifically to iodide and modulated NIS promoter activity. The results suggest that excess iodide affects thyroid vascular function in addition to iodide uptake. This study provides additional insights into the mechanism of action of excess iodide on thyroid function.",

Deletion constructs of the 5\u2032 flanking region were fused to a luciferase reporter gene. After transient transfection in HepG2 and Hep3B cells, a minimal region \u2212171/\u221253 bearing three SP1-binding sites was identified as the core promoter. Results obtained from electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that SP1 is bound to the core promoter. Deletion of SP1 consensus sequence resulted in the total loss of the promoter activity. Moreover, knockdown of SP1 reduced both CD151 promoter activity and chromatin accessibility.

Disruption of the Utp8p\u2013Utp9p interaction by mutation of the respective interacting domain led to a compromised ability of yeast cells to process 35S pre-rRNA into 18S pre-rRNA.

The abundance of hepatic BDK mRNA and total BDK protein did not correlate with changes in serum insulin concentrations.

Hydrogen-rich saline treatment significantly attenuated the severity of l-Arg-induced AP by ameliorating the increased serum amylase activity, inhibiting neutrophil infiltration, lipid oxidation and pancreatic tissue edema. Moreover, hydrogen-rich saline treatment could promote acinar cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and NF-\u03baB activation.

In this study, we investigated whether cell survival could be suppressed by a combination of the dispersion of lipid raft microdomains and treatment with genistein, a well-known potential isoflavone, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Cell viability was assayed by the property of reagent change upon reduction of resazurin to resorufin and apoptosis was evaluated by ethidium bromide/acridine orange (EB/AO) staining and PARP and caspase-3 expression. Signal transduction was investigated by immunoblot analysis. Cell viability decreased significantly more following successive double treatment with genistein and the cholesterol-lowering agent 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) than in response to either agent alone. Apoptotic cell staining and cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 appeared more clearly in double-treated cells than in those treated with genistein alone. In cell signaling, both HPCD and genistein decreased the protein expressions of pAkt as well as the androgen receptors stimulated by EGF and DHT, respectively, in concentration-dependent manners. This pattern was also present in protein levels of pAkt and the androgen receptor located in the lipid raft fraction. Furthermore, the phosphorylation cascade of Akt, GSK-3\u03b2 and p70S6k was markedly inhibited by the combination treatment. These data suggest that prostate cancer cells could be effectively inhibited by combination treatment of cholesterol-lowering strategies and genistein. The mechanism is likely to be partially via both the EGFR-mediated Akt or p70S6k pathways and a down-regulation of androgen receptor in the lipid raft microdomain.",

In a murine model of sepsis, we sought to elucidate which leukocytes are early IL-10 producers. Using a novel IL-10 transcriptional reporter mouse, we observed that splenic leukocytes produced little IL-10. At the site of infection, peritoneal neutrophils produced the highest levels of IL-10 among leukocytes. Using cytokine antibody labeling, we further show that peritoneal neutrophils had high amounts of intracellular IL-10. We next depleted neutrophils and found a 40% decrease in peritoneal IL-10 levels. Altogether, this report demonstrates that among leukocytes, neutrophils are significant contributors of IL-10 at the site of infection during sepsis.",

     "abstract": "The 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM), isolated from extracts of Melia azedarach L., displays antiviral and immunomodulating properties. CDM is the first reported tetranortriterpenoid responsible for the alkalinization of intracellular compartments affecting both, viral endocytic and exocytic pathways. Considering that viral glycoprotein synthesis is completely dependent upon cellular membrane trafficking, we questioned whether CDM might also interfere with the normal transport of cellular glycoproteins. This study demonstrates that CDM promoted a transient block in the transport of two cellular glycoproteins, the transferrin receptor (TfR) and TNF-\u03b1. Nevertheless, CDM did not affect the transferrin binding ability of TfR and did not impede the TNF-\u03b1 secretion. On the other hand, CDM disturbed the intracellular localization of capsid, glycoprotein and tegument proteins simultaneously in the same HSV-1 infected cells. Besides, we show that concanamycin A and monensin provoke a permanent blockage of viral and cellular glycoproteins, in contrast to the delay observed after CDM treatment. Thus, the delay on glycoprotein transport caused by CDM would account for the strong inhibition on virus multiplication without interfering with the bioactivity of cellular glycoproteins.",

Transgenic plants with constitutively higher expression of the GbTLP1 showed enhanced resistance against different stress agents, particularly, its performance against Verticillium dahliae was exceptional. Transgenic tobacco plants also exhibited considerable resistance against Fusarium oxysporum and some abiotic stresses including salinity and drought. In this experiment, transgenic plants without GbTLP1 expression were also used as controls, which behaved similar to non-transgenic control plants. Overexpression of GbTLP1 had no significant deleterious effect on plant growth except that flowering was delayed for 3\u20135\u00a0weeks.

Here we show investigation of the effect of lead, which is a divalent ion (Pb2+). Intracellular Ca2+ and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed on HEK 293 cells conditionally over-expressing TRPC5 or other TRP channels. Extracellular application of Pb2+ stimulated TRPC5 at concentrations greater than 1\u00a0\u03bcM. Control cells without TRPC5 showed little or no response to Pb2+ and expression of other TRP channels (TRPM2 or TRPM3) revealed partial inhibition by 10\u00a0\u03bcM Pb2+. The stimulatory effect on TRPC5 depended on an extracellular residue (E543) near the ion pore: similar to gadolinium action, E543Q TRPC5 was resistant to Pb2+ but showed normal stimulation by the receptor agonist sphingosine-1-phosphate. The study shows that Pb2+ is a relatively potent stimulator of the TRPC5 channel, generating the hypothesis that a function of the channel is to sense metal ion poisoning.",

Accordingly, we have developed different approaches for managing heart failure by using conventional microarray analyses. We analyzed gene expression profiles of myocardial samples from 12 patients with heart failure and constructed datasets of heart failure-associated genes using clinical parameters such as pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and ejection fraction (EF). From these 12 genes, we selected four genes with high expression levels in the heart, and examined their novelty by performing a literature-based search. In addition, we included four G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-encoding genes, three enzyme-encoding genes, and one ion-channel protein-encoding gene to identify a drug target for heart failure using in silico microarray database. After the in vitro functional screening using adenovirus transfections of 12 genes into rat cardiomyocytes, we generated gene-targeting mice of five candidate genes, namely, MYLK3, GPR37L1, GPR35, MMP23, and NBC1. The results revealed that systolic blood pressure differed significantly between GPR35-KO and GPR35-WT mice as well as between GPR37L1-Tg and GPR37L1-KO mice. Further, the heart weight/body weight ratio between MYLK3-Tg and MYLK3-WT mice and between GPR37L1-Tg and GPR37L1-KO mice differed significantly. Hence, microarray analysis combined with clinical parameters can be an effective method to identify novel therapeutic targets for the prevention or management of heart failure.",

Activated PSCs produce various inflammatory cytokines including TGF-\u03b21. In this study, we investigated whether IL-13 affects pancreatic fibrogenesis by modulating the functions of PSCs. IL-13 promoted PSCs proliferation without activation through the suppression of autocrine TGF-\u03b21.

Cigarette smoke (CS)-mediated oxidative stress is implicated in endothelial dysfunction. However, the role of SIRT1 in regulation of eNOS by CS and oxidants are not known. We hypothesized that CS-mediated oxidative stress downregulates SIRT1 leading to acetylation of eNOS which results in reduced nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signaling and endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and H2O2 showed decreased SIRT1 levels, activity, but increased phosphorylation concomitant with increased eNOS acetylation. Pre-treatment of endothelial cells with resveratrol significantly attenuated the CSE- and oxidant-mediated SIRT1 levels and eNOS acetylation.

Correlation analysis revealed a strong association of the RBP4-TTR ratio with parameters of lipid metabolism and with diabetes-related factors.

Strategies to reduce lipid accumulation in macrophages may have therapeutic potential for preventing and treating atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications. The antidiabetic drug metformin has been reported to reduce lipid accumulation in adipocytes. In this study, we examined the effects of metformin on lipid accumulation in macrophages and investigated the mechanisms involved. Methods and results: We observed that metformin significantly reduced palmitic acid (PA)-induced intracellular lipid accumulation in macrophages. Metformin promoted the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1), while reduced the expression of fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) which was involved in PA-induced lipid accumulation. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that metformin regulates FABP4 expression at the transcriptional level. We identified forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 as a positive regulator of FABP4 expression. Inhibiting FOXO1 expression with FOXO1 siRNA significantly reduced basal and PA-induced FABP4 expression. Overexpression of wild-type FOXO1 and constitutively active FOXO1 significantly increased FABP4 expression, whereas dominant negative FOXO1 dramatically decreased FABP4 expression. Metformin reduced FABP4 expression by promoting FOXO1 nuclear exclusion and subsequently inhibiting its activity. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that metformin reduces lipid accumulation in macrophages by repressing FOXO1-mediated FABP4 transcription. Thus, metformin may have a protective effect against lipid accumulation in macrophages and may serve as a therapeutic agent for preventing and treating atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome.",

To address the possible importance of NAT1 in breast cancer, we have used a novel small molecule inhibitor (Rhod-o-hp) of the enzyme to examine growth and invasion of the breast adenocarcinoma line MDA-MB-231.

Several apoA-IV isoforms exist, the most common in Caucasian populations being apoA-IV-1a (T347S) and apoA-IV-2 (Q360H). The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of these common aminoacid substitutions on the ability of apoA-IV to bind lipids, to promote cell cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, and to maintain endothelial homeostasis. Recombinant forms of wild-type apoA-IV, apoA-IV Q360H, and apoA-IV T347S were produced in Escherichia coli. ApoA-IV Q360H and apoA-IV T347S showed a slightly higher \u03b1-helical content compared to wild-type apoA-IV, and associated with phospholipids faster than wild-type apoA-IV. The capacity to promote ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux was significantly greater for the apoA-IV T347S than the other apoA-IV isoforms. No differences were observed in the ability of apoA-IV isoforms to inhibit the production of VCAM-1 and IL-6 in TNF\u03b1-stimulated endothelial cells. In conclusion, the apoA-IV T347S common variant has increased lipid binding properties and cholesterol efflux capacity, while the apoA-IV Q360H variant has only slightly increased lipid binding properties. The two common aminoacid substitutions have no effect on the ability of apoA-IV to maintain endothelial homeostasis.",

The assay is tested using the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 helicase as a model. We prepared a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrate with a 5\u2032 fluorophore-labeled strand hybridized to a 3\u2032 quencher-labeled strand. When the dsRNA is unwound by helicase, the fluorescence of the fluorophore is emitted following the separation of the strands. Unlike in conventional gel-based assays, this new assay eliminates the complex and time-consuming steps, and can be used to simply measure the real-time kinetics in a single helicase reaction. Our results demonstrate that Alexa Fluor 488 and BHQ1 are an effective fluorophore\u2013quencher pair, and this assay is suitable for the quantitative measurement of the RNA helicase activity of HCV NS3. Moreover, we found that several extracts of marine organisms exhibited different inhibitory effects on the RNA and DNA helicase activities of HCV NS3. We propose that this assay will be useful for monitoring the detailed kinetics of RNA unwinding mechanisms and screening RNA helicase inhibitors at high throughput.",

Mucin production in airway epithelia is increased under conditions of oxidative stress. Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP)-1 suppression is related to the development of airway inflammation and increased ROS levels. In this study, we investigated the role of SHP-1 in mucin secretion triggered by oxidative stress. Human lung mucoepidermoid H292 carcinoma cells were transfected with specific siRNA to eliminate SHP-1 gene expression. Cultured cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and Mucin 5AC(MUC5AC) gene expression and mucin production were determined. Activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) in association with MUC5AC production was evaluated. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was employed to determine whether antioxidants could block MUC5AC production. To establish the precise role of p38, mucin expression was observed after pre-treatment of SHP-1-depleted H292 cells with the p38 chemical blocker. We investigated the in vivo effects of oxidative stress on airway mucus production in SHP-1-deficient heterozygous (mev/+) mice. MUC5AC expression was enhanced in SHP-1 knockdown H292 cells exposed to H2O2, compared to that in control cells. The ratio between phosphorylated and total p38 was significantly increased in SHP-1-deficient cells under oxidative stress. Pre-treatment with NAC suppressed both MUC5AC production and p38 activation. Blockage of p38 MAPK led to suppression of MUC5AC mRNA expression. Notably, mucin production was enhanced in the airway epithelia of mev/+ mice exposed to oxidative stress. Our results clearly indicate that SHP-1 plays an important role in airway mucin production through regulating oxidative stress.",

In this study, expressions of Notch1 and hes1 in four human ovarian cancer (A2780, SKOV3, HO-8910, and HO-8910PM), and one ovarian surface (IOSE 144) cell lines were detected by Western blot and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. The effects of \u03b3-secretase inhibition (N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, DAPT) were measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry, ELISA and colony-forming assay. Our results showed that Notch1 and hes1 were found in all the four human ovarian cancer and IOSE 144 cell lines, and they were significantly higher in ovarian cancer cells A2780 compared to another four ovarian cells. Down-regulation of Notch1 expression by DAPT was able to substantially inhibit cell growth, induce G1 cell cycle arrest and induce cell apoptosis in A2780 in dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, hes1 was found to be down-regulated in dose- and time-dependent manner by DAPT in A2780. These results demonstrate that treatment with DAPT leads to growth inhibition and apoptosis of A2780 cells in dose- and time-dependent manner. These findings also support the conclusion that blocking of the Notch1 activity by \u03b3-secretase inhibitors represents a potentially attractive strategy of targeted therapy for ovarian cancer.",

It is believed that exploring the inter-relations between stem cells mechanical properties and lineage commitment will shed light on the mechanobiology aspect of differentiation. hMSCs were cultured in adipogenic and osteogenic mediums and the elastic moduli were monitored using micropipette aspiration. It was found that hMSCs undergoing osteogenesis have an instantaneous Young\u2019s modulus of 890\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0219\u00a0Pa and an equilibrium Young\u2019s modulus of 224\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0Pa, each is about 2-fold higher than the control group. Interestingly, cells cultured in adipogenic medium exhibited a slight increase in the cellular modulus followed by a decrease relative to that of the control group. Gene expression study was employed to gain insights into this phenomenon. Concomitant up regulation of actin binding filamin A (FLNa) and \u03b3-Tubulin with the cellular elastic modulus indicated their important role in mechanical regulation during hMSCs differentiation. Statistical results showed that cell shape and cell area changed with cellular mechanical properties, which means that cell morphology has a close relation with cell elastic modulus in the initial stage of differentiation. Collectively, these results provide a quantitative description of hMSCs mechanical behavior during the process of differentiation as well as the possible accompanying mechanism at the biomolecular level.",

The present study examined the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulatory effect of epicatechins on eNOS. NO-mediated relaxation was assessed using porcine coronary artery rings in the presence of indomethacin, and charybdotoxin plus apamin, inhibitors of cyclooxygenases and EDHF-mediated responses, respectively. The phosphorylation level of Akt and eNOS was assessed in cultured coronary artery endothelial cells by Western blot, and ROS formation using dihydroethidine. (\u2212)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCg) caused endothelium-dependent relaxations in coronary artery rings and the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in endothelial cells. These responses were inhibited by membrane-permeant analogues of superoxide dismutase and catalase, whereas native superoxide dismutase, catalase and inhibitors of major enzymatic sources of reactive oxygen species including NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, cytochrome P450 and the mitochondrial respiration chain were without effect. The EGCg derivative with all hydroxyl functions methylated induced neither relaxations nor the intracellular formation of ROS, whereas both responses were observed when the hydroxyl functions on the gallate moiety were present. In conclusion, EGCg causes endothelium-dependent NO-mediated relaxations of coronary artery rings through the Akt-dependent activation of eNOS in endothelial cells. This response is initiated by the intracellular formation of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, and is critically dependent on the gallate moiety and on the presence of hydroxyl functions possibly through intracellular auto-oxidation.",

NmeIPMS is a homodimer which catalyses the condensation of \u03b1-ketoisovalerate (\u03b1-KIV) and acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), and is inhibited by leucine. NmeIPMS can use alternate \u03b1-ketoacids as substrates and, in contrast to \u03b1-IPMS from other sources, is activated by a range of metal ions including Cd2+ and Zn2+ that have previously been reported as inhibitory, since they suppress the dithiodipyridone assay system rather than the enzyme itself. Previous studies indicate that \u03b1-IPMS is a TIM barrel enzyme with an allosteric leucine-binding domain. To assess the importance of this domain, a truncated form of NmeIPMS was generated and characterised. Loss of the regulatory domain resulted in a loss of the ability to catalyse the aldol reaction, although the enzyme was still able to slowly hydrolyse AcCoA independently of \u03b1-KIV at a rate similar to that of the WT enzyme. This implies that the regulatory domain is not only required for control of enzymatic activity but may assist in the positioning of key residues in the catalytic TIM barrel. The importance of this domain to catalytic function may offer new strategies for inhibitor design.",

Recent studies have suggested that inhibitors of PARG are able to be potent anti-cancer drug. In order to discover the potent and specific Inhibitors of PARG, a quantitative and high-throughput screening assay system is required. However, previous PARG assay systems are not appropriate for high-throughput screening because PARG activity is measured by radioactivities of ADP-ribose residues released from radioisotope (RI)-labeled poly(ADP-ribose). In this study, we developed a non-RI and quantitative assay system for PARG activity based on dot-blot assay using anti-poly(ADP-ribose) and nitrocellulose membrane.

We also show that amount of CD5 associated with lysosomal marker LAMP-1 after stimulation is significantly lower in c-Cbl \u2212/\u2212 thymocytes. CD5 mRNA level did not differ significantly between c-Cbl \u2212/\u2212 and wild type thymocytes. We conclude that CD5 is ubiquitylated; the ubiquitylation is mediated by c-Cbl; CD5 level on a T lymphocyte cell surface is regulated by ubiquitylation and targeting to lysosomes.",

In this work, we characterized the expression pattern of human DAPk like kinase/Zipper interacting protein kinase (Dlk/ZIP kinase) in cancer specimens and cell lines. Dlk expression level was significantly down-regulated in cervical carcinoma cells compared to the surrounding non-tumorous tissues. Overexpression of Dlk led to cell morphological changes, suppressed colony formation and elevated cell apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Both the kinase activity and the cytoplasmic localization were required for its pro-apoptotic tendency. Mechanism exploration revealed that upon serum deprivation, Dlk overexpression could sensitize cells to apoptosis while overexpression of the kinase inactive mutant (Dlk-K42A) was able to rescue apoptotic cell death. Our data thus implicates that Dlk plays a positive role in modulating death-related signaling pathways. Reconstitution of Dlk expression might bring a potential therapeutic approach to cervical carcinoma treatments.",

     "abstract": "Down-regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) expression could modify the ability of IRS-1 to fulfill its functions. It has been proposed that the phosphorylation of IRS-1 on serine residues could promote its degradation. However, few studies have investigated the transcriptional regulation of IRS-1 in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Genotyping for genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed that the transcription factor activating enhancer-binding protein-2\u03b2 (AP-2\u03b2) is a novel candidate gene for conferring susceptibility to obesity and type 2 diabetes. AP-2\u03b2 is expressed in adipose tissue and its expression is increased during the maturation of adipocytes. Overexpression of AP-2\u03b2 leads to adipocyte hypertrophy, directly inhibits adiponectin expression, and enhanced the expression of inflammatory adipokines such as IL-6 and MCP-1. In this study, we found that overexpression of AP-2\u03b2 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes impaired the promoter activity of IRS-1, and subsequently decreased mRNA and protein expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that AP-2\u03b2 bound specifically to the IRS-1 promoter region. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis of the AP-2 binding site located at \u2212362 to \u2212351, relative to the transcription start site, markedly decreased AP-2-induced suppression of IRS-1 promoter activity, whereas other putative AP-2 binding sites did not. Our results clearly showed that AP-2\u03b2 directly decreased IRS-1 expression by binding to its promoter. Based on these findings, we speculate that the AP-2\u03b2 transcriptional factor is a unique regulator of IRS-1 and a candidate gene for insulin resistance.",

Previously, using proteome analysis, we identified Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) as one of the putative target genes of Hoxc8. Here, we asked whether Hoxc8 regulates Pcna expression by directly binding to the regulatory sequence of Pcna. In mouse embryos at embryonic day 11.5, the expression pattern of Pcna was similar to that of Hoxc8 along the anteroposterior body axis. Moreover, Pcna transcript levels as well as cell proliferation rate were increased by overexpression of Hoxc8 in C3H10T1/2 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. Characterization of 2.3\u00a0kb genomic sequence upstream of Pcna coding region revealed that the upstream sequence contains several Hox core binding sequences and one Hox-Pbx binding sequence. Direct binding of Hoxc8 proteins to the Pcna regulatory sequence was verified by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a family of four closely-related genes, IMD1, IMD2 (also known as PUR5), IMD3, and IMD4, encodes the putative IMPDH. Although IMPDH synthesizes guanine in the cytoplasm, it has also been found in the nucleus, where it associates with nucleic acids in human cells. Here, we further show that IMPDH is recruited to actively transcribed region of genes. A synthetic lethal screen using a deletion strain of Ctk1 kinase, a yeast homolog of mammalian Cdk9/P-TEFb that phosphorylates serine 2 within the RNA polymerase II (RNApII) C-terminal domain (CTD), identified that Imd2 genetically interacts with Ctk1. Consistent with this association, IMPDHs were recruited to elongating RNApII only when serine 2 of the CTD was phosphorylated by Ctk1. Loss of Imd2 had little effect on the association of most elongation factors with RNApII. However, in cells lacking Imd2 or all the essential IMPDHs in the presence of minimal guanine, a defect in the association of Ctk1 with the promoter region was seen.

In this study, we investigated its role in corneal epithelium cell proliferation and differentiation. We showed that the 14-3-3\u03c3 mutation in repeated epilation (Er) mutant mice results in a dominant negative truncated protein. Primary corneal epithelial cells expressing the dominant negative protein failed to undergo high calcium-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation. We further demonstrated that blocking endogenous 14-3-3\u03c3 activity in corneal epithelial cells by overexpressing dominative negative 14-3-3\u03c3 led to reduced Notch activity and Notch1/2 transcription. Significantly, expression of the active Notch intracellular domain overcame the block in epithelial cell differentiation in 14-3-3\u03c3 mutant-expressing corneal epithelial cells. We conclude that 14-3-3\u03c3 is critical for regulating corneal epithelial proliferation and differentiation by regulating Notch signaling activity.",

The purpose of this study was to characterize the molecular abnormalities in patients with infantile or later-onset forms of the disease. The complete sequencing of the 14 exons and flanking regions of the HEXA gene was performed with a unique technical condition in 10 unrelated TSD patients. Eleven mutations were identified, including five splice mutations, one insertion, two deletions and three single-base substitutions. Four mutations were novel: two splice mutations (IVS8+5G\u00a0>\u00a0A, IVS2+4delAGTA), one missense mutation in exon 6 (c.621T\u00a0>\u00a0G (p.D207E)) and one small deletion (c.1211\u20131212delTG) in exon 11 resulting in a premature stop codon at residue 429. The c.621T\u00a0>\u00a0G missense mutation was found in a patient presenting an infantile form. Its putative role in the pathogenesis of TSD is suspected as residue 207 is highly conserved in human, mouse and rat. Moreover, structural modelling predicted changes likely to affect substrate binding and catalytic activity of the enzyme. The time-saving procedure reported here could be useful for the characterization of Tay-Sachs-causing mutations, in particular in non-Ashkenazi patients mainly exhibiting rare mutations.",

It is, however, not known whether chaperone molecules such as heat shock proteins contribute to this adenylate cyclase sensitization. Here, we report that treatment of cells with geldanamycin, an inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), led to effective attenuation of morphine-induced adenylate cyclase sensitization. In SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells, morphine significantly increased RNA transcript and protein levels of type I adenylate cyclase, leading to sensitization. Whole-genome tiling array analysis revealed that cAMP response element-binding protein, an important mediator for cellular adaptation to morphine, associated with the proximal promoter of Hsp90AB1 not only in SK-N-SH cells but also in rat PC12 and human embryonic kidney cells. Hsp90AB1 transcript and protein levels increased significantly during morphine treatment, and co-application of geldanamycin (0.1\u201310\u00a0nM) effectively suppressed the increase in forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase activation by 56%. Type I adenylate cyclase, but not Hsp90AB1, underwent significant degradation during geldanamycin treatment.

     "abstract": "Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) belongs to the family of class IIb HDACs and predominantly deacetylates non-histone proteins in the cytoplasm via the C-terminal deacetylase domain of its two tandem deacetylase domains. HDAC6 modulates fundamental cellular processes via deacetylation of \u03b1-tubulin, cortactin, molecular chaperones, and other peptides. Our previous study indicates that HDAC6 mediates TGF-\u03b21-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in A549 cells. In the current study, we identify a novel splicing variant of human HDAC6, hHDAC6p114. The hHDAC6p114 mRNA arises from incomplete splicing and encodes a truncated isoform of the hHDAC6p114 protein of 114\u00a0kDa when compared to the major isoform hHDAC6p131. The hHDAC6p114 protein lacks the first 152 amino acids from N-terminus in the hHDAC6p131 protein, which harbors a nuclear export signal peptide and 76 amino acids of the N-terminal deacetylase domain. hHDAC6p114 is intact in its deacetylase activity against \u03b1-tubulin. The expression hHDAC6p114 is elevated in a MCF-7 derivative that exhibits an EMT-like phenotype. Moreover, hHDAC6p114 is required for TGF-\u03b21-activated gene expression associated with EMT in A549 cells. Taken together, our results implicate that expression and function of hHDAC6p114 is differentially regulated when compared to hHDAC6p131.",

We investigated whether NAD+ depletion by PARP-1 activation plays a role in environmental stimuli/oxidant-induced reduction in SIRT1 activity. Both H2O2 and cigarette smoke (CS) decreased intracellular NAD+ levels in vitro in lung epithelial cells and in vivo in lungs of mice exposed to CS. Pharmacological PARP-1 inhibition prevented oxidant-induced NAD+ loss and attenuated loss of SIRT1 activity. Oxidants decreased SIRT1 activity in lung epithelial cells; however increasing cellular NAD+ cofactor levels by PARP-1 inhibition or NAD+ precursors was unable to restore SIRT1 activity. SIRT1 was found to be carbonylated by CS, which was not reversed by PARP-1 inhibition or selective SIRT1 activator. Overall, these data suggest that environmental/oxidant stress-induced SIRT1 down-regulation and PARP-1 activation are independent events despite both enzymes sharing the same cofactor.",

We have developed a new effective strategy of genetic immunization by activating CD8+ T cells through the ubiquitin-fusion degradation (UFD) pathway. We constructed expression plasmids encoding the amastigote surface protein-2 (ASP-2) of T. cruzi. To induce the UFD pathway, a chimeric gene encoding ubiquitin fused to ASP-2 (pUB-ASP-2) was constructed. Mice immunized with pUB-ASP-2 presented lower parasitemia and longer survival period, compared with mice immunized with pASP-2 alone. Depletion of CD8+ T cells abolished protection against T. cruzi in mice immunized with pUB-ASP-2 while depletion of CD4+ T cells did not influence the effective immunity. Mice deficient in LMP2 or LMP7, subunits of immunoproteasomes, were not able to develop protective immunity induced. These results suggest that ubiquitin-fused antigens expressed in antigen-presenting cells were effectively degraded via the UFD pathway, and subsequently activated CD8+ T cells.

     "abstract": "Scavenger receptor A (SR-A) plays a crucial role in affecting the dendritic cell-mediated presentation of cancer testis antigens to T cells against human cancer cells. Here we use a dendritic cell-mediated model to verify that a sulphated polysaccharide, fucoidin, can regulate the adverse regulatory function of SR-A, and lead to the up-regulation of the anti-tumor immunological response. SR-A is a receptor of calreticulin (CRT) existing on the surface of dendritic cells (DCs). CRT is a specific receptor for a NY-ESO-1 cancer testis antigen, and CRT itself is responsible for the cross-presentation of NY-ESO-1 to CD8+ cells and the induction of anti-tumor immunity. Flow cytometrical analysis (FACS) showed that fucoidin was able to significantly enhance the binding ratio of NY-ESO-1 to human DCs in a concentration dependent manner, and that the addition of fucoidin promoted the DC maturation upon stimulation of NY-ESO-1. Results from a cytotoxicity assay indicated that fucoidin-treated DCs stimulated the CD8+ T cells more effectively than non-treated DCs via a cross-presentation pathway. Furthermore, it was found that after stimulated by fucoidin-treated DCs, the CD8+ T cells can release more IFN-\u03b3 than non-fucoidin-treated cells as detected by intracellular IFN-\u03b3 staining. We conclude that fucoidin enhances the cross-presentation of NY-ESO-1 to T cells leading to an increase of T-cell cytotoxicity against NY-ESO-1 expressing human cancer cells.",

Since macrophages infiltrate the heart after infarction and because adenosine receptors behave differently across species, we evaluated the effect of adenosine on VEGF in human macrophages. Adenosine dose-dependently up-regulated VEGF expression and secretion by macrophages from healthy volunteers. VEGF production was also increased by blockade of extracellular adenosine uptake with dipyridamole. This effect was exacerbated by the toll-like receptor-4 ligands heparan sulfate, hyaluronic acid and lipopolysaccharide, and was associated with an increase of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 expression, the main transcriptional inducer of VEGF in hypoxic conditions. The agonist of the adenosine A2A receptor CGS21680 reproduced the increase of VEGF and the antagonist SCH58261 blunted it. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that activation of adenosine A2A receptor stimulates VEGF production in human macrophages.

Estrogen receptor (ER) \u03b1 appears to promote the proliferation of cancer tissues, while ER\u03b2 can protect against the mitogenic effect of estrogen in breast tissue. The expression status of ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 may greatly influence on the development, treatment, and prognosis of breast cancer.Previous studies have indicated that the deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1/KIAA1967) gene product has roles in regulating functions of nuclear receptors. The gene encoding DBC1 is a candidate for tumor suppressor identified by genetic search for breast cancer. Caspase-dependent processing of DBC1 promotes apoptosis, and depletion of the endogenous DBC1 negatively regulates p53-dependent apoptosis through its specific inhibition of SIRT1. In addition, DBC1 modulates ER\u03b1 expression and promotes breast cancer cell survival by binding to ER\u03b1.Here we report an ER\u03b2-specific repressive function of DBC1. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies show that ER\u03b2 and DBC1 interact in a ligand-independent manner similar to ER\u03b1. In vitro pull-down assays revealed a direct interaction between DBC1 amino-terminus and activation function-1/2 domain of ER\u03b2. Although DBC1 shows no influence on the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of ER\u03b1, the expression of DBC1 negatively regulates the ligand-dependent transcriptional activation function of ER\u03b2in vivo, and RNA interference-mediated depletion of DBC1 stimulates the transactivation function of ER\u03b2.

Accordingly, we investigated the direct functional effects of suppressing TRX1 levels on cellular senescence, a phenomenon intimately linked with tissue degeneration and aging. Here we find that suppression of TRX1 expression via shRNA rapidly induces premature senescence in young human skin fibroblasts through upregulation of the p53/p21Cip1/Waf1 and p16INK4a tumor suppressor pathways. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways by introduction of SV40 Large T Antigen prevents TRX1 suppression-induced premature senescence but not susceptibility to oxidative stressors.

Deleting the C-tail from CRLR disrupted AM-evoked cAMP production or receptor internalization, but did not affect [125I]AM binding. We found that CRLR residues 428\u2013439 are required for AM-evoked cAMP production, though deleting this region had little effect on receptor internalization. Moreover, pretreatment with pertussis toxin (100\u00a0ng/mL) led to significant increases in AM-induced cAMP production via wild-type CRLR/RAMP2 complexes. This effect was canceled by deleting CRLR residues 454\u2013457, suggesting Gi couples to this region. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that CRLR truncation mutants lacking residues in the Ser/Thr-rich region extending from Ser449 to Ser467 were unable to undergo AM-induced receptor internalization and, in contrast to the effect on wild-type CRLR, overexpression of GPCR kinases-2, -3 and -4 failed to promote internalization of CRLR mutants lacking residues 449\u2013467. Thus, the hCRLR C-tail is crucial for AM-evoked cAMP production and internalization of the CRLR/RAMP2, while the receptor internalization is dependent on the aforementioned GPCR kinases, but not Gs coupling.",

We constructed three expression vectors of OASL to produce isoform a (OASLa), isoform b (OASLb), and the C-terminal ubiquitin-like domain of isoform a (Ub). When Huh7 JFH-1 HCV replicon cells were separately transfected with these three vectors, colony formation of HCV-replicating cells was inhibited by 95%, 94%, and 65%, respectively. Both OASLa and OASLb were also inhibitory for cells as well as the virus because colony formation of OASL-producing cells was reduced to 41% and 8%, respectively. Stable Huh7 clones producing each of the three OASLs were established and assessed for their inhibition of HCV replication using luciferase reporter gene-containing JFH-1 replicon RNA. HCV replication was inhibited by 50\u201390% in several stable OASL clones. Association analysis in six Ub clones expressing different levels of Ub mRNA showed that the degree of inhibition of HCV replication was significantly associated with the amount of Ub present. In conclusion, OASL possesses two domains with HCV inhibitory activity. The N-terminal OAS-homology domain without OAS activity is inhibitory for cell growth as well as HCV replication, whereas C-terminal Ub is inhibitory only for HCV replication.

Here we showed that the Lyn-overexpressed myeloma cell lines had the higher proliferative rate with IL-6 and the enhanced activation of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and Akt. The IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 was not up-regulated in the Lyn-overexpressed cells, indicating that the Lyn-PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway is independent of these pathways. The PI 3-kinase was co-precipitated with Lyn in the Lyn-overexpressed cells of which proliferation with IL-6 was abrogated by the specific inhibitors for PI 3-kinase or Akt, suggesting that the activation of the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway associated with Lyn is indeed related to the concomitant augmentation of myeloma cell growth. Furthermore, the decreased expression of p53 and p21Cip1 proteins was observed in the Lyn-overexpressed cells, implicating a possible downstream target of Akt.

     "abstract": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is a rare and often undiagnosed disease, at least in the western countries. It is characterized by an inflammatory acute febrile vasculitis of medium sized arteries with a propensity to damage the coronary arteries. It normally occurs in the early childhood and the diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms. During the progression of the disease thrombocytosis is usually detected. This can exert a pathogenetic role in the cardiovascular complications occurring in KD. In the present work peripheral blood plasma and platelets from twelve na\u00efve patients with KD were analyzed in order to detect possible pathogenetic determinants or progression markers. Morphological, biochemical and flow cytometrical methods have been used. With respect to age-matched healthy donors, we found an increase of platelet activation markers, i.e. degranulation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization and leukocyte\u2013red cell\u2013platelet aggregates. Some significant alterations that could represent suitable diagnostic determinants have also been detected in patient plasma: (i) decreased antioxidant power, (ii) decreased levels of asymmetric dymethylarginine (ADMA), a naturally occurring chemical interfering with the production of nitric oxide, and (iii) increased levels of soluble P-Selectin and soluble annexin V. Since PS externalizing platelets are known to exert a pro-coagulant activity, our data suggest the hypothesis that increased risk of vascular complications in KD could depend on platelet stimulation and defective apoptosis probably related to nitrosative stress.",

On the other hand, expression of both LRRK2 mRNA and protein decreased markedly in spleen in an age-dependent manner. Analysis of purified spleen cells indicated that B lymphocytes were the major population expressing LRRK2, and that T lymphocytes showed no expression. Consistently, the B lymphocyte surface marker CD19 exhibited an age-dependent decrease of mRNA expression in spleen.

The cells were treated with or without DAPT and induced to osteoblastic lineage in the presence of vitamin D3.

According to the fold increase and colony-forming unit assay results, the cells cultured in DAPT exhibited lower proliferation rate than those cultured in control medium. Hey1, expressed in the nucleus of ASCs to act as a transcriptional repressor, was downregulated when Notch signaling was inhibited by DAPT.

We showed that TSPYL5 suppression with silencing RNA in A549 cells up-regulated cellular PTEN, followed by down-regulation of AKT activation. Therefore, blockage of TSPYL5 sensitized A549 cells to cytotoxic agents such as \u03b3-radiation.

The overexpression of TSPYL5 in H460 cells showed the opposite effects.

MITF positively regulates expression of more than 25 genes in pigment cells. Recently, it has been demonstrated that expression of several MITF downstream targets requires the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, which contains one of the two catalytic subunits, Brm or Brg1. Here we show that the expression of MITF itself critically requires active SWI/SNF. In several Brm/Brg1-expressing melanoma cell lines, knockdown of Brg1 severely compromised MITF expression with a concomitant dowregulation of MITF targets and decreased cell proliferation. Although Brm was able to substitute for Brg1 in maintaining MITF expression and melanoma cell proliferation, sequential knockdown of both Brm and Brg1 in 501mel cells abolished proliferation. In Brg1-null SK-MEL-5 melanoma cells, depletion of Brm alone was sufficient to abrogate MITF expression and cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of Brg1 or Brm to the promoter of MITF. Together these results demonstrate the essential role of SWI/SNF for expression of MITF and suggest that SWI/SNF may be a promissing target in melanoma therapy.",

The \u0394grx5 mutant requires cysteine on minimal media, and does not grow on non-fermentable carbon source such as glycerol. We found that the mutant is low in the activity of Fe\u2013S enzymes in mitochondria as well as in the cytoplasm. Screening of multi-copy suppressor of growth defects of the mutant identified isa1+ gene encoding a putative A-type Fe\u2013S scaffold, in addition to mas5+ and hsc1+ genes encoding putative chaperones for Fe\u2013S assembly process. Examination of other scaffold and chaperone genes revealed that isa2+, but not isu1+ and ssc1+, complemented the growth phenotype of \u0394grx5 mutant as isa1+ did, partly through restoration of Fe\u2013S enzyme activities. The mutant also showed a significant decrease in the amount of mitochondrial DNA. We demonstrated that Grx5 interacts in vivo with Isa1 and Isa2 proteins in mitochondria by observing bimolecular fluorescence complementation. These results indicate that Grx5 plays a central role in Fe\u2013S assembly process through interaction with A-type Fe\u2013S scaffold proteins Isa1 and Isa2, each of which is an essential protein in S. pombe, and supports mitochondrial genome integrity as well as Fe\u2013S assembly.",

The resulting divergent promoter region is bound by the chromatin insulator protein CTCF in association with histone H3 tri-methylated on lysine 4, irrespective of transcription of ANRIL and ARF. Methylation of the overlapping CpG island abolishes CTCF binding and the associated modification, which can be restored by 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment. shRNA knock down of CTCF expression dramatically reduces the induction of ANRIL and ARF, but also that of INK4A and INK4B expression by 5-Aza-dC.

In this study, we demonstrate the important process of validating potential reference genes using a non-model species. As there are almost no sequences known of the Pallid Atlantic Forest Rat (Delomys sublineatus), a rodent used as indicator species in conservation studies of the endangered Brazilian rainforest, suitable primer sets are more problematic to find than in model species.

The production of IL-1\u03b2 depended dramatically on the characteristics of the TiO2. Notably, smaller anatase and larger rutile particles provoked higher IL-1\u03b2 production. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 production depended on active cathepsin B and reactive oxygen species production independent of the characteristics of TiO2. Our results provide basic information for the creation of safe and effective novel forms of TiO2.",

Similar to the bone, type I collagen is the major organic component in dentine. However, little is known about minor fibrillar collagens, which seem to be co-expressed such as type I or II collagen. The present study examined the gene expression of type V and XI collagens, which play important roles in collagen fibril formation and skeletal morphogenesis, using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry. The transcripts of pro-\u03b11(XI), pro-\u03b12(XI), pro-\u03b11(V) and pro-\u03b12(V) chains were present, but not pro-\u03b13(V) and pro-\u03b11(II) chains, of which an overglycosylated variant is pro-\u03b13(XI) chain, in mouse incisor tooth, using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The pro-\u03b12(XI) protein, which is mainly expressed in cartilage, were observed in the odontoblast using a specific polyclonal antibody. Real-time RT-PCR showed that the transcripts of pro-\u03b12(XI), pro-\u03b11(V) and pro-\u03b12(V) were predominant in crown and that of pro-\u03b11(XI) in root of the tooth. Finally, the expression of pro-\u03b12(XI) was confirmed with an odontoblastic cell line transformed with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) both in vitro and in vivo.

The effect of HpHSP60 on cell proliferation, anti-death activity, angiogenesis and cell migration were explored. The results showed that HpHSP60 enhanced migration by gastric cancer cells and promoted tube formation by umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs); however, HpHSP60 did not increase cell proliferation nor was this protein able to rescue gastric cancer cells from death. Moreover, the results also indicated HpHSP60 had different effects on AGS gastric cancer cells or THP-1 monocytic cells in terms of their expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which are known to be important to cancer development. We propose that HpHSP60 may trigger the initiation of carcinogenesis by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release and by promoting angiogenesis and metastasis. Thus, this extracellular pathogen-derived HSP60 is potentially a vigorous virulence factor that can act as a carcinogen during gastric tumorigenesis.",

To better understand the signaling capacity of the ER, we focused on roles played by mitsugumin23 (MG23), a protein residing predominantly in this organelle. Overexpression of MG23 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells specifically enhanced apoptosis triggered by etoposide, a DNA-damaging anti-cancer drug. Conversely, genetic deletion of MG23 reduced susceptibility of thymocytes to DNA damage-induced apoptosis, which was demonstrated by whole-body irradiation experiments. In this setting, induction of the tumor-suppressor gene p53 was attenuated in MG23-knockout thymocytes as compared with their wild-type counterparts, consistent with the elevated radioresistance. It is therefore suggested that MG23 is an essential component of ER-generated lethal signals provoked upon DNA damage, specifying cell fate under pathophysiological conditions.",

Using the B16 melanoma tumor model, we investigated the function of Foxc2 in tumor angiogenesis. After subcutaneous injection of B16 melanoma cells, primary tumor growth as well as neovascularization was markedly reduced in mice lacking one copy of the Foxc2 gene (Foxc2+/\u2212).

Proteins released from endosomes into the cytoplasm are degraded by the proteasome, and fragmented antigenic peptides are presented to the classical cytosolic MHC class I pathway.

Although this agent diverts some of the endocytosed antigens away from the classical MHC class II-restricted presentation pathway to the class I pathway, the activation of CD4+ T cells was found not to be hampered by Endo-Porter-mediated antigen delivery. On the contrary, it was rather augmented, probably due to the increased uptake of antigen.

Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that ERp46 was present in the ER and the plasma membrane (PM). Transient knockdown of ERp46 increased the levels of AdipoR1, and AdipoR2, at the PM and this correlated with increased adiponectin-stimulated phosphorylation of AMPK. In contrast, adiponectin-stimulated phosphorylation of p38MAPK was reduced following ERp46 knockdown.

We thus hypothesized that obesity observed in ovariectomized mice, a model of menopause, may result in part from abrogated expression of muscle PPAR\u03b4 and/or downstream mediators such as FoxO1. To test this hypothesis, we ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-ovariectomized (SHM) 10-week old female C57Bl/6J mice, and subsequently harvested quadriceps muscles 12\u00a0weeks later for gene expression studies.

In addition, muscles from OVX mice expressed 57% less myogenin (drives type I fiber formation), 2-fold more MyoD (drives type II fiber formation), and 1.6-fold less musclin (produced exclusively by type II fibers) than SHM, collectively suggesting a shift towards less type I oxidative fibers.

We observed a novel mechanism of cartilage regulation by which muscle cells diminish the response of chondrocytes to IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1. We found that chondrocytes cocultured with muscle cells or cultured in muscle cell-conditioned medium significantly enhanced the expression of cartilage matrix proteins (collagen II and collagen IX) and resisted IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1-induced cartilage damage. Our data suggest that this effect is achieved by inhibiting the expression of key components of the signaling pathways of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including NF\u03baB, ESE-1, Cox-2, and GADD45\u03b2), leading to attenuated expression of cartilage-degrading enzymes (MMPs and ADAMTS4). Therefore, our work unveils a potential role of muscle in regulating cartilage homeostasis and response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, and provides insights on designing treatment strategies for joint degenerative diseases such as arthritis.",

Northern blot analysis revealed that CCDC3 was expressed abundantly in the aorta and adipose tissues. The mRNA levels of CCDC3 were higher in adipose tissues of obese db/db mice than control mice, and induced during differentiation of rat primary adipocytes. In differentiated adipocytes, CCDC3 mRNA expression was enhanced by insulin and pioglitazone, a PPARgamma agonist, and suppressed by TNF-alpha, isoproterenol and norepinephrine. Transient expression experiments followed by N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed secretion of CCDC3 protein into the culture medium, which was dose-dependently reduced by brefeldin A, an inhibitor of Golgi-mediated secretory pathway. When expressed in COS-7 cells, CCDC3 protein was post-transcriptionally modified with N-glycosylation, and formed a dimer complex. These results indicate that CCDC3 is a protein secreted by adipocytes and endothelial cells, and that its level is regulated both hormonally and nutritionally.",

However the factors responsible for this prothrombotic state, linked with high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), are not fully known. Leptin is elevated in obesity and studies have shown a positive correlation between leptin and PAI-1 levels in human subjects, along with a negative correlation with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). We tested the hypothesis that leptin induces PAI-1 and inhibits tPA expression using human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) in culture as these cells play an important role in atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that leptin induces the transcription and translation of PAI-1 in HCAEC. The leptin dependent upregulation of PAI-1 mRNA and protein was comparable to insulin-induced PAI-1 expression. We show leptin concentration (0\u2013150\u00a0ng/ml) dependent increases in PAI-1 mRNA and protein after 6 and 12\u00a0h of leptin administration, respectively. Increased intracellular PAI-1 expression correlates with increased PAI-1 activity in conditioned media and inhibition of specific ERK1/2 pathway by treatment with PD98059 (20\u201340\u00a0\u03bcM) inhibits leptin dependent PAI-1 expression. However no changes in tPA expression were seen with time or increasing concentrations of leptin. Also leptin treatment did not alter total tPA concentration or tPA activity in conditioned media. In conclusion, our study shows that leptin upregulates the expression of PAI-1 in vascular endothelial cells via activation of ERK1/2 but does not regulate tPA expression.

Only one report showed GOAT mRNA expression in ghrelin-expressing cells of the mouse stomach. We investigated the distribution of GOAT protein in peripheral tissues and co-expression with endocrine markers in the gastric mucosa using a custom-made anti-GOAT antibody. Tissues were collected from male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats and C57BL/6 mice. Western blot revealed two immunoreactive bands in rat and mouse gastric corpus mucosal proteins, a 50\u00a0kDa band corresponding to the GOAT protein and a 100\u00a0kDa band likely corresponding to a dimer. Western blot also detected GOAT in the plasma and levels were strongly increased after 24-h fasting in mice and slightly in rats. GOAT-immunoreactive cells were located in the gastric corpus mucosa and the anterior pituitary gland, whereas other peripheral tissues of rats and mice examined were negative. In mice, GOAT-immunoreactive cells were mainly distributed throughout the middle portion of the oxyntic glands, whereas in rats they were localized mainly in the lower portion of the glands. Double labeling showed that 95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% of GOAT-immunoreactive cells in mice co-labeled with ghrelin, whereas in rats only 56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% of GOAT-positive cells showed co-expression of ghrelin. The remainder of the GOAT-immunopositive cells in rats co-expressed histidine decarboxylase (44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03%). No co-localization was observed with somatostatin in rats or mice. These data suggest species differences between rats and mice in gastric GOAT expression perhaps resulting in a different role of the MBOAT4 enzyme in the rat stomach. Detection of GOAT in the plasma raises the possibility that ghrelin octanoylation may occur in the circulation and the fasting-induced increase in GOAT may contribute to the increase of acylated ghrelin after fasting.",

In order to better understand the role of TIEG in bone, we generated TIEG knockout (KO) mice. Calvarial osteoblasts (OBs) isolated from these mice exhibit a reduced ability to support osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Gene expression studies revealed decreased receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and increased osteoprotegerin (OPG) expression in TIEG KO OBs, suggesting a potential role for TIEG in regulating the expression of these genes. Since OPG and RANKL are two important regulators of osteoclast (OC) differentiation, we sought to determine if TIEG directly regulates their expression. Luciferase constructs, containing fragments of either the mouse OPG promoter (\u22121486 to +133\u00a0bp) or the RANKL promoter (\u22122000 to +1\u00a0bp) were each cloned into the pGL3 basic reporter vector and transiently transfected into TIEG KO calvarial OBs with and without a TIEG expression vector. No significant changes in the activity of the RANKL promoter were detected in the presence of TIEG. However, OPG promoter activity was inhibited in the presence of TIEG protein suggesting that TIEG directly represses the expression of OPG in OBs. In order to determine the region of this promoter through which TIEG acts, sequential 5\u2032-deletion constructs were generated. Transient transfection of these constructs revealed that the TIEG regulatory element(s) reside within a 200\u00a0bp region of the OPG promoter. Transient ChIP analyses, using a TIEG-specific antibody, revealed that TIEG binds to this region of the OPG promoter. Since we have previously shown that TIEG regulates target gene expression through Sp-1 sites, we examined this region of the OPG promoter for potential TIEG binding elements and identified four potential Sp-1 binding sites. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to determine if TIEG utilizes these Sp-1 elements to regulate the activity of the OPG promoter. The data demonstrate that two Sp-1 sites are likely to be involved in TIEG\u2019s repression of the OPG promoter. Taken together, these results confirm that TIEG directly binds to and inhibits OPG promoter activity in OBs, partially explaining the inability of TIEG KO OBs to fully support osteoclast differentiation.",

In contrast to the well-studied acidic activation domains, little is known about the activation domains of activators of TFIID-dependent genes, even though these genes constitute more than 80% of eukaryotic protein-coding genes. The paradigm for TATA-less genes are the ribosomal protein genes (RPGs).

     "abstract": "Atrial- and brain-type natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP, respectively) have been shown to exert potent lipolytic action in adipocytes. A family of natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs), NPR-1, NPR-2, and NPR-3, mediates their physiologic effects. NPR-1 and NPR-2 are receptor guanylyl cyclases, while NPR-3 lacks enzymatic activity and functions primarily as a clearance receptor for natriuretic peptides. ANP has a high affinity for NPR-1 and NPR-3 than other natriuretic peptides. There is a possibility that ANP may exhibit its lipolytic effect through the balance of NPR-1 and NPR-3 expressions in adipocytes. However, the regulation of adipose NPRs has not been fully elucidated. We here examined the regulation of mouse adipose NPRs by insulin, an anti-lipolytic hormone. Among the insulin target organs, NPR-1 mRNA levels were higher in white adipose tissue (WAT) than in liver and skeletal muscle. NPR-3 mRNA was expressed most abundantly in WAT. Fasting condition induced NPR-1 mRNA level while suppressed NPR-3 mRNA level in WAT. Administration of streptozotocin resulted in the increase of NPR-1 mRNA level while the decrease of NPR-3 mRNA level in WAT. In ob/ob mice, hyperinsulinemic model, NPR-1 mRNA level was lower whereas NPR-3 mRNA level was higher compared to lean control mice. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin significantly reduced NPR-1 mRNA level while increased NPR-3 mRNA levels both through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway. In summary, NPR-1 and NPR-3 were highly expressed in WAT and adipose NPR-1 and NPR-3 were reciprocally regulated by insulin. This study suggests that insulin may efficiently promote lipogenesis partly by reducing the lipolytic action of ANP through the opposite regulation of NPR-1 and NPR-3.",

Detailed structural analysis shows that a difference in the conformation of the connecting loop (\u03b215\u2013\u03b216) causes the formation of a water molecule-mediated hydrogen bond network between the connecting loop and the catalytic loop in EcSSADH, making the catalytic loop of EcSSADH more rigid compared to that of human SSADH.

     "abstract": "During a search for glucose-regulated abundant mRNAs in the diabetic rat kidney, we cloned thyroid hormone binding protein (THBP), also known as \u03bc-crystallin or CRYM. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hyperglycemia/high glucose on the expression of THBP. THBP mRNA copy numbers were determined in kidneys and hearts of diabetic GK rats vs normoglycemic Wistar rats, and in human mesangial cells (HMCs) exposed to high glucose using real-time qPCR, and THBP protein levels were measured by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Intracellular ROS was measured in THBP transfected cells using DCF fluorescence. Hyperglycemia significantly increased THBP mRNA in GK rat kidneys (326\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050 vs 147\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and hearts (1583\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0277 vs 191\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the levels of THBP mRNA increased with age and hyperglycemia in GK rat kidneys, whereas in normoglycemic Wistar rat kidneys there was a decline with age. High glucose significantly increased THBP mRNA (92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037 vs 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04, p\u00a0<\u00a00.005), and protein in HMCs. The expression of THBP as a fusion protein in transfected HMCs resulted in reduction of glucose-induced intracellular ROS. We have shown that THBP mRNA is increased in diabetic kidney and heart, is regulated by high glucose in renal cells, and appears to attenuate glucose-induced intracellular ROS. These data suggest that THBP may be involved in the cellular pathways activated in response to glucose. This is the first report linking hyperglycemia with THBP and suggests that the role of THBP in diabetic complications should be further investigated.",

Simvastatin induced cardinal features of apoptosis including increased DNA fragmentation, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and increased caspase-3 activity by depleting isoprenoids in MethA fibrosarcoma cells. Interestingly, the simvastatin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by p53 stabilization involving Mdm2 degradation. The apoptosis was ameliorated in p53 knockdown clones of MethA cells as well as p53\u2212/\u2212 HCT116 cells. The stabilized p53 protein translocated to mitochondria with Bax, and cytochrome c was released into cytosol. Moreover, knockdown or deficiency of p53 expression reduced both Bax translocation to mitochondria and MMP disruption in simvastatin-induced apoptosis.

     "abstract": "The actin homolog ParM plays a microtubule-like role in segregating DNA prior to bacterial cell division. Fluorescence and cryo-electron microscopy have shown that ParM forms filament bundles between separating DNA plasmids in vivo. Given the lack of ParM bundling proteins it remains unknown how ParM bundles form at the molecular level. Here we show using time-lapse TIRF microscopy, under in vitro molecular crowding conditions, that ParM-bundle formation consists of two distinct phases. At the onset of polymerization bundle thickness and shape are determined in the form of nuclei of short helically disordered filaments arranged in a liquid-like lattice. These nuclei then undergo an elongation phase whereby they rapidly increase in length. At steady state, ParM bundles fuse into one single large aggregate. This behavior had been predicted by theory but has not been observed for any other cytomotive biopolymer, including F-actin. We employed electron micrographs of ParM rafts, which are 2-D analogs of 3-D bundles, to identify the main molecular interfilament contacts within these suprastructures. The interface between filaments is similar for both parallel and anti-parallel orientations and the distribution of filament polarity is random within a bundle. We suggest that the interfilament interactions are not due to the interactions of specific residues but rather to long-range, counter ion mediated, electrostatic attractive forces. A randomly oriented bundle ensures that the assembly is rigid and that DNA may be captured with equal efficiency at both ends of the bundle via the ParR binding protein.",

However, regulatory mechanisms for ETAR levels are unknown. Here, we identified Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) as an ETAR-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid screening of human heart cDNA library using carboxyl terminal tail (C-tail) of ETAR as a bait. The interaction was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, co-immunoprecipitation in HEK293T cells expressing ETAR-myc and FLAG-Jab1, and confocal microscopy. Jab1 knockdown increased whole cell and cell surface levels of ETAR and ET-1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293T cells expressing ETAR, whereas Jab1 overexpression decreased them. Jab1 overexpression accelerated disappearance rate of ETAR after protein synthesis inhibition as an index of a degradation rate. ETAR was constitutively ubiquitinated, and the level of ubiquitination was enhanced by Jab1 overexpression. Long-term ET-1 stimulation markedly accelerated the rate of ETAR degradation and increased the amount of Jab1 bound to ETAR with a maximal level of 500% at 3\u00a0h. In the absence of ET-1 stimulation, the level of ETBR was lower than that of ETAR and the degradation rate of ETBR was markedly faster than that of ETAR. Notably, the amount of Jab1 bound to ETBR and ubiquitination level of ETBR were markedly higher than those for ETAR. Taken together, these results suggest that the amount of Jab1 bound to ETR regulates the degradation rate of ETAR and ETBR by modulating ubiquitination of these receptors, leading to changes in ETAR and ETBR levels.",

     "abstract": "Background: DMSO is routinely infused together with hematopoietic cells in patients undergoing myeloablative therapy and was recently found to inhibit smooth muscle cells proliferation and arterial thrombus formation in the mouse by preventing tissue factor (TF), a key activator of the coagulation cascade. This study was designed to investigate whether DMSO prevents platelet activation and thus, whether it may represent an interesting agent to be used on drug eluting stents. Methods and results: Human venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected in citrated tubes and platelet activation was studied by cone and platelet analyzer (CPA) and rapid-platelet-function-assay (RPFA). CPA analysis showed that DMSO-treated platelets exhibit a lower adherence in response to shear stress (\u221215.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9427%, n\u00a0=\u00a05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 versus control). Additionally, aggregometry studies revealed that DMSO-treated, arachidonate-stimulated platelets had an increased lag phase (18.0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.031, n\u00a0=\u00a09, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004 versus control) as well as a decreased maximal aggregation (\u22126.388\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.212%, n\u00a0=\u00a06, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0162 versus control). Inhibitory action of DMSO could be rescued by exogenous thromboxane A2 and was mediated, at least in part, by COX-1 inhibition. Conclusions: Clinically relevant concentrations of DMSO impair platelet activation by a thromboxane A2-dependent, COX-1-mediated effect. This finding may be crucial for the previously reported anti-thrombotic property displayed by DMSO. Our findings support a role for DMSO as a novel drug to prevent not only proliferation, but also thrombotic complications of drug eluting stents.",

Administration of CM from JKT-HM significantly promoted lymph node metastasis.

Here, we explored the hypothesis that cell surface expression and function of S1P1 are influenced by direct interactions with P-Rex1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac. We demonstrate that P-Rex1-PDZ domains interact with S1P1-carboxyl terminal tail and full length receptor monomers and dimers. Endothelial cells transfected with P-Rex1-PDZ domains show an increased migratory response to S1P. S1P1 trafficking to intracellular compartments is diminished by coexpression of P-Rex1.

A new biological feature, distribution of atomic composition is effectively used with, multiple physiochemical properties, amino acid composition, three part amino acid composition, and sequence similarity for predicting the subcellular location of the protein. Support Vector Machines are designed for four modules and prediction is made by a weighted voting system. Our system makes prediction with an accuracy of 100, 82.47, 88.81 for self-consistency test, jackknife test and independent data test respectively. Our results provide evidence that the prediction based on the biological features derived from the full length amino acid sequence gives better accuracy than those derived from N-terminal alone. Considering the features as a distribution within the entire sequence will bring out underlying property distribution to a greater detail to enhance the prediction accuracy.",

Class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) is one of the principal functional molecules of macrophages, and its level of expression declines during osteoclast differentiation. To investigate the role of SR-A in osteoclastogenesis, we examined pathological changes in femoral bone and the expression levels of osteoclastogenesis-related molecules in SR-A\u2212/\u2212 mice. The femoral osseous density of SR-A\u2212/\u2212 mice was higher than that of SR-A+/+ mice, and the number of multinucleated osteoclasts was significantly decreased. An in vitro differentiation assay revealed that the differentiation of multinucleated osteoclasts from bone marrow-derived progenitor cells is impaired in SR-A\u2212/\u2212 mice. Elimination of SR-A did not alter the expression level of the M-CSF receptor, c-fms; however, the expression levels of RANK and RANK-related osteoclast-differentiation molecules such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1) and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) significantly decreased. Furthermore, acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL), an SR-A ligand, significantly increased the expression level of RANK and MITF during osteoclast differentiation. These data indicate that SR-A promotes osteoclastogenesis via augmentation of the expression level of RANK and its related molecules.",

To investigate the effect of mutations near the \u03c9 site of PrP on the conversion and the GPI anchoring, and to discover the \u03c9 site of murine PrP, we systematically created mutant murine PrP with all possible single amino acid substitutions at every amino acid residue from codon 228 to 240. We transfected them into scrapie-infected mouse neuroblastoma cells and examined the conversion efficiencies and the GPI anchoring of each mutant PrP. Mutations near the \u03c9 site altered the conversion efficiencies and the GPI anchoring efficiencies. Especially, amino acid restrictions for the conversion and the GPI anchoring were severe at codons 230 and 232 in murine PrP, though they were less severe than in other GPI-anchored proteins. Only the mutant PrPs presented on a cell surface via a GPI anchor were conversion competent. The present study shows that mutations in the GPI-SS can affect the GPI anchoring and the conversion efficiency of PrP. We clarified for the first time the \u03c9 site of murine PrP and the amino acid conditions near the \u03c9 site for the conversion as well as GPI anchoring.",

Mechanical forces derived from blood flow are associated with the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This contributes to many vascular disorders such as hypertension, atherosclerosis and restenosis after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). In this study, we show that static pressure induces the proliferation of VSMC and activates its related signal pathway. VSMC from a rat aorta were treated with different pressures (0, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180\u00a0mm Hg) in a custom-made pressure incubator for 24\u00a0h. The most active proliferation of VSMC was detected at a pressure of 120\u00a0mm Hg. VSMC was also incubated under a static pressure of 120\u00a0mm Hg for different time intervals (0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24\u00a0h). We found that static pressure significantly stimulates VSMC proliferation. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation showed a peak at the pressure of 120\u00a0mm Hg at 4-h time point. Moreover, caveolin-1 expression was significantly inhibited by rising static pressure. Downregulation of VSMC proliferation could be found after PD98059 (ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor) treatment. Our data also showed that a siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knock down increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and VSMC proliferation. These results demonstrate that static pressure promotes VSMC proliferation via the Caveolin-1/ERK1/2 pathway.",

Type 2 diabetes is an age-related metabolic disorder with high prevalence in elderly (or old) people. Up to now, there are no treatments to cure diabetes. Therefore, early detection and the ability to monitor the progression of type 2 diabetes are very important for developing effective therapies. Type 2 diabetes is associated with high blood glucose in the context of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. These abnormalities may disturb the architecture and functions of erythrocytes at molecular scale. In this study, the aging- and diabetes-induced changes in morphological and biomechanical properties of erythrocytes are clearly characterized at nanometer scale using atomic force microscope (AFM). The structural information and mechanical properties of the cell surface membranes of erythrocytes are very important indicators for determining the healthy, diseased or aging status.

Here, we introduced systematic amino acid substitutions at this position and found that all 19 kinds of amino acid substitutions were tolerated, but the mutations significantly reduced the enzymatic activity and the binding affinity toward the cofactor NADPH. Moreover, the mutational effects on the cofactor binding affinity were well correlated with those on the catalytic activity, indicating that the R44X mutations affect the catalytic activity mainly by modulating the cofactor binding affinity. On the other hand, thermal denaturation measurements showed that most mutations stabilized the protein. Comparison between the mutational effects and various amino acid indices taken from the AAindex database indicated that hydrophobicity and polarity are key determinants of amino acids favorable at this position.

     "abstract": "Insulin secretion and glucose transport are the major mechanisms to balance glucose homeostasis. Recently, we found that the death effector domain-containing DEDD inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1) function, thereby preventing Cdk1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which overall results in maintenance of S6K1 activity. Here we newly show that DEDD forms a complex with Akt and heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), and supports the stability of both proteins. Hence, in DEDD\u2212/\u2212 mice, Akt protein levels are diminished in skeletal muscles and adipose tissues, which interferes with the translocation of glucose-transporter 4 (GLUT4) upon insulin stimulation, leading to inefficient incorporation of glucose in these organs. Interestingly, as for the activation of S6K1, suppression of Cdk1 is involved in the stabilization of Akt protein by DEDD, since diminishment of Cdk1 in DEDD\u2212/\u2212 cells via siRNA expression or treatment with a Cdk1-inhibitor, increases both Akt and Hsp90 protein levels. Such multifaceted involvement of DEDD in glucose homeostasis by supporting both insulin secretion (via maintenance of S6K1 activity) and glucose uptake (via stabilizing Akt protein), may suggest an association of DEDD-deficiency with the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

Calcium (Ca2+) mobilization is a sine qua non requisite for degranulation, allowing the rapid secretion of stored pro-inflammatory mediators responsible for allergy symptoms. Fyn is a Src-family kinase that positively controls Fc\u03b5RI-induced mast cell degranulation. However, our understanding of the mechanism connecting Fyn activation to secretion of pre-synthesized mediators is very limited. We analyzed Fc\u03b5RI-dependent Ca2+ mobilization in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) differentiated from WT and Fyn \u2212/\u2212 knock out mice. Fyn \u2212/\u2212 BMMCs showed a marked defect in extracellular Ca2+ influx after Fc\u03b5RI crosslinking but not after thapsigargin addition. High concentrations of Gadolinium (Gd3+) partially blocked Fc\u03b5RI-induced Ca2+ influx in WT cells but, in contrast, completely inhibited Ca2+ mobilization in Fyn \u2212/\u2212 cells. Low concentrations of an inhibitor of the canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) Ca2+ channels (2-aminoethoxyphenyl-borane, 2-APB) blocked Fc\u03b5RI-induced maximal Ca2+ rise in WT but not in Fyn \u2212/\u2212 cells. Ca2+ entry through Fyn-controlled, 2-APB sensitive channels was found to be important for full degranulation and IL-2 mRNA accumulation in WT cells. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that Fyn kinase interacts with TRPC 3/6/7 channels after IgE\u2013antigen stimulation, but its association is not related to protein tyrosine phosphorylation.

TRPV1 and TRPV4, two calcium-permeable channels of the vanilloid subfamily of TRP proteins, are activated by various physical and chemical stimuli, including noxious heat and mechanical stress, respectively. These channels are also required for exaggerated sensation of painful stimuli, condition referred to as hyperalgesia, which is frequently associated with inflammation. Phosphorylation of TRPV1, involving Protein Kinase C (PKC) and Protein Kinase A (PKA), appears to be the predominant mechanism for channel sensitization and development of heat hyperalgesia. PKC and PKA pathways have also been implicated in the sensitization of TRPV4, but the respective phosphorylation sites remain unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we report now that TRPV4 is phosphorylated on serine 824 by the PKC-activating phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This phosphorylation is prevented by a PKC inhibitor, confirming the involvement of PKC. Ser824, located in the carboxy-terminal cytosolic tail of TRPV4, is also phosphorylated after activation of the PKA pathway by forskolin, albeit less potently. Substitution of Ser824 with aspartic acid, mimicking phosphorylation at this site, increased TRPV4-mediated calcium influx in resting and in stimulated cells, underlining the importance of this residue in TRPV4 regulation. Thus PKC, and possibly PKA, phosphorylate TRPV4 at Ser824 leading to the enhancement of TRPV4 channel function. Our findings suggest an important role of this phosphorylation in TRPV4 sensitization and the development of hyperalgesia.",

Angiopoietin like proteins (ANGPTL) 3 and 4 inhibit LPL activity. In the present study, treatment of mice with LPS, an activator of TLR4 and a model of Gram-negative infections, did not alter the expression of GPIHBP1 in heart or adipose tissue. However, LPS decreased the expression of ANGPTL3 in liver and increased the expression of ANGPTL4 in heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Serum ANGPTL4 protein levels were markedly increased at 8 and 16\u00a0h following LPS treatment. Administration of zymosan, an activator of TLR2 and a model of fungal infections, also increased serum ANGPTL4 protein and mRNA levels in liver, heart, muscle, and adipose tissue. Finally, treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with LPS or cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-1 beta, and interferon gamma) stimulated ANGPTL4 expression. These studies demonstrate that ANGPTL4 is a positive acute phase protein and the increase in ANGPTL4 could contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia that characteristically occurs during the acute phase response by inhibiting LPL activity.",

We showed that treatment of cancer cells with chemo-therapeutic drugs or the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) results in induction of TAp63 expression, which is in turn related with chemosensitivity. Indeed, induction of TAp63 by TSA affects sensitivity to chemo-therapeutic drugs via the cleavage of the trans-inhibitory domain of TAp63 by active caspases, resulting in generation of a transcriptionally hyper-active TAp63 fragment. Therefore therapeutic approaches that enhance TAp63 expression may offer an improvement in the management of chemoresistant tumours. In this study we tested the abilities of different HDAC inhibitors to induce TAp63 expression. We discovered that two HDAC inhibitors belonging to the hydroxamate group, namely TSA and LBH589, are the most efficient inducers of TAp63 expression.

Although patients with OSCC have poor survival rates and a high incidence of metastasis, the molecular mechanisms of OSCC development have not yet been elucidated. This study investigated whether N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) contributes to the carcinogenesis of OSCC, as NDRG2 is reported to be a candidate tumor-suppressor gene in a wide variety of cancers. The down-regulation of NDRG2 mRNA, which was dependent on promoter methylation, was seen in the majority of OSCC cases and in several cases of precancerous leukoplakia with dysplasia. Induction of NDRG2 expression in an HSC-3/OSCC cell line significantly inhibited cell proliferation and decreased colony formation ability on soft agar. The majority of OSCC cell lines showed an activation of PI3K/Akt signaling, and enforced expression of NDRG2 in HSC-3 cells decreased the level of phosphorylated Akt at Serine 473 (p-Akt). Immunohistochemical p-Akt staining was detected in 56.5% of the OSCC tumors, and 80.4% of the tumors were negative for NDRG2 staining. Moreover, positive p-Akt staining was inversely correlated with decreased NDRG2 expression in OSCC tumors with moderate to poor differentiation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Therefore, NDRG2 is a candidate tumor-suppressor gene for OSCC development and probably contributes to the tumorigenesis of OSCC partly via the modulation of Akt signaling.",

Here we report that a local intrinsic curvature induced by the two phased AT tracts within the unusual promoter sequence of BNT2 played a major role for its temperature-dependent promoter activity. The base substitution of the AT tract in the spacer DNA between the \u221235 and the unusual \u221210 regions of the BNT2 promoter with non-AT tract sequence reduced intrinsic curvature slightly at 4\u00a0\u00b0C, but greatly affected its transcriptional activity.

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic protein secretion generally occurs via the classical secretory pathway that traverses the ER and Golgi apparatus. Secreted proteins usually contain a signal sequence with all the essential information required to target them for secretion. However, some proteins like fibroblast growth factors (FGF-1, FGF-2), interleukins (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta), galectins and thioredoxin are exported by an alternative pathway. This is known as leaderless or non-classical secretion and works without a signal sequence. Most computational methods for the identification of secretory proteins use the signal peptide as indicator and are therefore not able to identify substrates of non-classical secretion. In this work, we report a random forest method, SPRED, to identify secretory proteins from protein sequences irrespective of N-terminal signal peptides, thus allowing also correct classification of non-classical secretory proteins. Training was performed on a dataset containing 600 extracellular proteins and 600 cytoplasmic and/or nuclear proteins. The algorithm was tested on 180 extracellular proteins and 1380 cytoplasmic and/or nuclear proteins. We obtained 85.92% accuracy from training and 82.18% accuracy from testing. Since SPRED does not use N-terminal signals, it can detect non-classical secreted proteins by filtering those secreted proteins with an N-terminal signal by using SignalP. SPRED predicted 15 out of 19 experimentally verified non-classical secretory proteins. By scanning the entire human proteome we identified 566 protein sequences potentially undergoing non-classical secretion. The dataset and standalone version of the SPRED software is available at http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/tools-demos/spred/spred.",

However, more precise evidence of the molecular shape and function of this protein was required to asses this theory any further. In this study, an atomic force microscope (AFM) was used both as an imaging and a force measurement device to provide new information about Gli349 and its role in gliding motility. AFM images of the protein were obtained revealing a complex structure with both rigid and flexible parts, consistent with previous electron micrographs of the protein. Single-molecular force spectroscopy experiments were also performed, revealing that Gli349 is able to specifically bind to sialyllactose molecules and withstand unbinding forces around 70\u00a0pN. These findings strongly support the idea that Gli349 is the \u201cleg\u201d protein of M. mobile, responsible for binding and also most probably force generation during gliding motility.",

     "abstract": "The effects of cAMP in cell are predominantly mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is composed of two genetically distinct subunits, catalytic (C) and regulatory (R), forming a tetrameric holoenzyme R2C2. The only known function for the R subunit is that of inhibiting the activity of the C subunit kinase. It has been shown that overexpression of RI\u03b1, but not the C subunit kinase, is associated with neoplastic transformation. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that mutation in the RI\u03b1, but not the C subunit is associated with increased resistance to the DNA-damaging anticancer drug cisplatin, thus suggesting that the RI\u03b1 subunit of PKA may have functions independent of the kinase. We show here that the RI\u03b1 subunit interacts with a BTB/POZ domain zinc-finger transcription factor, PATZ1 (ZNF278), and co-expression with RI\u03b1 results in its sequestration in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic/nuclear translocation is inducible by cAMP. C-terminus deletion abolishes PATZ1 interaction with RI\u03b1 and results in its localization in the nucleus. PATZ1 transactivates the cMyc promoter and the presence of cAMP and co-expression with RI\u03b1 modulates its transactivation. Moreover, PATZ1 is aberrantly expressed in cancer. Taken together, our results showed a potentially novel mechanism of cAMP signaling mediated through the interaction of RI\u03b1 with PATZ1 that is independent of the kinase activity of PKA, and the aberrant expression of PATZ1 in cancer point to its role in cell growth regulation.",

We have recently shown that \u03b21Pix binds specifically to ET-Rs. Here, we show that \u03b21Pix binding to caveolin-1 is dependent on heterotrimeric G proteins activation state. \u03b21Pix interaction with different G proteins is increased in the presence of the G protein activator AMF. Moreover, extraction of cholesterol with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin disrupts the binding of \u03b21Pix to G\u03b1q, G\u03b112 and phospho-Erk1/2 but not the binding of \u03b21Pix to G\u03b21.

RNAi has been observed in a wide range of eukaryotes, including fungi, plants and animals. In vertebrates, long dsRNA activates the interferon response and yields nonspecific degradation of mRNA. In contrast, small interference RNA (siRNA) duplexes with a length of 21\u201323 nucleotides trigger specific gene silencing and thus are widely used in gene function studies. The use of siRNA for gene silencing in zebrafish has rarely been reported. In this report, we studied mammalian U6 promoter-driven siRNA-mediated RNA interference in zebrafish. The well characterized genes Myf5, Dlg3 and Nacre were selected as targets. Two to four target siRNAs were synthesized with incorporation of the U6 promoter. Constructs were introduced into early zebrafish embryos through microinjection, followed by in situ hybridization and embryonic development was monitored to determine whether U6 promoter-driven siRNAs could efficiently suppress specific gene expression. We showed that these siRNAs could partially suppress endogenous gene expression and that the siRNA efficiency varied at different targeted positions. However, the U6 promoter-driven siRNAs may also have induced nonspecific gene suppression (off-target effects). It appears that, despite the findings of previous reports, the current methodology of siRNA interference is not practical for studying gene function during early zebrafish development.",

Indeed, recombinant prodecorin has been used in several gene therapy experiments to inhibit unwanted fibrosis in model diseases of the kidney, heart, and other tissues although the status of the propeptide within the target tissues is unknown. Currently the protease that removes the highly conserved propeptide from decorin is unproven. Using a variety of approaches, we show that three isoforms of the Tolloid-related bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) can effectively remove the propeptide from human prodecorin resulting in the well-established mature proteoglycan. Classic BMP1, the full-length gene transcript mTLD (BMP1\u20133), and BMP1\u20135 (isoform lacking the CUB3 domain thought to be important for efficient type I collagen C-propeptidase activity) all removed the analogous propeptides from both recombinant human prodecorin and murine probiglycan. Furthermore, the timed removal of the propeptide was found to not be necessary for the addition of decorin\u2019s single glycosaminoglycan chain. Decorin therefore joins the growing list of matrix and bioactive molecules processed/activated by the BMP1/Tolloid family. Since the third member of the Class I small leucine-rich proteooglycan (SLRP) superfamily, asporin, also contains a similar cleavage motif at the appropriate location, we propose that the removal of these propeptides by members of the BMP1 family is an additional characteristic of Class I SLRP.",

The study shows (1) in contrast to uroguanylin, CO2 transduction mechanism is Ca2+-independent.

In the presented study, we used stable human colorectal cancer cell lines ectopically expressing COX-1, COX-2, and 15LOX-1, to investigate whether expression of COX-1, COX-2, or 15LOX-1 would affect cell adhesion using our opto-electric methodology. In a fixed-time point experiment, only COX-1- and COX-2-expressing cells enhanced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, but all the transfected cells showed invasion activity. However, in a real-time experiment using opto-electric approaches, transmitted cellular morphology was much different with tight adhesion being shown in COX-2 expressing cells, as imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy (DICM) and interference reflection contrast microscopy (IRCM). Furthermore, micro-impedance measurements showed a continued increase in both resistance and reactance of COX- and LOX-transfected cells, consistent with the imaging data. Our data indicate that both COX- and LOX-expressing cells have strong cell-to-cell and cell-to-substrate adhesions, and that cell imaging analysis with cell impedance data generates fully reliable results on cell adhesion measurement.",

Since there is a growing body of evidence that advanced glycation end products (AGE) and their receptor RAGE axis plays an important role in vascular complications in diabetes, this study investigated whether and how GLP-1 blocked the deleterious effects of AGE on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) was expressed in HUVEC. GLP-1 dose-dependently inhibited RAGE gene expression in HUVEC, which was blocked by small interfering RNAs raised against GLP-1R. An analogue of cyclic AMP also decreased RAGE mRNA level in HUVEC. Further, GLP-1 decreased reactive oxygen species generation and subsequently reduced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNA levels in AGE-exposed HUVEC. Our present study suggests that GLP-1 directly acts on HUVEC via GLP-1R and it could work as an anti-inflammatory agent against AGE by reducing RAGE expression via activation of cyclic AMP pathways.",

     "abstract": "Endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and is accompanied by dysregulated apoptosis of immune and non-immune cells. Treatment with statins reduces mortality in rodent models of sepsis and endotoxemia. Inhibition of protein isoprenylation, including farnesylation, has been proposed as a mechanism to mediate the lipid-lowering-independent effects of statins. Nonetheless, the effects of the inhibition of isoprenylation have not yet been studied. To investigate the role of farnesylation, we evaluated the effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitor and statin on survival following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in mice. Both simvastatin (2\u00a0mg/kg BW) and FTI-277 (20\u00a0mg/kg BW) treatment improved survival by twofold after LPS injection, as compared with vehicle alone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). LPS-induced cleavage (activation) of caspase-3, an indicator of apoptotic change, and increased protein expression of proapoptotic molecules, Bax and Bim, and activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) in the liver and spleen were attenuated by both simvastatin and FTI-277. These results demonstrate that farnesyltransferase inhibitor as well as statin significantly reduced LPS-induced mortality in mice. Our findings also suggest that inhibition of protein farnesylation may contribute to the lipid-lowering-independent protective effects of statins in endotoxemia, and that protein farnesylation may play a role in LPS-induced stress response, including JNK/SAPK activation, and apoptotic change. Our data argue that farnesyltransferase may be a potential molecular target for treating patients with endotoxemia.",

The anti-folate capecitabine is significantly less effective than pemetrexed. The balance between thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), and thymidine phosphorylase (TP) is critical to the efficacy of capecitabine. DNA from mesothelioma cell lines was bisulfite treated and examined by MS-PCR, RNA was obtained for real-time PCR analysis, and protein lysates were obtained for Western immunoblot analysis. Cytotoxicity was assessed by MTT assay, comparing 5-aza-CdR pretreated or untreated cells with 5\u2032-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (DFUR), 5-FU, and pemetrexed. Finally bisulfite sequencing of the extracellular growth factor-1 (ECGF-1) gene was performed on 4 mesothelioma samples and pericardial tissue. One of the four cell lines tested (H290) was methylated for ECGF-1. This corresponded to a lack of TP expression by real-time PCR and Western immunoblot. Treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcM 5-aza-CdR increased TP mRNA and protein expression in H290. DFUR, the substrate for TP, showed increased cytotoxicity when delivered after 5-aza-CdR exposure in the methylated cell line. There was no difference in any of the unmethylated cell lines when cells were exposed to 5-FU or pemetrexed with or without 5-aza-CdR. Patient tumor samples revealed an increased number of methylated CpG sites in ECGF-1 compared to normal pericardium.

However, there is still no evidence showing EGFL7\u2019s relationship with miR-126 and the proliferation of lung cancer cells. The aim of this work is to investigate whether miR-126, together with EGFL7, have an effect on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells\u2019 proliferation. Therefore, we constructed overexpressed miR-126 plasmid to target EGFL7 and transfected them into NSCLC cell line A549 cells. Then, we used methods like quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, flow cytometry assay, and immunohistochemistry staining to confirm our findings. The result was that overexpression of miR-126 in A549 cells could increase EGFL7 expression. Furthermore, the most notable finding by cell proliferation related assays is that miR-126 can inhibit A549 cells proliferation in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo by targeting EGFL7. As a result, our study demonstrates that miR-126 can inhibit proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells through one of its targets, EGFL7.",

However, the frequent changes in the surface antigens of influenza viruses allow the viruses to avoid antibody-mediated immunity. On the other hand, it is known that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) populations directed against internal antigens of influenza A virus are broadly cross-reactive to influenza virus subtypes. In the present study, liposomal conjugates with CTL epitope peptides derived from highly conserved internal antigens of influenza viruses were evaluated for their ability to protect against infection with influenza viruses. Liposomal conjugates with peptide M1 58-66, an HLA-A*0201-binding CTL epitope present within the amino-acid sequence of the M1 coding region, successfully induced antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells and CTLs in HLA-A*0201-transgenic mice. Moreover, after nasal infection with either the H1N1 or H3N2 virus, viral replication in the lung was significantly inhibited in the immunized mice. These protective activities lasted at least 6\u00a0months after the immunization. Thus, these results suggest that liposome-coupled CTL epitope peptides derived from highly conserved internal antigens of influenza viruses might be applicable to the development of vaccines that induce protection against infection with heterosubtypic influenza viruses.",

Over-expression of BRE by transfection promoted survival of cell lines against apoptotic induction; whereas depletion of the protein by siRNA resulted in the opposite. In vivo anti-apoptotic activity of BRE was demonstrated by significant attenuation of Fas-induced acute fulminant hepatitis in transgenic mice expressing the human protein specifically in the liver.

By 8\u00a0months after tumor induction, the maximal sizes of tumor nodules of transgenic mice were significantly larger than those of the non-transgenic controls, although the numbers of tumor nodules between the two groups did not significantly differ. Importantly, as in human HCC, the mouse endogenous BRE level was up-regulated in mouse HCC nodules. These results show that BRE over-expression can indeed promote growth, though not initiation, of liver tumors.

These findings indicate that HNE adduction occurs preferentially in spectrin at the interface between the skeletal proteins and lipid bilayer in red cells and suggest that HNE\u2013spectrin adduct aggregation results in the extrusion of damaged spectrin and membrane lipids under physiological and disease conditions.",

     "abstract": "Cachexia, progressive loss of fat and muscle mass despite adequate nutrition, is a devastating complication of cancer associated with poor quality of life and increased mortality. Myostatin is a potent tonic muscle growth inhibitor. We tested how myostatin inhibition might influence cancer cachexia using genetic and pharmacological approaches. First, hypermuscular myostatin null mice were injected with Lewis lung carcinoma or B16F10 melanoma cells. Myostatin null mice were more sensitive to tumor-induced cachexia, losing more absolute mass and proportionately more muscle mass than wild-type mice. Because myostatin null mice lack expression from development, however, we also sought to manipulate myostatin acutely. The histone deacetylase inhibitor Trichostatin A has been shown to increase muscle mass in normal and dystrophic mice by inducing the myostatin inhibitor, follistatin. Although Trichostatin A administration induced muscle growth in normal mice, it failed to preserve muscle in colon-26 cancer cachexia. Finally we sought to inhibit myostatin and related ligands by administration of the Activin receptor extracellular domain/Fc fusion protein, ACVR2B-Fc. Systemic administration of ACVR2B-Fc potently inhibited muscle wasting and protected adipose stores in both colon-26 and Lewis lung carcinoma cachexia, without affecting tumor growth. Enhanced cachexia in myostatin knockouts indicates that host-derived myostatin is not the sole mediator of muscle wasting in cancer. More importantly, skeletal muscle preservation with ACVR2B-Fc establishes that targeting myostatin-family ligands using ACVR2B-Fc or related molecules is an important and potent therapeutic avenue in cancer cachexia.",

The aim of the present study was to develop a murine model of ALI and sepsis to enhance the knowledge of mechanistic aspects and pathophysiological changes in patients with these injuries. In deeply anesthetized female C57BL/6 mice, injury was induced by four sets of cotton smoke using an inhalation chamber. Afterward, live Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 colony-forming units) was administered intranasally. The indicated dose of bacteria was determined based on the results of a dose\u2013response study (n\u00a0=\u00a047). The following study groups were monitored for survival over 96\u00a0h: (1) sham injury group, (2) only smoke inhalation group, (3) only bacteria group, and (4) smoke inhalation plus bacteria group. Each group included 10 mice. The survival rates were 100%, 90%, 30%, and 10%, respectively. The double hit injury was associated with excessive releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the plasma, and enhanced neutrophil accumulation, increased lipid peroxidation, and excessive formation of reactive nitrogen species in the lung. In mice receiving only smoke inhalation injury, no systemic cytokine release and increased lung tissue lipid peroxidation were observed. However, smoke alone significantly increased neutrophil accumulation and formation of reactive nitrogen species in lung tissue. In conclusion, bacterial pneumonia is predominantly responsible for mortality and morbidity in this novel murine model of smoke inhalation and pulmonary sepsis. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species mediate the severity of lung injury.",

Recently, Raymond and Segr\u00e8 revealed that molecular oxygen allows 1000 more metabolic reactions than can occur in anoxic conditions. From the novel metabolites produced in aerobic metabolism, we serendipitously found that some of the metabolites are signaling molecules that target nuclear receptors. Since nuclear signaling systems are indispensable to superior organisms, we speculated that aerobic metabolism may facilitate biological evolution through promoting the establishment of nuclear signaling systems. This hypothesis is validated by the observation that most (97.5%) nuclear receptor ligands are produced by aerobic metabolism, which is further explained in terms of the chemical criteria (appropriate volume and rather high hydrophobicity) of nuclear receptor ligands that aerobic metabolites are more ready than anaerobic counterparts to satisfy these criteria.",

However, the majority of in vitro model systems currently available examine the process of angiogenesis, while the current focus in anti-vascular therapies moves towards exploring the benefit of targeting established vasculature as well. This urges the need for in vitro systems that are able to differentiate between the effects of compounds on angiogenesis as well as on established vasculature. To achieve this, we developed an in vitro model in which effects of compounds on different vascular targets can be studied specifically. Using this model, we examined the actions of the fumagillin derivate TNP-470, the MMP-inhibitor marimastat and the recently developed tubulin-binding agent Ang-510. We show that TNP-470 and marimastat solely inhibited angiogenesis, whereas Ang-510 potently inhibited angiogenesis and caused massive disruption of newly established vasculature. We show that the use of this in vitro model allows for specific and efficient screening of the effects of compounds on different vascular targets, which may facilitate the identification of agents with potential clinical benefit. The indicated differences in the mode of action between marimastat, TNP-470 and Ang-510 to target vasculature are illustrative for this approach.",

The siRNA knockdown of JNK resulted in a decrease in RhoB expression and the siRNA knockdown of RhoB restored cell growth even in the \u03b3-irradiated cells.

Using the Transwell co-culture system, we found that OGD-treated astrocytes could not promote neural stem cell differentiation and proliferation. Next, isobaric tagging for the relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics techniques was performed to identify the proteins in the supernatants of astrocytes (with or without OGD). Through a multi-step analysis and gene ontology classification, 130 extracellular proteins were identified, most of which were involved in neuronal development, the inflammatory response, extracellular matrix composition and supportive functions. Of these proteins, 44 had never been reported to be produced by astrocytes. Using ProteinPilot software analysis, we found that 60 extracellular proteins were significantly altered (27 upregulated and 33 downregulated) in the supernatant of OGD-treated astrocytes.

The main hypothesis of the present work is that IAP\u2019s anticoagulant effect occurs by competing with phospholipid membranes in in vitro coagulation reactions. We verified this hypothesis by employing different phospholipid-dependent coagulation assays, such as the APTT, the dilute prothrombin time (dPT) and the dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) with both low and high amounts of phospholipids. We show that coagulation times are prolonged by IAP in a concentration-dependent manner, and that this prolongation is abrogated by adding excess phospholipid, demonstrating a phospholipid dependence for this inhibition. Using an ELISA-based binding assay, we show IAP inhibits the binding of one of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, factor X, to phospholipid membranes. This is further confirmed with fluorescence spectroscopy, where the interaction of IAP and factor X is inhibited by phospholipid. In summary, this work demonstrates that IAP can act as an anticoagulant by impairing the interaction of coagulation factors with phospholipid membranes and provides a paradigm for the development of novel anticoagulants.",

Activation of PI3K/AKT in endothelial cells by a low concentration of anti-HLA ligation enhances protection from complement attack. A real-time quantitative PCR and flow-cytometry experiment showed that ferritin H and HO-1 mRNAs were induced in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner, while CD55 and CD59 expression were not enhanced by anti-HLA ligation. Anti-HLA ligation on endothelial cells activates ferritin H ARE and induces Nrf2 binding on its enhancer element. Finally, overexpression of Nrf2 in endothelial cells attenuates complement-mediated cytotoxicity. These experiments suggest that induction of PI3K/AKT-dependent cytoprotective genes by Nrf2 is an important mechanism to prevent complement attack. Thus, a protocol to activate this pathway would be a potential strategy for avoidance of graft rejection in transplantation.",

Syndecan-2 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein whose intracellular C-terminus has previously been shown to interact with the post-synaptic density 95/discs large/zonula occludens-1 (PDZ) domain of CASK and with two separate regions of neurofibromin. These three proteins collaborate to orchestrate the induction of filopodia and dendritic spines. We have used systematic mutagenesis of the intracellular region of syndecan-2 and a quantitative yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay to study the determinants of their interactions. We show that syndecan\u2019s interactions with both CASK and neurofibromin are dependent on syndecan homodimerization and that neurofibromin largely interacts with the membrane-proximal part of the dimeric syndecan intracellular domain, leaving the membrane-distal C-terminus free to interact with CASK. We conducted a phylogenetic study of syndecan sequences, finding correspondence between conserved residues and mutations affecting both dimerization and interactions; we also find that fish have a very different syndecan repertoire from tetrapods.

Our results showed: TNF-\u03b1 markedly decreased BMP-2-induced alkaline phosphatase activity in the multipotent myoblast C2C12 cells in a dose dependent manner; stepwise experiments demonstrated that BMP-2-induced Smad1 activity was abrogated by addition of exogenous TNF-\u03b1 or overexpression of NF-\u03baB, and it was significantly elevated by overexpression of I\u03baB\u03b1, an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB; Western blotting showed that TNF-\u03b1 markedly decreased the amount of phospho-Smad1 in BMP-2-activated C2C12 cells, but it did not alter Smad1 mRNA abundance as measured by real-time PCR; addition of a functional cell-permeable NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide antagonized NF-\u03baB activity and ameliorated TNF-\u03b1 inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, our study reveals for the first time that NF-\u03baB activation inhibits osteoblast differentiation by attenuating Smad1 activity and application of NBD peptide ameliorates this inhibitory effect.

The level of each component is tightly regulated in a cell via proteasomal degradation. On the other hand, it has previously been reported that PS1/\u03b3-secretase is involved in the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway. PI3K is inhibited in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) brain, whereas the effects of PI3K inhibition on the metabolism of PS1/\u03b3-secretase have not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the treatment of neurons with PI3K inhibitors leads to increased levels of PS1/\u03b3-secretase components through an inhibitory effect on their degradation. Moreover, PI3K inhibition accelerated ubiquitination of PS1. We further show the evidence that the PS1 ubiquitination after PI3K inhibition is represented by the multiple mono-ubiquitination, instead of poly-ubiquitination. Accordingly, treatment of cells with PI3K inhibitor led to a differential intracellular redistribution of PS1 from the one observed after the proteasomal inhibition. These results suggest that PI3K inhibition may trigger the multiple mono-ubiquitination of PS1, which precludes the degradation of PS1/\u03b3-secretase through the proteasomal pathway. Since PS1/\u03b3-secretase is deeply involved in the production of A\u03b2 protein, a deeper knowledge into its metabolism could contribute to a better elucidation of AD pathogenesis.",

The ratio of unsaturated fatty acids and saturated fatty acids (UFAs/SFAs) was significantly lower in CS than in CTL. CR had higher monoenoic acid composition and lower dienoic acid composition than CTL. In addition, the amount of SFAs was lower and therefore the UFAs/SFAs ratio considerably higher in CR than in CTL.

In this study, we show that SMAR1 regulates the transcription of NF-\u03baB target gene CD40. SMAR1 recruits HDAC1 and forms a repressor complex on CD40 promoter and keeps its basal transcription in check. Further, we show that TNF\u03b1 stimulation induces SMAR1 phosphorylation at Ser-347 and promotes its cytoplasmic translocation, thus releasing its negative effect. Concomitantly, TNF\u03b1 induced phosphorylation of STAT1 at Tyr-701 by JAK1 facilitates its nuclear translocation and activation of CD40 through p300 recruitment and core Histone-3 acetylation. Thus, TNF\u03b1 mediated regulation of CD40 expression occurs by dual phosphorylation of SMAR1 and STAT1.",

To block the influence of bone marrow-derived cells, the mice were irradiated with a 4-Gy dose of radiation from a 137Cs source. Irradiation was performed in four different conditions with radio dense 2-cm thick lead disks; (1) H group, the head were covered with these discs to protect the eyes from radiation; (2) A group, all of the body was covered with these discs; (3) N group, mice were completely unshielded; (4) C group, mice were put in the irradiator but were not irradiated. On P17, the retinal areas showing pathological and physiological retinal angiogenesis were measured and compared to the retinas of nonirradiated mice.Although irradiation induced leukocyte depletion, it did not affect the number of other cell types or body weight. Retinal nonperfusion areas were significantly larger in irradiated mice than in control mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that physiological angiogenesis was impaired. However, the formation of tuft-like angiogenesis processes was more prominent in the irradiated mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating that pathological angiogenesis was intact.Bone marrow-derived cells seem to be differentially involved in the formation of physiological and pathological retinal vessels. Pathological angiogenesis in the murine retina does not require functional bone marrow-derived cells, but these cells are important for the formation of physiological vessels. Our results add a new insight into the pathology of retinal angiogenesis and bolster the hypothesis that bone marrow cells are involved in the pathology or severity of retinal angiogenic diseases.",

TRAIL has four major distinct receptors: DR4 and DR5 can recruit Fas-associated death domain protein to induce extrinsic death signal, while DcR1 and DcR2 are decoy receptors that can neutralize TRAIL toxicity by binding to TRAIL. Hypoxia is an important feature of solid tumors that renders tumor cells resistant to some chemotherapeutic agents, including TRAIL, and we therefore investigated the role of hypoxia in TRAIL receptor expression in human colon cancer cells. Hypoxia upregulated DcR2 protein expression in five different human colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, HT29, SW480, SW620, and WiDr). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the increased DcR2 protein was expressed on the cell surface membrane. In contrast, hypoxia had no effect on DR4, DR5, or DcR1 protein levels. RT-PCR analysis suggested that this protein increase was the result of DcR2 gene transcription. Transcription factors were investigated using p53-null cells, pharmacological inhibitors, and a small interfering RNA approach. Our results demonstrated that hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 played a crucial role in regulating the transcription of DcR2, but that neither p53 nor NF-\u03baB contributed to this regulation. Moreover, TRAIL-induced, but not agonistic DR5 antibody-induced cell death was attenuated under hypoxic conditions. These results suggest that increased DcR2 protein levels might play a role in TRAIL resistance in solid tumors.",

INO1 encodes a key enzyme required for the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylinositol. Induction of INO1 resulted in acetylation of both histones H3 and H4 at the INO1 promoter and sequences farther downstream in the coding region, suggesting a gene-wide acetylation in response to transcriptional activation. Such chromatin remodeling activity requires the presence of transcriptional activator Ino2p. This indicates that histone acetylation is an activator-dependent event. Furthermore, the increase of histone acetylation is due to the increase of acetylation levels per nucleosome rather than the increase of nucleosome density. Therefore, these observations constitute evidence for the molecular mechanism of the correlation between histone acetylation and INO1 activity.",

However, under certain conditions, it appears that in addition to oxidative stress, other mechanisms are also involved in proteasome regulation. This study investigated whether impaired protein methylation that occurs during exposure of liver cells to ethanol, may contribute to suppression of proteasome activity. We measured the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity in Huh7CYP cells, hepatocytes, liver cytosols and nuclear extracts or purified 20S proteasome under conditions that maintain or prevent protein methylation. Reduction of proteasome activity of hepatoma cell and hepatocytes by ethanol or tubercidin was prevented by simultaneous treatment with S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Moreover, the tubercidin-induced decline in proteasome activity occurred in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions. In vitro exposure of cell cytosolic fractions or highly purified 20S proteasome to low SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratios in the buffer also suppressed proteasome function, indicating that one or more methyltransferase(s) may be associated with proteasomal subunits. Immunoblotting a purified 20S rabbit red cell proteasome preparation using methyl lysine-specific antibodies revealed a 25\u00a0kDa proteasome subunit that showed positive reactivity with anti-methyl lysine. This reactivity was modified when 20S proteasome was exposed to differential SAM:SAH ratios.

Vesicle disruption was investigated by leakage of dye from calcein-loaded ULVs. We observed that SDM decreased diphenyl-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and increased the temperature-dependent change in anisotropy. SDM changed the absorbance of merocyanin-bound ULVs. SDM increased detergent-mediated calcein leakage. SDM structure was dramatically altered upon interaction with ULVs. We also observed that SDM enhanced detergent-mediated leakage of loaded ULVs, suggesting that SDM may be neurotoxic.

Still proof is lacking that FXII is activated by platelets in a more physiological environment. In this study we investigate if activated platelets can induce FXII-mediated contact activation and whether this activation affects clot formation in human blood.Human platelets were activated with a thrombin receptor-activating peptide, SFLLRN-amide, in platelet-rich plasma or in whole blood. FXIIa and FXIa in complex with preferentially antithrombin (AT) and to some extent C1-inhibitor (C1INH) were generated in response to TRAP stimulation. This contact activation was independent of surface-mediated contact activation, tissue factor pathway or thrombin. In clotting whole blood FXIIa-AT and FXIa-AT complexes were specifically formed, demonstrating that AT is a potent inhibitor of FXIIa and FXIa generated by platelet activation. Contact activation proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry and FXII, FXI, high-molecular weight kininogen, and prekallikrein were detected on activated platelets. Using chromogenic assays, enzymatic activity of platelet-associated FXIIa, FXIa, and kallikrein were demonstrated. Inhibition of FXIIa in non-anticoagulated blood also prolonged the clotting time.We conclude that platelet activation triggers FXII-mediated contact activation on the surface and in the vicinity of activated platelets. This leads specifically to generation of FXIIa-AT and FXIa-AT complexes, and contributes to clot formation. Activated platelets may thereby constitute an intravascular locus for contact activation, which may explain the recently reported importance of FXII in thrombus formation.",

     "abstract": "Apoptosis can result from activation of three major pathways: the extrinsic, the intrinsic, and the most recently identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated pathway. While the two former pathways are known to be operational in human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), the existence of the ER stress-mediated pathway, generally involving caspase-4, has never been reported in these cells. Recently, we have documented that arsenic trioxide (ATO) induced apoptosis in human PMNs by a mechanism that needs to be further investigated. In this study, using immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, we present evidence of ER alterations in PMNs activated by the ER stress inducer arsenic trioxide (ATO). Several key players of the unfolded protein response, including GRP78, GADD153, ATF6, XBP1 and eIF2\u03b1 are expressed and activated in PMNs treated with ATO or other ER stress inducers. Although caspase-4 is expressed and activated in neutrophils, treatment with a caspase-4 inhibitor did not attenuate the pro-apoptotic effect of ATO at a concentration that reverses caspase-4 processing and activation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway operates in human neutrophils.",

Oxygen tension is higher in arteries than in veins and thus has the potential to be an instructive signal in arterial/venous specification. EphrinB2 is specifically expressed in arteries and required during embryonic vessel formation. In this study, we show that expression of ephrinB2 is oxygen dependent. Mutagenesis of hypoxia-responsive elements and transactivation experiments determined this regulation to be achieved in a hypoxia-inducible factor independent manner. MAZ and Sp1 are known to regulate transcription together and have been shown to bind to the same sites within promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that binding of Sp1 to the ephrinB2 promoter was favored compared to MAZ under hypoxic relative to normoxic conditions. Furthermore, siRNA mediated knockdown of Sp1 attenuated this hypoxic response. These results indicate that hypoxia drives arterial differentiation by increasing ephrinB2 expression in endothelial cells through Sp1 activation.",

The neurofilament immunoreactivity was identified to form large ganglion-like structures and dense neuronal networks. The iGut was composed of all the enteric components of three germ layers: epithelial cells (endoderm), smooth muscle cells (mesoderm), ICCs (mesoderm), and enteric neurons (ectoderm).

All of the ECM proteins tested were found to support adhesion of MSCs to different extents. However, direct interaction only with laminin-1 triggered sprouting of neurite-like processes. Cells plated on laminin-1 exhibited neurite out growth as early as 3\u00a0h, and by 24\u00a0h, the cells developed elaborate neurites with contracted cell bodies and neuronal-like morphology. Function-blocking antibodies directed against \u03b16 and \u03b21 integrin subunits inhibited neurite formation on laminin-1 which confirmed the involvement of integrin \u03b16\u03b21 in neurite outgrowth. Mechanistic studies revealed that cell adhesion to laminin-1 activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways. Abrogation of FAK phosphorylation by herbimycin-A inhibited neurite formation and also decreased activities of MEK and ERK.

In parallel, insulin-exerted IR interaction with caveolin-2 was detected as early as 5\u00a0min throughout until 180\u00a0min. Down-regulation of caveolin-2 by caveolin-2 siRNA arrested specifically a long term activation of IR. The attenuation of IR activation resulted in retardation of rapamycin-sensitive pS727-STAT3 activation. As caveolin-2 tyrosine mutants were examined, Y27A-caveolin-2 explicitly impeded the long term IR activation by insulin, enhanced tyrosine dephosphorylation of IR, impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and exerted the interaction between activated IR and SOCS-3.

Fluorescence microscopy and laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopic detection showed that SMCs selectively uptake PpIX, and the intracellular PpIX concentration increases with the amount of PpIX in the incubation solution. PDT with PpIX impaired cellular viability from 93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4% to 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9% when the light intensity increases from 2 to 9\u00a0J/cm2 and intracellular PpIX concentration increases from 0.5 to 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml.

We have previously documented aberrant up-regulation of miR-1 expression in ischemic myocardium and the consequent slowing of cardiac conduction. However, whether miR-1 could be a biomarker for predicting acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is unclear. In the present study, we recruited 159 patients with or without AMI for quantification of miR-1 level in plasma using real-time RT-PCR method. We performed Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests for comparison. Univariable linear regression and logistics regression analyses were performed to assess the potential correlation between miR-1 and known AMI markers. We also conducted receiver\u2013operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic ability of miR-1. We found that: miR-1 level was significantly higher in plasma from AMI patients compared with non-AMI subjects and the level was dropped to normal on discharge following medication. Increased circulating miR-1 was not associated with age, gender, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus or the established biomarkers for AMI. However, miR-1 level was well correlated with QRS by both univariable linear and logistics regression analyses. The area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.7740 for separation between non-AMI and AMI patients and 0.8522 for separation AMI patients under hospitalization and discharge.

CaMKII is activated when it binds calmodulin in the presence of Ca2+ and, once autophosphorylated on T-286/7, remains active in the absence of Ca2+ (autonomous form). In the present study we used a quantitative mass spectrometric strategy (iTRAQ) to identify sites on PSD components phosphorylated upon CaMKII activation. Phosphorylation in isolated PSDs was monitored under conditions where CaMKII is: (1) mostly inactive (basal state), (2) active in the presence of Ca2+, and (3) active in the absence of Ca2+. The quantification strategy was validated through confirmation of previously described autophosphorylation characteristics of CaMKII. The effectiveness of phosphorylation of major PSD components by the activated CaMKII in the presence and absence of Ca2+ varied. Most notably, autonomous activity in the absence of Ca2+ was more effective in the phosphorylation of three residues on SynGAP. Several PSD scaffold proteins were phosphorylated upon activation of CaMKII. The strategy adopted allowed the identification, for the first time, of CaMKII-regulated sites on SAPAPs and Shanks, including three conserved serine residues near the C-termini of SAPAP1, SAPAP2, and SAPAP3. Involvement of CaMKII in the phosphorylation of PSD scaffold proteins suggests a role in activity-induced structural re-organization of the PSD.",

The molecular mechanisms that underlie this antagonism are not well understood. We examined AT1 and AT2 receptor-induced signal cross-talk in the cytoplasm and the importance of the hetero-dimerization of AT1 receptor with AT2 receptor on the cell surface. AT1 and AT2 receptors showed antagonistic effects toward inositol phosphate production. AT1 receptors mainly formed homo-dimers, rather than hetero-dimers with AT2 receptor, on the cell surface as determined by immunoprecipitation, and subsequently induced cell signals. AT2 receptor mainly formed homo-dimers, rather than hetero-dimers with AT1 receptor, on the cell surface. The expression levels of homo-dimerized AT1 receptor or AT2 receptor on the cell surface did not change after treatment with Ang II, the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan or the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319. Finally, AT1 and AT2 receptor-induced signals antagonized phospholipase C-\u03b23 phosphorylation. In conclusion, Ang II-induced AT1 receptor signals may be mainly blocked by AT2 receptor signals through their negative cross-talk in the cytoplasm rather than by the hetero-dimerization of both receptors on the cell surface. The proper balance of the expression levels of AT1 and AT2 receptors might be critical for the antagonistic action between these receptors.",

The plasma concentrations of MMP-9 were determined in all subjects.The mean plasma concentrations of MMP-9 of patients with T2DM were significantly higher than that of controls and the plasma levels of MMP-9 were higher in diabetic patients with macroangiopathy than in patients without macroangiopathy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The genotype (CC, CT, and TT) distribution of c.1562C>T polymorphism of the MMP-9 gene was 60.0%, 31.3%, and 8.8% in diabetic patients with macroangiopathy, 76.3%, 21.3%, and 2.5% in patients without macroangiopathy, and 77.5%, 21.3%, 1.3% in controls, respectively, a significant difference was found between diabetic patients with and without macroangiopathy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The frequency of the allele T was higher in patients with macroangiopathy than in patients without macroangiopathy (24.4% vs 13.1%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the plasma MMP-9 levels were markedly higher in patients with TT genotype than those with CC or CT genotype in patients with macroangiopathy (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The MMP-9 c.1562C>T gene polymorphism associated with a predisposition to increased plasma MMP-9 levels could constitute a useful predictive marker for diabetic macroangiopathy.",

The phosphorylation efficiency of the T4 polynucleotide kinase was highest when Oxa was located on the 5\u2032-end of single stranded DNAs compared to when other nucleobases were in this position. The order of phosphorylation efficiency was as follows; Oxa\u00a0>\u00a0Gua\u00a0>\u00a0adenine (Ade)\u00a0\u223c\u00a0thymine (Thy)\u00a0>\u00a0cytosine (Cyt). Base-pairing of Oxa and Cyt (Oxa:Cyt) between the ligation fragment and template was found to influence the ligation performance of the T4 DNA ligase to a lesser degree compared to Gua:Cyt. In addition, EcoRI and BglII showed higher cleavage activities on DNA substrates containing Oxa:Cyt than those containing Gua:Cyt, while BamHI, HindIII and EcoRV showed lower cleavage activity; however, this decrease in activity was relatively small.",

To confirm this hypothesis using cell cultures, we performed size exclusion chromatography as a pretreatment method prior to Western blotting to more clearly detect a small amount of \u03b1-synuclein oligomers in wild-type \u03b1-synuclein-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells.

Here, we investigated the potential role of URG11 in hypoxia-induced renal tubular epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT). Overexpression of URG11 in a human proximal tubule cell line (HK2) promoted a mesenchymal phenotype accompanied by reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and \u03b1-SMA, while URG11 knockdown by siRNA effectively reversed hypoxia-induced EMT. URG11 promoted the expression of \u03b2-catenin and increased its nuclear accumulation under normoxic conditions through transactivation of the \u03b2-catenin promoter. This in turn upregulated \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) and its downstream effector genes, vimentin, and \u03b1-SMA. In vivo, strong expression of URG11 was observed in the tubular epithelia of 5/6-nephrectomized rats, and a Western blot analysis demonstrated a close correlation between HIF-1\u03b1 and URG11 protein levels.

Administration of MPTP in mice produces neuropathological defects as observed in PD and 1-methyl-4-pyridinium (MPP+) induces cell death when neuronal cell cultures are used. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulator of energy homeostasis. In the present study, we demonstrated that AMPK is activated by MPTP in mice and MPP+ in SH-SY5Y cells. The inhibition of AMPK by compound C resulted in an increase in MPP+-induced cell death. We further showed that overexpression of AMPK increased cell viability after exposure to MPP+ in SH-SY5Y cells.

These structural characteristics permitted developing a Multiplex-Nested-PCR (MN-PCR) for the simultaneous identification of different P-type ATPases. Thus, using MN-PCR, seven different cDNAs were cloned from enterocytes and colonocytes, including SERCA3, SERCA2, Na+/K+-ATPase \u03b11-isoform, H+/K+-ATPase \u03b12-isoform, PMCA1, PMCA4 and a cDNA-fragment that seems to be a new cassette-type splice-variant of the atp1a1 gen.

Since integrin \u03b12\u03b21 interacts with collagen type I through the DGEA (Asp-Gly-Glu-Ala) amino acid sequence, and a similar sequence, DGDA (Asp-Gly-Asp-Ala), exists in the kringle 2 domain, we investigated whether the DGDA sequence has a role in antiangiogenic activity of TK1\u20132.

Pretreatment of the DGDA peptide also blocked anti-migratory activity of TK1\u20132.

Genetically engineered immunocompetent cells developed significant resistance to temozolomide compared to non-modified cells, and genetic modification of these cells did not affect their ability to kill K562 cells. We then evaluated the effectiveness of drug-resistant immunocompetent cell mediated killing of tumor cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy. During a chemotherapy challenge the cytotoxic activity of non-modified immunocompetent cells was dramatically impaired. However, when combined with chemotherapy, genetically-modified immune cells retained their cytotoxic activities and efficiently killed non-modified target cells.

However, due to the lack of proper analytical tools, it is unclear whether the phosphatase activity of SHP2 is activated in most studies. We have previously developed an activity-based probe LCL2 that formed covalent linkage with catalytically active protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Here, by combining LCL2 with a SHP2 specific antibody, we established an assay system that enables the direct monitoring of SHP2 activity upon cisplatin treatment of cancer cells. The protocol is advantageous over conventional colorimetric or in-gel PTP assays as it is specific and does not require the use of radioisotope reagents. Using this assay, we found SHP2 activity was selectively activated by cisplatin. Moreover, the activation of SHP2 appeared to be specific for cisplatin as other DNA damage agents failed to activate the activity. Although the role of SHP2 activation by cisplatin treatments is still unclear to us, our results provide the first direct evidence for the activation of SHP2 during cisplatin treatments. More importantly, the concept of using activity-based probe in conjunction with target-specific antibodies could be extended to other enzyme classes.",

We here found that sesamin increased in vitro angiogenic processes, such as endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, as well as neovascularization in an animal model. This compound elicited the activation of multiple angiogenic signal modulators, such as ERK, Akt, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), NO production, FAK, and p38 MAPK, but not Src. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin specifically inhibited sesamin-induced activation of the ERK and Akt/eNOS pathways. These inhibitors reduced angiogenic events, with high specificity for MEK/ERK-dependent cell proliferation and migration and PI3K/Akt-mediated tube formation. Moreover, inhibition of p38 MAPK effectively inhibited sesamin-induced cell migration. The angiogenic activity of sesamin was not associated with VEGF expression. Furthermore, this compound did not induce vascular permeability and upregulated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, which are hallmarks of vascular inflammation. These results suggest that sesamin stimulates angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the activation of MEK/ERK-, PI3K/Akt/eNOS-, p125FAK-, and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways, without increasing vascular inflammation, and may be used for treating ischemic diseases and tissue regeneration.",

We report that the MLrg gene produces two alternative splice products (GenBank Accession Nos. DQ316984 and DQ320011), respectively, encoding MLrgW and MLrgS polypeptides. Both proteins contain zinc finger and leucine zipper domains and are thus potential regulators of transcription. Expression of MLrgW and MLrgS were robustly upregulated following LPS treatment, and the proteins were localized predominantly in the nuclear membrane and cytoplasm. In stable transfectants over-expressing MLrgW the proportion of cells in G1 phase was significantly reduced, while in cells over-expressing MLrgS the proportion of cells in G2 was significantly increased; both proteins are thus potential regulators of cell cycle progression.

Since these transcription factors may also contribute to the maintenance of adipocyte function, we examined the effects of siRNA targeted to Mrf-2 on triglyceride metabolism in mature 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes. As it did in differentiating adipocytes, knockdown of Mrf-2 decreased the expression of both C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3. Knockdown of Mrf-2 also activated both lipolysis and triglyceride synthesis, and caused a significant increase in the ratio of glycerol release to free fatty acid release. This suggests that knockdown of Mrf-2 increases the rate of fatty acid recycling in 3T3-L1-derived adipocytes.

     "abstract": "Nucleostemin (NS) is a nucleolar protein abundantly expressed in a variety of proliferating cells and undifferentiated cells. Its known functions include cell cycle regulation and the control of pre-rRNA processing. It also has been proposed that NS has an additional role in undifferentiated cells due to its downregulation during stem cell differentiation and its upregulation during tissue regeneration. Here, however, we demonstrate that skeletal muscle cell differentiation has a unique expression profile of NS in that it is continuously expressed during differentiation. NS was expressed at similar levels in non-proliferating muscle stem cells (satellite cells), rapidly proliferating precursor cells (myoblasts) and post-mitotic terminally differentiated cells (myotubes and myofibers). The sustained expression of NS during terminal differentiation is necessary to support increased protein synthesis during this process. Downregulation of NS inhibited differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes, accompanied by striking downregulation of key myogenic transcription factors, such as myogenin and MyoD. In contrast, upregulation of NS inhibited proliferation and promoted muscle differentiation in a p53-dependent manner. Our findings provide evidence that NS has an unexpected role in post-mitotic terminal differentiation. Importantly, these findings also indicate that, contrary to suggestions in the literature, the expression of NS cannot always be used as a reliable indicator for undifferentiated cells or proliferating cells.",

Complete inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of atg5 in the Tet-off atg5\u2212/\u2212 MEF system attenuated the cytoprotective effect of IM, indicating that the effect is partially dependent on autophagy. However, cytoprotection by IM was not mediated through suppression of ROS production via mitophagy, ER stress via ribophagy, or proapoptotic function of ABL kinase.

It has been suggested previously that the protein arginine methylation of the RGG-box of ICP27 is required for herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) viral replication and gene expression in vivo. However, a cellular mediator for this process has not yet been identified. In our current study, we show that the protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) is a cellular mediator of the arginine methylation of ICP27 RGG-box. We generated arginine substitution mutants in this domain and examined which arginine residues are required for methylation by PRMT1. R138, R148 and R150 were found to be the major sites of this methylation but additional arginine residues serving as minor methylation sites are still required to sustain the fully methylated form of ICP27 RGG. We also demonstrate that the nuclear foci-like structure formation, SRPK interactions, and RNA-binding activity of ICP27 are modulated by the arginine methylation of the ICP27 RGG-box. Furthermore, HSV-1 replication is inhibited by hypomethylation of this domain resulting from the use of general PRMT inhibitors or arginine mutations. Our data thus suggest that the PRMT1 plays a key role as a cellular regulator of HSV-1 replication through ICP27 RGG-box methylation.",

This blood group is compatible with all other blood groups as a donor, as it does not express the H antigen on the red blood cells. In this study, we describe the establishment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the dermal fibroblasts of a Bombay blood-type individual by the ectopic expression of established transcription factors Klf4, Oct4, Sox2, and c-Myc. Sequence analyses of fibroblasts and iPSCs revealed a nonsense mutation 826C to T (276 Gln to Ter) in the FUT1 gene and a missense mutation 739G to A (247 Gly to Ser) in the FUT2 gene in the Bombay phenotype under study. The established iPSCs resemble human embryonic stem cells in morphology, passaging, surface and pluripotency markers, normal karyotype, gene expression, DNA methylation of critical pluripotency genes, and in-vitro differentiation. The directed differentiation of the iPSCs into hematopoietic lineage cells displayed increased expression of the hematopoietic lineage markers such as CD34, CD133, RUNX1, KDR, \u03b1-globulin, and \u03b3-globulin.

However, the mechanism by which FGF2 regulates bone mass or bone formation is not fully defined. Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), one member of activating transcription factor/cAMP response element binding family, is a transcription factor required for osteoblast terminal differentiation. Here we investigate the ability of FGF2 to increase expression of ATF4 in bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and examine ATF4 expression in Fgf2\u2212/\u2212 BMSCs. We found that FGF2 stimulated ATF4 mRNA expression as early as 20\u00a0min and increased ATF4 protein expression after three hours of treatment. BMSCs from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2\u2212/\u2212 mice were cultured in osteogenesis medium. We observed reduced alkaline phosphatase staining, decreased mineralized nodules and reduced osteocalcin expression, and reduced expression of ATF4 in Fgf2\u2212/\u2212 BMSC cultures compared to Fgf2+/+ BMSCs. This study is the first demonstration that ATF4 expression can be stimulated by FGF2 in osteoblasts and that ATF4 expression is significantly reduced in differentiated Fgf2\u2212/\u2212 BMSCs. These results suggest that impaired bone mass and bone formation in Fgf2 null mice may be due in part to reduced ATF4 expression.",

Structural analysis and molecular modeling lead to several novel findings. First, adenine is bound at the active site in the crystal structures of GAP31 to HIV-LTR duplex DNA with 5\u2032 overhanging adenosine ends, such as the 3\u2032-processed HIV-LTR DNA but not to DNA duplex with blunt ends. Second, the active site pocket of GAP31 is ideally suited to accommodate the 5\u2032 overhanging adenosine of the 3\u2032-processed HIV-LTR DNA and the active site residues are positioned to perform the adenosine glycosidase activity. Third, GAP31 also removes the 5\u2032-end adenine from single-stranded HIV-LTR DNA oligonucleotide as well as any exposed adenosine, including that of single nucleotide dAMP but not from AMP. Fourth, GAP31 does not de-purinate guanosine from di-nucleotide GT. These results suggest that GAP31 has DNA adenosine glycosidase activity against accessible adenosine. This activity is distinct from the generally known RNA N-glycosidase activity toward the 28S rRNA. It may be an alternative function that contributes to the antiviral and anti-tumor activities of GAP31. These results provide molecular insights consistent with the anti-HIV mechanisms of GAP31 in its inhibition on the integration of viral DNA into the host genome by HIV-integrase as well as irreversible topological relaxation of the supercoiled viral DNA.",

Herein, we evaluated the cytotoxic role of MGO in human lens epithelial cell line (HLE-B3). HLE-B3 cells were exposed to 400\u00a0\u03bcM MGO in the present or absence of pyridoxamine for 24\u00a0h. We then examined the formation of argpyrimidine, apoptosis and oxidative stress in HLE-B3 cells. In MGO-treated HLE-B3 cells, the accumulation of argpyrimidine was markedly increased, and caspase-3 and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were highly expressed, which paralleled apoptotic cell death. However, pyridoxamine (AGEs inhibitor) prevented the argpyrimidine formation and apoptosis of MGO-treated HLE-B3 cells. These results suggested that the accumulation of argpyrimidine and oxidative DNA damage caused by MGO are involved in apoptosis of HLE-B3 cells.",

While many mutations in the globular head region of the protein have been reported and studied, analysis of HCM-causing mutations in the \u03b2-MyHC rod domain has not yet been reported. To address this question, we performed an array of biochemical and biophysical assays to determine how the HCM-causing E1356K mutation affects the structure, stability, and function of the \u03b2-MyHC rod. Surprisingly, the E1356K mutation appears to thermodynamically destabilize the protein, rather than alter the charge profile know to be essential for muscle filament assembly.

Hepatic and pancreatic primordia become specified in the posterior segment of the ventral foregut endoderm at early somite stages. The mechanisms for demarcating gallbladder and bile duct primordium, however, are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the gallbladder and bile duct progenitors are specified in the paired lateral endoderm domains outside the heart field at almost the same timing as hepatic and pancreatic induction. In the anterior definitive endoderm, Sox17 reactivation occurs in a certain population within the most lateral domains posterolateral to the anterior intestinal portal (AIP) lip on both the left and right sides. During foregut formation, the paired Sox17-positive domains expand ventromedially to merge in the midline of the AIP lip and become localized between the liver and pancreatic primordia. In Sox17-null embryos, these lateral domains are missing, resulting in a complete loss of the gallbladder/bile-duct structure. Chimera analyses revealed that Sox17-null endoderm cells in the posteroventral foregut do not display any gallbladder/bile-duct molecular characters. Our findings show that Sox17 functions cell-autonomously to specify gallbladder/bile-duct in the mouse embryo.",

Osteocytes are thought to be the cellular structures that sense physical forces and transform these signals into a biological response. The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway has been identified as one of the signaling pathways that is activated in response to mechanical loading, but the molecular events that lead to an activation of this pathway in osteocytes are not well understood. We assessed whether nitric oxide, focal adhesion kinase, and/or the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase/Akt signaling pathway mediate loading-induced \u03b2-catenin pathway activation in MLO-Y4 osteocytes. We found that mechanical stimulation by pulsating fluid flow (PFF, 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0Pa, 5\u00a0Hz) for 30\u00a0min induced \u03b2-catenin stabilization and activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.

Addition of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME (1.0\u00a0mM) also abolished PFF-induced stabilization of \u03b2-catenin.

Muscle degeneration occurring in this disease is thought to be partly caused by increased Ca2+ entry through sarcolemmal cationic channels. Using the Mn2+ quench method, we show here that Mn2+ entry triggered by Ca2+ store depletion but not basal Mn2+ entry relies on Ca2+-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) activity in dystrophic fibers isolated from a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the mdx5cv mouse. iPLA2 was found to be localized in the vicinity of the sarcolemma and consistently, the iPLA2 lipid product lysophosphatidylcholine was found to trigger Ca2+ entry through sarcolemmal channels, suggesting that it acts as an intracellular messenger responsible for store-operated channels opening in dystrophic fibers. Our results suggest that inhibition of iPLA2 and lysophospholipid production may be of interest to reduce Ca2+ entry and subsequent degeneration of dystrophic muscle.",

Nevertheless, it is unclear how SUMO2/3 and SUMO2/3-modified proteins are delivered to the chromatin fibers. Here we report that the largest subunit of chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), human p150, interacts directly and preferentially with SUMO2/3. Amino acid residue of 98\u2013105 in p150 is essential and sufficient for SUMO2/3 interaction. p150-SUMO2/3 interaction coincided with regions that replicate chromatin fibers, because accumulation of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were detected at foci co-localized with both p150 and SUMO2/3 during the S-phase in a cell line expressing epitope-tagged p150. Although inhibition of SUMO2/3 expression had only a small effect on p150 deposition on the replication sites, depletion of p150 led to delocalization of SUMO2/3 from the replication foci. Furthermore, p150 mutants deficient in SUMO2/3 interaction, caused a major reduction of SUMO2/3 at the replication foci. Thus, our findings suggest an expanded role of p150 as a SUMO2/3-interacting factor, and raise the intriguing possibility that p150 plays a role in promoting delivery of SUMO2/3 or SUMO2/3-modified proteins (or both) on chromatin fibers during replication.",

     "abstract": "GH receptor (GHR) is a single membrane-spanning glycoprotein dimer that binds GH in its extracellular domain (ECD). GH activates the GHR intracellular domain (ICD)-associated tyrosine kinase, JAK2, which causes intracellular signaling. We previously found that plasma membrane (PM)-associated GHR was dramatically enriched in the lipid raft (LR) component of the membrane and that localization of GHR within PM regions may regulate GH signaling by influencing the profile of pathway activation. In this study, we examined determinants of LR localization of the GHR using a reconstitution system which lacks endogenous JAK2 and GHR. By non-detergent extraction and multistep fractionation, we found that GHR was highly enriched in the LR fraction independent of JAK2 expression. Various GHR mutants were examined in transfectants harboring JAK2. LR concentration was observed for a GHR in which the native transmembrane domain (TMD) is replaced by that of the unrelated LDL receptor and for a GHR that lacks its ICD. Thus, LR association requires neither the TMD nor the ICD. Similarly, a GHR that lacks the ECD, except for the membrane-proximal ECD stem region, was only minimally LR-concentrated. Mutants with internal stem deletions in the context of the full-length receptor were LR-concentrated similar to the wild-type. A GHR lacking ECD subdomain 1 reached the PM and was LR-concentrated, while one lacking ECD subdomain 2, also reached the PM, but was not LR-concentrated. These data suggest LR targeting resides in ECD subdomain 2, a region relatively uninvolved in GH binding.",

We previously reported that opioids inhibit cell growth and trigger apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism by which TLR2 mediates apoptosis in response to opioids is not yet known. Here we show that chronic morphine treatment in primary neurons dramatically increased the expression of TLR2 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. In addition, TLR2 deficiency significantly inhibited chronic morphine-induced apoptosis in primary neurons. Activation of caspase-3 after morphine treatment is impaired in TLR2 deficient primary neurons. Moreover, morphine treatment failed to induce an increased level of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2) in TLR2 deficient primary neurons, suggesting an involvement of GSK3\u03b2 in morphine-mediated TLR2 signaling. These results thus demonstrate that opioids prime neurons to undergo apoptosis by inducing TLR2 expression.

Two such antagonists, BIBN4096BS and MK-0974, have shown great promise in clinical trials and hence a deeper understanding of the mechanism of their interaction with the receptor is now required. The structure of the CGRP receptor is unusual since it is comprised of a hetero-oligomeric complex between the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRL) and an accessory protein (RAMP1). Both the CLR and RAMP1 components have extracellular domains which interact with each other and together form part of the peptide-binding site. It seems likely that the antagonist binding site will also be located on the extracellular domains and indeed Trp-74 of RAMP1 has been shown to form part of the binding site for BIBN4096BS. However, despite a chimeric study demonstrating the role of the N-terminal domain of CLR in antagonist binding, no specific residues have been identified. Here we carry out a mutagenic screen of the extreme N-terminal domain of CLR (residues 23\u201363) and identify a mutant, Met-42-Ala, which displays 48-fold lower affinity for BIBN4096BS and almost 900-fold lower affinity for MK-0974. In addition, we confirm that the Trp-74-Lys mutation at human RAMP1 reduces BIBN4096BS affinity by over 300-fold and show for the first time a similar effect for MK-0974 affinity. The data suggest that the non-peptide antagonists occupy a binding site close to the interface of the N-terminal domains of CLR and RAMP1.",

To better understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling adhesion formation and uptake and the use of these complexes by Staphylococcus aureus, the primary etiologic agent in sepsis, bacteremia and endocarditis, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition by simvastatin. In response to simvastatin, adhesion complexes diminished as well as \u03b21 trafficking to the plasma membrane required to initiate adhesion formation. Simvastatin stimulated CDC42 activation and coupling to p85, a small-guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP), yet sequestered CDC42 coupled to p85 within the cytosol. Loss of p85 GAP activity through use of genetic strategies decreased host cell invasion as well as \u03b21 trafficking. From these findings, we propose a mechanism whereby p85 GAP activity localized within membrane compartments facilitates \u03b21 trafficking.

In the present study, to better understand the epigenetic regulation mechanism responsible for the repression of hTERT by TSA, we examined expression of hTERT in the HCT116 colon cancer cell line after treatment with TSA and performed site-specific CpG methylation analysis of the hTERT promoter.

ChIP analysis revealed that TSA-induced demethylation of the 31st\u201333rd CpGs promoted CTCF binding on hTERT promoter, leading to repression of hTERT.

Deficiency of HCS results in decreased activity of these carboxylases and affects various metabolic processes. Despite the importance of this enzyme, the recognition mechanism of the biotinoyl domain by human HCS (hHCS) has remained unclear. We have developed a method to express hHCS in the baculovirus system and used it to purify catalytically active, full-length hHCS. NMR experiments on the biotinoyl domains from acetyl-CoA carboxylase indicate that when hHCS is added, it recognizes the MKM motif in human and in Escherichia coli with a preference to the human biotinoyl domain. In addition, hHCS can biotinylate the biotinoyl domains from human and E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase at similar rates compared to the E. coli biotin protein ligase, BirA, which reacts very slowly with the human biotinoyl domain. We propose that the hHCS has greater substrate acceptability, while the BirA has higher substrate specificity.

We recently characterized iron-dependent toxic \u03b1-syn oligomer species by confocal single molecule fluorescence techniques and used this aggregation model to identify several N\u2032-benzylidene-benzohydrazide (NBB) derivatives inhibiting oligomer formation in vitro. In our current work, we used the bioluminescent protein-fragment complementation assay (BPCA) to directly analyze the formation of toxic \u03b1-syn oligomers in cell culture and to investigate the effect of iron and potential drug-like compounds in living cells. Similar to our previous findings in vitro, we found a converse modulation of toxic \u03b1-syn oligomers by NBB derivates and ferric iron, which was characterized by an increase in aggregate formation by iron and an inhibitory effect of certain NBB compounds. Inhibition of \u03b1-syn oligomer formation by the NBB compound 293G02 was paralleled by a reduction in cytotoxicity indicating that toxic \u03b1-syn oligomers are present in the BPCA cell culture model and that pharmacological inhibition of oligomer formation can reduce toxicity.

We recruited 748 Chinese IS patients diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 24\u00a0h of symptom onset and 748 normal healthy controls from two ethnic populations and performed two case\u2013control studies in order to assess the nature of the polymorphisms of IL-6 and any links with IS. Common polymorphic loci in the IL-6 gene promoter were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between IL-6 genotypes and a diagnosis of IS. We found that the C allele frequency at the -174 promoter region of IL-6 was extremely low in both IS patients and controls in both ethnic groups. The G allele of the promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) G-572C was more common in IS subjects than controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004, corrected for multiple testing) in the Han population but not in the Uyghur population. GC carriage therefore increased the risk of IS in the Han ethnic group (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13\u20131.86). In addition, the differences in GG and GC frequency between the two ethnic populations were significant. The C allele frequency at the -174 promoter region of IL-6 was rare in Chinese IS patients and controls from either ethnic group.

Comparative sequence analysis of the full-length Mcl-1 and Mcl-1V cDNAs suggested that Mcl-1V mRNA results from splicing within the first coding exon of Mcl-1 gene at a non-canonical donor\u2013acceptor pair. MCL-1V lacks 46 amino acid residues within the N-terminal region of MCL-1. It localizes in mitochondria and inhibits anoxia- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis as potent as MCL-1, and decayed less rapidly than MCL-1 in the cells undergoing apoptosis. Collectively, our results show that mouse cells ubiquitously express antiapoptotic MCL-1V that may play a role in mitochondrial cell death.",

Their distribution patterns and significance in pediatric leukemias have not been established. Here we investigated the expression of P2X receptors in BMMC samples from Chinese pediatric acute leukemias. Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed that P2X1, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 receptors were simultaneously over expressed in leukemias compared with controls, whereas P2X2, P2X3 and P2X6 were absent or marginally expressed in both groups. It was worth noting that the co-expression feature of them, especially between P2X4 and P2X7, could be observed and the highest expression of P2X7 was detected in relapsed patients. Moreover, concomitant decrease of P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 expressions was observed at CR stage in a follow-up study. Functional P2X7 was also verified. These results suggested that P2X1, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X7 were hematopoiesis-related P2X receptors, and their signaling, especially for P2X7, might play important roles in pediatric leukemias. P2X receptors might co-operatively contribute to the malignant phenotype in human pediatric leukemias.",

     "abstract": "In Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the absence of functional Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) translates into chronic bacterial infection, excessive inflammation, tissue damage, impaired lung function and eventual death. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this vicious circle of inflammation is key to better therapies for CF. In this manuscript, we have found that the presence of IL-17 in the airways of CF patients not only exacerbates inflammation through the recruitment of neutrophils via secretion of CXCL8, but also by priming airway epithelial cells lacking functional CFTR to increase response to the bacterial sensor NOD1. IL-17 stimulation of airway epithelial cells (AECs) lacking functional CFTR increased the expression of NOD1, NOD2, TLR4 and its own receptors IL-17RA and IL-17RC. Moreover, prior stimulation of AECs expressing the CFTR\u0394F508 mutant with IL-17 showed much greater CXCL8 secretion in response to a NOD1 agonist and Pseudomonas aeruginosa diffusible material. Taken together our results show that IL-17 primes AECs expressing CFTR\u0394F508 to increase host defence response to bacteria through the up-regulation of PRRs, and in particular of NOD1, and identifies another mechanism of action through which the CFTR\u0394F508 mutation leads to increase inflammation in response to bacterial ligands. Therefore preventing IL-17 function in CF may prove an important strategy in decreasing lung inflammation due to both direct and indirect effects.",

Overexpression of Tau variants caused loss of notal bristles, and the phenotype was used for evaluating toxicity of ectopic Tau. The bristle loss phenotype was found to be highly associated with the toxicity of hyperphosphoryled Tau in flies. We have shown that the bristle loss phenotype can be rescued either by reducing Glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2)/Shaggy (Sgg) activity or overexpressing B\u03b22 regulatory subunits of PP2A. Elevated expression of the Drosophila B\u03b22 homolog, Twins (Tws), also alleviated neuritic dystrophy of the dorsal arborization (da) neuron caused by Tau aggregation. Additionally, lowering endogenous Tau dosage was beneficial as it ameliorated the bristle loss phenotype. Finally, the bristle loss phenotype was used to evaluate the efficacy of potential therapeutic compounds. The GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor, alsterpaullone, was found to suppress toxicity of Tau in a concentration-dependent manner. The notum of Drosophila, thus, provides a new tool and insights into Tau-induced toxicity. It could also potentially assist in screening new drugs for possible therapeutic intervention.",

There is a direct correlation between disease severity and SMN2 copy number. Mice do not have a Smn2 gene, and thus cannot naturally replicate the disorder. However, two murine models of SMA have been generated using SMN2-BAC transgenic mice bred onto a mutant Smn background. In these instances mice die shortly after birth, have variable phenotypes within the same litter, or completely correct the SMA phenotype. Both models have been imported to The Jackson Laboratory for distribution to the research community. To ensure that similar results are obtained after importation to The Jackson Laboratory to what was originally reported in the literature, we have begun a molecular and phenotypic evaluation of these mouse models. Here we report our findings for the SMA mouse model that has been deposited by the Li group from Taiwan. These mice, JAX stock number TJL-005058, are homozygous for the SMN2 transgene, Tg(SMN2)2Hung, and a targeted Smn allele that lacks exon 7, Smn1tm1Hung. Our findings are consistent with those reported originally for this line and clarify some of the original data. In addition, we have cloned and mapped the integration site for Tg(SMN2)2Hung to Chromosome 4, and provide a simple genotyping assay that is specific to the junction fragment. Finally, based upon the survival data from our genetic crosses, we suggest that this underused SMA model may be a useful compliment or alternative to the more commonly used \u201cdelta7\u201d SMA mouse. We provide breeding schemes in which two genotypes of mice can be generated so that 50% of the litter will be SMA-like pups while 50% will be controls.",

Similar results were obtained in vitro in J-774A.1 macrophage-like cell line incubated with high (30\u00a0mM) vs. low (5\u00a0mM) glucose concentrations. Accordingly, association and internalization of HDL to MPM from diabetic mice, or to J-774A.1 macrophages grown under diabetic conditions was significantly higher compared to control cells. Unexpectedly, however, increased macrophage SR-BI expression was associated with a substantial reduction in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages. Moreover, total cellular cholesterol content was increased by 28% in macrophages incubated with HDL under high glucose concentrations, compared to low glucose concentrations. This effect was abolished by a rabbit polyclonal anti-SR-BI, which blocks binding to the receptor, or alternatively by using BLT1, a specific inhibitor of lipid transport via the SR-BI.Diabetes stimulates the expression of SR-BI in macrophages and leads to a shift in its activity from HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux to HDL-mediated cholesterol influx.

NELL2-Tsp uses an alternate stop codon resulting in a C-terminal truncated form of NELL2, containing a signal peptide and a TSP-N domain. NELL2-Tsp is a glycosylated protein specifically expressed in brain tissue. NELL2-Tsp and NELL2 are secreted, likely due to the putative signal peptide. However, due to the truncation, the secreted portion of NELL2-Tsp is smaller than that of NELL2. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that NELL2-Tsp was able to associate with NELL2 and with itself. In addition, expression of NELL2-Tsp notably reduced secretion of NELL2 and inhibited NELL2-mediated neurite outgrowth. These results suggest that NELL2-Tsp may act as a negative regulator of wild-type NELL2.",

Although viral, dietary and genetic factors have been implicated in NPC, the molecular basis of its pathogenesis is not well defined. Based on a recent microRNA (miRNA) microarray study showing miR-200 downregulation in NPC, we further investigated the role of miR-200a in NPC carcinogenesis. We found that the endogenous miR-200a expression level increases with the degree of differentiation in a panel of NPC cell lines, namely undifferentiated C666-1, high-differentiated CNE-1, and low-differentiated CNE-2 and HNE1 cells. By a series of gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we showed that over-expression of miR-200a inhibits C666-1 cell growth, migration and invasion, whereas its knock-down stimulates these processes in CNE-1 cells. In addition, we further identified ZEB2 and CTNNB1 as the functional downstream targets of miR-200a. Interestingly, knock-down of ZEB2 solely impeded NPC cell migration and invasion, whereas CTNNB1 suppression only inhibited NPC cell growth, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of miR-200a on NPC cell growth, migration and invasion are mediated by distinct targets and pathways. Our results reveal the important role of miR-200a as a regulatory factor of NPC carcinogenesis and a potential candidate for miRNA-based therapy against NPC.",

Furthermore, SB203580 blocked stretch-induced NF-\u03baB activation during myogenesis, not through down-regulation of degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, and consequent translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus.

In the current work, we assessed the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of the class Ia PI3Ks, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b4, on bone cell growth, differentiation and function in vitro. Each of the class Ia PI3K isoforms is expressed and functionally active in bone cells. No consistent effects of inhibitors of p110-\u03b2 or p110-\u03b4 on bone cells were observed. Inhibitors of p110-\u03b1 decreased osteoclastogenesis by 60\u201380% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 vs control) by direct actions on osteoclast precursors, and decreased the resorptive activity of mature osteoclasts by 60% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 vs control).
