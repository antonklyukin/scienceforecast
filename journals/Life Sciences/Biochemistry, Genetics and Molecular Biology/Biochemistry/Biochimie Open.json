     "abstract": "Animals and humans are exposed each day to a multitude of chemicals in the air, water and food. They have developed a battery of enzymes and transporters that facilitate the biotransformation and elimination of these compounds. Moreover, a majority of these enzymes and transporters are inducible due to the activation of xenobiotic receptors which act as transcription factors for the regulation of their target genes (such as xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, see below \u00a74 for the AhR). These receptors include several members of the nuclear/steroid receptor family (CAR for Constitutive Androstane Receptor, PXR for Pregnane X Receptor) but also the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor or AhR, a member of the bHLH-PAS family (basic Helix-Loop-Helix - Period/ARNT/Single minded). In addition to the regulation of xenobiotic metabolism, numerous alternative functions have been characterized for the AhR since its discovery. These alternative functions will be described in this review along with its endogenous functions as revealed by experiments performed on knock-out animals.",

     "abstract": "An infectious retroviral particle contains 1000\u20131500 molecules of the nucleocapsid protein (NC) that cover the diploid RNA genome. NC is a small zinc finger protein that possesses nucleic acid chaperone activity that enables NC to rearrange DNA and RNA molecules into the most thermodynamically stable structures usually those containing the maximum number of base pairs. Thanks to the chaperone activity, NC plays an essential role in reverse transcription of the retroviral genome by facilitating the strand transfer reactions of this process. In addition, these reactions are involved in recombination events that can generate multiple drug resistance mutations in the presence of anti-HIV-1 drugs. The strand transfer reactions rely on base pairing of folded DNA/RNA structures. The molecular mechanisms responsible for NC-mediated strand transfer reactions are presented and discussed in this review. Antiretroviral strategies targeting the NC-mediated strand transfer events are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Vanadate, a protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor which elicits insulin-like effects, has previously been shown to inhibit expression of the insulin receptor gene at the transcriptional level in rat hepatoma cells. In an attempt to identify the DNA sequence and transcription factors potentially involved in this effect, a fragment of the proximal 5\u2032flanking region of the IR gene (\u22121143/\u2212252 upstream the ATG codon) has been cloned and functionally characterized. RNase protection allowed the identification of several transcription start sites in the conserved region of the gene, among which two major sites at \u2212455 and \u2212396. Upon fusion to the luciferase gene and transient transfection into hepatoma cells, the \u22121143/\u2212252 fragment showed promoter activity. This was unaffected by deletion of the \u22121143/\u2212761 sequence, but markedly decreased (90%) by additional deletion of the \u2212760/\u2212465 sequence. Treatment of hepatoma cells with vanadate led to a dose-dependent decrease in promoter activity of the 1143/\u2212252, \u2212760/\u2212252 and \u2212464/\u2212252 constructs (change relative to untreated cells, 40, 55 and 23% at 125\u00a0\u03bcM, and 70, 85 and 62% at 250\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). These data suggest that although the entire DNA sequence upstream the transcription start sites is probably involved in vanadate-induced inhibition, the short sequence downstream of position \u2212464 and is sufficient for inhibition. Potential targets of vanadate are the transcription factors FoxO1 and HMGA1, two downstream targets of the insulin signaling pathway which have been shown to mediate the inhibitory effect of insulin on IR gene expression.",

     "abstract": "Herbal drugs, on which 80% of the world's population rely, are relatively safe over conventional drugs. Conventional drugs are costly, have serious side effects and hence over the past few decades researchers have focused on drug discovery from herbal medicines or botanical sources. The majority of new herbal drugs have been generated from secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids and phenolic compounds) of plant metabolism. Till date, only a small fraction of the vast diversity of plant metabolism has been explored for the production of new medicines and other products. The emergence of new herbal genomics research, medicinal plant genomics consortium, together with advances in other omics information may help for the speedy discovery of previously unknown metabolic pathways and enzymes. This review highlights the importance of genomics research in the discovery of some previously unknown enzymes/pathways which may make significant contributions in plant metabolic biology and may be used for the future discovery of many new pharmaceutical agents.",

     "abstract": "Production of isoprostanes (IsoPs) is enhanced after acute, intense, and prolonged exercise, in untrained subjects. This effect is greater in older subjects. The present study aims to delineate the profile of acute-exercise-induced IsoPs levels in young and older endurance-trained subjects.All included subjects were male, young (n\u00a0=\u00a06; 29\u00a0yrs\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7) or older (n\u00a0=\u00a06; 63.7\u00a0yrs\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3), and competitors. The kinetics of F2-IsoPs in blood-sera was assessed at rest, for the maximal aerobic exercise power (MAP) corresponding to the cardio-respiratory fitness index and after a 30-min recovery period.No significant time effect on F2-IsoPs kinetics was identified in young subjects. However, in older athletes, F2-IsoPs blood-concentrations at the MAP were higher than at rest, whereas these blood-concentrations did not differ between rest and after the 30-min recovery period.Because plasma glutathione (GSH) promotes the formation of some F2-IsoPs, we suggest that the surprising decrease in F2-IsoPs levels in older subjects would be caused by decreased GSH under major ROS production in older subjects. We argue that the assessment F2-IsoPs in plasma as biomarkers of the aging process should be challenged by exercise to improve the assessment of the functional response against reactive oxygen species in older subjects.",

     "abstract": "Plant essential oils (EOs) are known to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi. Whether these antimicrobial effects are comparable to synthetic household products is less clear. Furthermore, limited research is available on the potential additive effect of blending EOs. In this investigation, a new EO blend containing orange, patchouli, peppermint, and clary sage was compared to its individual single oils and to three household products\u2013air freshener, liquid soap, and body spray\u2013for their ability to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudonomas aeruginosa, and Aspergillus brasiliensis in the disc-diffusion assay. The new EO blend significantly inhibited the growth of the four microorganisms. The zones of inhibition of new EO blend were greater than the air freshener and similar to the liquid soap and body spray, with the exception of Str. pneumoniae in which the body spray provided greater inhibitory zone. The new EO blend and the single oils, with the exception of peppermint, equally inhibited the growth of S. aureus and Str. pneumoniae suggesting no additive effect. P. aeruginosa and A. brasiliensis showed variable susceptibility to all EOs except for no susceptibility to orange and limonene. No difference was found between (\u2212) and (+)-limonene; whereas, (+)-menthol showed greater effect than (\u2212)-menthol. In conclusion, blending the EO of orange, patchouli, peppermint, and clary sage was beneficial in inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, Str. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, and A. brasiliensis providing a natural antimicrobial fragrance option over synthetics fragrances used in soaps, body sprays, and air fresheners.",

     "abstract": "Research on the biological effects of essential oils on human skin cells is scarce. In the current study, we primarily explored the biological activities of 10 essential oils (nine single and one blend) in a pre-inflamed human dermal fibroblast system that simulated chronic inflammation. We measured levels of proteins critical for inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes. The nine single oils were distilled from Citrus bergamia (bergamot), Coriandrum sativum (cilantro), Pelargonium graveolens (geranium), Helichrysum italicum (helichrysum), Pogostemon cablin (patchouli), Citrus aurantium (petitgrain), Santalum album (sandalwood), Nardostachys jatamansi (spikenard), and Cananga odorata (ylang ylang). The essential oil blend (commercial name Immortelle) is composed of oils from frankincense, Hawaiian sandalwood, lavender, myrrh, helichrysum, and rose. All the studied oils were significantly anti-proliferative against these cells. Furthermore, bergamot, cilantro, and spikenard essential oils primarily inhibited protein molecules related to inflammation, immune responses, and tissue-remodeling processes, suggesting they have anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. Helichrysum and ylang ylang essential oils, as well as Immortelle primarily inhibited tissue remodeling-related proteins, suggesting a wound healing property. The data are consistent with the results of existing studies examining these oils in other models and suggest that the studied oils may be promising therapeutic candidates. Further research into their biological mechanisms of action is recommended. The differential effects of these essential oils suggest that they exert activities by different mechanisms or pathways, warranting further investigation. The chemical composition of these oils was analyzed using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry.",

     "abstract": "Studies show that the continuous consumption of fructose can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and steatohepatitis. We aimed to investigate the role of Metformin in an animal model of liver injury caused by fructose intake, focusing on the molecular markers of lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, and antioxidant defenses. Male three months old C57BL/6 mice were divided into control group (C) and fructose group (F, 47% fructose), maintained for ten weeks. After, the groups received Metformin or vehicle for a further eight weeks: control (C), control\u00a0+\u00a0Metformin (CM), fructose (F), and fructose\u00a0+\u00a0Metformin (FM). Fructose resulted in hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and lower insulin sensitivity in association with higher mRNA levels of proteins linked with de novo lipogenesis and increased lipid peroxidation. Fructose diminished mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes, and of proteins responsible for mitochondrial biogenesis. Metformin reduced de novo lipogenesis and increased the expression of proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby increasing beta-oxidation and decreasing lipid peroxidation. Also, Metformin upregulated the expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes, providing a defense against increased reactive oxygen species generation. Therefore, a significant reduction in triglyceride accumulation in the liver, steatosis and lipid peroxidation was observed in the FM group. In conclusion, fructose increases de novo lipogenesis, reduces the antioxidant defenses, and diminishes mitochondrial biogenesis. After an extended period of fructose intake, Metformin treatment, even in continuing the fructose intake, can reverse, at least partially, the liver injury and prevents NAFLD progression to more severe states.",

Exosomes containing proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs are important in intracellular communication and immune function. Exosomes from different sources are usually obtained by combination of centrifugation and ultracentrifugation and according to published data can contain from a few dozens to thousands of different proteins. Crude exosome preparations from milk of eighteen horses were obtained for the first time using several standard centrifugations. Exosome preparations were additionally purified by FPLC gel filtration. Individual preparations demonstrated different profiles of gel filtration showing well or bad separation of exosome peaks and one or two peaks of co-isolating proteins and their complexes. According to the electron microscopy, well purified exosomes displayed a typical exosome-like size (30\u2013100\u00a0nm) and morphology. It was shown\u00a0that exosomes may have several different biological functions, but detection of their biological functions may vary significantly depending on the presence of exosome contaminating proteins and proteins directly into exosomes. Exosome proteins were identified before and after gel filtration by MALDI MS and MS/MS spectrometry of protein tryptic hydrolyzates derived by SDS PAGE and 2D electrophoresis. The results of protein identification were unexpected: one or two peaks co-isolating proteins after gel-filtration mainly contained kappa-, beta-, alpha-S1-caseins and its precursors, but these proteins were not found in well-purified exosomes. Well-purified exosomes contained from five to eight different major proteins: CD81, CD63 receptors, beta-lactoglobulin and lactadherin were common to all preparations, while actin, butyrophilin, lactoferrin, and xanthine dehydrogenase were found only in some of them.The article describes the morphology and the protein content of major horse milk exosomes for the first time.

     "abstract": "Many basic science questions remain regarding protein functions in the pathogen: host interaction, especially in the trunk disease fungi family, the Botryosphaeriaceae, which are a global problem for economically important plants, especially fruiting trees. Proteomics is a highly useful technology for studying protein expression and for discovering novel proteins in unsequenced and poorly annotated organisms. Current fungal proteomics approaches involve 2D SDS-PAGE and extensive, complex, protein extraction methodologies. In this work, a modified Folch extraction was applied to protein extraction to perform both de novo peptide sequencing and peptide fragmentation analysis/protein identification of the plant and human fungal pathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Both bioinformatics approaches yielded novel peptide sequences from proteins produced by L. theobromae in the presence of exogenous triglycerides and glucose. These proteins and the functions they may possess could be targeted for further functional characterization and validation efforts, due to their potential uses in biotechnology and as new paradigms for understanding fungal biochemistry, such as the finding of allergenic enolases, as well as various novel proteases, including zinc metalloproteinases homologous to those found in snake venom. This work contributes to genomic annotation efforts, which, hand in hand with genomic sequencing, will help improve fungal bioinformatics databases for future studies of Botryosphaeriaceae.

Following the intrinsic fluorescence of the tag, we have determined that the subcellular localization of these enzymes is in the endoplasmic reticulum, upon expression in HeLa cells. The presence of the tag at either end of the polypeptide chain can affect protein expression and, in the case of trans enoyl-CoA reductase, it induces the formation of protein aggregates.",

For this purpose, 50 Sprague\u2013Dawley male rats were randomly assigned into 5 groups: (1) control group (CON, n\u00a0=\u00a010), (2) sham (S, n\u00a0=\u00a010), (3) endurance training (ET, n\u00a0=\u00a010), (4) endurance training\u00a0+\u00a0vitamin E (ET\u00a0+\u00a0VE, n\u00a0=\u00a010), (5) vitamin E (VE, n\u00a0=\u00a010). Endurance training protocol was implemented for 6 weeks, 6 days per week, in accordance with the overload principle. To measure expression changes of p53 and PTEN genes in rats' prostate, real-time PCR method was used and HPLC method was used to measure vitamin E in this tissue. After 6 weeks of taking vitamin E, its level in all groups, except for group VE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000) did not significantly increase. After implementing training protocol, p53 expression reduced significantly in ET group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.026). Vitamin E supplementation along with endurance training did not cause any significant change either p53 or PTEN (respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.11). Instead, vitamin E supplementation without endurance training caused significant increase in PTEN, but did not cause any significant changes in p53 (respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.016, p\u00a0<\u00a00.15). These results indicate that endurance training reduces p53 and PTEN tumor suppressing genes expression, and taking vitamin E supplement could increase expression of these genes in some extent.",

However, to date, no validated biomarker are available to quantify this phenomena. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of a specific index combining plasma albumin and weight change to detect nutrition-related risks of fatigue increase and under-performance in athletes experiencing particular nutritional conditions.An athlete's nutrition risk index (ANRI) equation, based on data from lightweight and heavyweight rowers, was developed using relationship between plasma albumin concentrations combined to weight changes with sport performance and overtraining scores and was tested by odds ratio for failure. The accuracy and sensitivity of this former specific equation was subsequently tested on runners observing the Ramadan-fasting as well as on boxers after a short weight-loss period.Independently of training and performance, lightweight rowers presented lower nutritional parameters than heavyweight (albumin: 37.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7 vs 39.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0g\u00b7L\u22121, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; weight state: 94.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 vs 99.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In lightweight, ANRI was related with overtraining score (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.21, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), risks for failure in competition were enhanced when ANRI increased (OR:2.5, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

Because apical and basolateral membranes are only found in differentiated epithelial cells, genes critical for differential targeting may be specifically up-regulated upon MDCK cell differentiation. To search for these genes, a cross-species screening strategy was used. We first analyzed the human microarray data for protein trafficking-related genes that were up-regulated in colon carcinoma Caco2 cells upon differentiation. The results of mouse 44K gene expression microarray analysis were then used to extract additional candidate genes that showed higher expression in normal colon epithelium compared to primary embryonic fibroblasts. Finally, NCBI genomic sequence information was used to design RT-PCR primers for 13 candidate and 10 negative control genes and used to analyze MDCK cells at 2, 13 and 17 days after seeding. To determine whether the gene up-regulation was specific in epithelial differentiation, we also performed RT-PCR on rat non-differentiating intestinal IEC-6\u00a0cells and mouse C2C12\u00a0cells, a differentiating myoblast model. Of the 13 candidate genes, 3 genes, SDCBP2, KIF12, KIF27, met\u00a0all criteria of specific up-regulation in differentiated MDCK cells. In addition, KIF13A showed up-regulation in differentiated MDCK and C2C12\u00a0cells but not in IEC-6\u00a0cells cultured for the same duration. The functions of these genes need to be analyzed in the future. This cross-species screening strategy may be useful for other non-human, non-rodent cell models.",

Among these, dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) is well known for its capacity to induce mammary carcinomas in female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Ovariectomy suppresses the susceptibility of this model to DMBA, thus suggesting that the inducible action of the carcinogen depends on ovarian hormones. The promotion of DMBA-induced adenocarcinoma is accompanied by a series of neuroendocrine disruptions of both Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Gonadal (HPG) and Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axes and of the secretion of melatonin during the latency period of 2 months that precedes the occurrence of the first mammary tumor. The present review analyses the various neuroendocrine disruptions that occur along the HPG and the HPA axes, and the marked inhibitory effect of the carcinogen on melatonin secretion. The possible relationships between the neuroendocrine disruptions, which essentially consist in an increased pre-ovulatory secretion of 17\u03b2-estradiol and prolactin, associated with a marked reduction of melatonin secretion, and the decrease in gene expression of the receptors for aryl-hydrocarbons receptor (AhR) and 17\u03b2-estradiol (ER\u03b1; ER\u03b2) are also discussed.",

Analyses were carried out on the MocR sequences taken from the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria. The results suggest that MocR linkers display phylum-specific characteristics and unique features different from those already described for other classes of inter-domain linkers. They show an average length significantly higher: 31.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3 residues reaching a maximum of about 150 residues. Compositional propensities displayed general and phylum-specific trends. Pro is dominating in all linkers. Dyad propensity analysis indicate Pro\u2013Pro as the most frequent amino acid pair in all linkers. Physicochemical properties of the linker regions were assessed using amino acid indices relative to different features: in general, MocR linkers are flexible, hydrophilic and display propensity for \u03b2-turn or coil conformations. Linker sequences are hypervariable: only similarities between MocR linkers from organisms related at the level of species or genus could be found with sequence searches.

The NURR1 cDNA was RT-PCR cloned using NURR1-specific oligonucleotide primers derived from in silico sequences. The porcine NURR1 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 598 amino acids, displaying a very high similarity with bovine, human and mouse (99%) NURR1 protein. Expression analysis revealed a differential NURR1 mRNA expression in various organs and tissues. NURR1 transcripts could be detected as early as at 60 days of embryo development in different brain tissues. A significant increase in NURR1 transcript in the cerebellum and a decrease in NURR1 transcript in the basal ganglia was observed during embryo development. The porcine NURR1 gene was mapped to chromosome 15. Two missense mutations were found in exon 3, the first coding exon of NURR1. Methylation analysis of the porcine NURR1 gene body revealed a high methylation degree in brain tissue, whereas methylation of the promoter was very low. A decrease in DNA methylation in a discrete region of the NURR1 promoter was observed in pig frontal cortex during pig embryo development. This observation correlated with an increase in NURR1 transcripts. Therefore, methylation might be a determinant of NURR1 expression at certain time points in embryo development.",

Finally, we have analyzed the effect of GTPs on the levels of Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP)-9/2, whose expression is up-regulated by TNF-\u03b1 or LPS.Our results indicated that the pre-treatment with GTPs was able to reduce MMP-9/2 expression at both protein and enzyme activity levels in the conditioned media of TNF-\u03b1 or LPS stimulated MKN-28 cells.In conclusion, our results demonstrated that green tea polyphenol extract reduces the invasiveness of gastric MKN-28 cancer cells through the reduction of TNF-\u03b1 or LPS induced MMP-9/2 up-regulation. Therefore, these data support the hypothesis that GTPs could exert a protective role against the metastatic process in gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Estrogen receptor (ER) antagonists such as tamoxifen (Tam) have been used successfully to treat ER+ breast cancers for more than 30 years. Unfortunately, long term use of Tam can result in resistance. Tam resistance is associated with the activation of growth factor signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation and survival. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), is up-regulated in Tam resistant (Tam-R) cells. Previous studies have reported that the flavanone, naringenin (Nar) can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in ER+ breast cancer cells. Furthermore, Nar has been shown to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathways in MCF-7\u00a0cells. In this report we investigated whether inhibition of MAPK alone is mediating the effects of Nar on cell proliferation and viability. These studies will determine the mechanism of action of Nar. Tam-R MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with Nar or U0126, a MAPK kinase inhibitor. Our studies show that while both U0126 and Nar impaired cell proliferation and viability the combination of U0126 and Nar resulted in greater inhibition of cell viability than either compound alone. It has been previously reported that Nar can bind the ER. Our lab has also shown that Nar localizes ER\u03b1 to a peri-nuclear region of the cell. Confocal microscopy revealed that in U0126 treated cells ER\u03b1 displayed an even distribution across the cytoplasm as seen in untreated Tam-R cells. These studies suggest that MAPK is not the only target of Nar.",

     "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in patients with breast cancer. In triple-negative breast cancer, high recurrence rates, increased invasive capacity of cells, and their aggressive ability to metastasize at secondary sites dictate patient survival. The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) plays a critical role in controlling the metastatic potential of these cells. Its activity results in an elevation of intracellular pH and in extracellular acidification, a key step in the establishment of the tumor microenvironment. Here, we describe assays for characterization of Na+/H+ exchanger activity and its related downstream physiological effects on triple-negative breast cancer cells. Na+/H+ exchanger activity can be routinely and rapidly measured in live cells with a fluorometric assay that assesses changes in intracellular pH. Characterization of downstream cell effector function as a result of Na+/H+ exchanger activation can be evaluated by measuring directed cell migration and invasion. Cell migration is assessed with wound-healing assays, where a gap is introduced in a confluent monolayer of cells and the rate of gap closure is measured over time. Cell invasion is assessed in the short-term by transwell invasion assays that track cell movement through an extracellular matrix. Long-term invasiveness, growth and proliferation can be assessed with 3-D invasion assays using transwell inserts fitted with specialized scaffolds optimized for 3-D cell culture. Taken together these assays provide powerful tools for testing the effects of altering Na+/H+ exchanger activity with chemical inhibition on the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Recently, it has been recognized that, much like an electric current in an electric circuit, dynamic disruptions from flexible, unstructured regions distal to the active region are transferred through the contact network to the active site and influence protein stability and/or function. As transmembrane proteins frequently possess the \u03b2-barrel structure, studies of proteins with this topology are required. The unstructured lid segments of the \u03b2-barrel GFP protein are conserved and could play a role in the backbone stabilization required for chromophore function. A study of the disordered C-terminus and the function within the lid is necessary. In this study, we entirely truncated the flexible C-terminal tail and investigated the N-terminal Strep-tagged GFP by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the temperature- and GdnHCl-induced unfolding by circular dichroism. The introduction of the unstructured Strep-tag itself changed the unfolding pathway. Truncating the entire flexible tail did not decrease the fluorescence intensity to a large extent; however, the protein stability changed dramatically. The temperature for half-denaturation T1/2 changed significantly from 79\u00a0\u00b0C for the wild-type to 72.8\u00a0\u00b0C for the mutant. Unfolding kinetics at different temperatures have been induced by 4\u00a0M GdnHCl, and the apparent Arrhenius activation energy decreased by 40% as compared to the wild-type.",

The TaCypA-1 possesses peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity that catalyses cis to trans isomerization of the peptidyl prolyl bonds, a rate limiting step in protein folding. Expression of deleted mutants of TaCypA-1, that lacked PPIase activity, resulted in abrogation of thermotolerance, providing the first evidence that this activity plays a key role in stress tolerance of cells and can be exploited for industrial applications. Further, we also demonstrate that TaCypA-1 interacts with calmodulin (CaM), and the CaM-binding domain is localized to amino acid residues 51\u201371 in the N-terminus region.",

     "abstract": "An enzyme, O-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OASTL), also known as O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase or cysteine synthase (CSase), catalyses the incorporation of sulfide into O-acetylserine and produces cysteine. We previously identified a cDNA encoding an OASTL-like protein from Spinacia oleracea, (SoCSaseLP), but a recombinant SoCSaseLP produced in Escherichia coli did not show OASTL activity. The exon-intron structure of the SoCSaseLP gene shared conserved structures with other spinach OASTL genes. The SoCSaseLP and a Beta vulgaris homologue protein, KMT13462, comprise a unique clade in the phylogenetic tree of the OASTL family. Interestingly, when the SoCSaseLP gene was expressed in tobacco plants, total OASTL activity in tobacco leaves was reduced. This reduction in total OASTL activity was most likely caused by interference by SoCSaseLP with cytosolic OASTL. To investigate the possible interaction of SoCSaseLP with a spinach cytosolic OASTL isoform SoCSaseA, a pull-down assay was carried out. The recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SoCSaseLP fusion protein was expressed in E. coli together with the histidine-tagged SoCSaseA protein, and the protein extract was subjected to glutathione affinity chromatography. The histidine-tagged SoCSaseA was co-purified with the GST-SoCSaseLP fusion protein, indicating the binding of SoCSaseLP to SoCSaseA. Consistent with this interaction, the OASTL activity of the co-purified SoCSaseA was reduced compared with the activity of SoCSaseA that was purified on its own. These results strongly suggest that SoCSaseLP negatively regulates the activity of other cytosolic OASTL family members by direct interaction.",

Despite some heavy metals are required for plant growth and development, others are considered toxic elements and do not play any known physiological role in plant cells. Elevated doses of Cd or Cu cause toxicity in plants and generate damages due to the stress condition and eventually cause a significant reduction in quantity and quality of crop plants. The nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is reported to alleviate the toxicity of some heavy metals like Cd and Cu. In the current study, the role of NO in alleviating stresses of Cd and Cu was investigated in in\u00a0vitro-grown tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Based on plant growth, total chlorophyll contents, contents and activities of rubisco and rubisco activase. According to the results of this study, the growth and total chlorophyll contents of Cd/Cu stressed plants were hugely decreased in the absence of SNP, while the supplementation of SNP resulted in a significant increase of both fresh weight and total chlorophyll contents. Remarkable reductions of Rubisco and rubisco activase contents and activities were observed in Cd and Cu-induced plants. SNP supplementation showed the highest contents and activities of rubisco and rubisco activase compared to the control and Cu/Cd-stressed plants. Taken together, our findings suggest that SNP could play a protective role in regulation of plant responses to abiotic stresses such as Cd and Cu by enhancing Rubisco and Rubisco activase.",

The TAL1 transcription factor is also an important player of this latter process and is expressed very early in the myeloid and erythroid lineages. We previously established a link between TGF-\u03b21 signaling and TAL1 by showing that the cytokine was able to induce its proteolytic degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. In this manuscript we show that TAL1 interacts with SMAD3 that acts in the pathway downstream of TGF-\u03b21 association with its receptor. TAL1 expression strengthens the positive or negative effect of SMAD3 on various genes. Both transcription factors activate the inhibitory SMAD7 factor through the E box motif present in its transcriptional promoter. DNA precipitation assays showed that TAL1 present in Jurkat or K562 cells binds to this SMAD binding element in a SMAD3 dependent manner. SMAD3 and TAL1 also inhibit several genes including ID1, hTERT and TGF-\u03b21 itself. In this latter case TAL1 and SMAD3 can impair the positive effect exerted by E47. Our results indicate that TAL1 expression can modulate TGF-\u03b21 signaling by interacting with SMAD3 and by increasing its transcriptional properties. They also suggest the existence of a negative feedback loop between TAL1 expression and TGF-\u03b21 signaling.",

However, the functions of Cer accumulation in necrotic cell death remain unknown. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between Cer accumulation with inhibition of the conversion pathway of Cer and concomitant necrotic cell death. In order to minimize the effect of apoptosis against necrotic cell death, A549 cells having the inhibiting effect of caspase 9 by survivin were used in this study. Consequently, Cer accumulation in A549 cells would likely be associated with a pathway other than the mitochondrial caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis. Here, we showed that the dual addition of a glucosyl-Cer synthase inhibitor and a ceramidase inhibitor to A549 cell culture induced palmitoyl-Cer accumulation with Cer synthase 5 expression and necrotic cell death with lysosomal rupture together with leakage of cathepsin B/alkalization after 2\u20133\u00a0h, although it is unknown in this study whether the necrotic cell death was caused by the lysosomal rupture.

The increase in palmitoyl-coenzyme A concentration was achieved by activation of the fatty acid synthetic pathway from acetyl coenzyme A.",

     "abstract": "FKBP22, an Escherichia coli-specific peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, shows substantial homology with the Mip-like virulence factors. Mip-like proteins are homodimeric and possess a V-shaped conformation. Their N-terminal domains form dimers, whereas their C-terminal domains bind protein/peptide substrates and distinct inhibitors such as rapamycin and FK506. Interestingly, the two domains of the Mip-like proteins are separated by a lengthy, protease-susceptible \u03b1-helix. To delineate the structural requirement of this domain-connecting region in Mip-like proteins, we have investigated a recombinant FKBP22 (rFKBP22) and its three point mutants I65P, V72P and A82P using different probes. Each mutant harbors a Pro substitution mutation at a distinct location in the hinge region. We report that the three mutants are not only different from each other but also different from rFKBP22 in structure and activity. Unlike rFKBP22, the three mutants were unfolded by a non-two state mechanism in the presence of urea. In addition, the stabilities of the mutants, particularly I65P and V72P, differed considerably from that of rFKBP22. Conversely, the rapamycin binding affinity of no mutant was different from that of rFKBP22. Of the mutants, I65P showed the highest levels of structural/functional loss and dissociated partly in solution. Our computational study indicated a severe collapse of the V-shape in I65P due to the anomalous movement of its C-terminal domains. The \u03b1-helical nature of the domain-connecting region is, therefore, critical for the Mip-like proteins.",

     "abstract": "Composite biomaterials made from synthetic and protein-based polymers are extensively researched in tissue engineering. To successfully fabricate a protein-polymer composite, it is critical to understand how strongly the protein binds to the synthetic polymer, which occurs through protein adsorption. Currently, there is no cost-effective and simple method for characterizing this interfacial binding. To characterize this interfacial binding, we introduce a simple three-step method that involves: 1) synthetic polymer surface characterisation, 2) a quick, inexpensive and robust novel immuno-based assay that uses protein extraction compounds to characterize protein binding strength followed by 3) an in\u00a0vitro 2D model of cell culture to confirm the results of the immuno-based assay. Fibrinogen, precursor of fibrin, was adsorbed (test protein) on three different polymeric surfaces: silicone, poly(acrylic acid)-coated silicone and poly(allylamine)-coated silicone. Polystyrene surface was used as a reference. Characterisation of the different surfaces revealed different chemistry and roughness. The novel immuno-based assay showed significantly stronger binding of fibrinogen to both poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine) coated silicone. Finally, cell studies showed that the strength of the interaction between the protein and the polymer had an effect on cell growth. This novel immuno-based assay is a valuable tool in developing composite biomaterials of synthetic and protein-based polymers with the potential to be applied in other fields of research where protein adsorption onto surfaces plays an important role.",

This and many other pathophysiological changes seen in human patients are reproduced in mice injected with purified endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). In the present study, down-regulation of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) and gluconeogenesis in mice exposed to LPS was challenged by nutritional intervention with Argan oil. Mice given a standard chow supplemented or not with either 6% (w/w) Argan oil (AO) or 6% (w/w) olive oil (OO) prior to exposure to LPS were explored for liver gene expressions assessed by mRNA transcript levels and/or enzyme activities. AO (or OO) food supplementation reveals that, in LPS-treated mice, hepatic expression of genes involved in FAOx and gluconeogenesis was preserved. This preventive protection might be related to the recovery of the gene expressions of nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1) and estrogen related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1) and their coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1\u03b1, (PGC-1\u03b1).

     "abstract": "Giardia lamblia is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, a disease of high prevalence in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Giardiasis leads to poor absorption of nutrients, severe electrolyte loss and growth retardation. In addition to its clinical importance, this parasite is of special biological interest due to its basal evolutionary position and simplified metabolism, which has not been studied thoroughly. One of the most important and conserved metabolic pathways is the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). This molecule is widely known as a coenzyme in multiple redox reactions and as a substrate in cellular processes such as synthesis of Ca2+ mobilizing agents, DNA repair and gene expression regulation. There are two pathways for NAD biosynthesis, which converge at the step catalyzed by nicotinamide/nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT, EC 2.7.7.1/18). Using bioinformatics tools, we found two NMNAT sequences in Giardia lamblia (glnmnat-a and glnmnat-b). We first verified the identity of the sequences in silico. Subsequently, glnmnat-a was cloned into an expression vector. The recombinant protein (His-GlNMNAT) was purified by nickel-affinity binding and was used in direct in\u00a0vitro enzyme assays assessed by C18-HPLC, verifying adenylyltransferase activity with both nicotinamide (NMN) and nicotinic acid (NAMN) mononucleotides. Optimal reaction pH and temperature were 7.3 and 26\u00a0\u00b0C. Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics were observed for NMN and ATP, but saturation was not accomplished with NAMN, implying low affinity yet detectable activity with this substrate. Double-reciprocal plots showed no cooperativity for this enzyme. This represents an advance in the study of NAD metabolism in Giardia spp.",

CIT supplementation lowered leptin mRNA 62% and increased adiponectin mRNA 232%. In cultured explants of RET WAT from 4 month-old CD, 4 month-old HFD and 25-month-old CD rats, the exposure to 2.5\u00a0mmol/L CIT for 24\u00a0h up-regulated adiponectin gene expression 151%, 362% and 216% respectively. In contrast, leptin gene expression was down-regulated 66% selectively in CIT-treated explants from 25-month-old CD rats. These results further support the proposed beneficial effect of CIT to counteract the deleterious effects of aging and overweight on the metabolic, inflammatory and endocrine functions of WAT.",
