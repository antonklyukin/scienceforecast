     "abstract": "A new series of pyrazole derivatives was prepared in this work, including pyrazolopyrimidines, pyrazolotriazines, pyrazolylthienopyridines, and 2-(pyrazolylamino)thiazol-4-ones, utilizing 3-amino-5-methyl-1H-pyrazole as a synthetic precursor. Their in vitro anticancer activity was tested on hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2. The results revealed that the pyrazolylhydrazonoyl cyanide 8, the pyrazolopyrimidine 3, and the pyrazolylaminothiazolone 17 were the most active with IC50 values of 2, 7, and 7\u202f\u00b5M respectively in comparison with 5.5\u202f\u00b5M for cisplatin as a reference drug. Interestingly, all the synthesized compounds showed higher selectivity index than cisplatin. DNA binding assay was also carried out for the synthesized compounds to rationalize their mechanism of action. Molecular modeling studies, including docking into DNA minor groove, flexible alignment, and surface mapping, were conducted. Results obtained proved the superior DNA-binding affinity of the most active anticancer compounds.",

     "abstract": "With the aim to discover novel, efficient and selective inhibitors of human alkaline phosphatase and nucleotide pyrophosphatase enzymes, two new series of pyrazolyl pyrimidinetriones (PPTs) (6a\u2013g) and thioxopyrimidinediones (PTPs) (6h\u2013n) were synthesized in good chemical yields using Knoevenagel condensation reaction between pyrazole carbaldehydes (4a\u2013g) and pharmacologically active N-alkylated pyrimidinetrione (5a) and thioxopyrimidinedione (5b). The inhibition potential of the synthesized hybrid compounds was evaluated against human alkaline phosphatase (h-TNAP and h-IAP) and ectonucleotidase (h-NPP1 and h-NPP3) enzymes. Most of the tested analogs were highly potent with a variable degree of inhibition depending on the functionalized hybrid structure. The detailed structure-activity relationship (SAR) of PPT and PTP derivatives suggested that the compound with unsubstituted phenyl ring from PPT series led to selective and potent inhibition (6a; IC50\u202f=\u202f0.33\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02\u202f\u00b5M) of h-TNAP, whereas compound 6c selectively inhibited h-IAP isozyme with IC50 value of 0.86\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202f\u00b5M. Similarly, compounds 6b and 6h were identified as the lead scaffolds against h-NPP1 and h-NPP3, respectively. The probable binding modes for the most potent inhibitors were elucidated through molecular docking analysis. Structure-activity relationships, mechanism of action, cytotoxic effects and druglikeness properties are also discussed.",

Cisplatin exerts anticancer activity via multiple mechanisms but its most acceptable mechanism involves generation of DNA lesions by interacting with purine bases on DNA followed by activation of several signal transduction pathways which finally lead to apoptosis. However, side effects and drug resistance are the two inherent challenges of cisplatin which limit its application and effectiveness. Reduction of drug accumulation inside cancer cells, inactivation of drug by reacting with glutathione and metallothioneins and faster repairing of DNA lesions are responsible for cisplatin resistance. To minimize cisplatin side effects and resistance, combination therapies are used and have proven more effective to defect cancers. This article highlights a systematic description on cisplatin which includes a brief history, synthesis, action mechanism, resistance, uses, side effects and modulation of side effects. It also briefly describes development of platinum drugs from very small cisplatin complex to very large next generation nanocarriers conjugated platinum complexes.",

     "abstract": "Abnormal melanogenesis results in excessive production of melanin, leading to pigmentation disorders. As a key and rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis, tyrosinase has been considered an important target for developing therapeutic agents of pigment disorders. Despite having an (E)-\u03b2-phenyl-\u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl scaffold, which plays an important role in the potent inhibition of tyrosinase activity, cinnamic acids have not attracted attention as potential tyrosinase inhibitors, due to their low tyrosinase inhibitory activity and relatively high hydrophilicity. Given that cinnamic acids\u2019 structure intrinsically features this (E)-scaffold and following our experience that minute changes in the chemical structure can powerfully affect tyrosinase activity, twenty less hydrophilic cinnamamide derivatives were designed as potential tyrosinase inhibitors and synthesised using a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. Four of these cinnmamides (4, 9, 14, and 19) exhibited much stronger mushroom tyrosinase inhibition (over 90% inhibition) at 25\u202f\u00b5M compared to kojic acid (20.57% inhibition); crucially, all four have a 2,4-dihydroxy group on the \u03b2-phenyl ring of the scaffold. A docking simulation using tyrosinase indicated that the four cinnamamides exceeded the binding affinity of kojic acid, and bound more strongly to the active site of tyrosinase. Based on the strength of their tyrosinase inhibition, these four cinnamamides were further evaluated in B16F10 melanoma cells. All four cinnamamides, without cytotoxicity, exhibited higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity (67.33 \u2013 79.67% inhibition) at 25\u202f\u03bcM than kojic acid (38.11% inhibition), with the following increasing inhibitory order: morpholino (9)\u202f=\u202fcyclopentylamino (14)\u202f<\u202fcyclohexylamino (19)\u202f<\u202fN-methylpiperazino (4) cinnamamides. Analysis of tyrosinase activity and melanin content in B16F10 cells showed that the four cinnamamides dose-dependently inhibited both cellular tyrosinase activity and melanin content and that their inhibitory activity at 25\u202f\u03bcM was much better than that of kojic acid. The results of melanin content analysis well matched those of the cellular tyrosinase activity analysis, indicating that tyrosinase inhibition by the four cinnamamides is a major factor in the reduction of melanin production. These results imply that these four cinnamamides with a 2,4-dihydroxyphenyl group can act as excellent anti-melanogenic agents in the treatment of pigmentation disorders.",

     "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea is an economically important fungal pathogen with a host range of over 200 plant species. Unfortunately, gray mold disease caused by B. cinerea has not been effectively controlled because of its high risk for fungicide resistance development. As a part of our ongoing efforts to develop novel sulfonamides as agricultural fungicides against Botrytis cinerea, we introduced 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine) substructure, designed and synthesized a series of novel 2-substituted acylaminoethylsulfonamides. The newly synthesized sulfonamides were evaluated in vitro and in vivo for their fungicidal activity against Botrytis cinerea, of which the 2-ethoxyacetylamide derivative (V-A-12, EC50\u202f=\u202f0.66\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121) exhibited the highest potency in vitro and superior fungicidal activity compared with procymidone (EC50\u202f=\u202f1.06\u202fmg\u00b7L\u22121). In vivo bioassay indicated that compound V-A-12 could be effective for the control of tomato gray mold. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship of these sulfonamides was analyzed by establishing a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) model, which can provide guidance for the development of sulfonamides as fungicides. Finally, the effeicacy of sulfonamide derivatives was again verified in the activity evaluation against resistant Botrytis cinerea strains. These results further enhance the development value of 2-substituted acylaminoethylsulfonamides to control the tomato gray mold.",

The biological activities of these compounds were investigated by the assays of transcription and replication inhibition, cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity.The result of this study indicates that, both compounds strongly bind to DNA via intercalation but only 1 has a strong nuclease activity. The coordination compound of dicnq (1) binds to the DNA only slightly stronger than the quaternized form of dicnq (2), and is more potent as an inhibitor of transcription and replication and therefore, 1 has more potential as an anticancer agent but the compounds did not show cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, and DLD-1 colon cancer cell lines it was found that they only had activities against HepG2 liver cancer cell line with following IC50 values; 94.75 and 159.60\u202f\u00b5M for 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, tested bacteria are more susceptible to compound 1. These biological activities of 1 may strongly be due to its ability to digest DNA as a chemical nuclease. According to this study, the quaternization of the ligand does not make biologically more active than the coordination compound of the same ligand in this case.

Based on the facts that many naturally occurring lipopeptides are potent antimicrobials, our study aimed to explore the potential of replacing rhamnose in rhamnolipids with amino acids thus creating lipopeptides that would mimic or enhance properties of the parent molecule. This would allow not only for more economical and greener production but also, due to the availability of structurally different amino acids, facile manipulation of physico-chemical and biological properties.Our synthetic efforts produced a library of 43 lipopeptides revealing biologically more potent molecules. The structural changes significantly increased, in particular, anti-biofilm properties against Candida albicans, although surface activity of the parent molecule was almost completely abolished. Our findings show that the most active compounds are leucine derivatives of 3-hydroxy acids containing benzylic ester functionality. The SAR study demonstrated a further increase in activity with aliphatic chain elongation. The most promising lipopeptides 15, 23 and 36 at 12.5\u202f\u00b5g/mL concentration allowed only 14.3%, 5.1% and 11.2% of biofilm formation, respectively after 24\u202fh.

All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in-vitro anti-tubercular activity against H37Rv strain by Alamar Blue assay method. Most of the synthesized compounds displayed potent anti-tubercular activities. Amongst all the tested compounds 6p, 6g, 6n and 6h exhibited promising anti-tubercular activity. Further, these potent compounds were gauged for MDR-TB, XDR-TB and cytotoxic study. None of these compounds exhibited potent cytotoxicity. Stability of protein ligand complex was further evaluated by molecular dynamics simulation for 10\u202fns. All these results indicate that the synthesized compounds could be potential leads for further development of new potent anti-tubercular agents.",

Then, the inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity by the compounds isolated from S. asper was measured. Meanwhile, enzyme kinetics and molecular docking were determined to exhibit the combination modes between cardiac glycosides and Na+,K+-ATPase.

Compound 4 could reasonably bind to the active sites of Na+,K+-ATPase, proved by molecular docking. Furthermore, the contents of the major compounds in four different parts of S. asper were extremely different, analyzed by chemometric methods, similarity analysis and principle compounds analysis. All these findings indicated that the contents of major compounds in different parts of S. asper were extremely different with a significant activity of inhibiting Na+,K+-ATPase, providing a reference for determination of effective part and administered dosage.

     "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in developing countries. Therefore, development of new chemotherapeutic agents is required. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells contain elevated copper levels which play an integral role in angiogenesis. Thus, targeting copper via copper-specific chelators in cancer cells can serve as effective anticancer strategy. In this work, a copper chelator pregnenolone acetate nucleus-based tetrazole derivative (ligand-L) was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, ESI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR. DNA binding ability of ligand-L was studied using UV\u2013Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies reveal that quenching constant of ligand-l-DNA and ligand-L-Cu(II) were found to be 7.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 M\u22121 and 8.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 M\u22121, respectively.

Results showed that ligand-L exhibit significant cytotoxic activity against cervical cancer C33A cells with IC50 value 5.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.8\u202f\u00b5M. Further, it was found that ligand-L cytotoxicity is due to redox cycling of copper to generate ROS which leads to DNA damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, this is the report where we synthesized pregnenolone acetate-based tetrazole derivative against C33A cells that targets cellular copper to induce pro-oxidant death in cancer cells. These findings will provide significant insights into the development of new chemical molecules with better copper chelating and pro-oxidant properties against cancer cells.",

In addition, the interaction between the isolated TF and active sites of QS- gene (LasI/rhlI, LasR/rhlR, and AHLase) in P.aeruginosa was evaluated by molecular docking studies using AutoDock Tools version 1.5.6. Based on the structural elucidation of the isolated compound was identified as 3, 5, 7-Trihydroxyflavone. Consequently, the isolated TF shows a significant reduction of biofilm formation through the inhibition of QS-dependent phenotypes such as pyocyanin production, proteolytic, swimming motility, EPS activities against P.aeruginosa in a dose-dependent manner. Molecular docking analysis of isolated TF can interfere the signaling [N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL) and N-butanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL)] molecules in P.aeruginosa by QS genes (LasI, LasR, rhlI, and AHLase) regulation.

     "abstract": "Metformin, the most frequently administered oral anti-diabetic drug, is a substrate for organic cation transporters (OCTs). This determines not only its pharmacokinetic properties but also its biochemical effects in humans, including its recently-discovered antiproliferative properties. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis whether chemical modification of its biguanide backbone may increase the cellular uptake and antiproliferative efficacy of metformin.The study examines five sulfenamide derivatives of metformin with differing lengths of alkyl chains. It determines their cellular uptake and the role of OCTs in their transport in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (epithelial-like MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231). It also evaluates whether increased cellular uptake of metformin derivatives is associated with their cytotoxic properties.Sulfenamide derivatives were characterized by a greater ability to bind to OCTs than metformin. Compound 2 with n-octyl alkyl chain was found to possess the greatest affinity towards OCTs, as measured by determination of [14C]choline uptake inhibition (IC50\u202f=\u202f236.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.28\u202f\u03bcmol/L, and 217.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.33\u202f\u03bcmol/L, for MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 respectively). Sulfenamides were also found to exhibit better cellular uptake in comparison with the parent drug, metformin. For instance, the uptake of cyclohexyl derivative 1 was 1.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.19\u202fnmol/min/mg of proteins and thus was 12-fold higher than the metformin in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, higher uptake was associated with the greatest antiproliferative properties expressed as the lowest IC50 value i.e. inhibiting the growth of 50% of the cells (IC50\u202f=\u202f0.72\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.31\u202f\u03bcmol/L).Collectively, chemical modification of metformin into sulfenamides with different alkyl substituents obtains better substrates for OCTs, and subsequently higher cellular uptake in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Additionally, the length of alkyl chain introduced to the sulfenamides was found to influence selectivity and transport efficiency via OCT1 compared to other possible transporters, as well as potential intracellular activity and cytotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "TPEN is an amino chelator of transition metals that is effective at the cellular and whole organism levels. Although TPEN of often used as a selective zinc chelators, it has affinity for copper and iron and has been shown to chelate both biologically. We have previously shown that TPEN selectively kills colon cancer cells based on its ability to chelate copper, which is highly enriched in colon cancer cells. The TPEN-copper complex is redox active thus allowing for increased ROS production in cancer cells and as such cellular toxicity. Here we generate TPEN derivatives with the goal of increasing its selectivity for copper while minimizing zinc chelation to reduce potential side effects. We show that one of these derivatives, TPEEN despite the fact that it exhibits reduced affinity for transition metals, is effective at inducing cell death in breast cancer cells, and exhibits less toxicity to normal breast cells. The toxicity effect of the both chelators coupled to the metal content of the different cell types reveals that they exhibit their toxicity through chelating redox active metals (iron and copper). As such TPEEN is an important novel chelators that can be exploited in anti-cancer therapies.",

Evaluation of the potential biomolecular targets of bioconjugates 2 by UV\u2013Vis, fluorescence and CD spectroscopy revealed no measurable interaction with DNA, but micromolar affinity for proteins. The cytotoxicity of bioconjugates 2 is in correlation with their BSA binding constants, i. e. bioconjugates with lower IC50 values show higher binding affinities towards BSA. Compound 2mG with value of IC50 16\u202f\u03bcM was selected for further biological characterization. The higher level of toxicity towards tumor compared to normal cell lines indicates its selective activity, important characteristic for potential medical use. It was detected 2mG caused increase of cells in the S phase of cell cycle and consequential decrease of cells in G0/G1 phase. Additionally, 2mG caused dose- and time-dependent increase of SubG0/G1 cell population, suggesting its ability to induce programmed cell death. Further investigation determined autophagy as the mode of cell death. The role of GSH in HeLa cells response to investigated organometallic ruthenium complexes was confirmed using specific regulators of GSH synthesis, buthionine sulfoximine and N-acetyl-cysteine. Pre-treatment of cells with ethacrynic acid and probenecid emphasized the role of GSH in detoxification of 2mG compound. The amount of total ruthenium accumulation in the cell did not correlate with toxicity of 2pG, 2pA, 2mG and 2mA, suggesting structure dependent differences in either cell uptake or kinetics of ruthenium complexes detoxification.

These two compounds affected the cell viability of cancer cells, with IC50 values within the range between 5 to 9\u202f\u00b5M. The cell cycle analysis showed that 4a and 6g induced S and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. This could be the mechanism by which these molecules induced cytotoxicity in tested cancer cells. The prepared compounds were tested in zebrafish embryos to evaluate in vivo and developmental toxicity of the pyrazolyl-s-triazine derivatives in animals. None of the derivatives were lethal in the concentration range tested.",

Patients suffering from this disease can currently be treated with numerous oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs, but none is capable of reproducing the physiological action of insulin and, in several cases, they induce severe side effects. Developing new anti-diabetic drugs remains one of the most urgent challenges of the pharmaceutical industry. Multi-target drugs could offer new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of T2D, and the reported data on type 2 diabetic mice models indicate that these drugs could be more effective and have fewer side effects than mono-target drugs. \u03b1-Glucosidases and Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) are considered important targets for the treatment of T2D: the first digest oligo- and disaccharides in the gut, while the latter regulates the insulin-signaling pathway. With the aim of generating new drugs able to target both enzymes, we synthesized a series of bifunctional compounds bearing both a nitro aromatic group and an iminosugar moiety. The results of tests carried out both in vitro and in a cell-based model, show that these bifunctional compounds maintain activity on both target enzymes and, more importantly, show a good insulin-mimetic activity, increasing phosphorylation levels of Akt in the absence of insulin stimulation. These compounds could be used to develop a new generation of anti-hyperglycemic drugs useful for the treatment of patients affected by T2D.",

Furthermore, 12 compounds with similar scaffold with 6a were tested for anti-osteoclastogenesis. As a result, 9 compounds inhibited both NF-\u03baB and osteoclastogenesis. Among them, compound 6b is the most potent inhibitor against NF-\u03baB (IC50\u202f=\u202f2.09\u202f\u03bcM) and osteoclast differentiation (IC50\u202f=\u202f0.86\u202f\u03bcM). Further studies show that compound 6b blocks the phosphorylation of both p65 and I\u03baB\u03b1, and suppresses NF-\u03baB targeted gene expression without interfering MAPKs and PI3K/Akt signal transduction pathways.

Here, we found that SO could significantly inhibit the growth and proliferation of A549 cells and induce its pro-apoptotic action through a caspase-dependent pathway. It could also impair the mitochondria which can be reflected by mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Besides, SQSTM1 up-regulation and autophagic flux measurement demonstrated that exposure to SO led to autophagosome accumulation, which plays a protective role in SO-treated cells. In addition, knocking down of LC3B increased SO triggered apoptotic cell rates.

Of interest, its inhibitory potency toward Baker\u2019s yeast was 28 times greater than standard drug, acarbose and its DPPH radical scavenging (SC50 11.2\u202f\u00b5M) was 130 times higher than commercial antioxidant BHT. Subsequent investigation on mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of \u03b2-14 revealed that it blocked Baker\u2019s yeast and sucrase functions by mixed-type inhibition while it exerted non-competitive inhibition toward maltase. Molecular dynamics simulation of the most potent furofuran lignans (4, \u03b1-8b, \u03b1-14, and \u03b2-14) with the homology rat intestinal maltase at the binding site revealed that the hydrogen bond interactions from catechol, acetoxy, and quinone moieties of furofuran lignans were the key interaction to bind tightly to \u03b1-glucosidase. The results indicated that \u03b2-14 possessed promising antidiabetic activity through simultaneously inhibiting \u03b1-glucosidases and free radicals.",

However, laboratory synthesis of various chalcones has also been reported. Both natural and synthetic chalcones are known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antitumor, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial and antituberculosis. These promising activities, ease of synthesis and simple chemical structure have awarded chalcones considerable attraction. This review focuses on the anti-inflammatory effects of chalcones, caused by their inhibitory action primarily against the activities and expressions of four key inflammatory mediators viz., cyclooxygenase, prostaglandin E2, inducible NO synthase, and nuclear factor \u03baB. Various methodologies for the synthesis of chalcones have been discussed. The potency of recently synthesized chalcones is given in terms of their IC50 values. Structure-Activity Relationships (SARs) of a variety of chalcone derivatives have been discussed. Computational methods were applied to calculate the ideal orientation of a typical chalcone scaffold against three enzymes, namely, cyclooxygenase-1, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible NO synthase for the formation of stable complexes. The global market of anti-inflammatory drugs and its expected growth (from 2018 to 2026) have been discussed. SAR analysis, docking studies, and future prospects all together provide useful clues for the synthesis of novel chalcones of improved anti-inflammatory activities.",

However, over-expression of NTPDases has been linked with various pathological diseases e.g. cancer. Thus, to treat these diseases, the inhibitors of this class of enzyme are of interest. The significance of this class of enzyme encouraged us to synthesize a new class of quinoline derivatives with the aim to find selective and potent inhibitors of NTPDases. Therefore, a mild and efficient synthetic route was established for the synthesis of quinoline derivatives. The reaction was catalyzed by molecular iodine to afford the substituted quinoline derivatives. All the synthetic derivatives (3a-3w) were evaluated for their potential to inhibit the h-NTPDase1, 2, 3 and 8. Most of the compounds were identified as dual inhibitors of h-NTPDase1 and 8 with lower effects on h-NTPDase2 and 3. Two compounds i.e. 3f and 3t were identified as selective inhibitor of h-NTPDase1 whereas the compound 3s inhibited the h-NTPDase8 selectively.

As a continuous effort to develop novel antiviral agents, the series of planar fluorenone (3a\u20137d) were synthesized and used along with nonplanar biphenyls (11a\u2013d) for the comparative analysis of their interaction with DNA. The chemical structure of new compounds was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectra as well as elemental analysis. DNA affinity of 3a\u20137d and 11a\u2013d was evaluated by ethidium bromide displacement assay. Affinity constant (lgKa) of 3a\u20137d was found to be approximately two orders of magnitude higher than constants of corresponding 11a\u2013d. The molecular docking of aminoalkoxybiphenyls (11a\u2013d) into minor grove of five different nucleotide sequences (d(CCIICICCII), d(CGCGTTAACGCG), d(CGCGATATCGCG), d(GGCCAATTGG), d(GGATATATCC)) demonstrated their binding capacity to the specific DNA site. The linear least squares fitting technique was successfully applied to derive an equation describing the relationship between lgKa and SF.",

Cell cycle analysis showed that the representative compound 8a led to cell cycle cessation at G0/G1 phase indicating that CDK2/E1complex could be the plausible biological target for these newly synthesized compounds. Thus, the most active compounds (7c and 8a-c) were tested for their CDK2 inhibitory activity.

Moreover, RT-PCR gene expression assay showed that compound 8a increased the levels of the nuclear CDK2 regulators P21 and P27 by 2.30 and 5.7 folds, respectively. ELISA tequnique showed also that compound 8a led to remarkable activation of caspases-9 and -3 inducing cell apoptosis. QSAR study showed that the charge distribution and molecular hydrophobicity are the structural features affecting cytotoxic activity in this series. Molecular docking study for the most potent cytotoxic compounds (7c and 8a-c) rationalized their superior CDK2 inhibitory activity through their hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the key amino acids in the CDK2 binding site.

Via structure-based drug design (SBDD), a rational strategy based on the binding mode of Norathyriol to PTP1B, we designed 26 derivatives with substitutions at the four phenolic hydroxyl groups of Norathyriol. By chemical synthesis and in vitro bioassay, we identified seven PTP1B inhibitors that were more potent than Norathyriol, of which XWJ24 showed the highest potency (IC50: 0.6\u202f\u03bcM). We also found out that XWJ24 was a competitive inhibitor and showed the 4.5-fold selectivity over its close homolog, TC-PTP.

It is worth noting that maslinic acid and corosolic acid derivatives coupled aspartic acid (9f: IC50\u202f=\u202f382\u202f\u03bcm and 10f: IC50\u202f=\u202f364\u202f\u03bcm, respectively) have the best water solubility and thus presented higher inhibitory activity than that of acarbose (IC50\u202f=\u202f484\u202f\u03bcm). Unfortunately, all of the derivatives possess lower inhibitory properties of \u03b1-glucosidase than those of the parent compounds in the measurement system of DMSO solution, even if the derivatives exhibit better water solubility than that of the parent compounds.",

In this paper, new tamoxifen-based derivatives with a rigid structural motif in their structure were designed, synthesized, and evaluated to assess their antitumor behavior. All the tested compounds affected estrogen receptor-positive tumor (MCF-7) cell growth, even with different extents, among which, the most active ones proved also to induce mitochondria-mediated apoptosis through activation of PARP cleavage, decrease in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increase in Bim gene expression levels.

The structures were elucidated in light of extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D, 2D NMR (1H, 13C, 1H-1H-COSY, HMBC and HSQC) and HR-ESI-MS. These compounds were screened for their in vitro antiproliferative activity in rat C6 glioma and astrocyte cells using MTT assay and in silico by molecular docking against targets that play a central role in controlling glioma cell cycle progression. Majoranolide (3) is the most active compound with IC50 6.69\u202f\u00b5M against C6 glioma cells, followed by the compounds 1 (IC50 9.06\u202f\u00b5M), 2 (IC50 12.04\u202f\u00b5M) and 4 (IC50 41.90\u202f\u00b5M). The alkene lactones 1\u20133 exhibited lower toxicity in non-tumor cells when compared to glioma cells. Molecular docking results showed that majoranolide establishes hydrogen bonds with all targets through its \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated-\u03b3-lactone moiety, whereas the long-chain alkyl group binds by means of several hydrophobic bonds. In the present study, it can be concluded from the anti-proliferative activity of isolates against C6 glioma cells that lactone constituents from P. fulva could have a great potential for the control of C6 glioma cells.",

By suppressing the formation of damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) by XO or scavenging ROS from other sources, these compounds may prevent a buildup of ROS in the aftermath of a heart attack or stroke. To combine these two properties in a single molecule, we synthesized and characterized the non-purine XO inhibitor caffeic acid phenethylester (CAPE) and 19 derivatives using a convenient microwave-assisted Knoevenagel condensation protocol. Varying systematically the number and positions of the hydroxyl groups at the two phenyl rings, we derived structure-activity relationships based on experimentally determined XO inhibition data. Molecular docking suggested that critical enzyme/inhibitor interactions involved \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between the phenolic inhibitor ring and Tyr914, hydrogen bonds between inhibitor hydroxyl groups and Glu802, and hydrophobic interactions between the CAPE phenyl ring and non-polar residues located at the entrance of the binding site. To effectively scavenge the stable radical DPPH, two hydroxyl groups in 1,2- or 1,4-position at the phenyl ring were required. Among all compounds tested, E-phenyl 3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acrylate, a CAPE analog without the ethyl tether, showed the most promising properties.",

Currently approved oral synthetic antidiabetic drugs such as biguanides, thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, and meglitinides have shown undesirable side effects. Therefore, newer approaches and targets for the management of diabetes mellitus are highly desirable. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme, \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme and sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) have been recognized as effective therapeutic targets for the management of diabetes mellitus while natural products are alternatives to oral synthetic hypoglycemic agents.

Natural products do not only provide useful drugs in their own right but also provide templates for the development of more effective compounds for enhanced therapeutic potential.

Therefore, down-regulation of c-myc transcription by inhibiting hnRNP K through disrupting its binding to c-myc gene promoter is a potential approach for cancer therapy. In the present study, we synthesized and screened a series of Quinoline derivatives and evaluated their binding affinity for hnRNP K. Among these derivatives, (E)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(4-morpholino-6-nitroquinolin-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one (compound 25) was determined to be the first-reported hnRNP K binding ligand with its KD values of 4.6 and 2.6\u202f\u03bcM measured with SPR and MST, respectively. Subsequent evaluation showed that the binding of compound 25 to hnRNP K could disrupt its unfolding of c-myc promoter i-motif, resulting in down-regulation of c-myc transcription. Compound 25 showed a selective anti-proliferative effect on human cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranged from 1.36 to 3.59\u202f\u03bcM. Compound 25 exhibited good tumor growth inhibition in a Hela xenograft tumor model, which might be related to its binding with hnRNP K. These findings illustrated that inhibition of DNA-binding protein hnRNP K by compound 25 could be a new and selective strategy of regulating oncogene transcription instead of targeting promoter DNA secondary structures such as G-quadruplexes or i-motifs.",

The standard symptomatic therapy consists of dopamine replacement with l-dopa, the metabolic precursor of dopamine, which represents the most effective treatment. Since monoamine oxidase (MAO) B is a key dopamine metabolising enzyme in the brain, MAO-B inhibitors are often used as adjuvants to l-dopa. In addition to the symptomatic benefits offered by MAO-B inhibitors, these drugs may also possess neuroprotective properties and possibly delay the progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease. Based on the therapeutic use of MAO-B inhibitors, the present study evaluates a series of mono- and disubstituted derivatives of 4(3H)-quinazolinone as potential inhibitors of recombinant human MAO-A and MAO-B. Twelve C6-monosubstituted and nine N3/C6-disubstituted 4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives were synthesised, which led to the discovery of novel quinazolinone derivatives with micromolar and submicromolar activities as inhibitors of MAO-B.

The (4S) enantiomer of C4-propoxy-HPD was the most active compound being approximately twice as efficient as (4S)-DPD and ten-times more potent than the (4R) enantiomer. Additionally, the specificity of this analogue to bacteria with LuxP receptors makes it a good candidate for clinical applications, because it is not susceptible to scavenging by LsrB-containing bacteria that degrade the natural AI-2.

However, the clear beneficial effects of naturally occurring estrogen mimetic coumestrol remain controversial due to experimental evidence that it has been shown to stimulate MCF-7 cell proliferation via agonist effect on estrogen receptor at low concentration. Herein, to disconnect the ER interaction and apoptosis-specific mechanism of coumestrol, various 3, 9-di-O-substituted coumestrols (7a-7e) and their furan ring-opened analogs (5a-5e) were synthesized and assessed for antiproliferative properties. Attachment of a dimethylamine-containing side chain to 3-O of coumestrol led to the most promising compound 7e with improved antiproliferative activity (1.7-fold increase) against MCF-7 cells, decreased estrogen activity (>20 times weaker ER\u03b1 binder) and a novel action to induce apoptosis. Mechanistic studies revealed that 7e is a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, which could arrest cell cycle at G2/M phase and induce apoptosis along with the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, such subtle modifications to the 3, 9-di-hydroxyl groups of coumestrol allow the generation of a novel apoptosis inducer with distinct pharmacological properties, providing an excellent starting point to future development of novel tumor-vascular disrupting agents targeting tubulin.",

On the basis of it, a systematic strategy was applied to identify a high-quality lead compound (compound 50) that inhibits the essential enzyme DprE1, thus blocking the synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall to kill M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, the rational design and synthetic strategy for compound 50 was reported. Notably, the compound 50 has been confirmed to be no toxicity.

Several theoretical and experimental studies were done to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control breast carcinoma metastasis. The mechanistic effectiveness in cell cycle progression, apoptotic induction and gene regulation were assessed for the promising compound 9d due to its remarkable cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 and significant VEGFR-2 inhibition. Flow cytometeric analysis showed that compound 9d induced cell growth cessation at G2/M phase and increased the percentage of cells at pre-G1 phase that stimulates the apoptotic death of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, real time PCR assay illustrated that compound 9d up regulated p53 gene expression and elevated Bax/Bcl-2 ratio which confirmed the mechanistic pathway of compound 9d. Moreover, the apoptotic induction of breast cancer cells MCF-7 was enhanced effectively through activation of caspases-7 and 9 by compound 9d.

We also synthesized the analogue of aromaticane B using compound 2. In vitro anti-proliferative activity of some derivatives were tested by MTT assay. Two derivatives showed weak anti-tumor effect on two cancer cell lines (HepG2 and MCF7) under normoxia. Four orobanone analogue 2, 5, 6 and 9 significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1 luciferase reporter activity in HeLa cells with the IC50 values of 13.6, 6.6, 2.4 and 18.2\u202f\u03bcM, respectively.",

Additionally, we observed that C and EC quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of AGH through a static quenching mechanism, and that the electrostatic force was the predominant driving factor in the binding reaction. Molecular docking studies indicated that the benzene-ring-4\u2032-hydroxyphenyl construct on flavan-3-ol plays an important role in AGH inhibition, and that the inhibition increases along with increased binding of amino acid residues at this site. Furthermore, C and EC inhibited glucose absorption in everted intestine sleeves in vitro and suppressed increases in postprandial blood glucose levels in vivo. Our results suggest that C and EC are useful to protect against hyperglycemia through inhibiting the activity of a-glucosidase.",

Several factors were identified for causing structural changes of a protein, however quinone-induced protein modifications received very little attention whether for amyloidal or non-amyloidal proteins.

Our study shows that all BQs can readily modify lysozyme in a complex manner through adduct formation, oligomerization, polymeric aggregation, and/or fibrilization.

Good antioxidant activity is related to the number and position of hydroxyl groups on the arylidene moiety as well as to the presence of methoxy or 4-(diethylamino) group. On the contrary low antioxidant activity is showed by the isomeric 1H-indol-2-yl(methylene)-benzohydrazides. Furthermore, hydrazones 4\u201317 showed photoprotective capacities with satisfactory in vitro SPF as compared to the commercial PBSA sunscreen filter. The indole 16 and 17, showing the best antioxidant and photoprotective profile, were included in different formulation and their topical release was evaluated. Varying the formulation composition, it was possible to optimize skin adsorption and solubility of the active indole in the formulation. The antiproliferative effect of the hydrazones 4\u201317 was tested on human erythroleukemia K562 and melanoma Colo-38 cells. Hydrazones 11, 16 and 17 showed growth inhibition at sub micromolar concentrations on both cell lines. These results indicate indole hydrazones as potential multifunctional molecules especially in the treatment of neoplastic diseases being the good antioxidant properties of 16 and 17 correlated to their high antiproliferative activity.",

     "abstract": "A large number of natural products containing the propellane scaffold have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicity against several cancers; however, their mechanism of action is still unknown. Anticancer drugs targeting DNA are mainly composed of small planar molecule/s that can interact with the DNA helix, causing DNA malfunction and cell death. The aim of this study was to design and synthesize propellane derivatives that can act as DNA intercalators and/or groove binders. The unique structure of the propellane derivatives and their ability to display planar ligands with numerous possible geometries, renders them potential starting points to design new drugs targeting DNA in cancer cells. New substituted furo-imidazo[3.3.3]propellanes were synthesized via the reaction of substituted alkenylidene-hydrazinecarbothioamides with 2-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-2-ylidene)propanedinitrile in tetrahydrofuran at room temperature. The structures of the products were confirmed by a combination of elemental analysis, NMR, ESI-MS, IR and single crystal X-ray analysis. Interestingly, 5c, 5d and 5f showed an ability to interact with Calf Thymus DNA (CT-DNA). Their DNA-binding mode was investigated using a combination of absorption spectroscopy, DNA melting, viscosity, CD spectroscopy measurements, as well as competitive binding studies with several dyes. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated against the NCI-60 panel of cancer cell lines. 5c, 5d and 5f exhibited similar anti-proliferative activity against the A549 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line. Further mechanistic studies revealed their ability to induce DNA damage in the A549 cell line, as well as apoptosis, evidenced by elevated Annexin V expression, enhanced caspase 3/7 activation and PARP cleavage. In this study, we present the potential for designing novel propellanes to provoke cytotoxic activity, likely through DNA binding-induced DNA damage and apoptosis.",

In this context, Tabernaemontana catharinensis (Apocynaceae) has been highlighted because of the presence of active indole alkaloids. Thus, this study aims the bio-guided search of T. catharinensis cytotoxic alkaloids. The chemical composition was identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry, and fractionation was performed by open column and preparative thin-layer chromatography, from plant stems. The enriched fractions were tested in vitro in tumour cells A375 (melanoma cell line) and A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells), and non-tumour Vero cells (African green monkey kidney epithelial cells). The alkaloids identified as active were submitted to in silico toxicity prediction by ADME-Tox and OSIRIS programs and, also, to molecular docking, using topoisomerase I (PDB ID: 1SC7) by iGEMDOCK. As a result, six sub-fractions were obtained, which were identified as containing 16-epi-affinine, 12-methoxy-n-methyl-voachalotine, affinisine, voachalotine, coronaridine hydroxyindoline and ibogamine, respectively. The affinisine-containing sub-fraction showed selective toxicity against A375, with an IC50 of 11.73\u202f\u00b5g\u202fmL\u22121, and no cytotoxicity against normal cells (Vero). From the in silico toxicity test results, all indole alkaloid compounds had a low toxicity risk. The molecular docking data provided structural models and binding affinities of the plant\u2019s indole alkaloids and topoisomerase I. In summary, this bio-guided search revealed that the indole alkaloids from T. catharinensis display selective cytotoxicity in A375 tumour cells and toxicity in silico.

It has been suggested that a heat shock protein-90 (Hsp90) inhibitor can prevent NCD by activating the heat shock transcription factor-1 which, in turn, upregulates molecular chaperones such as Hsp70 that targets aggregated/misfolded proteins for refolding/degradation. We have isolated radicicol, an Hsp90 inhibitor, from a fungus occurring in the crevices of marble rocks of Central India. Radicicol, which was found to be a strong antioxidant, was tested for its ability to rescue yeast cells from death induced by expression of wild-type \u03b1-synuclein, its more toxic A53T mutant, and \u03b2A4. It effectively overcomes wild-type/mutant \u03b1-synuclein mediated yeast cell death, concomitantly diminishes ROS levels, reverses mitochondrial dysfunction and prevents nuclear DNA-fragmentation, a hallmark of apoptosis. Surprisingly however, radicicol is unable to rescue yeast cells from death triggered by expression of secreted \u03b2A4. Moreover, although radicicol acts as an antioxidant it fails to prevent yeast cell death inflicted by the proapoptotic protein, Bax. Our results indicate that radicicol specifically targets aggregated/misfolded \u03b1-synuclein\u2019s toxicity and opens up the possibility of using multiple yeast assays to screen natural product libraries for compounds that would unambiguously target \u03b1-synuclein aggregation/misfolding.",

Immobilization of HNL is known to provide robustness, reusability and in some cases also enhances activity and selectivity.We optimized the preparation of immobilization of Baliospermium montanum HNL (BmHNL) by cross linking enzyme aggregate (CLEA) method and characterized it by SEM. Optimization of biocatalytic parameters was performed to obtain highest % conversion and ee of (S)-mandelonitrile from benzaldehyde using CLEA-BmHNL. The optimized reaction parameters were: 20\u202fmin of reaction time, 7 U of CLEA-BmHNL, 1.2\u202fmM substrate, and 300\u202fmM citrate buffer pH 4.2, that synthesized (S)-mandelonitrile in \u223c99% ee and \u223c60% conversion. Addition of organic solvent in CLEA-BmHNL biocatalysis did not improve in % ee or conversion of product unlike other CLEA-HNLs. CLEA-BmHNL could be successfully reused for eight consecutive cycles without loss of conversion or product formation and five cycles with a little loss in enantioselectivity. Eleven different chiral cyanohydrins were synthesized under optimal biocatalytic conditions in up to 99% ee and 59% conversion, however the % conversion and ee varied for different products. CLEA-BmHNL has improved the enantioselectivity of (S)-mandelonitrile synthesis compared to the use of purified BmHNL. Nine aldehydes not tested earlier with BmHNL were converted into their corresponding (S)-cyanohydrins for the first time using CLEA-BmHNL. Among the eleven (S)-cyanohydrins syntheses reported here, eight of them have not been synthesized by any CLEA-HNL. Overall, this study showed preparation, characterization of a stable, robust and recyclable biocatalyst i.e. CLEA-BmHNL and its biocatalytic application in the synthesis of different (S)-aromatic cyanohydrins.",

     "abstract": "Human serum albumin is perceived to be the most abundant protein in human blood plasma and functions as a major carrier of different enzymes and drugs inside human body. The present article puts in an effort to demonstrate the attitude adopted by human serum albumin towards a potential therapeutic luminophore 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-10-phenyl-3,4,6,7,8,10-hexahydro-1H-cyclopenta[g]furo[3,4-b]quinoline-1-one (HPFQ). HPFQ is a prodigy from azapodophyllotoxin class of compounds, which have been synthesized from the perspective of improved bioactivity than its prologue podophyllotoxins. While, HPFQ has proved to be highly bioactive against most cancer cell lines with best GI50 values of <0.1\u202f\u00b5M for a major number of cell lines; it also showed terrific fluorescent properties throughout the polarity scale, worthy of a promising imaging agent. The binding mechanism of HPFQ with HSA has been established by combining in vitro spectroscopic techniques, in silico molecular docking and induced fit docking (IFD). The competitive site-binding studies demonstrated that the otherwise anion-receptor sudlow site I of HSA nurtures neutral HPFQ with prudent affinity (Binding constant, K b = 0.74\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202fM\u22121). The time-resolve fluorescence studies reveal an appreciable reduction in HSA average radiative lifetime against an increase in HPFQ concentration and provided evidence for Forster\u2019s resonance energy transfer (FRET) being responsible for the dominant quenching mechanism, escorted by minor structural deformations in the backbone of protein structure. HPFQ institutes itself near Trp-214 within protein matrix, and subsequently the \u201chydrophobic amino acids\u201d dominated cybotactic environment of Trp-214 experiences a reduction in the micropolarity. The allosteric modulation triggered by the stronger association of HPFQ with HSA leads towards minor deformation in secondary structure of protein. Sudlow site I of HSA proficiently embraces a favourable conformation like malleable dough to furnish space for arriving bioactive HPFQ molecule. HPFQ is also believed to administer the conformational regulation in HSA domain by affecting inter-conversion of HSA rotamers, which may prove to be an enlightening area to decode the preferable interaction between them. The juxtaposed spectroscopic research described herein is expected to embolden design of azapodophyllotoxin based anti-proliferative clinical agents for efficient in vivo bio-distribution employing HSA-centred drug delivery and administration systems.",

Enzymatic kinetic study indicated that eighteen ebsulfurs gained except 1a\u2013b and 1f inhibited NDM-1, exhibiting an IC50 value ranging of 0.16\u20139\u202f\u03bcM, and 1g was found to be the best, dose- and time-dependent inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.16\u202f\u03bcM. Also, these ebsulfurs effectively restored the antibacterial activity of cefazolin against E. coli expressing NDM-1, and the best effect was observed to be from 1g, 1i and 1n, resulting in an 256-fold reduction in MIC of the antibiotic at a dose of 16\u202f\u03bcg/mL. The equilibrium dialysis study implied that the ebsulfur disrupted the coordination of one Zn(II) ion at active site of NDM-1. Labelling of NDM-1 using a constructed fluorescent ebsulfur Ebs-R suggested that the inhibitor covalently bound to the target through SDS-PAGE analysis in vitro. Also, labelling NDM-1 in living E. coli cells with Ebs-R by confocal microscopic imaging showed the real-time distribution change process of intracellular recombinant protein NDM-1. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of these ebsulfurs against L929 mouse fibroblastic cells was tested, and their capability to restore antibacterial activity of antibiotic against clinical strains E. coli EC08 producing NDM-1 was determined. The ebsulfur scaffold proposed here is valuable for development of the covalent irreversible inhibitors of NDM-1, and also for labelling the target in vitro and in vivo.",

     "abstract": "The delivery of drugs to the brain is complicated by the multiple factors including low blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) passive permeability, active BBB efflux systems, and plasma protein binding. Thus, a detailed understanding of the transport of the new potent substances through the membranes is vitally important and their physico-chemical characteristics should be analyzed at first. This work presents an evaluation of drug likeness of eight 7-O-arylpiperazinylcoumarin derivatives with high affinity towards serotoninergic receptors 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A with particular analysis of the requirements for the CNS chemotherapeutics. The binding constants to human serum albumin (HSA) were determined at physiological pH using fluorescence spectroscopy, and then their mode of action was explained by analysis of theoretical HSA complexes. Dynamic simulation of systems allowed for reliable evaluation of the interaction strength. The analyzed coumarins were able to pass BBB, and they present good drug likeness properties. They showed high affinities to HSA (log KQ\u202f=\u202f5.3\u20136.0 which corresponds to \u22128.12 to \u22127.15\u202fkcalmol\u22121 of Gibbs free energy). The changes of the emission intensity upon binding to HSA were scrutinized showing the different mode of action for 4-phenylpiperazinylcoumarins. The values of computed Gibbs free energy and determined on the basis of experimentally obtained binding constants log KQ coincide suggesting a good quality of the theoretical model. Overall the 8-acetyl-7-O-arylpiperazinyl-4-methylcoumarin derivatives represent valuable lead compounds to be further tested in various preclinical assays as a possible chemotherapeutics against CNS diseases. Studied coumarins can be metabolized by cytochrome P450 to aldehydes and hydroxy derivatives. The existence of other binding sites inside HSA than Sudlow\u2019s site 1 was postulated. The longer aliphatic linker between coumarin and piperazine moieties favored binding to HSA in other than Sudlow site 1 pocket.",

     "abstract": "Drug resistance and cancer cells metastasis have been the leading causes of chemotherapy failure and cancer-associated death in breast cancer patients. In present, various active molecules either exhibiting novel mechanism of action such as inducing autophagy or inhibiting metastasis have been developed to address these problems. However, the compounds exhibiting such dual functions have rarely been described. Previous work in our group showed that TSA, as a synthetic analog of asperphenamate, induced autophagic cell death in breast cancer cells instead of apoptosis. Furthermore, the target enzyme of TSA was predicted to be cathepin L (Cat L) by natural product consensus pharmacophore strategy. Accumulated evidences have shown that cathepsins are closely associated with migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. It seemed likely that TSA-like molecules may possess the dual functions of inducing autophagy and inhibiting metastasis. Therefore, sixty optically active derivatives were firstly designed and synthesized by replacing the A-ring moiety of TSA with other substituted-phenyl sulfonyl groups. Further cathepsin inhibitory activity assay showed that (S, S) and (S, R) isomers displayed no activity against four kinds of cathepsins (L, S, K, B), while all derivatives tested were inactive toward K and B subtypes. Compound 6a with meta-bromo substituent displayed the greatest inhibitory activity, and its inhibitory capability against Cat L and S was 3.9 and 11.5-fold more potent than that of TSA, respectively. Molecular docking also exhibited that 6a formed more hydrogen bonds or \u03c0-\u03c0 contacts with Cat L or S than TSA. In order to determine whether 6a could play dual roles, its anti-cancer mechanism was further investigated. On the one hand, MDC staining experiment and western blotting analysis validated that 6a can induce autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells. On the other hand, its metastatic inhibitory ability was also confirmed by wound healing and transwell chamber experiment.",

In this regard, FABP4 recently demonstrated an interesting molecular target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, other metabolic diseases and some type of cancers. In the past years, hundreds of effective FABP4 inhibitors have been synthesized. In this paper, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model has been produced, in order to predict the bioactivity of FABP4 inhibitors. The methodology has been combined with a scaffold-hopping approach, allowing to identify three new molecules that act as effective inhibitors of this protein.

In fact, 10 of the active coumarins showed higher inhibition (IC50\u202f=\u202f7.01\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.28\u202f\u00b5M \u2013 43.31\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.63\u202f\u00b5M) than that of galanthamine. The most active ones were revealed to be 7-styryloxycoumarin (IC50\u202f=\u202f7.01\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.28\u202f\u00b5M) and 7-isopentenyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (IC50\u202f=\u202f8.18\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.74\u202f\u00b5M). In addition to the in vitro tests, MetaCore/MetaDrug binary QSAR models and docking simulations were applied to evaluate the active compounds by ligand-based and target-driven approaches. The predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of the compounds suggested that the compounds reveal lipophilic character and permeate blood brain barrier (BBB) and the ADME models predict higher human serum protein binding percentages (>50%) for the compounds. The calculated docking scores indicated that the coumarins showing remarkable BChE inhibition possessed favorable free binding energies in interacting with the ligand-binding domain of the target. Therefore, our results disclose that O-alkylcoumarins are promising selective inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes, particularly BChE in our case, which definitely deserve further studies.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurological disorder with diverse underlying pathological processes. Several lines of evidence suggest that BACE1 is a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD and its inhibition is of particular importance in AD treatment. Ten new 3-hydrazinyl-1,2,4-triazines bearing pendant aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole were synthesized as multifunctional ligands against AD. We show that compounds containing Cl and NO2 groups at the para position of the phenyl ring, namely compounds 7c (IC50\u202f=\u202f8.55\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.37\u202f\u00b5M) and 7d (IC50\u202f=\u202f11.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.01\u202f\u00b5M), possess promising BACE1 inhibitory potential. Furthermore, we assessed the neuroprotective activities of 7c and 7d derivatives in PC12 neuronal cell line, which showed moderate protection against amyloid \u03b2 peptide toxicity. In addition, compound 7d demonstrated metal chelating activity and moderate antioxidant potential (IC50\u202f=\u202f44.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.33\u202f\u00b5M). Molecular docking studies of these molecules revealed high-affinity binding to several amino acids of BACE1, which are essential for efficient inhibition. These results demonstrate that 1,2,4-triazine derivatives bearing an aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole have promising properties as therapeutic agents for AD.",

Demethyloleuropein is extracted from black olives drupes in very limited amounts and only in particular periods of the year. The availability of demethyloleuropein could be increased by a selective hydrolysis of the methyl ester moiety of oleuropein, a secoiridoid present in large amount in olive leaves. In this work we describe a new enzymatic method for carrying out a selective hydrolysis of oleuropein via the screening of a panel of hydrolases (lipases, esterases and proteases).

Lately, there has been a growing interest in its cytosolic C-terminal SAM domain (EphA2-SAM) as it engages protein modulators of receptor endocytosis and stability. Interestingly, EphA2-SAM binds the SAM domain from the lipid phosphatase Ship2 (Ship2-SAM) mainly producing pro-oncogenic outcomes. In an attempt to discover novel inhibitors of the EphA2-SAM/Ship2-SAM complex with possible anticancer properties, we focused on the central region of Ship2-SAM (known as Mid-Loop interface) responsible for its binding to EphA2-SAM. Starting from the amino acid sequence of the Mid-Loop interface virtual peptide libraries were built through ad hoc inserted mutations with either l- or d- amino acids and screened against EphA2-SAM by docking techniques. A few virtual hits were synthesized and experimentally tested by a variety of direct and competition-type interaction assays relying on NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance), MST (Microscale Thermophoresis) techniques. These studies guided the discovery of an original EphA2-SAM ligand antagonist of its interaction with Ship2-SAM.",

Investigation of their impact on Akt phosphorylation as a possible mechanism for the antiproliferative activity of this class of compounds revealed that these compounds might elicit a concentration-dependent mechanism via inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at the lower concentration. Molecular docking predicted their binding modes to Akt to involve polar head binding to the Pleckstrin homology domain and hydrophobic tail extension into a hydrophobic pocket connecting the Pleckstrin homology domain and the kinase domain.

Its extracellular fibrillar assemblies in pancreatic \u03b2-cells are responsible for type 2 diabetes. A three-step synthetic scheme was used to prepare these novel compounds using 2-(6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)-5-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-one as a key intermediate that was reacted with various diazo electrophiles to generate a library of compounds with yields ranging from 64 to 85%. The effect of the compounds on hIAPP amyloid fibril formation was evaluated with a thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence-based kinetic assay. Furthermore, TEM imaging was carried out to corroborate the interactions of the compounds with hIAPP and subsequent hIAPP inhibition at the different level of fibrillization. The CD spectroscopy showed that upon incubation with SSE15314 for 12\u202fh, the percentage of \u03b1-helices was maintained to a level of hIAPP at 0\u202fh. The current study presents identification and characterization of SSE15314 as the hit, which completely inhibited the fibril formation and can be further optimized into a lead compound.",

The scientific basis for its action has been attributed to the action of phytoestrogens. This study aimed to investigate the estrogen-like activity of isoflavonoids isolated from P. lobata root and their safety with respect to their effect on breast cancer cell proliferation. In an E-screen assay, crude MeOH extract of PLR significantly increased the proliferation of MCF-7 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the four fractions obtained by solvent fractionation of MeOH extract, the n-BuOH fraction had significant estrogen-like activities at all concentrations tested. Phytochemical analysis of the n-BuOH fraction led to the isolation of 10 isoflavones (1\u201310), among which genistein (10) had significant estrogen-like activities at all concentrations tested. These activities were significantly enhanced by treatment with genistein and 17\u03b2-estradiol compared with 17\u03b2-estradiol alone, and this effect was mediated by decreased expression of estrogen receptor (ER)\u03b1 and phospho-ER\u03b1 in MCF-7 cells. In a cell cytotoxicity assay, genistein (10) exhibited significant cytotoxicity in both ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. This cytotoxicity was characterized by the induction of apoptotic cells stained with annexin V conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and involved activation of mitochondria-independent and -dependent apoptosis pathways in MCF-7 cells. Our results demonstrated that genistein (10) has estrogen-like effects dependent on ER pathway activation and anti-proliferative effects mediated by the apoptosis pathway rather than the ER pathway in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.",

The compounds 2j, 2h, 2t and 2u displayed acceptable responses against intracellular amastigote compared to reference drug, excellent antileishmanial activities against axenic amastigote (LD50 ranging from 1 to 4\u202f\u03bcM) and relative low toxicities on peritoneal macrophages. To validate the efficacy of these four derivatives, an in vitro evaluation was performed against an antimony-resistant amastigote strain; identifying to 2h and 2u as promising antileishmanial leads for further pharmacokinetics and in vivo studies. Experimental mechanism assays putted in evidences that the most active compounds act as folate inhibitor. A tentative molecular docking on pteridine reductase 1 (PTR1) enzyme showed that the most active quinazolinones 2j and 2t are located in almost identical place compared with methotrexate reference into active site.",

IMRG4 damages the bacterial membranes causing membrane depolarization and permeabilization, as determined by loss of salt tolerance, flow cytometric analysis, propidium idodie and fluorescent microscopy. It reduces the intracellular invasion of HEK-293 cells by S. aureus and decreases the staphylococcal load in different organs of infected mice models. In addition to anti-staphylococcal activity, IMRG4 inhibits the multidrug efflux pump, NorA, which was determined by molecular docking and EtBr efflux assays. In combination, IMRG4 significantly reduces the MIC of norfloxacin for clinical strains of S. aureus including VISA. Development of resistance against IMRG4 alone and in combination with norfloxacin was low and IMRG4 prolongs the post-antibiotic effect of norfloxacin. These virtues combined with the low toxicity of IMRG4, assessed by MTT assay and haemolysis, makes it an ideal candidate to enter drug development pipeline against S. aureus.",

In addition, 5 reversibly and competitively inhibited hMAO-A and hMAO-B with Ki values of 0.030 and 0.91\u202f\u00b5M, respectively. Genkwanin (4) was also observed to strongly inhibit hMAO-A and hMAO-B (IC50\u202f=\u202f0.14 and 0.35\u202f\u00b5M, respectively), and competitively inhibit hMAO-A and hMAO-B (Ki\u202f=\u202f0.097 and 0.12\u202f\u00b5M, respectively). Molecular docking simulation reveals that the binding affinity of 5 with hMAO-A (\u221218.49\u202fkcal/mol) is higher than that observed with hMAO-B (0.19\u202fkcal/mol). Compound 5 interacts with hMAO-A at four possible residues (Asn181, Gln215, Thr336, and Tyr444), while hMAO-B forms a single hydrogen bond at Glu84. These findings suggest that compound 5 as well as 4 can be considered as novel potent and reversible hMAO-A and/or hMAO-B inhibitors or useful lead compounds for future development of hMAO inhibitors in neurological disorder therapies.",

The unique structural arrangements of AChE peripheral anionic site (PAS) and catalytic site (CAS) joined by a narrow gorge, prompted us to design the inhibitors that can interact with dual binding sites of AChE. Eighteen homo- and heterodimers of desloratadine and carbazole (already available tricyclic building blocks) were synthesized and tested for their inhibition potential against electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) and equine serum butyrylcholinesterase (eqBChE). We identified a six-carbon tether heterodimer of desloratadine and indanedione based tricyclic dihydropyrimidine (4c) as potent and selective inhibitor of eeAChE with IC50 value of 0.09\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.003\u202f\u03bcM and 1.04\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08\u202f\u03bcM (for eqBChE) with selectivity index of 11.1. Binding pose analysis of potent inhibitors suggest that tricyclic ring is well accommodated into the AChE active site through hydrophobic interactions with Trp84 and Trp279. The indanone ring of most active heterodimer 4b is stabilized into the bottom of the gorge and forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the important catalytic triad residue Ser200.",

Furthermore, STP-LMWC-IONPs exhibited quenching effect on lysozyme fluorescence spectrum at pH 9.0 due to binding of Na+ counterions to the protein, confirming denaturation of the latter. After HEWL interaction with STP-LMWC-IONPs (pH 9.0), CD spectra revealed a conformational change in the secondary structure of HEWL. Also, counterion induced lysozyme inactivation, due to interaction with nanoparticles at pH 9.0, was confirmed by enzymatic activity assay involving lysis of Micrococcus lysodeikticus. In conclusion, pH 9.0 was observed to be a more favorable condition, compared to pH 7.4, for the strongest electrostatic interaction between lysozyme and NPs. We postulate that the counterions in nanoparticle surface-coating can ameliorate protein misfolding or unfolding and also prevent their aggregation and, therefore, can be considered as a powerful and potential therapeutic strategy to treat incurable neurodegenerative disorders.",

Two control cationic lipids N14-As and Toc-NOH are designed in such a way that one is with ascorbic acid moiety and no tocopherol moiety; another is with tocopherol moiety and no ascorbic acid moiety respectively. All the three cationic lipids can form self-assembled aggregates. The antioxidant efficiencies of the three lipids were compared with free ascorbic acid. The cationic lipids (Toc-As, N14-As and Toc-NOH) were formulated individually with a well-known fusogenic co-lipid DOPE and characterization studies such as DNA binding, heparin displacement, size, charge, circular dichroism were performed. The biological characterization studies such as cell viability assay and in vitro transfection studies were carried out with the above formulations in HepG2, Neuro-2a, CHO andHEK-293T cell lines. The three formulations showed their transfection efficiencies with highest in Toc-As, moderate inN14-As and least in Toc-NOH. Interestingly, the transfection efficiency observed with the antioxidant based conjugated lipid Toc-As is found to be approximately two and half fold higher than the commercially available lipofectamine 2000 at 4:1 charge ratio in Hep G2 cell lines. In the other cell lines studied the efficiency of Toc-As is found to be either higher or similarly active compared to lipofectamine 2000. The physicochemical characterization results show that Toc-As lipid is showing maximum antioxidant potency, strong binding with pDNA, least size and optimal zeta potential. It is also found to be least toxic in all the cell lines studied especially in Neuro-2a cell lines when compared to other two lipids. In summary, the designed antioxidant lipid can be exploited as a delivering system for treating ROS related diseases such as malignancy, brain stroke, etc.",

A standard methylene blue (MB+) method was applied to measure the capacity for the hydrogen sulfide generation of all the target derivatives. One particular molecule A1, which contained \u03b1-thioctic acid moiety for hydrogen sulfide donating, manifested more potent antiproliferative activity.

The ensuing biological assays revealed central role of apoptosis in A1\u2019s mode of action for antiproliferative efficacy, which led to further confirmation of G1 phase cell cycle arrest, mitochondria membrane potential collapse and apoptotic activation in Bel-7402 cells.

This article is about a new material with antibiofilm and antimicrobial properties combining polyurethane and Hypericum perforatum extract (PHPE) together. Antimicrobial effect of H. perforatum extract was determined against three clinical pathogens; C. albicans, E. coli and S. aureus. The highest antimicrobial activity of H. perforatum extract was found against S. aureus strain. Antibiofilm analysis results revealed that H. perforatum was also inhibited by the biofilm formation of S. aureus by 56.85%. The combination of polyurethane material and H. perforatum extract (PHPE) resulted in 92.85% decrease in S. aureus biofilm compared to control group. The reduction of S. aureus after H. perforatum incorporation was revealed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) study.

     "abstract": "Overexpression of NTPDases leads to a number of pathological situations such as thrombosis, and cancer. Thus, effective inhibitors are required to combat these pathological situations. Different classes of NTPDase inhibitors are reported so far including nucleotides and their derivatives, sulfonated dyes such as reactive blue 2, suramin and its derivatives, and polyoxomatalates (POMs). Suramin is a well-known and potent NTPDase inhibitor, nonetheless, a range of side effects are also associated with it. Reactive blue 2 also had non-specific side effects that become apparent at high concentrations. In addition, most of the NTPDase inhibitors are high molecular weight compounds, always required tedious chemical steps to synthesize. Hence, there is still need to explore novel, low molecular weight, easy to synthesize, and potent NTPDase inhibitors.Keeping in mind the known NTPDase inhibitors with imine functionality and nitrogen heterocycles, Schiff bases of tryptamine, 1\u201326, were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques such as EI-MS, HREI-MS, 1H-, and 13C NMR. All the synthetic compounds were evaluated for the inhibitory avidity against activities of three major isoforms of NTPDases: NTPDase-1, NTPDase-3, and NTPDase-8. Cumulatively, eighteen compounds were found to show potent inhibition (Ki\u202f=\u202f0.0200\u20130.350\u202f\u03bcM) of NTPDase-1, twelve (Ki\u202f=\u202f0.071\u20131.060\u202f\u03bcM) of NTPDase-3, and fifteen compounds inhibited (Ki\u202f=\u202f0.0700\u20134.03\u202f\u03bcM) NTPDase-8 activity.

Here, we describe the results of the NMR fragment-based screening conducted against CD44 by which we found eight new hit compounds that bind to the receptor with the affinity in milimolar range. The NMR-based characterization revealed that there are two possible binding modes for these compounds, and for some of them the binding is no longer possible in the presence of hyaluronic acid.

Recently, targeting ERK has evolved as a potentially attractive strategy to overcome this resistance. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of novel series of fused naphthofuro[3,2-c]quinoline-6,7,12-triones 3a-f and pyrano[3,2-c]quinoline-6,7,8,13-tetraones 5a,b and 6, as potential ERK inhibitors.

In order to draw structure and activity relationships we tested natural and synthetical capsaicinoids as well as synthetical capsinoids. In an accumulation assay these compounds were evaluated for their ability to accumulate ethidium bromide into mycobacterial cells, a well-known substrate for efflux pumps. Capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin, the two most abundant capsaicinoids in Capsicum species, proved to be superior efflux pump inhibitors compared to the standard verapamil.

Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe (Zingiberaceae), an indigenous plant of India, has been used traditionally in Ayurveda and folk medicine. As part of our ongoing efforts to screen traditional medicinal plants exhibiting pharmacological potential and to characterize the compounds involved, we examined the anti-inflammatory effects of the MeOH extract of C. zedoaria rhizomes using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 murine macrophage cells and found that MeOH extract inhibited the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 23.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.77\u202f\u03bcg/mL). In our efforts to characterize the compounds responsible for these anti-inflammatory effects, bioactivity-guided fractionation of the MeOH extract and chemical investigation of its active hexane-soluble fraction led to the successful isolation of five sesquiterpenes (1\u20135), the structures of which were elucidated by NMR spectroscopic analysis and LC/MS analysis.

Studies were carried out with pooled human liver microsomes. A lot of analyzed compounds show activity for inhibiting 11\u03b2-HSD1 (up to 59.15% at concentration 10\u202f\u00b5mol/l). Molecular docking simulation show that the molecule of the most active compound: 7-(cyclohexylmethyl)-2-iodomethyl-2,3-dihydrothiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-5-one forms hydrogen bonds with Ala172, Leu171, Leu215 or Tyr177. In addition, the cycloalkane moiety can create the hydrophobic contacts with NADP+. For this compound also the most favourable Docking Score value was obtained.The most active compound only in the slight degree inhibits 11\u03b2-HSD2 activity and is a selective inhibitor of 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1.

Meantime, [35S] labeled 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine 5\u2032-phosphosulfate (PAP35S) and [14C] glucuronic acid (Glc A) were adopted to label HS-FK506 conjugates, respectively, to evaluate their efficiency of nucleus entry, as a result, 14C Glc A was sensitive, effective and reliable whereas PAP35S gave rise to a mixture of labeled compounds, hampering the understanding of structure-function relationship of nucleus HS. Compared with the corresponding HS, the amount of HS-FK506 conjugates to translocate into nucleus from radioactive assay experiments sharply increased, e.g. tridecasaccharide-FK506 1d increased by approximate 10 folds, offering a simple and robust platform for enabling hydrophilic compounds including carbohydrates to translocate into nucleus and shedding light on their biological functions.",

The early stage interaction between compound 7 and the A\u03b242 monomer was investigated by replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations and docking studies. Our theoretical results revealed that compound 7 can elongate the helical conformation state of an early stage A\u03b242 monomer and it helps preventing the formation of \u03b2-sheet structures by interacting with key residues in the central hydrophobic cluster (CHC). This strategy where early \u201con-pathway\u201d events are monitored by small molecules will help the development of new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

Specifically, against the cytosolic hCA I, II, transmembrane hCA IV and the tumor-associated, membrane-bound hCA IX.The compounds were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of chlorine atoms from cyanuric chloride (2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine) using environmentally friendly water-based synthetic conditions. The products yields ranged in the interval of 43\u201397%. Purity of the products was verified by the HPLC-DAD-ESI-Q-TOF MS method. Identity of the products was confirmed by the same method plus NMR and IR.The products showed weak inhibition of the cytosolic, off-target isozyme hCA II, but some of them were low nanomolar (i.e. strong) inhibitors of the tumor-associated hCA IX. The series offered representatives selective towards isozymes hCA I, IV and IX. 2,2\u2032-((6-((4-sulfamoylphenethyl)amino)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl)bis(imino))disuccinic acid demonstrated highest selectivity to the tumor-associated isoform hCA IX over off-target isozymes, with impressive KI ratio (hCA II/hCA IX) 213.9 and inhibition constant equal to acetazolamide (KI\u202f=\u202f25.8\u202fnM). Although the selectivities of some other products, e.g. those conjugating Leu and Glu, were a bit lower (188.7 and 84.3, respectively) their inhibition constants were similar to acetazolamide too (24.0 and 27.1, respectively).The selected most impressive results from the inhibition study were interpreted via molecular modeling experiment (docking in Glide) revealing different inter-molecular enzyme-substrate interaction of 2,2\u2032-((6-((4-sulfamoylphenethyl)amino)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diyl)bis(imino))disuccinic acid within specific hCA IX and hCA II microregions.

     "abstract": "A set of 19 oxadiazolone (OX) derivatives have been investigated for their antimycobacterial activity against two pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria, Mycobacterium marinum and Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and the avirulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) mc26230. The encouraging minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values obtained prompted us to test them against virulent M. tb H37Rv growth either in broth medium or inside macrophages. The OX compounds displayed a diversity of action and were found to act either on extracellular M. tb growth only with moderated MIC50, or both intracellularly on infected macrophages as well as extracellularly on bacterial growth. Of interest, all OX derivatives exhibited very low toxicity towards host macrophages. Among the six potential OXs identified, HPOX, a selective inhibitor of extracellular M. tb growth, was selected and further used in a competitive labelling/enrichment assay against the activity-based probe Desthiobiotin-FP, in order to identify its putative target(s). This approach, combined with mass spectrometry, identified 18 potential candidates, all being serine or cysteine enzymes involved in M. tb lipid metabolism and/or in cell wall biosynthesis. Among them, Ag85A, CaeA, TesA, KasA and MetA have been reported as essential for in vitro growth of M. tb and/or its survival and persistence inside macrophages. Overall, our findings support the assumption that OX derivatives may represent a novel class of multi-target inhibitors leading to the arrest of M. tb growth through a cumulative inhibition of a large number of Ser- and Cys-containing enzymes involved in various important physiological processes.",

However, the bioconversion of structurally more complex esters with polar functional groups is less well understood, especially in humans. Therefore, it is not clear if ester prodrugs can be utilized for targeted drug delivery. In the present study a brain-targeted ester prodrug (1) of ketoprofen, utilizing the l-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) was prepared and the enzymes involved in its metabolism in human plasma and liver S9 subcellular fraction as well as rat brain S9 fraction were identified. Furthermore, species differences among mouse, rat and human plasma and liver S9 fraction were compared.

Moreover, both rodent species showed more efficient bioconversion in the liver S9 fractions compared to human and relatively efficient bioconversion in the brain S9 fractions.

The results revealed that compounds 15,16,17,24 and 25 showed the highest antitumor activity against all tested cell lines compared to Doxorubicin. In order to explain the expected mode of action of the observed anticancer activity, compounds 15,16,17,24 and 25 were selected to screen their DNA binding affinity and enzyme inhibitory activity against DNA polymerase, thymidylate synthase and tyrosine kinase. The results revealed that the tested compounds showed good DNA binding affinity as well as good inhibitory activity against the three enzymes which might explain the observed anticancer activity of the target compounds.",

The enzyme is of interest due to its potential as a biocatalyst for the production of sugar 1-phosphates and due to its involvement in the inherited metabolic disease type II galactosemia. It has been previously shown that a region (residues 231\u2013245) in human galactokinase often has altered mobility when active site residues are varied. We hypothesised that the reverse may be true and that designing changes to this region might affect the functioning of the active site of the enzyme. Focussing on four residues (Leu-231, Gln-242, Glu-244 and Glu-245) we conducted molecular dynamics simulations to explore the effects of changing these residues to glycine or serine. In most cases the variations resulted in local changes to the 231\u2013245 region and global changes to the root mean squared fluctuation (RMSF) of the protein. The four serine variants were expressed as recombinant proteins. All had altered steady state enzyme kinetic parameters with \u03b1-d-galactose as a substrate. However, these changes were generally less than ten-fold in magnitude. Changes were also observed with 2-deoxy-\u03b1-d-galactose, \u03b1-d-galactosamine and \u03b1-d-talose as substrates, including (in some cases) loss of detectable activity, suggesting that these variations can tune the specificity of the enzyme. This study demonstrates that activity and specificity of human galactokinase can be modulated by variations designed to affect active site flexibility. It is likely that this principle can be generalised to other enzymes.",

     "abstract": "It is still challenging to determine the potential targets of natural products, which is essential for further drug research and development. Due to its novel mechanism of action of inducing autophagy effects in breast cancer cells, asperphenamate has received our considerable attention. However, its unknown target inevitably impedes further study. In our previous work, the target enzyme of asperphenamate was predicted as cathepsin by the natural product consensus pharmacophore strategy. Then, asperphenamate and its three derivatives were chosen to study in detail by molecular docking calculations with AutoDock 4 suite. The docking results showed the three derivatives interacted more tightly with either cathepsin L or cathepsin S than with asperphenamate. The ortho-benzyloxyl phenylacetyl derivative 1 and\u00a0p-toluenesulfonyl derivative 3 showed similar interactions with cathepsin L and adopted a better geometric shape within the binding pocket than did the N-CBZ-piperidyl analog 2. On the other hand, compound 2 formed more hydrogen bonds than 1 and 3 to make it tightly bind within cathepsin S. The cathepsin inhibitory activity assay verified the molecular simulation results. Compound 2 was remarkably less active than 1 and 3 against cathepsin L. However, compound 2 showed the strongest potency against cathepsin S with IC50 of 13.12\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.29\u202f\u03bcM. Considering that cathepsin S plays a vital role in the process of metastasis in breast cancer cells, the inhibitory effect of 2 on migration and invasion was further studied in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells by wound healing and transwell chamber assays. The results illustrated that 2 exhibited an apparent inhibitory ability to the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Next, 2 will be chosen as a lead compound to develop novel double functional chemotherapeutic agents with both novel mechanisms of action against apoptosis-resistant cancer cells, such as inducing autophagy and inhibiting cancer metastasis.",

The synthesized compounds were targeted as new candidates to extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) with considerable antineoplastic activity. The synthesis involved the reactions of 2 equivalents of 4-hydroxy-2(1H)-quinolinones 1a-f and one equivalent of 1,4-naphthoquinone (2) in a mixture of ethanol/dimethylformamide (1:1) as a solvent and 0.5\u202fmL Et3N.

Bioassay-based analysis of the EtOH extract led to the successful isolation of two sterols, ergosterol peroxide (1) and 9,11-dehydroergosterol peroxide (2); three diterpenes, dehydroabietic acid (3), 7-oxocallitrisic acid, (4) and pimaric acid (5); and two triterpenes, dehydroeburicoic acid monoacetate (6) and eburicoic acid acetate (7) from the active hexane-soluble fraction.

These findings demonstrate that the EtOH extract of P. cocos sclerotia is worth consideration as a new potential source of bioactive compounds effective in the treatment of osteoporosis in the elderly, since the extract contains sterols that inhibit adipogenic differentiation as well as diterpenes that promote osteogenic differentiation from MSCs.",

The enzyme HheC exhibits a highly R enantioselectivity in the processes of dehalogenation of vicinal halohydrins and ring-opening of epoxides, which attracts more attentions in organic synthesis. Recently dozens of novel potential halohydrin dehalogenases have been identified by gene mining, however, most of the characterized enzymes showed low stereoselectivity. In this study, a novel halohydrin dehalogenase of HheA10 from Tsukamurella sp. 1534 has been heterologously expressed, purified and characterized. Substrate spectrum and kinetic resolution studies indicated the HheA10 was a highly S enantioselective enzyme toward several halohydrins, which produced the corresponding epoxides with the ee (enantiomeric excess) and E values up to >99% and >200 respectively. Our results revealed the HheA10 was a promising biocatalyst for the synthesis of enantiopure aromatic halohydrins and epoxides via enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic halohydrins. What\u2019s more important, the HheA10 as the first individual halohydrin dehalogenase with the highly S enantioselectivity provides a complementary enantioselectivity to the HheC.",

     "abstract": "The oncogenic transcriptional corepressor Nac1 contains a conserved POZ protein\u2013protein interaction module that mediates homodimerization or heterodimerization with itself or other POZ proteins. The dimerization has been recognized as an attractive target for cancer therapy. Here, we attempted to (i) discover those potential binding partners of Nac1 in the human genome, (ii) derive key peptide segments from the complex interface of Nac1 with its putative partners, and (iii) improve the peptide binding affinity to Nac1 POZ domain. In the procedure, Nac1 POZ dimerization with 136 human POZ domains was modeled, simulated and analyzed at atomic level to elucidate structural basis, energetic property and dynamics behavior. Two hotspot regions, namely \u03b11-helix and \u03b12/\u03b13-hairpin, at the dimerization interface were identified that are responsible for stabilizing the formed POZ\u2013POZ dimer complexes. The \u03b11-helix and \u03b12/\u03b13-hairpin were stripped from the interface to derive their respective isolated SIP peptides, which, however, exhibited a large flexibility and intrinsic disorder in free state, and thus would incur a considerable penalty upon rebinding to Nac1 POZ domain. By carefully examining the natively folded structures of \u03b11-helix and \u03b12/\u03b13-hairpin in protein context and their interaction modes with the domain, we rationally designed a hydrocarbon bridge and a disulfide bond separately for the two peptides in order to constrain their conformational flexibility in free state, thus largely minimizing the flexibility penalty. Consequently, three \u03b11-helix peptides derived from Nac1, Miz1 and Slx4 were stapled by all-hydrocarbon bridge, while four \u03b12/\u03b13-hairpin peptides derived from Nac1, Bacd1, Klh28 and Mynn were cyclized by disulfide bond. Binding affinity analysis revealed that, as designed, these peptides were converted from non- or weak binders to moderate or good binders of Nac1 POZ domain upon the stapling and cyclization.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the lipid-regulating effects of alisol compounds are reported that include alisol B, alisol A 24-acetate (24A), alisol A and an alisol B - 24A - alisol A mixture (content ratio\u202f=\u202f1:1:1). The effects on the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), a key lipid-modulating enzyme, were studied to investigate the molecular mechanism of lipid-regulating activity of alisols. The effects of alisols on regulating blood lipids and the activities of LPL were determined using a reagent kit method. The structure of LPL was obtained by homology modeling and the interactive mechanism of alisol monomers and the mixture with LPL was investigated by molecular simulation. The alisol monomer and mixture were shown to regulate blood lipids, suggesting that alisols may decrease the level of triglyceride (TG) by improving the activity of LPL. The order of intensity was: mixture\u202f>\u202falisol A\u202f>\u202falisol B\u202f>\u202f24A, indicating that alisols of alismatis rhizoma feature a synergistic effect on LPL. The N- and C-terminus of LPL both represented the catalytic active domains of this lipid-regulating effect. Cys306, Gln129 and Ser166 were the key amino acid residues resulting in the lipid-regulating effect of the alisol monomer while Ser166 and Arg18 were found to be responsible for the lipid-regulating effect of the mixture. The C-terminus of LPL was indirectly involved in the enzymatic process. A folded side chain of alisols or the parent ring was found to bind somewhat weaker to LPL than an open side chain or parent ring. The hydroxyl groups on the C14-, C22-, C28-, C30- and C31-terminus in the side chain, the ring ether structure in C23-position, and the acetyl group in C29-position represented the key sites for the lipid-regulating action of alisols. Meanwhile, the C30-site hydroxyl group played an important role in the synergistic effect of the alisol mixture.",

In this paper, phenoxy containing cholic acid derivatives with excellent drug-likeness have been designed, synthesized, and assayed as agents against cholesterol accumulation in Raw264.7 macrophages. The most active compound 14b reduced total cholesterol accumulation in Raw264.7 cells up to 30.5% at non-toxic 10\u202f\u03bcM and dosage-dependently attenuated oxLDL-induced foam cell formation. Western blotting and qPCR results demonstrate that 14b reduced both cholesterol and lipid in Raw264.7 cells through (1) increasing the expression of cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1, (2) accelerating ApoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux. Through a cell-based luciferase reporter assay and molecular docking analysis, LXR was identified as the potential target for 14b. Interestingly, unlike conventional LXR agonist, 14b did not increase lipogenesis gene SREBP-1c expression. Overall, these diverse properties disclosed herein highlight the potential of 14b as a promising lead for further development of multifunctional agents in the therapy of cardiovascular disease.",

Moreover, N-alkyl salts of these tetrahydroisoquinolines were used as starting material to synthesize a series of new 1-aryl-7,8-dihydroxy 3-tetrahydrobenzazepines derivatives with electron-withdrawing substituents at C-2 position by the diastereoselective Stevens rearrangement. The structure-activity relationship of these compounds was explored to evaluate the effect of the functional group at C-2 in benzazepines and the modification in the aryl group at the isoquinoline C-1 position towards the affinity and selectivity for the mentioned receptors. The 1-aryl-6,7-dihydroxy tetrahydroisoquinoline 4c shows significant affinity towards D2 receptor, with Ki value of 31\u202fnM. This significant affinity can be attributed to the presence of a thiomethyl group, and it is the most active 1-aryl-6,7-dihydroxy tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative reported to date.",

The results clearly demonstrated that all tested bioactive constituents from Cortex Mori Radicis including sanggenone C (SC), sanggenone D (SD), kuwanon C (KC), kuwanon G (KG), morin and morusin displayed strong to moderate inhibitory effects towards PL with the IC50 values ranging from 0.77\u202f\u03bcM to 20.56\u202f\u03bcM. Further investigations on inhibition kinetics demonstrated that SC, SD, KC and KG functioned as potent and mixed inhibitors against PL-mediated 4-MU oleate hydrolysis, with the Ki values less than 5.0\u202f\u03bcM. Furthermore, molecular docking simulations demonstrated that SD (the most potent PL inhibitor from Cortex Mori Radicis) could create strong interaction with Ser152 (the key amino acid in the catalytic triad) of PL via hydrogen bonding. All these findings provided a new powerful evidence for explaining the hypolipidemic effect of Cortex Mori Radicis, also suggested that some abundant natural compounds in this herbal medicine could be served as lead compounds for the development of new PL inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Continuous development of new antibacterial agents is necessary to counter the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Polymyxins are considered as drugs of last resort to combat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Structural optimization of polymyxins requires an in-depth understanding of its structure and how it relates to its antibacterial activity. Herein, the effect of hydrophobicity was explored by adding a secondary fatty acyl component of varying length onto the polymyxin structure at the amine side-chain of l-diaminobutyric acid at position 1, resulting to the development of dilipid polymyxins. The incorporation of an additional lipid was found to confer polymyxin activity against Gram-positive bacteria, to which polymyxins are inherently inactive against. The dilipid polymyxins showed selective antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, dilipid polymyxin 1 that consists of four carbon-long aliphatic lipids displayed the ability to enhance the antibacterial potency of other antibiotics in combination against P. aeruginosa, resembling the adjuvant activity of the well-known outer membrane permeabilizer polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN). Interestingly, our data revealed that dilipid polymyxin 1 and PMBN are substrates for the MexAB-OprM efflux system, and therefore are affected by efflux. In contrast, dilipid polymyxin analogs that consist of longer lipids and colistin were not affected by efflux, suggesting that the lipid component of polymyxin plays an important role in resisting active efflux. Our work described herein provides an understanding to the polymyxin structure that may be used to usher the development of enhanced polymyxin analogs.",

All the compounds have been evaluated for their DOT1L inhibitory activities. The results showed that most of the compounds have strong anti DOT1L activities. Compounds 3e, 8h and 9e are the most potential ones from each category with the IC50 values of 1.06\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.35\u202f\u03bcM, 5.72\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.56\u202f\u03bcM and 3.55\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.28\u202f\u03bcM, respectively. Such inhibitors expressed significant binding interactions with DOT1L by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding assay. The results of molecular docking experiments suggested that they could occupy the SAM binding pocket of DOT1L. Compounds 8h and 9e exhibited better inhibitory activities but poor selectivities against the both MLL-rearranged MV4-11 cells and the non MLL-rearranged Kasumi-1 cells than those of 3a and 3e, which suggested that the introduction of the amino side chain would be beneficial for their anti leukemia cells proliferation activities, possibly due to the improvement of the fat solubility. Additionally, the direct cellular inhibition activities were found that compound 9e could effectively down-regulate both the level of H3k79 methylation and MLL-rearranged leukemia gene expression of Hoxa9 and Meis1 in MV4-11 in the qRT-PCR and western blot studies. These observations suggested DOT1L was one of the potential targets but perhaps not the most pivotal one for these compounds, which made their poor selectivities against leukemia cells proliferation.",

Herein, we designed a strategy to control miRNA biogenesis with light controllable inhibitor targeting the pre-miRNA processing by Dicer. By conjugating two non-inhibiting units, a low affinity Dicer inhibitor and a pre-miRNA binder, through a photocleavable linker, the bifunctional molecule obtained could inhibit miRNA production. Taking advantage of the photocleavable property of the linker, the bifunctional inhibitor can be fragmented into separate non-inhibiting units and therefore be deactivated by light.

Enantioselective hydrolysis of \u03b2-butyrolactone with immobilized Candida antarctica lipase-B (CAL-B) results in (R)-\u03b2-butyrolactone and (S)-\u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid, which are easily converted to (R) or (S)-ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate and reduced to (R) or (S)-1,3 butanediol. Either enantiomer of ethyl-3-hydroxybutyrate and 1,3 butanediol are then coupled, again using CAL-B, to produce the ketone body ester product. This is an efficient, scalable, atom-economic, chromatography-free, and low cost synthetic method to produce the ketone body esters.",

The carbamates and salicylanilides exhibited mostly a moderate inhibition of both cholinesterase enzymes with IC50 values ranging from 5 to 235\u202f\u00b5M. IC50 values for AChE were in a narrower concentration range when compared to BChE, but many of the compounds produced a balanced inhibition of both cholinesterases. The derivatives were comparable or superior to rivastigmine for AChE inhibition, but only a few of carbamates also for BChE. Several structure-activity relationships were identified, e.g., N-phenethylcarbamates produce clearly favourable BChE inhibition.

Inspired by previous studies of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines to find out safer and effective topoisomerase targeted anticancer agent, twenty-seven 2-phenol-4,6-dichlorophenyl-pyridines were designed, synthesized, and tested for their topo I and II\u03b1 inhibitory and anti-proliferative activity.

Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) catalyzes this posttranslational modification, which is essential for ghrelin to bind and activate its cognate GHS-R1a receptor. Inhibition of GOAT offers a potential avenue for modulating ghrelin signaling for therapeutic effect. Defining the molecular characteristics of ghrelin that lead to binding and recognition by GOAT will facilitate the development and optimization of GOAT inhibitors. We show that small peptide mimics of ghrelin substituted with 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid in place of the serine at the site of octanoylation act as submicromolar inhibitors of GOAT. Using these chemically modified analogs of desacyl ghrelin, we define key functional groups within the N-terminal sequence of ghrelin essential for binding to GOAT and determine GOAT\u2019s tolerance to backbone methylations and altered amino acid stereochemistry within ghrelin.

     "abstract": "\u03b1-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR; P504S) is a promising novel drug target for prostate and other cancers. Assaying enzyme activity is difficult due to the reversibility of the \u2018racemisation\u2019 reaction and the difficulties in the separation of epimeric products; consequently few inhibitors have been described and no structure\u2013activity relationship study has been performed. This paper describes the first structure\u2013activity relationship study, in which a series of 23 known and potential rational AMACR inhibitors were evaluated. AMACR was potently inhibited (IC50\u202f=\u202f400\u2013750\u202fnM) by ibuprofenoyl-CoA and derivatives. Potency was positively correlated with inhibitor lipophilicity. AMACR was also inhibited by straight-chain and branched-chain acyl-CoA esters, with potency positively correlating with inhibitor lipophilicity. 2-Methyldecanoyl-CoAs were ca. 3-fold more potent inhibitors than decanoyl-CoA, demonstrating the importance of the 2-methyl group for effective inhibition. Elimination substrates and compounds with modified acyl-CoA cores were also investigated, and shown to be potent inhibitors. These results are the first to demonstrate structure\u2013activity relationships of rational AMACR inhibitors and that potency can be predicted by acyl-CoA lipophilicity. The study also demonstrates the utility of the colorimetric assay for thorough inhibitor characterisation.",

Albeit many efforts are being employed in the characterization of the interaction processes with S2 subsite, little is known about the cruzain S3 subsite. In this work, we show a brief but consistent study to identify favorable substitutions in P3 of dipeptidyl nitriles that increase cruzain affinity. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified some dipeptidyl nitrile analogs with modifications at P3 position that had higher cruzain inhibition than the original unsubstituted compound. A matched molecular pair analysis shows the importance of including a chlorine atom in the P3-meta position. The modifications implemented in P3 are confirmed when profiling the thermodynamic parameters via isothermal titration calorimetry. The classical enthalpy-entropy compensation phenomenon, in which enthalpy changes are counterbalanced by entropy results in a small modification of \u0394G.

Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is an emerging threat to the mankind and hence, there is an urge to develop alternative therapies. Targeting quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication process regulates various biofilm and virulence factors would be a most promising alternate which curbs the pathogenesis without killing the bacteria, unlike antibiotics. SdiA, a quorum regulator is well-known to control the behavioural changes of UPEC in establishing biofilm and virulence. Therefore, we have hypothesized that the SdiA-selective inhibitors derived from the plant, Melia dubia using the molecular docking would be a remarkable therapeutic candidate to down regulate the UPEC biofilm and virulence phenotypes. In this study, we have designed, synthesized and characterized the fructose-furoic acid ester by NMR and ESI-MS. In vitro studies revealed that the QSI-MD selectively inhibits UPEC adherence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis showed the effectiveness of QSI-MD to inhibit the UPEC biofilm. Genetic studies using qRT-PCR revealed the down-regulation of quorum sensing regulated genes (fimA, csgA, espA). Based on the findings, we could propose that the QSI-MD could possibly act through SdiA and show target-specific inhibition of biofilm and virulence. It is notable that more than 70 bacterial species execute their communication through the SdiA homologues (LuxIR system). Hence, the QSI-MD could be further developed as a broad-spectrum anti-infective drug.",

Such a negative chemical shift of 1H NMR spectrum was reproduced by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and explained by the shielding effect from the pyran-2-one ring over the hydrogen atom in the 3D conformations.

Despite the valuable findings of curcumin against different cancer cells, the clinical use of curcumin in cancer treatment is limited due to its extremely low aqueous solubility and instability, which lead to poor in vivo bioavailability and limited therapeutic effects. We therefore focused in the present study to evaluate the anti-tumor potential of curcumin analogues on the human breast carcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7, as well as their effects on non-tumorigenic normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10). The IC50 values of curcumin analogue J1 in these cancer cell lines were determined to be 5\u202fng/ml and 10\u202fng/ml, in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells respectively. Interestingly, at these concentrations, the J1 did not affect the viability of non-tumorigenic normal breast epithelial cells MCF-10. Furthermore, we found that J1 strongly induced growth arrest of these cancer cells by modulating the mitochondrial membrane potentials without significant effect on normal MCF-10 cells using JC-1 staining and flow cytometry analysis. Using annexin-V/PI double staining assay followed by flow cytometry analysis, we found that J1 robustly enhanced the induction of apoptosis by increasing the activity of caspases in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells. In addition, treatment of breast cancer cells with J1 revealed that, in contrast to the expression of cyclin B1, this curcumin analogue vigorously decreased the expression of cyclin A, CDK2 and cyclin E and subsequently sensitized tumor cells to cell cycle arrest. Most importantly, the phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR and PKC-theta in J1-treated cancer cells was markedly decreased and hence affecting the survival of these cancer cells. Most interestingly, J1-treated cancer cells exhibited a significant inhibition in the activation of RhoA followed by reduction in actin polymerization and cytoskeletal rearrangement in response to CXCL12. Our data reveal the therapeutic potential of the curcumin analogue J1 and the underlying mechanisms to fight breast cancer cells.",

The enzyme has one binding site for kolaflavanone with a binding constant (Ka) of 2.57\u202f\u00d7\u202f104\u202fL.mol\u22121 and effective Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) of 4.87\u202fnm. The bonding process was enthalpically driven. The reaction was not spontaneous and was predominantly characterized by Van der Waals forces and hydrogen bond. The flavonoid bonding slightly perturbed the secondary and tertiary structures of ALDH that was \u2018tryptophan-gated\u2019. The interaction was regulated by both diffusion and ionic strength. Molecular docking showed the binding of kolaflavanone was at the active site of ALDH and the participation of some amino acid residues in the complex formation with \u22129.6\u202fkcal\u202fmol\u22121 binding energy. The profiles of atomic fluctuations indicated the rigidity of the ligand-binding site during the simulation. With these, ALDH as a subtle nano-particle determinant of kolaviron bioavailability and efficacy is hereby proposed.",

     "abstract": "Lipoxygenases catalyze the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives to produce conjugated diene hydroperoxides. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (SBLO-1) has been the subject of intensive structural and mechanistic study, but the manner in which this enzyme binds substrates is uncertain. Previous studies suggest that the fatty acyl group of the substrate binds in an internal cavity near the catalytic iron with the polar end at the surface of the protein or perhaps external to the protein. To test this model, we have investigated two pairs of enantiomeric N-linoleoylamino acids as substrates for SBLO-1. If the amino acid moiety binds external to the protein, the kinetics and product distribution should show little or no sensitivity to the stereochemical configuration of the amino acid moiety. Consistent with this expectation, N-linoleoyl-l-valine (LLV) and N-linoleoyl-d-valine (LDV) are both good substrates with kcat/Km values that are equal within error and about 40% higher than kcat/Km for linoleic acid. Experiments with N-linoleoyl-l-tryptophan (LLT) and N-linoleoyl-d-tryptophan (LDT) were complicated by the low critical micelle concentrations (CMC\u202f=\u202f6\u20138\u202f\u03bcM) of these substances. Below the CMC, LDT is a better substrate by a factor of 2.7. The rates of oxygenation of LDT and LLT continue to rise above the CMC, with modest stereoselectivity in favor of the d enantiomer. With all of the substrates tested, the major product is the 13(S)-hydroperoxide, and the distribution of minor products is not appreciably affected by the configuration of the amino acid moiety. The absence of stereoselectivity with LLV and LDV, the modest magnitude of the stereoselectivity with LLT and LDT, and the ability micellar forms of LLT and LDT to increase the concentration of available substrate are all consistent with the hypothesis that the amino acid moiety binds largely external to SBLO-1 and interacts with it only weakly.",

In order to find the optimal reaction conditions, the influence of various parameters such as enzyme source, nucleophile:substrate ratio, enzyme:substrate ratio, solvent and temperature was studied. The excellent results obtained by lipase catalysis made the procedure very efficient considering their advantages such as mild reaction conditions and low environmental impact. Moreover, in order to explain the reactivity of glycyrrhetinic acid and the acetylated derivative to different nucleophiles in the enzymatic reactions, molecular docking studies were carried out.

All compounds were tested for the inhibitory effect on both of the cholinesterases, electric eel acetylcholinesterase (eeAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase from equine serum (eqBChE) and the inhibitory activity (expressed as IC50 values) was compared with that of the established drugs Galanthamine and Rivastigmine.

Thus far, compounds that inhibit the methylation or acetylation of histones have advanced in the clinic, but inhibitors of histone phosphorylation have lagged behind. Haspin is a kinase that phosphorylates histone H3 and is a promising anticancer target. Thus far only a handful of haspin inhibitors have been reported. Using a one-flask Doebner/Povarov reaction, we synthesized a library of compounds that potently inhibit haspin with IC50 values as low as 14\u202fnM.

This compound exhibited highest activity against leukaemia cell line (RPMI-8226) at 0.7244\u202f\u00b5M, renal cancer cell line (A498) at 0.8511\u202f\u00b5M and prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) at 0.7932\u202f\u00b5M on the NCI five dose assay test. The PTK assay provides promising activity at IC50 of 0.07\u202f\u00b5M in the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. Compound 31 had good intermolecular interaction with PTK in the molecular docking studies, this ligand-enzyme complex was found to stable in the MM-PBSA study over 100\u202fns. It had 54.22% oral bioavailability with Tmax of 0.60\u202fh which is higher compared to the dasatinib with bioavailability and Tmax of 14\u201334% and 1\u20131.42\u202fh respectively. Anticancer action of 31 was found to be impressive in pharmacokinetic studies making it a potential lead molecule.",

     "abstract": "Depravity of malaria in terms of morbidity and mortality in human beings makes it a major health issue in tropical and subtropical areas of the globe. Drug counterfeiting and non-adherence to the treatment regimen have significantly contributed to development and spread of multidrug resistance that has highlighted the need for development of novel and more efficient antimalarial drugs. Complexity associated with cancer disease and prevalence of diversified cell populations vindicates highly specific treatment options for treatment of cancer. Resistance to these anticancer agents has posed a great hindrance in successful treatment of cancer. Pondering this ongoing situation, it was speculated to develop novel compounds targeting malaria and cancer. Moving on the same aisle, we synthesized pyrazole acrylic acid based oxadiazole and amide derivatives using multi-step reaction pathways (6a\u2013x; 6a\u2032\u2013h\u2032). Schizont maturation inhibition assay was employed to determine antimalarial potential. Compound 6v emerged as the most potent antimalarial agent targeting falcipain-2 enzyme. Anticancer activity was done using sulforhodamine B assay. Compounds 6b\u2032 and 6g\u2032 demonstrated promising results against all the tested cell lines. Further, Microscopic view clearly indicated formation of apoptotic bodies, chromatin condensation, shrinkage of cells and bleb formation. Validation of the results was achieved using molecular docking studies. From the obtained results, it was observed that cyclization (oxadiazole) favored antimalarial activity while non-cyclized compounds (amides) emerged as better anticancer agents.",

This volatile constituent not only contributes to the aroma of saffron but has been reported to possess antidiabetic, antiulcer, antiasthamatic, anticonvulsant, antidepressant, cardioprotective, anticancer and UV protective properties. Most of these therapeutic actions are contributed by its potential to quench reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant properties of phytoconstituents are now being explored for developing photoprotective skin formulations. These bioactives have the potential to protect the epidermal and dermal layers of the skin which mainly comprises of elastin and collagen. When UV rays penetrate the dermal layers, there is an increased production of elastase, collagenase and hyaluronidase leading to degradation of collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid respectively. These dermal components are responsible to provide strength, elasticity and moisture to the skin. Due to frequent exposure to sunlight, these conditions tend to augment leading to wrinkle formation and sagging of skin.Although antioxidant properties of safranal have been established on various cell lines but till date no studies have been reported regarding the dermal enzyme inhibition activities. In the current research work, a comprehensive in vitro evaluation of antioxidant, anti-elastase, anti-collagenase, anti-hyaluronidase activities of safranal along with determination of sun protection factor (SPF) was carried out. The in vitro antioxidant activity was carried out by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method and its IC50 value was found to be 22.7\u202f\u03bcg/ml. The enzyme inhibition IC50 values of safranal for anti elastase activity were found to be 43.6\u202f\u03bcg/ml, 70\u202f\u03bcg/ml for antihyaluronidase activity and 9.4\u202f\u03bcg/ml for anticollagenase activity.

Its established free radical scavenging capability along with above characteristics make it a valuable component to be incorporated into herbal antiaging formulations.",

The inhibition of \u03b1-glucosidase, a key carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzyme, could serve as one of the effective methodology in both preventing and treating diabetes through controlling the postprandial glucose levels and suppressing postprandial hyperglycemia. In this context, three series of diamine-bridged bis-coumarinyl oxadiazole conjugates were designed and synthesized by one-pot multi-component methodology. The synthesized conjugates (4a\u2013j, 5a\u2013j, 6a\u2013j) were evaluated as potential inhibitors of glucosidases. Compound 6f containing 4,4\u2032-oxydianiline linker was identified as the lead and selective inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme with an IC50 value of 0.07\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.001\u202f\u03bcM (acarbose: IC50\u202f=\u202f38.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12\u202f\u03bcM).

In the current series, compound 12 showed most potent MAO-B inhibitor activity with IC50 value of 80\u202fnM and compound 7 was found to be most potent MAO-A inhibitor with IC50 value of 120\u202fnM and both the compounds were found reversible inhibitors. Compound 8 was found most selective MAO-A inhibitor while compound 20 was found most selective inhibitor for MAO-B isoform. In the cytotoxicity evaluation, all the compounds were found non-toxic to SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells at 25\u202f\u00b5M concentration. In the ROS studies, compound 8 (MAO-A inhibitor) reduced the ROS level by 51.2% while compound 13 reduced the ROS level by 61.81%. In the molecular dynamic simulation studies for 30\u202fns, compound 12 was found quite stable in the active cavity of MAO-B. Thus, it can be concluded that phenyl- and 1-benzhydrylpiperazine derivatives are promising MAO inhibitors and can act as a lead to design potent, and selective MAO inhibitors for the treatment of various neurological disorders.",

The metal complexes could bind to CT-DNA through intercalation binding mode. This has also been confirmed by the molecular docking studies. The DNA cleavage efficiencies of these complexes with pBR322 DNA were investigated by gel electrophoresis. The complexes were found to promote the cleavage of pBR322 DNA from the supercoiled form I to the open circular form II in the presence of an oxidizing agent (H2O2). The in vitro chemosensitivity of the studied complexes exhibits significant cytotoxic effects, compared to those reported for cisplatin. These findings represent a prompting to search for the probable interaction of these complexes with other cellular elements of fundamental consequence in cell proliferation. The in vitro anticancer activities indicate that the Cu(II) complex is active against the selected human tumor cell lines, and the order of in vitro anticancer activities is consistent with the DNA-binding affinities. Towards noncancerous cell line, Cu(II) complex exhibits very low toxicity. On the other hand all the complexes have been found to exhibit cytotoxic effects against cancerous cell lines with potency more than that of the widely used drug cisplatin and hence they have the potential to act as promising anticancer agents. Captivatingly, they are non-toxic to normal cell lymphocytes revealing that they are selective in killing only the cancer cells.",

Spectrophotometric assessment using a known zinc indicator dithizone was selected.Initial screening performed by comparison of spectra of dithizone and its complex with zinc suggested 530 and 570\u202fnm as suitable wavelengths for determination of zinc at pH 4.5 while 540 and 590\u202fnm for pH 5.5\u20137.5. Additional research showed the lower wavelengths to be more suitable.

     "abstract": "At low pH, protons from the external, bulk solution can protonate the phenoxide group of the p-HBDI chromophore in wild-type green fluorescent protein (wtGFP) and its mutants, and likely continue to tentatively protonate the phenol hydroxyl group of the same chromophores. Because the protonated GFP chromophore is a transient, we prepare the stable p-trimethylammonium analogues (2a and 2b) of the GFP chromophore to mimic it and explore their properties. What we found is that the p-trimethylammonium analogues of the GFP chromophore have the highly electrophilic amidine carbon, blue-shifted electronic absorption, smaller molar absorptivity, smaller fluorescent quantum yield, and faster E-Z thermoisomerization rate. The amidine carbon of the p-trimethylammonium analogue (2b) of the GFP chromophore is the only site that is attacked by very weak nucleophile of water, resulting in ring-opening of the imidazolinone moiety. The half-life of its decay rate in D2O is around 33\u202fdays. Actually, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of p-HBDI also results in ring-opening of the imidazolinone moiety. The ratio of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis rate constants [kobs(p-HBDI)/kobs(1b)] between p-HBDI and 1b (p-dimethylammonium analogue of the GFP chromophore) is dramatically increased from 0.30 at pH\u202f=\u202f2 to 0.63 at pH\u202f=\u202f0. This is the evidence that more and more phenol hydroxyl groups of p-HBDI are tentatively protonated in a low-pH aqueous solution and that accelerates hydrolysis of p-HBDI in the way similar to the quaternary ammonium derivatives 2a and 2b in water. With this view point, 2a and 2b still can partially mimic the cationic p-HBDI with the protonated phenol hydroxyl group. Implication of the experiment is that the amidine carbon of the chromophore in wtGFP and its mutants at very low pH should be highly electrophilic. Whether ring-opening of the imidazolinone moiety of the GFP chromophore would occur or not depends on if water molecules can reach the amidine carbon of the chromophore inside wtGFP and its mutants.",

In this study, more than fifty flavonoids were collected to assay their inhibitory effects against hCE2 using a fluorescence-based method. The results demonstrated that C3 and C6 hydroxy groups were essential for hCE2 inhibition, while O-glycosylation or C-glycosylation would lead to the loss of hCE2 inhibition. Among all tested flavonoids, 5,6-dihydroxyflavone displayed the most potent inhibitory effect against hCE2 with the IC50 value of 3.50\u202f\u03bcM. The inhibition mechanism of 5,6-dihydroxyflavone was further investigated by both experimental and docking simulations.

Chemical synthesis of their optical isomers is expensive, time consuming and not friendly to the environment, so biotransformations are under consideration. Among others, these compounds act as enzymes inhibitors. This makes the bioconversions of phosphonates, especially scaling experiments, hard to perform. Biocatalysis is one of the methods that can be applied in synthesis of optically pure compounds. To increase the efficiency of the process with whole cell biocatalysts, it is essential to ensure optimal reaction conditions that minimize cellular stress and can enhance the metabolic activity of cells. The present investigation focuses on the scaling up of the kinetic resolution of racemic mixture of 2-butyryloxy-2-(ethoxy-P-phenylphosphinyl)acetic acid, applying free and immobilized form of the fungal biocatalysts and two operation systems: shake flask and recirculated fixed-bed batch reactor. Protocols of effective mycelium immobilization on polyurethane foams were set for T. purpurogenus IAFB 2512, F. oxysporum, P. commune. The best results of biotransformation were obtained with the immobilized P. commune in the column recirculated fixed-bed batch reactor. The conversion reaches 56% (maximal for the kinetic process) and the enantiomeric enrichment of the isomers mixture ranges between 82 and 93% (93% for ester of RP,R conformation). All biocatalysts exhibit SP-preference toward tested compound, what is essential because of importance of the phosphorus atom chirality for its biological activity.",

We have previously reported a series of FFA1 agonists with thiazole scaffold exemplified by compound 1, and identified a small hydrophobic subpocket partially occupied by the methyl group of compound 1. Herein, we describe further structure optimization to better fit the small hydrophobic subpocket by replacing the small methyl group with other hydrophobic substituents. All of these efforts resulted in the identification of compound 6, a potent FFA1 agonist (EC50\u202f=\u202f39.7\u202fnM) with desired ligand efficiency (0.24) and ligand lipophilicity efficiency (4.7). Moreover, lead compound 6 exhibited a greater potential for decreasing the hyperglycemia levels than compound 1 during an oral glucose tolerance test. In summary, compound 6 is a promising FFA1 agonist for further investigation, and the structure-based study promoted our understanding for the binding pocket of FFA1.",

To better understand the enzyme-inhibitor interaction and to explain the efficiency and selectivity of the compounds toward hMAOs, molecular modeling studies were carried out on new, high resolution hMAO-A and hMAO-B crystallographic structures. According to binding energies and inhibition constants obtained from molecular docking calculations, compound 1-R has been found as the most selective MAO-A inhibitor and its weak binding affinities to MAO-B (large Ki values) led to the enhancement in MAO-A selectivity. It bounded in close proximity to FAD in the active site of MAO-A and situated near the aromatic cage by means of \u03c0-alkyl interactions with Tyr407 and Phe352 whereas its position in MAO-B was 10\u202f\u00c5 far from FAD and it was situated outside the Ile199 gate of the active site. None of the studied compounds showed any cytototoxicity on HepG2 cells at 1 and 5\u202f\u00b5M concentrations.",

A new strategy for the development of gem-disubstituted substrate-product analogues as inhibitors of racemases and epimerases is elaborated using \u03b1-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtMCR) as a model enzyme. MtMCR catalyzes the epimerization at C2 of acyl-CoA substrates, a key step in the metabolism of branched-chain fatty acids. Moreover, the human enzyme is a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents directed against prostate cancer. We show that rationally designed, N,N-dialkylcarbamoyl-CoA substrate-product analogues inactivate MtMCR. Binding greatly exceeds that of the substrate, (S)-ibuprofenoyl-CoA, up to \u223c250-fold and is proportional to the alkyl chain length (4\u201312 carbons) with the N,N-didecyl and N,N-didodecyl species having competitive inhibition constants with values of 1.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202f\u03bcM and 0.42\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202f\u03bcM, respectively.

The benzo-\u03b3-pyrone scaffold is well-known in medicinal chemistry with diverse pharmacological activities attributed to them, however, their therapeutic potential as adenosine receptor antagonists have not been investigated in detail. To expand on the structure\u2013activity relationships, the present study explored the adenosine A1 and A2A receptor binding affinities of a selected series of benzo-\u03b3-pyrone analogues. In vitro evaluation led to the identification of 5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one with the best adenosine A2A receptor affinity among the test compounds and was found to be non-selective (A1Ki\u202f=\u202f0.956\u202f\u00b5M; A2AKi\u202f=\u202f1.44\u202f\u00b5M). Hydroxy substitution on ring A and/or B play a key role in modulating the binding affinity at adenosine A1 and A2A receptors. Adenosine A1 receptor affinity was increased to the nanomolar range with hydroxy substitution on C6 (ring A), while meta-hydroxy substitution on ring B governed adenosine A2A receptor affinity. The double bond between C2 and C3 of ring C as well as C2 phenyl substitution was shown to be imperative for both adenosine A1 and A2A receptor affinity. Selected benzo-\u03b3-pyrone derivatives behaved as adenosine A1 receptor antagonists in the performed GTP shift assays.

Here, we reported computational modeling of the atomic-level complex structure of ADAMTS4 with its cognate inhibitory protein TIMP3 based on high-resolution crystal template. By systematically examining the modeled complex structure we successfully identified a short inhibitory loop (62EASESLC68) in TIMP3 N-terminal inhibitory domain (NID) that directly participates in blocking the enzyme\u2019s active site, which, and its extended versions, were then broken from the full-length protein to serve as the peptide inhibitor candidates of ADAMTS4. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulation, binding energetic analysis, and fluorescence-based assay revealed that the TIMP3-derived linear peptides can only bind weakly to the enzyme (Kd\u202f=\u202f74\u202f\u00b1\u202f8\u202f\u03bcM), which would incur a considerable entropy penalty due to the high conformational flexibility and intrinsic disorder of these linear peptides. In this respect, we proposed a cyclization strategy to improve enzyme\u2013peptide binding affinity by, instead of traditionally maximizing enthalpy contribution, minimizing entropy cost of the binding, where a disulfide bond was added across the two terminal residues of linear peptides, resulting in a number of TIMP3-derived cyclic peptides. Our studies confirmed that the cyclization, as might be expected, can promote peptide binding capability against ADAMTS4 substantially, with affinity increase by 3-fold, 9-fold and 7-fold for cyclic peptides , and , respectively.",

     "abstract": "The fruit of the white mulberry tree (Morus alba L.) is a multiple fruit with a sweet flavor commonly consumed around the world. Chemical investigation of the fruits led to the isolation of two indole acetic acid derivatives (1\u202f\u22122) including a new compound, which turned out to be an isolation artifact, 3S-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H-indole-3-acetic acid butyl ester (1), along with five known compounds (3\u202f\u22127). Compounds 2 and 7 were newly identified from mulberry fruit. The new isolation artifact (1) exhibited cytotoxic effect on human cervical cancer Hela cells in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 1 activated caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3, followed by cleavage of PARP, a substrate of caspase-3, in a dose-dependent manner. Simultaneous alterations in protein expression of mitochondrial factors Bax, BID and Bcl-2 were also observed. A comparison between compounds 1 and 2 led to a structure-activity relationship analysis of the cytotoxic effect. These results suggest that compound 1 could be beneficial in human cervical cancer treatment, and provide a theoretical basis for further application of compound 1.",

In line with this approach, in this paper, we present a new class of C-glycosides incorporating the sulfamoylphenyl moiety. These compounds have been prepared by sulfamoylation of C-glycosyl phenols, which have been synthetized by aldol reaction of glycosyl ketones with the appropriate aromatic aldehydes. The inhibition profile of the new glycomimetics was determined against four human (h) CA isozymes, comprising hCAs I and II (cytosolic, ubiquitous isozymes), hCA IV and hCA IX (tumor associated isozyme). Peracetylated and deprotected C-glycosyl sulfamates showed better inhibition selectivity compared to structurally related phenylsulfamates. In this study, deprotected compound 12 was identified as selective inhibitor of hCA IX. These results confirm that attaching carbohydrate moieties to CA sulfamoylphenyl pharmacophore improves its inhibitory activity.",

(Pa-Ami), with superior activity for nicotinamide and its chlorinated derivatives, was exploited and characterized. Kinetic analysis and molecular docking clearly indicated that chlorine substitution in the pyridine ring of nicotinamide, especially the substitution at 2-position led to a dramatic decrease of Pa-Ami activity. The productivity of the bioprocess was significantly improved using fed-batch mode at low reaction temperature and 2-CA was produced as high as 370\u202fmM with a substrate conversion of 94.2%.

The clinical utility of the pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are inadequate because of the lack of selectivity for tumor tissues, high reactivity of the pharmacophoric imine functionality, low water solubility, and stability. To address these limitations two new \u03b2-glucoside prodrugs of PBDs have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential use in selective therapy of solid tumors by ADEPT. The preliminary studies reveal the prodrugs are much less toxic compared to the parent moieties. These prodrugs are activated by \u03b2-glucosidase to produce the active cytotoxic moiety signifying their utility in ADEPT of cancer. The prodrugs 1a and 1b were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity in three human cancer cell lines, i.e., A375, MCF-7 and HT-29 by employing MTT assay. The results reveal that the prodrugs have shown significant cytotoxic activity in the presence of enzyme.

     "abstract": "We have previously shown that human interferon \u03b1-2b (IFN) produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is heterogeneous at the N-terminal, with three major species (Ahsan et al., 2014). These are: (a) the direct translation product of the gene retaining the N-terminal methionine, (b) a species from which the methionyl residue has been removed by E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase to give the native interferon \u03b1-2b and (c) in which the N-terminal Cys residue of the latter contains an acetyl group. In this paper we overcome this heterogeneity, using engineered interferon derivatives with phenylalanine residue directly downstream of the N-terminal methionine (Met-Phe-IFN). This modification not only prevented the removal of the N-terminal methionine by E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase but also the subsequent N-acetylation. Critically, Met-Phe-IFN had enhanced activity in a biological assay. N-terminal stabilization was also achieved by fusing human cytochrome b5 at the N-terminal of interferon (b5-IFN-chimera). In this case also, the protein was more active than a reciprocal chimera with cytochrome b5 at the C-terminal of interferon (Met-IFN-b5-chimera). This latter protein also had a heterogeneous N-terminal but addition of phenylalanine following Met, (Met-Phe-IFN-b5-chimera), resolved this problem and gave enhanced biological activity.",

To identify orally available agonists, we tried to interdict the metabolically labile group by incorporating two deuterium atoms at the \u03b1-position of phenylpropionic acid. Interestingly, the differences of physicochemical properties between hydrogen and deuterium are quite small, but there are many differences in the structure-activity relationship between phenylpropionic acid series and present deuterated series. Further optimizations of deuterated series led to the discovery of compound 18, which exhibited a superior balance in terms of in vitro activity, lipophilicity, and solubility. Better still, compound 18 revealed a lower clearance (CL\u202f=\u202f0.44\u202fL/h/kg), higher maximum concentration (Cmax\u202f=\u202f7584.27\u202f\u03bcg/L), and longer half-life (T1/2\u202f=\u202f4.16\u202fh), resulting in a >23-fold exposure than compound 1.

Interestingly, the effect on activity against human and murine sEH varied in opposite ways with each new methyl group introduced into the molecule. Compounds with three methyl substituents in adamantane were very poor inhibitors of murine sEH while still very potent against human sEH. In addition, diureas with terminal groups bigger than sEH catalytic tunnel diameter were still good inhibitors suggesting that the active site of sEH opens to capture the substrate or inhibitor molecule. The introduction of one methyl group leads to 4-fold increase in potency without noticeable loss of metabolic stability compared to the unsubstituted adamantane. However, introduction of two or three methyl groups leads to 8-fold and 98-fold decrease in stability in human liver microsomes for the corresponding compounds.",

In the present work, two new natural products were isolated from the ariel part of Ocimum basilicum; 7-(3-hydroxypropyl)-3-methyl-8-\u03b2-O-d-glucoside-2H-chromen-2-one (1) and E-4-(6\u2032-hydroxyhex-3\u2032-en-1-yl)phenyl propionate (2) and confirmed their structures with different spectroscopic techniques including NMR spectroscopy etc. The isolated compounds (1, 2) were evaluated for in vitro inhibitory activity against aldose reductase (AKR1B1) and aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). The natural product (1) showed better inhibitory activity for AKR1B1 with IC50 value of 2.095\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0\u00b5M compare to standard sorbinil (IC50\u00a0=\u00a03.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0\u00b5M).

However, their exact molecular mechanism is still unclear and is not fully investigated. In this regard, a novel series of compounds bearing a COXs privilege scaffold, diphenyl thiazole, was synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. The most active compounds 10b, 14a,b, 16a, 17a,b and 18b were evaluated in vitro for COX-1/COX-2 inhibitory activity. These compounds were suggested to exert their anticancer activity through a multi-target mechanism based on their structural features. Thus, compounds 10b and 17b with the least IC50 values in MTT assay were tested against three known anticancer targets; EGFR, BRAF and tubulin. Compounds 10b and 17b showed remarkable activity against EGFR with IC50 values of 0.4 and 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively and good activity against BRAF with IC50 values of 1.3 and 1.7\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. In contrast, they showed weak activity in tubulin polymerization assay. The in vivo anti-inflammatory potential was assessed and interestingly, compound 17b was the most potent compound. Together, this study offers some important insights into the correlation between COXs inhibition and cancer treatment. Additionally, the results demonstrated the promising activity of these compounds with a multi-target mechanism as good candidates for further development into potential anticancer agents.",

Compounds 7c and 9g showed high safety profiles with normal stomach tissue integrity. Docking studies supported the observed in vitro inhibitory activity towards the COX enzymes that may explain their promising anti-inflammatory activity relative to indomethacin. Moreover, differences between the COX-1 and COX-2 isozymes in observed energy scores, as well as in the number of interactions with some of the compounds tested, might predict their higher selectivity towards COX-1 rather than COX-2.

The Sudlow site I of HSA although anion receptive, harbors neutral CBIQD in Sudlow site I (subdomain IIA, close to Trp) of HSA, while in BSA its prefers to snugly fit into Sudlow site II (subdomain IIIA, close to Tyr). Based on discernable diminution of HSA mean fluorescence lifetime as a function of biluminophore concentration, facile occurrence of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is substantiated as the probable quenching mechanism accompanied by structural deformations in the protein ensemble. CBIQD establishes itself within HSA close to Trp214, and consequently reduces the micropolarity of the cybotactic environment that is predominantly constituted by hydrophobic amino acid residues. The stronger association of CBIQD with HSA encourages an allosteric modulation leading to slight deformation in its secondary structure whereas for BSA the association is comparatively weaker. Sudlow site I of HSA is capable to embrace a favorable conformation like malleable gold to provide room for incoming CBIQD, whereas for BSA it behaves more like rigid cast-iron which does not admit any change thus forcing CBIQD to occupy an altogether different binding location i.e. the Sudlow site II. The anticancer CBIQD is found to be stable within the HSA scaffold as vindicated by root mean square deviation (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) obtained by MD simulation. A competitively inhibited esterase-like activity of HSA upon CBIQD binding to Lys199 and Arg257 residues, plausibly envisions that similar naphthalimide based prodrugs, bearing ester functionality, can be particularly activated by Sudlow site I of HSA. The consolidated spectroscopic research described herein may encourage design of naphthalimide based pro-drugs for effective in vivo biodistribution using HSA-based drug delivery systems.",

The protein has recently been found to function as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor through the activation of RhoGTPase. Here, computational modeling and bioinformatics analysis were employed to investigate the molecular mechanism and biological implication underlying Spon2 autoinhibition. It is revealed that the binding of PxxP motif to SH domain can stabilize the intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal helix and DH domain of Spon2, thus shifting the protein into an autoinhibitory state. Here, we proposed releasing Spon2 autoinhibition by targeting SH domain with competitive peptide ligands. To verify this notion, the PxxP sequence was adopted as the start to derive an array of efficient SH binders by using a structure-based rational design strategy, which were then substantiated with fluorescence spectroscopy analysis and guanine nucleotide exchange test. Consequently, the obtained peptide ligands were determined to have a moderate or high affinity for SH domain; they can also enhance Spon2 exchange activity by 1.2\u20136.1 folds, exhibiting a significant correlation with their SH-binding affinity (Pearson\u2019s coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.92). In addition, neutral substitution of conserved residues in a high-affinity peptide ligand can largely reduce its Spon2-activating potency, confirming that the designed peptide activates Spon2 by competitively disrupting SH\u2013PxxP interaction.",

Particularly N-benzoyldehydroabietylamines 11, 12 and 13 were excellent inhibitors for AChE, showing inhibition rates comparable to standard galantamine hydrobromide.",

In addition, the anti-pathogenic capacity of the seven coumarins was evaluated on the wild type and the biosensor strain of Chromobacterium violaceum.The comparative study of coumarins showed that molecules with hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring displayed higher activity on the inhibition of biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa over coumarins with substituents in positions 3 and 4 or without the double 3,4-bond. These 3 or 4-hydroxylated positions caused a decrease in the anti-biofilm activity obtained for coumarin. However, the hydroxyl group in position 3 of the pyrone ring was important for the inhibition of C. violaceum QS and elastolytic activity of P. aeruginosa. The effects observed were active independently of any effect on growth. According to our results, coumarin and its hydroxylated derivatives represent an interesting group of compounds to use as anti-virulence agents against the human pathogen P. aeruginosa.",

     "abstract": "New cyanoacrylamide derivatives were theoretically examined for their binding abilities to a protein model of apoptosis inhibitor proteins x-IAP and c-IAP1 using molecular modeling. The two compounds 5a and 5b proved promising IAP antagonists, where they have good binding affinity toward the selected active domains. Anticancer activity of all derivatives was performed on different human cancer cell lines (HCT116, Caco2, and MCF7) as well as normal line (HBF4). Data revealed that breast carcinoma was more sensitive to the novel compounds than other lines especially compounds 5a and 5b, but all derivatives lost their cytotoxic effect in case of Caco2 cell line and they showed low cytotoxic effect toward HCT116 cells except compound 3. The flow cytometric analysis revealed that the two compounds 5a and 5b induced apoptosis to 46.5% and 54.8% respectively, relative to control 8.06%. In addition, PCR results indicated that the two compounds 5a and 5b induced the expression of p53 gene and decreased induction of BCL2 (anti-apoptotic gene), while the two compounds have no effect on the protein expression of Caspase-9. By monitoring the presence of Caspase-3 which was a mean to detect apoptotic death in breast carcinoma, the two compounds have stimulated the induction of apoptosis by increasing the production of Caspase-3 protein. Finally, it was concluded that the two compounds 5b and 5a have the most promising anti-cancer activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF7), and it is believed that the anticancer activities of these two compounds were due to being the most effective in the inhibition of a member of IAPs groups, leading to activation of p53 gene and the Caspase-3 dependent apoptosis.",

Their reactions are also complicated by the presence of multiple dehydrodopyl units. Since they have been invoked in crosslinking and covalent binding, to understand the reactivities of these novel compounds, we have taken a simple model compound that possess the tunichrome reactive group viz., 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopamine (Dehydro NADA) and examined its reaction with N-acetylcysteine in presence of oxygen under both enzymatic and nonenzymatic conditions. Ultraviolet and visible spectral studies of reaction mixtures containing dehydro NADA and N-acetylcysteine in different molar ratios indicated the production of side chain and ring adducts of N-acetylcysteine to dehydro NADA. Liquid chromatography and mass spectral studies supported this contention and confirmed the production of several different products. Mass spectral analysis of these products show the potentials of dehydro NADA to form side chain adducts that can lead to polymeric products. This is the first report demonstrating the ability of dehydro dopyl units to form adducts and crosslinks with amino acid side chains.",

Moreover, the apoptosis induction by 2e was also inhibited by PFT-\u03b1 as evidenced by non-significant induction of apoptosis after treatment of MCF-7 cells with both derivative 2e and PFT-\u03b1. In addition, docking study reveals that derivative 2e has a binding pattern close to the pattern observed in the structure of the lead fragment 5,6-dimethoxy-2-methylbenzothiazole bound to T-p53C-Y220C.

The analysis of cell metabolism, using the MTT method, showed that the compound 4l impaired cell metabolism in HUVEC only in high concentration (100\u00a0\u00b5M). A lower concentration of compound 4l, whether in association or not with paclitaxel, was required to cause toxicity in both SK-Mel-28 and SK-Mel-103 cells in comparison with HUVEC cells. Moreover, the ability of 4l to cause cell death was evaluated by flow cytometry, and the data obtained highlighted the apoptotic action of 4l and paclitaxel co-treatment on Sk-Mel-28 cells only, which corroborated the greater efficacy of maleimide compounds against cancer cells. Together, our data provide promising data on the selectivity of maleimide compounds to cancer cells, and suggest that novel maleimide-substituted compounds may be synthesized and tested on different cancer cell lines, as primary or co-adjuvant agents of cancer cell toxicity.",

The desulphurization of ferrocenyl thioureas to the corresponding oxo analogues using aqueous sodium hydroxide and mercuric chloride led to the ferrocenyl ureas (F1\u2013F9) in high yields. The DNA binding studies performed by cyclic voltammetry and UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy produced results that are in close agreement with one another for the binding constants (K) and an electrostatic mode of interaction was observed. The nature and the extent of interaction with DNA was further investigated by viscometry. The DFT/B3LYP method was used to determine the charge distribution and HOMO/LUMO energies of the optimized structure. The DFT calculated HOMO and LUMO energies correlate well with the experimentally determined redox potential values. The synthesized ferrocenyl derivatives exhibited good scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH).

Recorded NMR spectra allowed confirming the reaction progress and also postulating possible mechanism of conversion. The path of bioconversion was defined as enantio convergent process for both modes of applied biocatalysts. This means that kinetically driven resolution of racemic mixture of the substrate leads to the one enantiomer of the product. The bioconversion started from ester bond hydrolysis (equally in both enantiomers) with the conversion degree from 30% (whole-cell) to 35% (isolated enzymes) and with the production of optically pure monoester (compound 2; 100% of e.e). For whole-cell bioprocess it was the initiative step for the enantioselective amide bond hydrolysis, what resulted in synthesis of desired product 3-amino-3-phosphonopropanoic acid 4.

Parthenolide is a potent anticancer sesquiterpene lactone that is also able to kill cancer stem cells. The main problem with this compound is its poor solubility in water. To solve this problem, medicinal chemists have tried to prepare amino-derivatives of parthenolide, however, most amino-derivatives have less potency than that of parthenolide. In this paper, we proposed a new approach to synthesize parthenolide derivatives with better solubility and higher potency. We prepared novel parthenolide derivatives through the aza-Michael addition of nitrogen-containing anticancer drug molecules (cytarabine and melphalan) to the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone group of parthenolide. Different types of catalysts were used to catalyze the aza-Michael addition. Among all the used catalysts, 1,8-diazabicyclo [5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU) was found to have the highest catalytic activity. In addition, we examined the effects of parthenolide-anticancer drug hybrids on the growth and proliferation of three cancer cell lines (MCF-7, LNcaP, Hep G2) and CHO. The parthenolide prodrugs showed potent cytotoxic property with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 5.2\u00a0\u03bcM, higher than those of parthenolide and anticancer drugs (cytarabine and melphalan).",

Their instability and high reactivity has severely hampered the assessment of their biological role. Experiments conducted with the model compound, 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopamine, indicated that the instability of tunichromes is due to this basic structure. Exposure of this catecholamine derivative to even mild alkaline condition such as pH 7.5 causes rapid nonenzymatic oxidation. High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry studies confirmed the production of dimeric and other oligomeric products in the reaction mixture. The nonenzymatic reaction seemed to proceed through the intermediary formation of semiquinone free radical and superoxide anion. Ultraviolet and visible spectral studies associated with the oxidation of tunichromes isolated from Ascidia nigra by tyrosinase indicated the probable formation of oligomeric tunichrome products. Attempts to monitor the polymerization reaction by mass spectrometry ended in vain. Tunichrome also exhibited instability in mild alkaline conditions generating superoxide anions.

The introduction of modified Py-dC in most cases causes minor decrease of hairpin thermodynamic stability. The energetically unfavorable effect is more pronounced when modified residue is present within hairpin loop. Our studies indicate that thermodynamic effects induced by all Py-dC derivatives are net results of increased stacking interactions caused by larger surface of pyrrolo-2\u2032-deoxycytidine aromatic ring and unfavorable effect implied by the presence of additional side chains. The CD spectra of all modified hairpins are similar to unmodified hairpin indicating that the presence of Py-dC derivatives does not disrupt the secondary structure of DNA. Interestingly, the presence of various side chains can increase fluorescent discrimination of paired and unpaired regions of DNA. The fluorescence observed for hairpins modified within loop is significantly quenched when Py-dC derivative is present in the stem region.",

     "abstract": "The oncogenic transcription factor forkhead box M (Foxm) is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Targeting the protein interaction with its cognate DNA has been established as an attractive approach to anti-CRC chemotherapy. State-of-the-art molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the Foxm adopts considerably different conformations to interact with and without its DNA partner; the holo conformation is tightly packed as a typical globulin configuration, whereas the apo form is locally unstructured that exhibits intrinsic disorder in DNA recognition helix, indicating that DNA binding can help the Foxm refolding. With this finding, the MD equilibrium structure of DNA-free Foxm was utilized to perform molecular docking virtual screening against a natural organic compound library. Consequently, six hit compounds were identified as potential small-molecule mediators of Foxm\u2013DNA interaction; their binding affinities (KD) to Foxm DNA-binding domain were then determined to range between 3.8 and 230\u00a0\u03bcM by using isothermal titration calorimetry. These compounds were suggested to recognize and stabilize the apo conformation of Foxm, thus shifting the binding reaction equilibrium of Foxm from DNA-bound to DNA-free states to disrupt the formation of Foxm\u2013DNA adduct.",

Based on bioassay-guided fractionation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated Raw264.7 cells, chemical investigation of the EtOH extract of the sclerotia of P. cocos resulted in the isolation and identification of eight compounds including six triterpenoids, namely poricoic acid A (1), 3-O-acetyl-16\u03b1-hydroxydehydrotrametenolic acid (2), polyporenic acid C (3), 3\u03b2-hydroxylanosta-7,9(11),24-trien-21-oic acid (4), trametenolic acid (5), and dehydroeburicoic acid (6), as well as (\u2212)-pinoresinol (7) and protocatechualdehyde (8). The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by spectroscopic analysis, including 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and LC/MS analysis. The anti-inflammatory activities of the isolates were evaluated by estimating their effect on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 as well as on the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Compounds 1\u20135 inhibited NO production and iNOS expression in LPS-stimulated Raw264.7 cells. Among them, compound 1 exerted the highest anti-inhibitory activity and reduced PGE2 levels via downregulation of COX-2 protein expression.

The present study was aimed to develop azomethine based nano-fungicides for protecting the crop from fungal pathogens and subsequent yield losses. The protocol for the formation of nano-azomethines was generated and standardized. Technically pure azomethines were transformed into their nano-forms exploiting polyethylene glycol as the surface stabilizer. Characterization was performed by optical (imaging) probe (Zetasizer) and electron probe (TEM) characterization techniques. The mean particle sizes of all nano-fungicides were below 100\u00a0nm. In vitro fungicidal potential of nano-chemicals was increased by 2 times in comparison to that of conventional sized azomethines against pathogenic fungi, namely, Rhizoctonia solani, Rhizoctonia bataticola and Sclerotium rolfsii. The performance of nano-chemicals in pot experiment study was also superior to conventional ones as antifungal agent.",

During pathophysiological conditions, the over expression of AP and e5\u2032NT lead to an increased production of adenosine that enhance tumor proliferation, invasiveness, neoangiogenesis and disrupts the body antitumor response. As both enzymes are abundantly expressed in above mentioned conditions, therefore it is of great interest to synthesize and develop potent inhibitors of these enzymes that augment the antitumor therapy. Herein we reported the synthesis and biological activity of a new series of chalcone-sulfonamide hybrids (4a-j). These derivatives were then evaluated for their inhibitory potential against two members of ecto-nucleotidase family, e5\u2032NT (human and rat) and APs isozyme (intestinal and tissue nonspecific). Only six derivatives were found to inhibit both human and rat e5\u2032NT enzymes.

An analysis of the structure-activity relationships for MAO-B inhibition indicates that substitution with the methoxy group on the A-ring leads to a significant enhancement in MAO-B inhibition compared to the unsubstituted homologues while the effect of the heteroaromatic substituent on activity, in decreasing order is: 5-bromo-2-furan\u00a0>\u00a05-methyl-2-furan\u00a0>\u00a02-pyridine\u00a0\u2248\u00a02-thiophene\u00a0>\u00a0cyclohexyl\u00a0>\u00a03-pyridine\u00a0\u2248\u00a02-furan. It may therefore be concluded that 2-heteroarylidene-1-indanone derivatives are promising leads for the design of MAO inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease and possibly other neurodegenerative disorders.",

Among them, paratocarpin E showed significant cytotoxicity against these cancer cell lines with an IC50 of 19.6\u00a0\u03bcM on the growth of MCF-7 cells. Paratocarpin E treatment of MCF-7 cells resulted in typical apoptotic features via increasing expression of activated caspase-8 and -9 and PARP cleavage. Moreover, paratocarpin E altered the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol, suggesting that the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis was initiated. In addition, paratocarpin E increased the MDC-positive autophagic vacuoles, the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I protein levels of Beclin-1, but decreased p62 expression, indicating the potent pro-autophagic effects of paratocarpin E in MCF-7 cells. Mechanistically, cell death induced by paratocarpin E is able to induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells by activating p38 and JNK signaling pathway while inhibiting Erk pathway. Furthermore, paratocarpin E promotes the activation and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB, which plays an important role in balancing paratocarpin E-mediated apoptosis and autophagy. The molecular docking study also revealed that paratocarpin E bound to Fas and NF-\u03baB complex. These findings provide initial evidences that paratocarpin E can be used as a potential anti-cancer drug in future for breast cancer therapy.",

The rate constants observed for the decarboxylation of LOTh in neutral and acidic solutions are about four times smaller than those for the corresponding compound that contains the amino group, lactylthiamin.

The data were correlated with the potencies in muscle contractile experiments and the substrate properties towards the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). A study of the biological activities in guinea pig ileum and rat uterus indicated that only Toac0-BK partially maintained its native biological potency among the tested peptides. This and its counterpart, Toac3-BK, maintained the ability to act as ACE substrates. These results indicate that peptides bearing Toac probe far from the ACE cleavage sites were more susceptible to hydrolysis by ACE. The results also emphasize the existence of a finer control for BK-receptor interaction than for BK binding at the catalytic site of this metallodipetidase.

The HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis identified various biomolecules known as potent antioxidants, such as chlorogenic acid, (epi)catechin, procyanidins, caffeoyl-hexosides, quercetin-glucosides and kaempferol. The fruit peel of A. crassiflora, a specie from Cerrado, the Brazilian Savanna, provided a source of antioxidant compounds with properties to block carbohydrate digestive enzymes and formation of glycation products. Thus, there is potential to use the by-products of araticum in order to identify and isolate phytochemicals for application in nutraceutical supplements, food additives and pharmaceuticals products.",

The results show that the hydroperoxide lyase activities of F92L and F92L/P430A mutants prefer 13-hydroperoxy substrate to other hydroperoxydienoic acids or hydroperoxytrienoic acids. The Soret maximum was completely red-shifted in P430A and F92L/P430A mutants, but it was partially shifted in the F92L mutant. ESR spectral data showed that wild type, F92L and P430A mutants occupied high and low spin states, while the F92L/P430A mutant occupied only low spin state. The extent of the red shift of the Soret maximum increased as the population of low spin heme iron increased, suggesting that the spectral shift reflects the high to low transition of heme iron spin state in rice allene oxide synthase-1. Relative to wild type allene oxide synthase-1, the hydroperoxide lyase activities of F92L and F92L/P430A are less sensitive to inhibition by imidazole with (13S or 9S)-hydroperoxydienoic acid as substrate and more sensitive than wild type with (13S)-hydroperoxytrienoic acid as substrate.

     "abstract": "The interaction of pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) is investigated under pseudo-physiological conditions by UV\u2013Vis, fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy. The intrinsic fluorescence of BSA was quenched by VB6, which was rationalized in terms of the static quenching mechanism. According to fluorescence quenching calculations, the bimolecular quenching constant (kq), dynamic quenching (KSV) and static quenching (KLB) at 310\u00a0K were obtained. The efficiency of energy transfer and the distance between the donor (BSA) and the acceptor (VB6) were calculated by Foster\u2019s non-radiative energy transfer theory and were equal to 41.1% and 2.11\u00a0nm.The collected UV\u2013Vis and fluorescence spectra were combined into a row-and column-wise augmented matrix and resolved by multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS). MCR-ALS helped to estimate the stoichiometry of interactions, concentration profiles and pure spectra for three species (BSA, VB6 and VB6-BSA complex) existed in the interaction procedure. Based on the MCR-ALS results, using mass balance equations, a model was developed and binding constant of complex was calculated using non-linear least squares curve fitting. FT-IR spectra showed that the conformation of proteins was altered in presence of VB6. Finally, the combined docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to estimate the binding affinity of VB6 to BSA. Five-nanosecond MD simulations were performed on bovine serum albumin (BSA) to study the conformational features of its ligand binding site. From MD results, eleven BSA snapshots were extracted, at every 0.5\u00a0ns, to explore the binding affinity (GOLD score) of VB6 using a docking procedure. MD simulations indicated that there is a considerable flexibility in the structure of protein that affected ligand recognition. Structural analyses and docking simulations indicated that VB6 binds to site I and GOLD score values depend on the conformations of both BSA and ligand. Molecular modeling results showed that VB6\u2013BSA complex formed not only on the basis of electrostatic forces, but also on the basis of \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 staking and hydrogen bond. There was an excellent agreement between the experimental and computational results. The results presented in this paper, will offer a reference for detailed and systematic studies on the biological effects and action mechanism of small molecules with proteins.",

In addition, substitution of the hydrogen atom H4 of Phe471 with halogen atoms, in particular the bromine atom Br4, can constitute a geometrically satisfactory halogen bonding with the oxygen atom O of CETP Ile193 residue. Fluorescence polarization assays substantiated that (i) mutation of the aromatic Phe471 to small Ala residue would impair the SBH-peptide affinity with Kd change from 10.5 to 26.4\u00a0\u03bcM, indicating that the \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking should exist in Phe471\u22efPhe197 adduct, and (ii) substitution with Br4 can considerably improve SBH-peptide affinity by \u223c3-fold, but the SBH-peptide binding does not change essentially upon substitution with Br3 (a negative control that is theoretically unable to form the halogen bonding), indicating that the rationally designed halogen bonding should form between the Phe471(Br4) residue of SBH-peptide and the Ile193 residue of CETP protein.",

Appropriately designed reactions using C. parapsilosis effect efficient catalysis of organic transformations such as deracemization, enantioselective reduction of prochiral ketones, imines, and kinetic resolution of racemic alcohols via selective oxidation. This review includes the details of these biotransformations, catalyzed by whole cells (wild type and recombinant strains), purified enzymes (oxidoreductases) and immobilized whole cells of C. parapsilosis. The review presents a bioorganic perspective as it discusses the chemo, regio and stereoselectivity of the biocatalyst along with the structure of the substrates and optical purity of the products. Fermentation scale biocatalysis using whole cells of C. parapsilosis for several biotransformations to synthesize important chiral synthons/industrial chemicals is included. A comparison of C. parapsilosis with other whole cell biocatalysts for biocatalytic deracemization and asymmetric reduction of carbonyl and imine groups in the synthesis of a variety of enantiopure products is presented which will provide a basis for the choice of a biocatalyst for a desired organic transformation.

IC50 values for AChE were in a closer concentration range of 24.05\u201386.85\u00a0\u03bcM when compared to BChE inhibition (7.92\u2013227.19\u00a0\u03bcM). The esters caused the more efficient inhibition of AChE than amides and parent acid. The esterification and amidation of the rhodanine-3-acetic acid increased inhibition of BChE, even up to 26 times. Derivatives of 4-nitroaniline/phenol showed the activity superior to other substituents (H, Cl, CH3, OCH3, CF3). Rhodanines produced a balanced inhibition of both cholinesterases. Seven derivatives produced the more potent inhibition of AChE than rivastigmine, a clinically used drug; additional three compounds were comparable. Two amides exceeded inhibitory potency of rivastigmine towards BChE. Importantly, this is the first evidence that rhodanine-based compounds are able to inhibit BChE.",

Further, the effects of desmiflavasides C (1) and D (2) on the proliferation of breast and ovarian cancer cells as well as normal breast epithelial cells in culture were examined.

The peptides were also evaluated for the pro-apoptotic action in vivo on hemocytes of the Tenebrio molitor beetle. Additionally, the structural properties of alloferon analogs were examined by the circular dichroism in water and methanol. It was found that most of the evaluated peptides can reduce the HHV-1 titer in Vero cells. [Ala9]-alloferon exhibits the strongest antiviral activity among the analyzed compounds. However, no cytotoxic activity against Vero cell line was observed for all the studied peptides. In vivo assays with hemocytes of T. molitor showed that [Lys9]-, [Phg9]-, [Lys12]-, and [Phe12]-alloferon exhibit a twofold increase in caspases activity in comparison with the native peptide. The CD conformational studies indicate that the investigated peptides seem to prefer the unordered conformation.",

While peptidyl dopas are oxidatively converted to dehydrodopa derivatives, nothing is known about the further fate of dehydrodopyl compounds. To fill this void, we studied the oxidation chemistry of a peptidyl dehydrodopa mimic, 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopa methyl ester with mushroom tyrosinase. We employed both routine biochemical studies and reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to investigate the course of the reaction. Tyrosinase catalyzed the oxidation of 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopa methyl ester readily generating its typical o-quinone as the transient two-electron oxidation product. This quinone was extremely unstable and rapidly reacted with the parent compound forming benzodioxan type oligomeric products. Reaction mixture containing chemically made o-benzoquinone and 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopa methyl ester generated a mixed adduct of benzoquinone and 1,2-dehydro-N-acetyldopa methyl ester. Based on this finding, we propose that peptidyl dehydrodopa also exhibits a similar transformation accounting partially for the adhesive and cementing properties of dopyl proteins in nature.",

Although arjunolic acid (AA) has a diverse range of therapeutic applications including cardio-protection, there have been no reports on the effect of AA on CA II. The present study describes for the first time, the novel zinc independent inhibition of CA II by AA. The molecular docking studies of AA indicated that the hydroxyl group at C2 of the A-ring, which hydrogen bonds with the catalytic site residues (His64, Asn62 and Asn67), along with the gem-dimethyl group at C20 of the E-ring, greatly influences the inhibitory activity, independent of the catalytic zinc, unlike the inhibition observed with most CA II inhibitors. Among the triterpenoids tested viz. arjunolic acid, arjunic acid, asiatic acid, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, AA was the most potent in inhibiting CA II in vitro with an IC50 of 9\u00a0\u03bcM. It was interesting to note, that in spite of exhibiting very little differences in their structures, these triterpenoids exhibited vast differences in their inhibitory activities, with IC50 values ranging from 9\u00a0\u03bcM to as high as 333\u00a0\u03bcM. Furthermore, AA also inhibited the cytosolic activity of CA in H9c2 cardiomyocytes, as reflected by the decrease in acidification of the intracellular pH (pHi). The decreased acidification reduced the intracellular calcium levels, which further prevented the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Thus, these studies provide a better understanding for establishing the novel molecular mechanism involved in CA II inhibition by the non-zinc binding inhibitor AA.",

     "abstract": "A novel series of 6-aryl-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4(5H)-ones 3a-h were synthesized in a single step via condensation of carboxamide 2 with some aromatic aldehydes (presence of iodine). Treatment of aminopyrazole 1a with acetic anhydride afforded pyrazolopyrimidines 4 which on treatment with ethyl chloroacetate in refluxing dry DMF furnished a single product identified as ethyl 2-(3,6-dimethyl-4-oxo-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-5(4H)-yl) acetate 5. On the other hand, esterification of compound 6 with different alcohol, led to the formation of new esters linked pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidinones hybrids 7a-f. The reaction of compound 2 with 3-propargyl bromide gave the compound 8 used as a dipolarophile to access to triazoles (4- and 5-regioisomers (9a-e) and (10a-e), respectively) via the 1,3-dipoar cycloaddition reaction. Finally, condensation reaction of aminopyrazole 1b with \u03b1-cyanocinnamonitiles gave the new pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-3,6-dicarbonitriles 11a-e. Structures of compounds were established on the basis of 1H/13C NMR and ESI-HRMS. Compounds were screened for their cytotoxic (HCT-116 and MCF-7) and 5-lipoxygenase inhibition activities. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) was discussed.",

The prototype MeP releasing prodrug, 9-(\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl)-6-methylpurine, MeP-dR has demonstrated good activity against tumors expressing E. coli PNP, but its antitumor activity is limited due to toxicity resulting from the generation of MeP from gut bacteria. Therefore, we have embarked on a medicinal chemistry program to identify non-toxic MeP prodrugs that could be used in conjunction with E. coli PNP. In this work, we report on the synthesis of 9-(6-deoxy-\u03b2-d-allofuranosyl)-6-methylpurine (3) and 9-(6-deoxy-5-C-methyl-\u03b2-d-ribo-hexofuranosyl)-6-methylpurine (4), and the evaluation of their substrate activity with several phosphorylases.

     "abstract": "Mitomycin C (MC) and Decarbamoylmitomycin C (DMC) \u2013 a derivative of MC lacking the carbamate on C10 \u2013 are DNA alkylating agents. Their cytotoxicity is attributed to their ability to generate DNA monoadducts as well as intrastrand and interstrand cross-links (ICLs). The major monoadducts generated by MC and DMC in tumor cells have opposite stereochemistry at carbon one of the guanine\u2013mitosene bond: trans (or alpha) for MC and cis (or beta) for DMC. We hypothesize that local disruptions of DNA structure from trans or cis adducts are responsible for the different biochemical responses produced by MC and DMC. Access to DNA substrates bearing cis and trans MC/DMC lesions is essential to verify this hypothesis. Synthetic oligonucleotides bearing trans lesions can be obtained by bio-mimetic methods. However, this approach does not yield cis adducts. This report presents the first chemical synthesis of a cis mitosene DNA adduct. We also examined the stereopreference exhibited by the two drugs at the mononucleotide level by analyzing the formation of cis and trans adducts in the reaction of deoxyguanosine with MC or DMC using a variety of activation conditions. In addition, we performed Density Functional Theory calculations to evaluate the energies of these reactions. Direct alkylation under autocatalytic or bifunctional conditions yielded preferentially alpha adducts with both MC and DMC. DFT calculations showed that under bifunctional activation, the thermodynamically favored adducts are alpha, trans, for MC and beta, cis, for DMC. This suggests that the duplex DNA structure may stabilize/oriente the activated pro-drugs so that, with DMC, formation of the thermodynamically favored beta products are possible in a cellular environment.",

These compounds showed significant cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the range 0.118\u201354.32\u00a0\u03bcM. Conjugate 5m displayed potent antiproliferative activity against DU-145 cell line. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that these compounds arrested the cell cycle in G2/M phase. Moreover, the tubulin polymerization assay and immunofluorescence analysis indicate that 5m exhibits potent inhibitory effect on the tubulin assembly. Further, DNA fragmentation and Hoecst staining assays confirm that 5m induces apoptosis. Molecular docking studies and competitive binding assay indicated that 5m effectively bind at the colchicine binding site of the tubulin.",

In this report, we systemically investigated four site-selective strategies to introduce azide functionality into recombinant thrombomodulin (TM456), via direct recombinant expression with unnatural amino acid, chemical, and enzymatic modification for its bio-orthogonal modification application. First, a straightforward recombinant method to express TM456 with azide functionality near C-terminus by replacing methionine with azidohomoanlanine from methionine auxotroph Escherichia coli cell was investigated. Next, a sortase-mediated ligation (SML) method to incorporate azide functionality into the C-terminus of recombinant TM456 was demonstrated. The third is to add azide functionality to the N-terminal amine of recombinant TM456 via amidation chemistry, and the fourth is tyrosine selective three-component Mannich reaction to introduce azide functionality to recombinant TM456. Overall, SML of recombinant protein affords the highest overall yield for incorporating azide functionality into the C-terminus recombinant TM456 since the key protein expression step uses natural amino acids. Also, single site modification facilitates the highest TM456 activity.",

     "abstract": "Aldehyde oxidase (AO), a cytosolic molybdenum-containing hydroxylase, is predominantly active in liver and other tissues of mammalian species and involved in the metabolism of extensive range of aldehydes and nitrogen-containing compounds. A wide range of natural components including polyphenols are able to interfere with AO-catalyzed reactions. Polyphenols and flavonoids are one of the extensive secondary plant metabolites ubiquitously present in plants considered an important part of the human diet. The aim of the present study was to investigate inhibitory effect of selected phenolic compounds from three subclasses of aurone, flavanone and phenolic lactone compounds on the activity of AO, spectrophotometrically. AO enzyme was partially purified from liver of guinea pig. Then, inhibitory effects of 10 flavonoid compounds including 8 derivatives of 2-benzylidenebenzofuran-3(2H)-ones, as well as naringenin and ellagic acid on the activity of aldehyde oxidase were assessed compared with the specific inhibitor of AO, menadione. Among the phenolic compounds with inhibitory effects on the enzyme, ellagic acid (IC50\u00a0=\u00a014.47\u00a0\u03bcM) was the most potent agent with higher inhibitory action than menadione (IC50\u00a0=\u00a031.84\u00a0\u03bcM). The mechanisms by which flavonoid compounds inhibit AO activity have been also determined. The inhibitory process of the assessed compounds occurs via either a non-competitive or mixed mode. Although flavonoid compounds extensively present in the nature, mainly in dietary regimen, aurones with promising biological properties are not widely distributed in nature, so synthesis of aurone derivatives is of great importance. Additionally, aurones seem to provide a promising scaffold in medicinal chemistry for the skeleton of new developing drugs, so the results of the current study can be valuable in order to better understanding drug\u2013food as well as drug\u2013drug interaction and also appears to be worthwhile in drug development strategies.",

First, experiments with analogues containing small fluorophores that are alternative substrates for prenyltransferases are described. Those analogues have been useful for quantifying binding affinity and for the production of fluorescently labeled proteins. Next, the use of analogues that incorporate biotin, bioorthogonal groups or antigenic moieties is described. Such probes have been particularly useful for identifying proteins that are naturally prenylated within mammalian cells. Overall, the use of isoprenoid analogues has contributed significantly to the understanding of protein prenlation.",

     "abstract": "Dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) are potent exopeptidases, which possess central role in proteolysis. As compared to other members of DPP family, proline containing dipeptide hydrolysing activity of DPP-II (Dipeptidyl peptidase II) is unique as it hydrolyses imino group and plays a key role in protein metabolism. In present study, DPP-II was purified from germinated moong bean seeds using acid and ammonium sulphate precipitation followed by successive chromatographies on gel filtration (pH 7.4) and cation exchanger (pH 5.9). Native PAGE and in-situ gel assay confirmed the apparent homogeneity. Purified plant DPP-II is an oligomeric enzyme with molecular weight of 97.3\u00a0kDa. Highest DPP-II activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C, with stability in the range of neutral to alkaline pH. Substrate specificity showed consequent activity for proline containing dipeptide followed by Lys-Ala and other hydrophobic dipeptides, but none of the studied endopeptidase and monopeptidase substrate was hydrolysed. Catalytic characterization with modifier studies revealed the involvement of Ser and His residues in its catalytic mechanism. Its dipeptidyl peptidase activity for proline containing dipeptide supported its role in the bioactive peptide generation and food industry. Functional studies of DPP-II revealed the significant involvement of this glycoproteinous enzyme in protein mobilization during germination. Further studies on industrial applications exploring physiological role are in progress.",

     "abstract": "Eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN) is an eosinophil secretion protein and a member of the Ribonuclease A (RNase A) superfamily involved in the immune response system and inflammatory disorders. The pathological actions of EDN are strongly dependent on the enzymatic activity and therefore, it is of significant interest to discover potent and specific inhibitors of EDN. In this framework we have assessed the inhibitory potency of triazole double-headed ribonucleosides. We present here an efficient method for the heterologous production and purification of EDN together with the synthesis of nucleosides and their biochemical evaluation in RNase A and EDN. Two groups of double-headed nucleosides were synthesized by the attachment of a purine or a pyrimidine base, through a triazole group at the 3\u2032-C position of a pyrimidine or a purine ribonucleoside, respectively. Based on previous data with mononucleosides these compounds were expected to improve the inhibitory potency for RNase A and specificity for EDN. Kinetics data revealed that despite the rational, all but one, double-headed ribonucleosides were less potent than the respective mononucleosides while they were also more specific for ribonuclease A than for EDN. Compound 11c (9-[3\u2032-[4-[(cytosine-1-yl)methyl]-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl]-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl]adenine) displayed a stronger preference for EDN than for ribonuclease A and a Ki value of 58\u00a0\u03bcM. This is the first time that an inhibitor is reported to have a better potency for EDN than for RNase A. The crystal structure of EDN\u201311c complex reveals the structural basis of its potency and selectivity providing important guidelines for future structure-based inhibitor design efforts.",

In this study, we explored an in vitro microsomal ghrelin octanoylation assay to analyze its enzymologic features. Measurement of Km for 10-mer, 27-mer, and synthetic Tat-peptide-containing ghrelin substrates provided evidence for a role of charge interactions in substrate binding. Ghrelin substrates with amino-alanine in place of Ser3 demonstrated that GOAT can catalyze the formation of an octanoyl-amide bond at a similar rate compared with the natural reaction. A pH-rate comparison of these substrates revealed minimal differences in acyltransferase activity across pH 6.0\u20139.0, providing evidence that these reactions may be relatively insensitive to the basicity of the substrate nucleophile. The conserved His338 residue was required both for Ser3 and amino-Ala3 ghrelin substrates, suggesting that His338 may have a key catalytic role beyond that of a general base.",

Although little is known about the substrate selectivity of this enzyme, the biocatalytic activities of CYP175A1 on different substituted naphthalenes have been studied in oxidative pathway, and the effect of the substituent on the reaction has been determined. The enzyme first acts as a peroxygenase to convert these substituted naphthalenes to the corresponding naphthols, which subsequently undergo in-situ oxidative dimerization to form dyes of different colors possibly by the peroxidase-type activity of CYP175A1. The product analyses and kinetic measurements suggested that the presence of electron releasing substituent (ERS) in the substrate enhanced the substrate conversion, whereas the presence of electron withdrawing substituent (EWS) in the substrate drastically reduced the substrate conversion. The position of the ERS in the substrate was also found to play an important role in the transformation of the substrate. The results further demonstrate that mutation of the Leu80 residue to Phe enhances the reactivity of the enzyme by favoring the substrate association in the active site. The observed rates of the enzymatic oxygenation reaction of the substituted naphthalenes followed the Hammett correlation of substituent effect, supporting aromatic electrophilic substitution mechanism catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 enzyme.",

Among the targets available for inhibition of dengue virus, non-structural protein NS2B\u2013NS3 protease is considered as a promising target for the development of anti-dengue agents. In the current study we have synthesized a series of 4-(1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindol-2-yl)benzene-1-sulphonamide derivatives and screened for DENV2 protease activity. Compounds 16 and 19 showed IC50 of DENV2 Protease activity with 48.2 and 121.9\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies were carried out to know the binding mode responsible for the activity. MD simulations revealed that, NS2B/NS3 protease was more stable when it binds with the active compound. Structure optimization of the lead compounds 16 and 19 and their co-crystallization studies are underway.",

Asp38 and Leu37 were shown to be important but not essential for calcium-mediated association of maize lipoxygenase-1 to subcellular membranes in vitro. Kinetic studies demonstrate that catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) shows a bell-shaped dependence on log of the molar ratio of substrate to unbound calcium. Calcium also modulates product distribution of the maize lipoxygenase-1 reaction, favoring 13-positional specificity and increasing the relative amount of (E,Z)-isomeric products. The results suggest that calcium regulates the maize lipoxygenase-1 reaction by binding to substrate, and by promoting binding of substrate to enzyme and association of maize lipoxygenase-1 to subcellular membranes.",

Among them, compounds 1b and 2d displayed excellent IC50 values of 1.66\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.49\u00a0\u03bcM and competitive inhibitor constant Ki 43.66\u00a0\u03bcM and 4.10\u00a0\u03bcM respectively. Ex vivo study confirmed their CNS penetration and brain AChE inhibition abilities. Furthermore, 1b and 2d showed significant antiamnesic activity at a dose of 1.0\u00a0mg/kg as compared to the reference compounds piracetam and rivastigmine. The results indicate that these two compounds emerged to be developed as cognition enhancers worthy of future pursuit.",

Asymmetrical tetracationic porphyrin with one phenyl-4-N-methyl-4-pyridyl group and three N-methyl-4-pyridyl groups exhibit the best G4-DNA binding affinities among all the designed compounds, suggesting that the bulk of the substituents should be matched to the width of the grooves they putatively lie in. Theoretical calculations applying the density functional theory have been carried out and explain the binding properties of these porphyrins reasonably.

The goal of the study was to evaluate quinone-induced protein modifications as well as substituent effects, utilizing several techniques such as SDS\u2013PAGE, fluorescence spectroscopy, microscopy, and LC-ESI+-QTOF-MS. SDS\u2013PAGE experiments revealed that all quinones modify RNase through oligomerization as well as polymeric aggregation; with CBQ functioning as the most efficient quinone while MBQ was least efficient. The fluorescence emission was found to be less intense and the anisotropy values were found to be slightly higher for the modified RNase compared to the unmodified RNase. UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy indicated that all three quinones formed adducts in which they were covalently linked to RNase. Confocal imaging analysis showed that the presence of CBQ resulted in massive RNase aggregation, while PBQ-treated RNase formed much smaller aggregates. MBQ-treated RNase exhibited micrographic features that closely resembled those of the unmodified RNase. LC-ESI+-QTOF-MS studies indicated the nature of PBQ- and CBQ-induced RNase modifications are complex mainly due to simultaneously occurrence of both adduct formation and oligomerization.

Since adenosine antagonists (A1 and A2A subtypes) and MAO-B inhibitors are considered agents for the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, dual-target-directed drugs that antagonize adenosine receptors and inhibit MAO-B may have enhanced therapeutic value. The results document that the sulfanylphthalimide analogues are selective for the adenosine A1 receptor over the A2A receptor subtype, with a number of compounds also possessing MAO-B inhibitory properties. Among the compounds evaluated, 5-[(4-methoxybenzyl)sulfanyl]phthalimide was found to possess the highest binding affinity to adenosine A1 receptors with a Ki value of 0.369\u00a0\u03bcM.

Such dual-target-directed compounds may act synergistic in the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease: antagonism of the A1 receptor may facilitate dopamine release, while MAO-B inhibition may reduce dopamine metabolism. Additionally, dual-target-directed compounds may find therapeutic value in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: antagonism of the A1 receptor may be beneficial in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction, while MAO-B inhibition may exhibit neuroprotective properties.

It is important to understand the goal of developing artificial molecular receptors, capable of binding very efficiently and very selectively with caffeine which is described elaborately in this context. The modern bioorganic chemistry concerns the design of synthetic molecules that mimic various aspects of enzyme chemistry and to understand their essential roles in biological systems. The stimulating effect of caffeine is not only exploited in nutrient technology but also in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, which accounts for the economic importance of this particular additive.

Compound 3j, which is carrying 3,4-di-OMeC6H3 groups at R position on the molecule, was found to be potent MAO-B inhibitor amongst the fifteen with Ki value for MAO-B of 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM comparable to that of standard drug, Selegiline (Ki for MAO-B is 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcM). Compound 3j also appeared as the most selective MAO-B inhibitor according to its best selectivity index (30.0), which is comparable to that of Selegiline (SIMAO-B\u00a0=\u00a035.0). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies were carried out using Autodock-4.0 and Amber12 to understand the molecular level interaction and energy relation of MAO isoforms with selective inhibitors (3d and 3j). Simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. Leads identified may further be explored to develop potent isoform specific inhibitors of MAO.",

The interactions between these compounds and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, UV\u2013vis spectrophotometry and circular dichroic spectroscopy. According to experimental results, three azocalix[4]arene derivatives can efficiently bind to BSA molecules and the o-MAC-Calix displays more efficient interactions with BSA molecules than m-MAC-Calix and p-MAC-Calix. Molecular docking showed that the o-MAC-Calix was embedded in the hydrophobic cavity of helical structure of BSA molecular and the tryptophan (Trp) residue of BSA molecular had strong interaction with o-MAC-Calix. The fluorescence quenching of BSA caused by azocalix[4]arene derivatives is attributed to the static quenching process. In addition, the synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy indicates that these azocalix[4]arene derivatives are more accessible to Trp residues of BSA molecules than the tyrosine (Tyr) residues. The circular dichroic spectroscopy further verified the binding of azocalix[4]arene derivatives and BSA.",

The l-Phenylalanine QUATS displayed enhanced antibacterial properties with a higher cut-off point compared to their corresponding l-Phenylalanine ester hydrochlorides. The CMC was correlated with the MIC, inferring that micellar activity contributes to the cut-off effect in antibacterial activity. The hemolytic activities (HC50) of the QUATS against human red blood cells were also determined to illustrate the selectivity of these QUATS for bacterial over mammalian cells. In general, the MIC was lower than the HC50, and assessment of the micellar contribution to the antibacterial and hemolytic evaluation in TBS as a common medium confirmed that these QUATS can act as antibacterial, yet non-toxic molecules at their monomer concentrations. The interaction of the QUATS with the phospholipid vesicles (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, DPPC) in the presence of 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) as fluorescence probes showed that the presence of the quaternary ammonium moiety causes an increase in hydrophobic interactions, thus causing an increase in antibacterial activity.",

One of the reasons attributed to these high levels is decrease in inhibitor concentration. Therefore, the work on the identification of small molecular weight compounds as inhibitors of cysteine proteases is of great therapeutic significance. Exploring this work in the same direction, we here present the synthesis of substituted N-formylpyrazolines and N-benzoylpyrazolines and study these as inhibitors to cysteine proteases. After a preliminary screening of the compounds as inhibitors to cysteine proteases in general, studies were carried out to study their inhibitory effects on cathepsin B and cathepsin H.

Results showed that LDQN-C could enhance secretion and synthesis of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) by up-regulating expression levels of aggrecan, collagen II and Sox9 genes compared to the GA treated group and control group. Expression of collagen type II was effectively up-regulated while collagen I was down-regulated, which demonstrated that the inhibition of chondrocytes dedifferentiation by LDQN-C. Range of 1.36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0M to 1.36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M is recommended dose of LDQN-C, among which the most profound response was observed with 1.36\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128\u00a0M. GA at concentration of 0.125\u00a0\u03bcg/mL was compared. This study might provide a basis for the development of a novel agent for the treatment of articular cartilage defect.",

Currently, there is a growing interest in their antitumor activity and their ability to reduce the risk and mortality of several cancers. While several studies revealed the ability of NSAIDs to induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis in cancer cells, their exact anticancer mechanism is not fully understood. However, both cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent and -independent pathways were reported to have a role. In an attempt to develop new anticancer agents, a series of diphenylthiazole substituted thiazolidinone derivatives was synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activity against a panel of cancer cell lines. Additionally, the inhibitory activity of the synthesized derivatives against COX enzymes was investigated as a potential mechanism for the anticancer activity. Cytotoxicity assay results showed that compounds 15b and 16b were the most potent anticancer agents with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) between 8.88 and 19.25\u00a0\u03bcM against five different human cancer cell lines. Interestingly, COX inhibition assay results were in agreement with that of the cytotoxicity assays where the most potent anticancer compounds showed good COX-2 inhibition comparable to that of celecoxib. Further support to our results were gained by the docking studies which suggested the ability of compound 15b to bind into COX-2 enzyme with low energy scores. Collectively, these results demonstrated the promising activity of the newly designed compounds as leads for subsequent development into potential anticancer agents.",

     "publication date": "12-2014",
     "abstract": "The carbon\u2013carbon lyases, tryptophan indole lyase (TIL) and tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL) are bacterial enzymes which catalyze the reversible elimination of indole and phenol from l-tryptophan and l-tyrosine, respectively. These PLP-dependent enzymes show high sequence homology (\u223c40% identity) and both form homotetrameric structures. Steady state kinetic studies with both enzymes show that an active site base is essential for activity, and \u03b1-deuterated substrates exhibit modest primary isotope effects on kcat and kcat/Km, suggesting that substrate deprotonation is partially rate-limiting. Pre-steady state kinetics with TPL and TIL show rapid formation of external aldimine intermediates, followed by deprotonation to give quinonoid intermediates absorbing at about 500\u00a0nm. In the presence of phenol and indole analogues, 4-hydroxypyridine and benzimidazole, the quinonoid intermediates of TPL and TIL decay to aminoacrylate intermediates, with \u03bbmax at about 340\u00a0nm. Surprisingly, there are significant kinetic isotope effects on both formation and subsequent decay of the quinonoid intermediates when \u03b1-deuterated substrates are used. The crystal structure of TPL with a bound competitive inhibitor, 4-hydroxyphenylpropionate, identified several essential catalytic residues: Tyr-71, Thr-124, Arg-381, and Phe-448. The active sites of TIL and TPL are highly conserved with the exceptions of these residues: Arg-381(TPL)/Ile-396 (TIL); Thr-124 (TPL)/Asp-137 (TIL), and Phe-448 (TPL)/His-463 (TIL). Mutagenesis of these residues results in dramatic decreases in catalytic activity without changing substrate specificity. The conserved tyrosine, Tyr-71 (TPL)/Tyr-74 (TIL) is essential for elimination activity with both enzymes, and likely plays a role as a proton donor to the leaving group. Mutation of Arg-381 and Thr-124 of TPL to alanine results in very low but measurable catalytic activity. Crystallography of Y71F and F448H TPL with 3-fluoro-l-tyrosine bound demonstrated that there are two quinonoid structures, relaxed and tense. In the relaxed structure, the substrate aromatic ring is in plane with the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 bond, but in the tense structure, the substrate aromatic ring is about 20\u00b0 out of plane with the C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 bond. In the tense structure, hydrogen bonds are formed between the substrate OH and the guanidinium of Arg-381 and the OH of Thr-124, and the phenyl rings of Phe-448 and 449 provide steric strain. Based on the effects of mutagenesis, the substrate strain is estimated to contribute about 108 to TPL catalysis. Thus, the mechanisms of TPL and TIL require both substrate strain and acid/base catalysis, and substrate strain is probably responsible for the very high substrate specificity of TPL and TIL.",

The function of ThDP is to greatly increase the acidity of two carbon acids by stabilizing their conjugate bases, the ylide/carbene/C2-carbanion of the thiazolium ring and the C2\u03b1-carbanion/enamine, once the substrate binds to ThDP. In recent years, several ThDP-bound intermediates on such pathways have been characterized by both solution and solid-state methods. Prominent among these advances are X-ray crystallographic results identifying both oxidative and non-oxidative intermediates, rapid chemical quench followed by NMR detection of several intermediates which are stable under acidic conditions, solid-state NMR and circular dichroism detection of the states of ionization and tautomerization of the 4\u2032-aminopyrimidine moiety of ThDP in some of the intermediates. These methods also enabled in some cases determination of the rate-limiting step in the complex series of steps. This review is an update of a review with the same title published by the authors in 2005 in this Journal. Much progress has been made in the intervening decade in the identification of the intermediates and their application to gain additional mechanistic insight.",

     "abstract": "Nature has evolved different strategies for the reversible cleavage of ketose phosphosugars as essential metabolic reactions in all domains of life. Prominent examples are the Schiff-base forming class I FBP and F6P aldolase as well as transaldolase, which all exploit an active center lysine to reversibly cleave the C3\u2013C4 bond of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or fructose-6-phosphate to give two 3-carbon products (aldolase), or to shuttle 3-carbon units between various phosphosugars (transaldolase). In contrast, transketolase and phosphoketolase make use of the bioorganic cofactor thiamin diphosphate to cleave the preceding C2\u2013C3 bond of ketose phosphates. While transketolase catalyzes the reversible transfer of 2-carbon ketol fragments in a reaction analogous to that of transaldolase, phosphoketolase forms acetyl phosphate as final product in a reaction that comprises ketol cleavage, dehydration and phosphorolysis. In this review, common and divergent catalytic principles of these enzymes will be discussed, mostly, but not exclusively, on the basis of crystallographic snapshots of catalysis. These studies in combination with mutagenesis and kinetic analysis not only delineated the stereochemical course of substrate binding and processing, but also identified key catalytic players acting at the various stages of the reaction. The structural basis for the different chemical fates and lifetimes of the central enamine intermediates in all five enzymes will be particularly discussed, in addition to the mechanisms of substrate cleavage, dehydration and ring-opening reactions of cyclic substrates. The observation of covalent enzymatic intermediates in hyperreactive conformations such as Schiff-bases with twisted double-bond linkages in transaldolase and physically distorted substrate\u2013thiamin conjugates with elongated substrate bonds to be cleaved in transketolase, which probably epitomize a canonical feature of enzyme catalysis, will be also highlighted.",

Both experimental and computational approaches were taken to the work. The experiments were performed in vitro and goat liver was used as a source of lipid. 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal was used as model marker for estimation of docetaxel\u2013lipid interaction. The computational portion of the work was limited to QSAR analysis of those antioxidants for better understanding of the structural requirements of antioxidants on docetaxel\u2013lipid interaction. The study was done with freely online available 2D descriptors available on PaDEL (open source). Stepwise regression analysis was used as chemometric tool. The experimental study showed the lipid peroxidation induction capacity of docetaxel. It was also noted that all twenty-eight antioxidants had the ability to suppress the lipid peroxidation. But among them butylated hydroxyl toluene showed the highest potential (\u221220.5%) and flavone showing lowest potential (\u22120.8%) to suppress the docetaxel-induced lipid peroxidation. The computational study indicates the importance of topology of the whole molecules, topological distances among atoms within a molecule and specific fragment pattern present in a molecule required for inhibition of lipid peroxidation.",

The nexus for many of these events is the control of the AmpR transcription factor by the composition of the muropeptide pool generated during peptidoglycan recycling.

Abyssinones promoted apoptosis by up regulation of p53 and Bax, along with down regulation of Bcl-2. Apoptosis induction was mediated through mitochondrial pathway releasing cytochrome c and Apaf-1 into cytosol; associated with activation of caspase-3. Further they were able to decrease the expression of cell proliferation markers PCNA and cyclin D1 indicating anti proliferative activity. These observations demonstrate that abyssinones trigger apoptosis via mitochondrial pathway by activation of caspase-3 and disrupts cell cycle.",

Enzymatic assays for and structural information on essential integral membrane proteins such as MraY and FtsW involved in lipid II (the peptidoglycan building block precursor) biosynthesis have put these proteins on the list of potential new targets. This review summarises and discusses the results and approaches to the development of lead compounds that inhibit bacterial cell division.",

     "abstract": "Resistance to antimicrobials is one of the biggest threats to our healthcare. However, in the last few decades very few truly novel antimicrobial compounds have been brought to market, creating the potential threat of a post-antibiotic era in which infections are very difficult to treat. Identification of novel compounds with antimicrobial activity is therefore paramount. Ideally, novel compounds should be designed that are active against targets that are not or barely used, as it is less likely that resistance already exists against such compounds. One example of an underexplored target in the treatment of infections is DNA. In this review we describe a number of DNA binding compounds and discuss potential opportunities and problems.",

Consequently there is renewed interest in drugs which attenuate virulence rather than bacterial growth. Since the metaphors of warfare are often used to describe the battle between pathogen and host, we will describe in such a context, the molecular communication (quorum sensing) mechanisms used by bacteria to co-ordinate virulence at the population level. Recent progress in exploiting this information through the design of anti-virulence deception strategies that disrupt quorum sensing through signal molecule inactivation, inhibition of signal molecule biosynthesis or the blockade of signal transduction and their advantages and disadvantages are considered.",

In this study, Enoxaparin\u2013PEG conjugate (P-ENX) was synthesized from Enoxaparin and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and evaluated for its potential for extended duration of action. The esterification of the carboxyl groups of the drug moiety with the hydroxyl groups of mPEG-2000 was done by employing carbodiimide coupling chemistry. P-ENX conjugate was purified by dialysis and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Proton-Nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass analysis techniques. FTIR analysis revealed frequency of the carbonyl group in accord with ester linkage formation between the drug and the PEG moiety. 1H NMR of the conjugate showed significant change in the chemical shift further indicative of ENX and PEG chemical interaction. In MALDI spectra, small peaks at 12,907 and 16,137 m/z confirmed the probability of conjugation of ENX and PEG. P-ENX exhibited considerable enhancement in anti-Xa activity (by three-folds) in comparison to free ENX. Further, an increase in AUC (over four-folds) was observed in P-ENX. Thus, PEGylation of ENX is a novel approach for extended and enhanced activity of ENX with a potential for decreased dosing frequency.",

Herein we report the synthesis of a bipartite ASO conjugated to MTX using the tau RNA hairpin and flanking sequences as a template. A set of six MTX analogs, each containing a linker-azide, and a set of ten bipartite ASOs, each containing a branched linker-alkyne, were synthesized and tested in combinatorial fashion for their ability to conjugate in the presence or absence of template RNA. A single template-dependent MTX\u2013ASO conjugate was identified from among the 60 reaction mixtures, demonstrating that the MTX and ASO precursors could simultaneously bind the RNA template and allow proper positioning of azide and alkyne for 1,3-cycloaddition.

Structural characterizations of the new compounds were performed using spectral and elemental analysis. All compounds were tested for their anticancer activity against human breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and PC-3 respectively. With exception of compounds 11a and 13a, results revealed that all the tested compounds showed half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values less than 40\u00a0\u03bcM. Compound 12b and the three urea derivatives 14b\u2013d showed the most potent anticancer activity with IC50 values less than 2.73\u00a0\u03bcM. The anticancer activity of these compounds was mediated, at least in part, via the induction of apoptosis as indicated by its ability to activate caspase-3/7. In light of the high potency of our novel compounds in targeting both breast and prostate cancers, these compounds warrant continued preclinical development as potential anticancer agents.",

In the large family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs), functional predictions often fail. Putative tropinone reductases, named tropinone reductase-like (TRL), are SDRs annotated in many genomes of organisms that do not contain tropane alkaloids. SDRs in vitro often accept several substrates complicating functional assignments. Cochlearia officinalis, a Brassicaceae, contains tropane alkaloids, in contrast to the closely related Arabidopsis thaliana. TRLs from Arabidopsis and the tropinone reductase isolated from Cochlearia (CoTR) were investigated for their catalytic capacity. In contrast to CoTR, none of the Arabidopsis TRLs reduced tropinone in vitro. NAD(H) and NADP(H) preferences were relaxed in two TRLs, and protein homology models revealed flexibility of amino acid residues in the active site allowing binding of both cofactors. TRLs reduced various carbonyl compounds, among them terpene ketones. The reduction was stereospecific for most of TRLs investigated, and the corresponding terpene alcohol oxidation was stereoselective. Carbonyl compounds that were identified to serve as substrates were applied for modeling pharmacophores of each TRL. A database of commercially available compounds was screened using the pharmacophores. Compounds identified as potential substrates were confirmed by turnover in vitro. Thus pharmacophores may contribute to better predictability of biochemical functions of SDR enzymes.",

However, such drugs are effective in patients having good glycemic control and less severe diabetic complications. In present study we have designed novel pyrazolone derivative and performed eco-friendly synthesis approach and tested the synthesized compounds as potential inhibitors of aldose reductase activity.

The analysis of HATR-FTIR frequency shifts and bandwidths and 1H NMR spin\u2013lattice relaxation times, related to specific lipid groups, showed that \u03b1-ESA causes an ordering effect on the polar and interfacial regions of ASO liposomes, which may restrict the OH diffusion in the membrane.

The aim of this review is to give an overview of biocatalytic carbonyl reduction with special focus on processing of fluoro containing 1-arylethanones with enzymes in cell free systems. The methodologies applied to improve the reactions are highlighted, alongside potential application of the building blocks in bioactive compounds. Enzymatic ketone reduction is concluded to be most beneficial as compared to chemo catalytic methods in transformations of highly fluorinated and therefore electron deficient ketones. A high enantiomeric excess can be achieved, and by changing the catalyst, both enantiomers are accessible. High rates are often seen for such electron deficient ketones, and the reactions have a favourable equilibrium position.",

     "abstract": "Chromone (4), which form the base structure of various flavonoids isolated as natural products, is capable of relaxing smooth muscle. This is relevant to the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The former disorder involves the contraction of vascular smooth muscle (VSM), and the latter two bronchoconstriction of airway smooth muscle (ASM). One of the principal mechanisms by which flavonoids relax muscle tissue is the inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), present in both VSM and ASM. Therefore, a study was designed to analyze the structure\u2013activity relationship of chromone derivatives in vaso- and bronchorelaxation through the inhibition of PDE. Docking studies showed that these chromones bind at the catalytic site of PDEs. Consequently, we synthesized analogs of chromones substituted at position C-2 with alkyl and naphthyl groups. These compounds were synthesized from 2-hydroxyacetophenone and acyl chlorides in the presence of DBU and pyridine, modifying the methodology reported for the synthesis of 3-acylchromones by changing the reaction temperature from 80 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C and using methylene chloride as solvent, yielding the corresponding phenolic esters 10a\u201310h. These compounds were cyclized with an equivalent of DBU, pyridine as solvent, and heated at reflux temperature, yielding the chromones 11a\u201311h. Evaluation of the vasorelaxant effect of 4, 11a\u201311h on rat aorta demonstrated that potency decreases with branched alkyl groups. Whereas the EC50 of compound 11d (substituted by an n-hexyl group) was 8.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0\u03bcM, that of 11f (substituted by an isobutyl group) was 14.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.64\u00a0\u03bcM. Contrarily, the effectiveness of the compound is directly proportional to the length of the alkyl chain, as evidenced by the increase in maximal effect of compound 11c versus 11d (66% versus 100%) and 11e versus 11f (60% versus 96%). With an aromatic group like naphthyl as the C-2 substituent, the effectiveness was only 43%. All compounds tested on guinea pig trachea showed less than 55% effectiveness. Compounds 4, 11a\u201311h were evaluated as PDE inhibitors in vitro, with 11d showing the greatest effect (73%), corroborating the importance of a long alkyl chain, which inhibits the decomposition of cGMP.

In this study, we examined whether endocannabinoids containing both N-acyl group and phenolic group can affect the activity of soybean lipoxygenase (LOX)-1, similar to mammalian 15-lipoxygenase in physicochemical properties. First, N-arachidonoyl dopamine and N-oleoyl dopamine were found to inhibit soybean LOX-1-catalyzed oxygenation of linoleic acid in a non-competitive manner with a Ki value of 3.7\u00a0\u03bcM and 6.2\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Meanwhile, other endocannabinoids failed to show a remarkable inhibition of soybean LOX-1. Separately, N-arachidonoyl dopamine and N-arachidonoyl serotonin were observed to inactivate soybean LOX-1 with Kin value of 27\u00a0\u03bcM and 24\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively, and k3 value of 0.12\u00a0min\u22121 and 0.35\u00a0min\u22121, respectively. Furthermore, such an inactivation was enhanced by ascorbic acid, but suppressed by 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9,11-octadecadienoic acid. Taken together, it is proposed that endocannabinoids containing polyunsaturated acyl moiety and phenolic group may be efficient for the inhibition as well as inactivation of 15-lipoxygenase.",

Several antagonists of the A2A receptor have entered clinical trials for this purpose and many research groups have initiated programs to develop A2A receptor antagonists. Most A2A receptor antagonists belong to two different chemical classes, the xanthine derivatives and the amino-substituted heterocyclic compounds. In an attempt to discover high affinity A2A receptor antagonists and to further explore the structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) of A2A antagonism by the xanthine class of compounds, this study examines the A2A antagonistic properties of series of (E)-8-styrylxanthines, 8-(phenoxymethyl)xanthines and 8-(3-phenylpropyl)xanthines. The results document that among these series, the (E)-8-styrylxanthines have the highest binding affinities with the most potent homologue, (E)-1,3-diethyl-7-methyl-8-[(3-trifluoromethyl)styryl]xanthine, exhibiting a Ki value of 11.9\u00a0nM. This compound was also effective in reversing haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats, providing evidence that it is in fact an A2A receptor antagonist. The importance of substitution at C8 with the styryl moiety was demonstrated by the finding that none of the 8-(phenoxymethyl)xanthines and 8-(3-phenylpropyl)xanthines exhibited high binding affinities for the A2A receptor.",

     "abstract": "The anticancer drug mitomycin C produces cytotoxic effects after being converted to a highly reactive bis-electrophile by a reductive activation, a reaction that a number of 1-electron or 2-electron oxidoreductase enzymes can perform in cells. Several reports in the literature indicate that ascorbic acid can modulate the cytotoxic effects of mitomycin C, either potentiating or inhibiting its effects. As ascorbic acid is a reducing agent that is known to be able to reduce quinones, it could be possible that the observed modulatory effects are a consequence of a direct redox reduction between mitomycin C and ascorbate. To determine if this is the case, the reaction between mitomycin C and ascorbate was studied using UV/Vis spectroscopy and LC/MS. We also studied the reaction of ascorbate with mitomycin A, a highly toxic member of the mitomycin family with a higher redox potential than mitomycin C. We found that ascorbate is capable to reduce mitomycin A efficiently, but it reduces mitomycin C rather inefficiently. The mechanisms of activation have been elucidated based on the kinetics of the reduction and on the analysis of the mitosene derivatives formed after the reaction. We found that the activation occurs by the interplay of three different mechanisms that contribute differently, depending on the pH of the reaction. As the reduction of mitomycin C by ascorbate is rather inefficiently at physiologically relevant pH values we conclude that the modulatory effect of ascorbate on the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C is not the result of a direct redox reaction and therefore this modulation must be the consequence of other biochemical mechanisms.",

Praziquantel (PZQ) is the only drug currently administrated to treat this disease. However, praziquantel-resistant parasites have been identified in endemic areas and can be generated in the laboratory. Therefore, it is essential to find new therapeutics. Herein we report a series of novel 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sufonyl 1,4-diazepine derivatives, which were synthesized, characterized and tested as anti-schistosomal agents in vitro. Among all tested compounds, compounds 4a, 5b, and 7b at different tested concentrations (50, 100, and 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) showed the highest schistosomicidal activity. Among those 3 compounds, compound 7b was the most potent anti-schistosomal one. Moreover, all tested compound, at 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL concentration, significantly reduced oviposition of adult worms in vitro. Furthermore, both compound 4a and 7b, as well as compound 6a, completely diminished egg deposition. To clarify the possible mechanism by which novel 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sufonyl 1,4-diazepine derivatives act as anti-schistosomal agents, molecular docking of all new compounds was carried out using Molsoft ICM pro 3.5-0a to investigate the binding affinity and binding mode to thioredoxin glutathione reductase enzyme (TGR), a potential drug target for anti-schistosomal agents. The docking results revealed moderate to high affinity of the new compounds towards TGR. Compound 7b scored the highest binding energy (\u2212101.13\u00a0kcal/mol) against TGR crystal structure forming eight hydrogen bonds with the amino acid residues at the binding site of the receptor. This result indicates that compound 7b could exert its effect through inhibition of TGR, which is a vital enzyme for schistosome survival.",

     "abstract": "The present study was undertaken to gain insight into the associations of mercury(II) with dicysteinyl tripeptides in buffered media at pH 7.4. We investigated the effects of increasing the distance between cysteinyl residues on mercury(II) associations and complex formations. The peptide\u2013mercury(II) formation constants and their associated thermodynamic parameters in 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffered solutions were evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry. Complexes formed in different relative ratios of mercury(II) to cysteinyl peptides in ammonium formate buffered solutions were characterized by LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The results from these studies show that n-alkyl dicysteinyl peptides (CP 1\u20134), and an aryl dicysteinyl peptide (CP 5) can serve as effective \u201cdouble anchors\u201d to accommodate the coordination sites of mercury(II) to form predominantly one-to-one Hg(peptide) complexes. The aryl dicysteinyl peptide (CP 5) also forms the two-to-two Hg2(peptide)2 complex. In the presence of excess peptide, Hg(peptide)2 complexes are also detected. Notably, increasing the distance between the ligating groups or \u201canchor points\u201d in CP 1\u20135 does not significantly affect their affinity for mercury(II). However, the enthalpy change (\u0394H) values (\u0394H1\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221291\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 and \u0394H2\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221266\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121) for complex formation between CP 4 and 5 with mercury(II) are about one and a half times larger than the related values for CP 1, 2 and 3 (\u0394H1\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u221266\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 and \u0394H2\u00a0\u223c\u00a046\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121).

Generally, these associations result in a decrease in entropy, indicating that these peptide\u2013mercury complexes potentially form highly ordered structures.

Further, the potency was affected by the aromatic substitution pattern of the phenylethanamine: the unsubstituted, the meta-fluoro and the para-bromo substituted derivatives had the lowest minimum protozoacidal concentrations (8\u201316\u00a0\u03bcg/mL).

Gastric ulceration was determined in pre-inflamed rats. Natural curcumin showed modest aspirin-like anti-inflammatory activity which was enhanced when co-administered with the PGE1 analogue misoprostol as a synergist. In contrast, four novel curcuminoids (RK-97, RK-103, RK-104 and RK-106) in which the bis-methoxy-phenyl group of curcumin was replaced with bis-dimethoxybutenolidyl-(ascorbate), bis-naphthyl, and bis-furanyl derivatives, respectively, had potent activity in the anti-arthritic assay with little gastric or systemic toxicity, compared with the vehicle-treated controls. Of the curcuminoids the furan RK-106 was the only compound to inhibit production of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in a monocytic cell-line THP-1 in vitro. The inactivity of RK-106 on the production of PGE2 may be related to its absence of gastrotoxicity. None of the curcuminoids exhibited anti-pyretic activity and this may also be related to its insensitivity to PGE2.

     "abstract": "Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), in the active site of ornithine 4,5-aminomutase (OAM), forms a Schiff base with N\u03b4 of the d-ornithine side chain and facilitates interconversion of the amino acid to (2R, 4S) 2,4-diaminopentanoic acid via a radical-based mechanism. The crystal structure of OAM reveals that His225 is within hydrogen bond distance to the PLP phenolic oxygen, and may influence the pKa of the Schiff base during radical rearrangement. To evaluate the role of His225 in radical stabilization and catalysis, the residue was substituted with a glutamine and alanine. The H225Q and H225A variants have a 3- and 10-fold reduction in catalytic turnover, respectively, and a decrease in catalytic efficiency (7-fold for both mutants). Diminished catalytic performance is not linked to an increase in radical-based side reactions leading to enzyme inactivation. pH-dependence studies show that kcat increases with the ionization of a functional group, but it is not attributed to His225. Binding of 2,4-diaminobutyric acid to native OAM leads to formation of an overstabilized 2,4-diaminobutyryl\u2013PLP derived radical. In the H225A and the H225Q mutants, the radical forms and then decays, as evidenced by accumulation of cob(III)alamin. From these data, we propose that His225 enhances radical stability by acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor to the phenolic oxygen, which favors the deprotonated state of the imino nitrogen and leads to greater resonance stabilization of the 2,4-diaminobutyryl\u2013PLP radical intermediate. The potential role of His225 in lowering the activation energy barrier to mediate PLP-dependent radical rearrangement is discussed.",

The reactions were monitored by NMR spectroscopy. In all reactions studied, the covalent adduct was the first new species detected and its decomposition to form products could be observed. Concentrations of adducts were sufficiently high at steady-state that their structures could be determined directly from NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures; adduct structures are those expected from an Ene reaction between 7 and the substrate. This first reaction step results in transfer of the C4 hydrogen nucleus of 7 to the substrate and formation of a covalent bond between C2 of the dihydropyridine ring and the substrate \u03b1-atom. Discovery of these Ene-adduct intermediates completes the spectrum of mechanisms observed in NADH model reactions to span those with free radical intermediates, no detectable intermediates and now covalent intermediates. The geometry of the transition state for formation of the Ene adduct is compared with those of theoretical transition state models and crystal structures of enzyme\u2013substrate/inhibitor complexes to suggest a relative orientation for the dihydropyridine ring and the substrate in an initial cyclic transition state that is flexible enough to accommodate all observed mechanistic outcomes.",

Its enzymatic activity increases dramatically above 60\u00a0\u00b0C, with optimum activity at 95\u00a0\u00b0C. Its pH optimum at 60\u00a0\u00b0C is 5.7.

     "abstract": "It was recently reported that a series of C5-substituted phthalimides are remarkably potent reversible inhibitors of recombinant human monoamine oxidase (MAO) B. Modeling studies suggested that the phthalimide ring forms numerous polar interactions with the polar region of the MAO-B substrate cavity while the C5 side chain extends to, and interacts via Van der Waals interactions with the hydrophobic regions of the enzyme entrance cavity. Interactions with both cavities appear to be requirements for high affinity binding. In the present study we have examined an analogs series of C4-substituted phthalonitriles as potential human MAO inhibitors. The phthalonitriles were found to be highly potent reversible MAO-B inhibitors with most analogs exhibiting IC50 values in the low nM range. The phthalonitriles also interacted with human MAO-A, although with lower binding affinities compared to MAO-B. Modeling studies suggest that the high binding affinities of the phthalonitriles to MAO-B may depend, at least in part, on the formation of polar interactions between the nitrile functional groups and the enzyme substrate cavity. Examination of a homologs series of benzonitriles established that the phthalonitrile moiety is more optimal for MAO-B inhibition than the corresponding benzonitrile moiety, and that C3-substituted benzonitriles are better MAO-B inhibitors than C4-substituted benzonitriles. Since elimination of the nitrile functional group yielded compounds with only moderate MAO-B inhibition potencies, it may be concluded that this functional group is privileged for MAO-B inhibition.",

To better understand protein kinases, the molecular underpinnings of phosphoryl group transfer, protein phosphorylation, and inhibitor interactions are examined. This analysis begins with a survey of phosphate group and phosphoprotein properties which provide context to the evolutionary selection of phosphorylation as a central mechanism for biological regulation of most cellular processes. Next, the kinetic and catalytic mechanisms of protein kinases are examined with respect to model aqueous systems to define the elements of catalysis. A brief structural biology overview further delves into the molecular basis of catalysis and regulation of catalytic activity. Concomitant with a prominent role in normal physiology, protein kinases have important roles in the disease state. To facilitate effective kinase drug discovery, classic and emerging approaches for characterizing kinase inhibitors are evaluated including biochemical assay design, inhibitor mechanism of action analysis, and proper kinetic treatment of irreversible inhibitors. As the resulting protein kinase inhibitors can modulate intended and unintended targets, profiling methods are discussed which can illuminate a more complete range of an inhibitor\u2019s biological activities to enable more meaningful cellular studies and more effective clinical studies. Taken as a whole, a wealth of protein kinase biochemistry knowledge is available, yet it is clear that a substantial extent of our understanding in this field remains to be discovered which should yield many new opportunities for therapeutic intervention.",

     "abstract": "The spontaneous hydrolysis of glycosylamines, where the aglycone is either a primary amine or ammonia, is over a hundred million-times faster than that of O- or S-glycosides. The reason for this (as pointed out by Capon and Connett in 1965) is that, in contrast to the mechanism for O- or S-glycoside hydrolysis, hydrolysis of these N-glycosides (e.g., glc-NHR) involves an endocyclic C\u2013O bond cleavage resulting in formation of an imine (iminium ion) which then reacts with water. Since ring-opening is kinetically favored with glycosylamines, compounds such as phenylglucosylamine can be a useful probes of enzymes that have been suggested to possibly follow this mechanism. With \u03b2-glucosidase from sweet almonds, the enzyme is highly efficient in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phenyl glucoside (kcat/knon\u00a0\u223c\u00a01014) and phenyl thioglucoside (kcat/knon\u00a0\u223c\u00a01010) while with either the almond or the Aspergillus niger enzyme or with yeast \u03b1-glucosidase, there is no detectable catalysis of phenylglucosylamine hydrolysis (kcat/knon\u00a0<\u00a020).

     "abstract": "Galactokinase catalyses the phosphorylation of galactose at the expense of ATP. Like other members of the GHMP family of kinases it is postulated to function through an active site base mechanism in which Asp-186 abstracts a proton from galactose. This asparate residue was altered to alanine and to asparagine by site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding gene. This resulted in variant enzyme with no detectable galactokinase activity. Alteration of Arg-37, which lies adjacent to Asp-186 and is postulated to assist the catalytic base, to lysine resulted in an active enzyme. However, alteration of this residue to glutamate abolished activity. All the variant enzymes, except the arginine to lysine substitution, were structurally unstable (as judged by native gel electrophoresis in the presence of urea) compared to the wild type. This suggests that the lack of activity results from this structural instability, in addition to any direct effects on the catalytic mechanism. Computational estimations of the pKa values of the arginine and aspartate residues, suggest that Arg-37 remains protonated throughout the catalytic cycle whereas Asp-186 has an abnormally high pKa value (7.18). Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations suggest that Asp-186 moves closer to the galactose molecule during catalysis. The experimental and theoretical studies presented here argue for a mechanism in which the C1\u2013OH bond in the sugar is weakened by the presence of Asp-186 thus facilitating nucleophilic attack by the oxygen atom on the \u03b3-phosphorus of ATP.",

     "abstract": "The isomeric mixture of cis- and trans-1,3-dichloropropene constitutes the active component of a widely used nematocide known as Telone II\u00ae. The mixture is processed by various soil bacteria to acetaldehyde through the 1,3-dichloropropene catabolic pathway. The pathway relies on an isomer-specific hydrolytic dehalogenation reaction catalyzed by cis- or trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase, known respectively as cis-CaaD and CaaD. Previous sequence analysis and crystallographic studies of the native and covalently modified enzymes identified Pro-1, His-28, Arg-70, Arg-73, Tyr-103, and Glu-114 as key binding and catalytic residues in cis-CaaD. Mutagenesis of these residues confirmed their importance to the dehalogenation reaction. Crystal structures of the native enzyme (2.01\u00a0\u00c5 resolution) and the enzyme covalently modified at the Pro-1 nitrogen by 2-hydroxypropanoate (1.65\u00a0\u00c5 resolution) are reported here. Both structures are at a resolution higher than previously reported (2.75\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, respectively). The conformation of the covalent adduct is strikingly different from that previously reported due to its interaction with a 7-residue loop (Thr-32 to Leu-38). The participation of another active site residue, Arg-117, in catalysis and inactivation was also examined. The implications of the combined findings for the mechanisms of catalysis and inactivation are discussed.",

One of the possible explanations of this phenomenon is direct non-covalent interaction between CAF and aromatic mutagen/carcinogen molecules through stacking (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0) complexes formation. Here we demonstrate that CAF and other MTX, pentoxifylline (PTX) and theophylline (TH), form stacking complexes with carcinogenic imidazoquinoline-type (IQ-type) food-borne heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAs). We estimated neighborhood association constants (KAC of the order of magnitude of 102\u00a0M\u22121) in neutral and acidic environment and enthalpy changes (\u0394H values between \u221215.1 and \u221239.8\u00a0kJ/mol) for these interactions using UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy, calculations based on thermodynamical model of mixed aggregation and titration microcalorimetry.

A tertiary, T-state, neamine species populated at \u223c3% was also detected by NMR at pD 7.4. The pKa values determined by NMR titration experiments are pKa1 6.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 for N3 of ring-II, pKa2 7.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 for N2\u2032 of ring-I, pKa3 7.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 for N1 of ring-II, and pKa4 8.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15 for N6\u2032 of ring-I.

Radioactive acetylation assays were carried out to further evaluate the virtual screen hits. Several compounds with new structural scaffolds were identified with micromolar inhibition potency for Tip60 from the biochemical studies.

Ligand internuclear distances were derived from 2D NOESY data and applied to molecular modelling calculations as conformational restraints. NMR experiments on micelles evidenced that the ligands closely approached the micelles but gave no hints on the preferential conformations of the interacting ligands. Results from NMR experiments in the presence of liposomes clearly indicated that both ligands strongly interacted with the bilayer assuming a preferential folded conformation with the quinoline arms superimposing on each other.

     "abstract": "The tautomerase superfamily consists of structurally homologous proteins that are characterized by a \u03b2-\u03b1-\u03b2 fold and a catalytic amino-terminal proline. 4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) family members have been identified and categorized into five subfamilies on the basis of multiple sequence alignments and the conservation of key catalytic and structural residues. Representative members from two subfamilies have been cloned, expressed, purified, and subjected to kinetic and structural characterization. The crystal structure of DmpI from Helicobacter pylori (HpDmpI), a 4-OT homolog in subfamily 3, has been determined to high resolution (1.8\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.1\u00a0\u00c5) in two different space groups. HpDmpI is a homohexamer with an active site cavity that includes Pro-1, but lacks the equivalent of Arg-11 and Arg-39 found in 4-OT. Instead, the side chain of Lys-36 replaces that of Arg-11 in a manner similar to that observed in the trimeric macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which is the title protein of another family in the superfamily. The electrostatic surface of the active site is also quite different and suggests that HpDmpI might prefer small, monoacid substrates. A kinetic analysis of the enzyme is consistent with the structural analysis, but a biological role for the enzyme remains elusive. The crystal structure of DmpI from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfDmpI), a 4-OT homolog in subfamily-4, has been determined to 2.4\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. AfDmpI is also a homohexamer, with a proposed active site cavity that includes Pro-1, but lacks any other residues that are readily identified as catalytic ones related to 4-OT activity. Indeed, the electrostatic potential of the active site differs significantly in that it is mostly neutral, in contrast to the usual electropositive features found in other 4-OT family members, suggesting that AfDmpI might accommodate hydrophobic substrates. A kinetic analysis has been carried out, but does not provide any clues about the type of reaction the enzyme might catalyze.",

In this paper, we prepared the complex consisting of schizophyllan (SPG) and ASOs attached a dA40 tail with different PS contents to the 3\u2032 end of the ODN, which is introduced to stabilize the complex with SPG. With increase of PS content in the dA40, its complexation ability with SPG was improved and the complex showed high thermal stability. The thermal stability of the fully phosphorothioated ASOs was obtained by only replacing 20% of the oxygen of the phosphodiester moiety. The ability of gene suppression between PS and phosphodiester for antisense sequences was almost the same, indicating that the antisense sequences need not to be PS backbone.

The desired thiolpyridine protected analogs 7a-c,f,g were obtained by the sequence of deacetylation of 5a-c followed by thiopyridinylation and/or condensation of the corresponding heterocyclic bases with the newly synthesized peracetylated 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) sugar precursor 13, which was obtained via a novel synthetic route from glycosyl donor 12. None of the compounds 6 and 7 showed antiviral activity, but the 5-fluorouracil derivative 7c and particularly the uracil derivative 7b were endowed with an interesting and selective cytostatic action against a variety of murine and human tumor cell cultures.",

The protonation of all amino groups of kanamycin A is exothermic, but the protonation enthalpy does not correlate with basicity as in a case of simple polyamines.

Plots of chemical shifts for each H and C atom of kanamycin A vs. pH were fitted to the theoretical equation relating them to pKa values of ionogenic groups and it was observed that changes in chemical shifts of all atoms in ring C were controlled by ionization of a single amino group with pKa 7.98, in ring B by ionization of two amino groups with pKa 6.61 and 8.54, but in ring A all atoms felt ionization of one group with pKa 9.19 and some atoms felt ionization of a second group with pKa 6.51, which therefore should belong to amino group at C3 in ring B positioned closer to the ring A while higher pKa 8.54 can be assigned to the group at C1.

Esters 1 and 3 significantly reduced thrombin-evoked platelet aggregation, which is likely mediated to the attenuation of thrombin-stimulated Ca2+ release and entry. The three compounds reduced the ability of platelets to accumulate Ca2+ in the intracellular stores, probably by enhancing the Ca2+ leakage rate and reduced store-operated Ca2+ entry in these cells.

     "abstract": "The flavoenzyme nitroalkane oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of primary and secondary nitroalkanes to the corresponding aldehydes and ketones plus nitrite. The structure of the enzyme shows that Ser171 forms a hydrogen bond to the flavin N5, suggesting that it plays a role in catalysis. Cys397 and Tyr398 were previously identified by chemical modification as potential active site residues. To more directly probe the roles of these residues, the S171A, S171V, S171T, C397S, and Y398F enzymes have been characterized with nitroethane as substrate. The C397S and Y398 enzymes were less stable than the wild-type enzyme, and the C397S enzyme routinely contained a substoichiometric amount of FAD. Analysis of the steady-state kinetic parameters for the mutant enzymes, including deuterium isotope effects, establishes that all of the mutations result in decreases in the rate constants for removal of the substrate proton by \u223c5-fold and decreases in the rate constant for product release of \u223c2-fold. Only the S171V and S171T mutations alter the rate constant for flavin oxidation. These results establish that these residues are not involved in catalysis, but rather are required for maintaining the protein structure.",

Phosphorylation of recombinant human, rat, mouse and Trichinella spiralis TSs proteins was compared, with the human enzyme being apparently a much better substrate than the others. Following hydrolysis and TLC, phosphoserine was detected in human and rat, and phosphotyrosine in T. spiralis, TS, used as substrates for CK2\u03b1. MALDI-TOF MS analysis led to identification of phosphorylated Ser124 in human TS, within a sequence LGFS124TREEGD, atypical for a CK2 substrate recognition site. The phosphorylation site is located in a region considered important for the catalytic mechanism or regulation of human TS, corresponding to the loop 107\u2013128.

It was found that juglone acted as a strong, time and concentration dependent inactivator of urease. On the contrary, lawsone showed an inconsiderable inhibition influence. The reactivation of juglone modified urease showed the participation of reversible and irreversible contribution in the inactivation. In the presence of an excess of DTT, urease inactivated by juglone regained 70% of its activity. The reversible inactivation was attributed to oxidation of the essential urease thiols by reactive oxygen species (ROS) realizing during reduction of juglone to seminaphthoquinone. Presence of hydrogen peroxide in the incubation system was proved by direct determination and by application of catalase. The irreversible contribution in the inhibition was assumed as an arylation of urease thiol groups by juglone. The insignificant urease inhibition by lawsone was concluded as an effect of a low hydrogen peroxide generation and lawsone resistance for reaction with protein thiols. It was found that lawsone well reacted with l-cysteine, poorly with glutathione and hardly with urease thiols. The observed sequence was arranged according the rule the more complex thiol the less susceptible for reaction with lawsone. On the other hand, juglone displayed an excellent reactivity towards both thiols and urease. Thus, this indicated a significance of a steric hindrance which appeared when the hydroxyl group changing position from 5 in juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) to 2 in lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone).",

Agmatine is an endogenous human cell signaling molecule that triggers the innate immune response in humans. Unlike H. pylori, humans do not encode an AgD; it is hypothesized that inhibition of this enzyme would increase the levels of agmatine, and thereby enhance the innate immune response. Taken together, these facts suggest that HpAgD is a potential drug target. Herein we describe the optimized expression, isolation, and purification of HpAgD (10\u201330\u00a0mg/L media). The initial kinetic characterization of this enzyme has also been performed. Additionally, the crystal structure of wild-type HpAgD has been determined at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. This structure provides a molecular basis for the preferential deimination of agmatine, and identifies Asp198 as a key residue responsible for agmatine recognition, which has been confirmed experimentally.

The (1R)-6\u03b2-hydroxycineole dehydrogenase exhibited a strict requirement for NAD(H), with no reaction observed in the presence of NADP(H).

     "abstract": "Phosphoryl-transfer reactions have long been of interest due to their importance in maintaining numerous cellular functions. A phosphoryl-transfer reaction results in two possible stereochemical outcomes: either retention or inversion of configuration at the transferred phosphorus atom. When the product is phosphate, isotopically-labeled [16O,\u00a017O,\u00a018O]-phosphate derivatives can be used to distinguish these outcomes; one oxygen must be replaced by sulfur or esterified to achieve isotopic chirality. Conventionally, stereochemical analysis of isotopically chiral phosphate has been based on 31P NMR spectroscopy and involves complex chemical or enzymatic transformations. An attractive alternative would be direct determination of the enantiomeric excess using chiroptical spectroscopy. (S)-Methyl-[16O,\u00a017O,\u00a018O]-phosphate (MePi\u2217), 7 and enantiomeric [16O,\u00a017O,\u00a018O]-thiophosphate (TPi\u2217), 10, were previously reported to exhibit weak electronic circular dichroism (ECD), although with 10 the result was considered to be uncertain. We have now re-examined the possibility that excesses of 7 and 10 enantiomers can be detected by ECD spectrometry, using both experimental and theoretical approaches. 7 and both the (R) and (S) enantiomers of 10 (10a,\u00a010b) were synthesized by the \u2018Oxford route\u2019 and characterized by 1H,\u00a031P and 17O NMR, and by MS analysis. Weak ECD could be found for 7, with suboptimal S/N. No significant ECD could be detected for the 10 enantiomers.Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations of the electronic excitation energies and rotational strengths of the same three enantiomers were carried out using the functional B3LYP and the basis set 6-311G\u2217\u2217. The isotopically-perturbed geometries were predicted using the anharmonic vibrational frequency calculational code in GAUSSIAN 03. In the case of 10, calculations were also carried out for the hexahydrated complex to investigate the influence of the aqueous solvent. The predicted excitation wavelengths are greater than the observed wavelengths, a not unusual result of TDDFT calculations. The predicted anisotropy ratios are 2.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 for 7, \u22125.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 for 10a/b, and 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 for 10a/b\u22c5(H2O)6. For 7 the predicted anisotropy ratio approximates that observed in this work, 4.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 at 208\u00a0nm. For 10a/b, the upper limits of the experimental anisotropy ratios (<5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 at 225\u00a0nm, pH 9; <5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 at 236\u00a0nm, pH 12) are comparable to the predicted magnitude of the value for 10a/b. The lower predicted value for 10a/b\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0(H2O)6 suggests that the aqueous environment affects the ECD significantly. Altogether, the TDDFT calculations together with a stereochemical analysis based on NMR and the MS data support the conclusion that the experimental ECD results for MePi\u2217 and TPi\u2217 may be reliable in order of magnitude.",

Here we show that Gpr co-purifies with a b-type heme cofactor. Gpr associates with heme in a 1:1 stoichiometry to form a complex that is characterized by a Kd value of 5.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0\u03bcM in the absence of NADPH and a Kd value of 11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM in the presence of saturating NADPH. The absorbance spectrum of reconstituted Gpr indicates that heme is bound in a hexacoordinate low-spin state under both oxidizing and reducing conditions. The physiological function of heme association with Gpr is unclear, as the l-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate reductase activity of Gpr does not require the presence of the cofactor. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that Gpr clusters with a family of putative monooxygenases in several organisms, suggesting that Gpr may act as a heme-dependent monooxygenase. The discovery that Gpr associates with heme is interesting because Gpr shares 35% amino acid identity with the mammalian voltage-gated K+ channel \u03b2-subunit, an NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase that endows certain voltage-gated K+ channels with hemoprotein-like, O2-sensing properties. To date the molecular origin of O2 sensing by voltage-gated K+ channels is unknown and the results presented herein suggest a role for heme in this process.",
