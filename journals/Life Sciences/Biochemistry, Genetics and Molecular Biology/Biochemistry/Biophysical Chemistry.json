     "abstract": "Trehalose ability to preserve water in biology has spawned research on this special disaccharide and its solutions. Trehalose unlike any other disaccharide, tend to mix with almost any amount of water. In water, Trehalose forms a hydrodynamic volume with bound waters (both coordination water and semicircular heterogeneities), capable of perturbing the very nature of normal bulk water. Switching of the two major conformational forms, defined by their helicities (i, i-H2O with lower helicity and ii, ii-H2O with higher helicity), were closely examined, using DFT/B3LYP- 6-311\u202f+\u202fG** level of theory, along with molecular dynamic (MD) calculations in aqueous media. Patterns in radial distribution functions (RDF) confirmed semicircular heterogeneities, including spines of water (rows of slow water molecules), in Trehalose hydration shell. Dynamics of Trehalose conformational switch and its coordination water are coupled to dynamics of these spines of water, which are themselves coupled to dynamics of the rest of Trehalose hydration shell waters. Like seamless cogwheels such energy cascade links the upstream slow dynamics of spines to the downstream collective bulk water dynamics. This lubricates Trehalose conformational switch through coordination water uptake, for which we proposed a mechanism here. We show how the coupling between Trehalose and bound waters in its hydrodynamic volume encompass both function and dynamic of the molecule and its hydration shell. Further simulations are needed to see how this ability is related to the evading and percolating nature of cryoprotectant water, also reported for the self-coordinating jelly behavior of biological water.",

Theoretical and experimental NMR relaxation methods were developed to study the dynamic properties of water molecules in the protein hydration shell. Water non-selective and selective relaxation rates, were shown to be sensitive to contributions from ordered solvent molecules at protein surface. The average rotational correlation time of water molecules in the protein hydration shell was determined for three protein systems of different size: ribonuclease A, human serum albumin and fibrinogen. The knowledge of these properties is an important step toward the determination of the size of the water ordering contributions originate in proteins systems.",

     "abstract": "Elastic compliance of DMPC liposomes with Hofmeister electrolytes: NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaNO3, KCl and MgCl2 studied using Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation has been correlated with changes in their lamellar spacing from SAXS. The study suggests that hydration water of the different ions has an effect on the overall packing of the lipid bilayer that results as either a dehydrated liposome or where water smears the surface of the liposomes. Ratio of hydrogen bonded carbonyl and phosphate of polar region of the liposomes from ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, suggests that the polar groups are less hydrated due to the displacement of water by the electrolytes compared to pure DMPC and ordered in the sequence for cations as: K+\u202f<\u202fNa+,Mg2+ and for anions as SO42\u2212\u202f<\u202fCO32\u2013\u202f<\u202fCl\u2212\u202f<\u202fNO3\u2212.

     "abstract": "New ideas and methods are being developed to generate highly designable small functional protein folds beyond the confines of natural structures, from secondary to quaternary level. Highly designable folds can have multiple sequence solutions, which are thermodynamically and kinetically stable. We have previously described how short syndiotactic helices can be exceptionally stable energetically, and how they can be used as a template for designing antibacterial agents. In this work, we have designed four syndiotactic, single turn, amphipathic; cationic 7-mer peptides which are the sequence and structural subset of earlier published 12-mer sequences. We examined the stability of the designed structures and its effects on the biological activity of such short peptide sequences. This was achieved by making objective comparisons between 12-mer and 7-mer sequences in terms of their antibacterial activity. Further, we investigated the mechanistic origins of clearly different bactericidal potency of single (7-mer) and double (12-mer) turn syndiotactic helices using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results suggest that conformationally constrained stable short double turn peptide scaffolds are highly designable, whereas single turn structures are more likely to be disordered. The stability of the designed peptide structure provides a platform for inclusion of multiple sequence variables and defined electrostatic fingerprints. Therefore, a stable peptide scaffold along with pre-defined electrostatic signatures can together be utilized for the design of novel antimicrobial peptides.",

We found that interfacial hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity greatly influence the heights and Young's modulus of individual proteins. Compared to on the hydrophilic mica surface, FVIII proteins appear bigger vertical sizes while similar lateral sizes on the HOPG surface. The water accessible surface area analysis indicate stronger apolar properties C1 and C2 domains than others, suggesting a preferred orientation through the strong hydrophobic interactions between HOPG and the hydrophobic residues interface of the protein domains.

A comprehensive understanding of the micellization and structure of the mixed micelles are crucial to design effective delivery systems for such substances. In this study, the evolution of the dietary mixed micelle formation under physiologically relevant concentrations and the dependence of structural properties on micelle size were investigated through coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. The MARTINI force field was used to model cholate and POPC as the representative bile salt and phospholipid, respectively. The micellization behavior was similar under both fasted and fed state concentrations. Total lipids concentration and the micelle size did not affect the internal structure of the micelles. All the micelles were slightly ellipsoidal in shape independent of their size. The extent of deviation from spherical geometry was found to depend on the micellar POPC/cholate ratio. We also found that the surface and core packing density of the micelles increased with micelle size. The former resulted in more perpendicular alignments of cholates with respect to the surface, while the latter resulted in an improved alignment of POPC tails with the radial direction and more uniform core density.",

To probe the consequences of these differences, we determined the influence of inositol hexakisphosphate (inositol-P6) on the DTNB affinities of avian and mammalian carbonmonoxyhemoglobins. Inositol-P6decreases by two orders of magnitude the DTNB affinity of guinea pig hemoglobin, which has His2\u03b2 and the R2 quaternary structure. It decreases, or has no effect on, the DTNB affinities of hemoglobins that have His2\u03b2 and whose structures lie along the R2 \u21cc R quaternary equilibrium. Finally, inositol-P6increases by one to two orders of magnitude the DTNB affinities of hemoglobins that lack His2\u03b2.

EFL1 function is driven by conformational changes. However, the nature of such conformational changes or the mechanism by which they are prompted are still largely unknown. In previous studies, it has been established that this GTPase interacts with its cofactor in solution in an inverted orientation with respect to the binding mode derived from 60S ribosome subunit cryo-EM data. To shed new light on this conundrum, we characterized calorimetrically the energetic basis describing the recognition of Efl1 to GT(D)P, Sdo1 and their intercommunication in solution. A structural-based analysis of the binding signatures indicates that Efl1 has a large structural flexibility. The mutual effects of Sdo1 and nucleotides on Efl1 modulate in a very specific and robust way the complex conformational landscape of Efl1, resembling the behavior observed with other GTPases and their cofactors.",

     "abstract": "Salts, when added to milk, profoundly influence casein aggregation. Even though this well-known phenomenon has been widely exploited, there are still many unanswered questions. How do salts affect casein aggregation? Does water contribute significantly to the aggregation change? The key to answering these questions comes from statistical thermodynamics, i.e. the principles of physics that can link macroscopic data to the collective behaviour of molecules. We present two theoretical approaches. A rigorous approach which demands far more measurements than reported hitherto; and an approximate, pragmatic approach. It bases on stoichiometric models (isodesmic model for aggregation equilibria and von Smoluchowski model for kinetics) that can yield information on protein-water and protein-salt interactions from \u2018real-life\u2019 experimental measurements on model systems available in a variety of formats.

     "abstract": "Volumetric characterization of proteins and their recognition events has been instrumental in providing information on the role of intra- and intermolecular interactions, including hydration, in stabilizing biomolecules. The credibility of molecular models and interpretation schemes used to rationalize experimental data are essential for the validity of microscopic insights derived from volumetric results. Current empirical schemes used to interpret volumetric data suffer from a lack of theoretical and computational substantiation. In this contribution, we take advantage age of recent MD simulations of proteins in solution coupled with Voronoi-Delaunay tessellation of simulated structures that have provided an exceptional level of structural detail on the nature of protein-water interfaces. We use these structural insights to re-evaluate empirical frameworks used for interpretation of volumetric data. An important issue in this respect is the actual dividing surface between water and protein atoms that is used in volumetric studies when the solute and solvent are treated as hard spheres enclosed within their respective van der Waals surfaces. In one development, using Voronoi tessellation of MD simulated protein-water systems the dividing surface has been defined as the points equidistant from the water and protein atoms. The interstitial void volume between the solute and the dividing surface corresponds to thermal volume envisaged by Scaled Particle Theory. In this communication, we explicitly account for the contributions of thermal volume to the partial molar volume, compressibility, and expansibility of proteins and re-examine and redefine the intrinsic and hydration volumetric contributions.

This study endeavoured the binding interactions of CMT with calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA) along with the structural alterations attained by the DNA duplex owing to CMT interactions through multi-spectroscopic, calorimetric and molecular docking studies. The UV\u2013visible absorbance and fluorescence quenching studies revealed the binding strength of CMT with ct-DNA, evident from the binding constants K1\u202f=\u202f3.79\u202f\u00d7\u202f103\u202fM\u22121 and Kq\u202f=\u202f2\u202f\u00d7\u202f103\u202fM\u22121. The time-resolved lifetime measurements inferred that the quenching was static due to the non-fluorescent ground state complex formation. The dye displacement study, temperature melting and viscosity measurements established a typical non-intercalative binding mode of CMT with ct-DNA.

     "abstract": "Intracellular calcium oscillations have been widely studied. It is assumed that information is conveyed in the frequency, amplitude and shape of these oscillations. In particular, calcium signalling in mammalian liver cells has repeatedly been reported to display frequency coding so that an increasing amount of stimulus is translated into an increasing frequency of the oscillations. However, recently, we have shown that calcium oscillations in fish liver cells rather exhibit amplitude coding with increasing stimuli being translated into increasing amplitudes. Practical consequences of this difference are unknown so far. Here we investigated advantages and disadvantages of frequency vs. amplitude coding, in particular in environments with substantially changing temperatures (e.g. 10\u201320 degrees). For this purpose, we use computational modelling and a new approach to generate a calcium model exactly displaying a specific frequency and/or amplitude. We conclude that despite the advantages in flexibility that frequencies might offer for the transmission of information in the cell, amplitude coding is obviously more robust with respect to changes in environmental temperatures. This potentially explains the observed differences between two classes of organisms, one operating at constant temperatures whereas the other is not.",

Mg2+ titration experiments by ensemble FRET show that both stacking conformations have similar Mg2+ requirements for folding. Strikingly, smFRET experiments reveal that a specific junction sequence can populate both conformers and that this junction undergoes continual interconversion between the two stacked conformers. These findings will support the development of folding principles for the rational design of functional DNA nanostructures.",

It has been suggested that hIAPP toxicity may be due to its accumulation in pancreatic islets, causing membrane disruption and cell permeabilization, however the molecular basis underlying its lipid association are still unclear. Here, we combine solid-state NMR, fluorescence and bright field microscopy to investigate hIAPP - lipid membrane interactions. Real-time microscopy highlights a time-dependent penetration of hIAPP oligomers toward the most buried layers of the lipid vesicles until the membrane disrupts. Deuterium NMR was conducted on liposomes at different hIAPP concentration to probe lipid internal order and thermotropism. The gel-to-fluid phase transition of the lipids is decreased by the presence of hIAPP, and site-specific analysis of the order parameter showed a significant increase of lipid order for the first eight positions of the acyl chain, suggesting a partial insertion of the peptide inside the bilayer. These results offer experimental insight into the membrane destabilization of hIAPP on model membrane vesicles.",

To characterise the requirements for band-pass activation further, we developed a minimal model, identifying antagonistic, calcium-dependent regulation with differently responsive regulators as essential for band-pass activation. Further, in optimisations cooperative binding proved to be an important feature for distinct frequency-decoding in models of high- and band-pass activation. A subsequent analysis of the optimised parameter sets revealed the most sensitive parameters along with additional preconditions for efficient decoding.Our analysis is not limited to NFAT, but potentially applies to any protein showing high- or band-pass activation.",

The novel bolalipids contain lateral alkyl chains of different length in 1- and 32-position of the long membrane-spanning C32 alkyl chain. We will show for the first time that these single-chain alkyl-branched bolalipids show a miscibility with bilayer-forming phospholipids\u2014by maintaining the vesicular aggregate structure\u2014due to the lateral alkyl substituents located next to the phosphocholine headgroup of the bolalipid. We are convinced that these alkyl side chains are able to fill the void volume, which is created when unmodified single-chain bolalipids are inserted in a transmembrane fashion into a phospholipid bilayer. Consequently, the miscibility of our alkyl-chained bolalipids with bilayer-forming phospholipids rose with increasing lengths of the lateral alkyl chain of the bolalipid. Finally, we were successful in preparing liposomes from various bolalipid/phospholipid mixtures, which were stable in size upon storage for at least 21\u202fdays. These mixed liposomes (bolasomes) could be used as oral drug delivery systems in the near future.",

     "abstract": "Nrf2 is a critical regulator of innate immune response and survival during sepsis, which is constitutively degraded through binding to the Keap1 adapter protein of E3 ubiquitin ligase. Two linear peptides DLG and ETG derived from, respectively, the low-affinity and high-affinity motifs of Nrf2 binding site exhibit self-binding affinity to Keap1 central hole (active pocket); they can be exploited as therapeutic self-inhibitory peptides to disrupt the Nrf2\u2013Keap1 interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation and binding energetics decomposition reveal that the two peptides possess large flexibility and intrinsic disorder in unbound free state, and thus would incur a considerable entropy penalty upon binding to Keap1. In order to improve Keap1\u2013peptide binding affinity (or free energy \u0394G), instead of traditionally increasing favorable enthalpy contribution (\u0394H) we herein describe a rational peptide cyclization strategy to minimize unfavorable entropy penalty (\u0394S) upon the binding of Nrf2-derived linear peptides to Keap1. Crystal structure analysis impart that the native active conformations of DLG and ETG peptides bound with Keap1 are folded into U-shape and hairpin configurations, respectively, and adopt their turning head to insert into the central hole of Keap1. Here, cyclization is designed by adding a disulfide bond across the two arms of DLG U-shape or ETG hairpin, which would not influence the direct intermolecular interaction between Keap1 and peptide as well as desolvation effect involved in the interaction, but can effectively constrain the conformational flexibility and disorder of the two peptides in free state, thus largely minimizing entropy penalty upon the binding. Both free energy calculation and binding affinity assay substantiate that the cyclization, as might be expected, can moderately or considerably enhance peptide binding potency to Keap1, with affinity (dissociation constant Kd) increase by 1.4\u20137.5-fold for designed cyclic peptides relative to their linear counterparts.",

To address Hofmeister effect on activity of chymotrypsin, two different substrates, N-benzoyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester and amide N-succinyl-L-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide, were used. Catalytic activity of chymotrypsin is dependent on salt concentration and position of anion in Hofmeister series. The enzyme activity for both substrates is only slightly affected by chaotropic anions and increases with kosmotropic nature of anions. While the trend of Hofmeister effect on chymotrypsin catalysis is similar for both substrates, the amplitude of the effect significantly differs. In the presence of 1\u202fM sulfate, catalytic efficiency increased by ~2-fold for the ester but ~20-fold for the amide substrate. Positive correlation between stability and activity of chymotrypsin indicates the interdependence of these enzyme properties and is in agreement with recently developed macromolecular rate theory suggesting an important role of protein dynamics in enzyme catalysis. Linear dependencies of catalytic properties of chymotrypsin with partitioning of anions at bulk water/air as well as at hydrocarbon surface strongly indicate that the modulated enzyme properties are results of direct interaction of anions with protein surface.",

Biologically active ClpA hexamers contain two nucleotide binding domains (NBD) per protomer, D1 and D2. Despite extensive study, complete understanding of how the twelve NBDs within a ClpA hexamer coordinate ATP binding and hydrolysis to polypeptide translocation is currently lacking. To examine nucleotide binding and coordination at D1 and D2, ClpA Walker B variants deficient in ATP hydrolysis at one or both NBDs have been employed in various studies. In the presence of ATP, it is widely assumed that ClpA Walker B variants are entirely hexameric. However, a thermodynamically rigorous examination of the self-assembly mechanism has not been obtained. Differences in the assembly due to the mutation can be misattributed to the active NBD, leading to potential misinterpretations of kinetic studies. Here we use sedimentation velocity studies to quantitatively examine the self-assembly mechanism of ClpA Walker B variants deficient in ATP hydrolysis at D1, D2, and both NBDs. We found that the Walker B mutations had clear, if modest, effects on the assembly. Most notably, the Walker B mutation stabilizes the population of a larger oligomer in the absence of nucleotide, that is not present for analogous concentrations of wild type ClpA. Our results indicate that Walker B mutants, widely used in studies of AAA+ family proteins, require additional characterization as the mutation affects not only ATP hydrolysis, but also the ligand linked assembly of these complexes. This linkage must be considered in investigations of unfolding or other ATP dependent functions.",

     "abstract": "A procedure is evolved to assess the maximum uncoupling activity of the classical unsubstituted phenolic uncouplers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OX PHOS) 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2,6-dinitrophenol. The uncoupler concentrations, C, required for maximum uncoupling efficacy are found to be a strong function of the pH, and a linear relationship of pC with pH is obtained between pH\u202f5 to pH\u202f9. The slopes of the uncoupler concentrations in the aqueous and lipid phases as a function of pH have been estimated. It is shown that the experimental results can be derived from first principles by an enzyme kinetic model for uncoupling that is based on the same equations as formulated for the coupling of ion transport to ATP synthesis in a companion paper after imposition of the special conditions arising from the uncoupling process. The results reveal the catalysis of a reaction that involves both the anionic and protonated forms of the phenolic uncouplers in the vicinity of their binding sites in a non-aqueous region of the cristae membranes of mitochondria. The rate-limiting step in the overall process of uncoupling has been identified based on the uncoupling data. The data cannot be explained by a simple conduction of protons by uncouplers from one bulk aqueous phase to another as postulated by Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory. It is shown that Nath's two-ion theory of energy coupling/uncoupling in ATP synthase is consistent with the results. A molecular mechanism for uncoupling of ATP synthesis by the dinitrophenols is presented and the chief differences between coupling and uncoupling in ATP catalysis are summarized. The pharmacological consequences of our analysis of uncoupling are discussed, with particular reference to the mode of action of the anti-tuberculosis drug bedaquiline that specifically targets the c-subunit of the F1FO-ATP synthase and uncouples respiration from ATP synthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Measurements of unloaded run length show that the transition from single- to multiple-motor behavior can be characterized by the appearance of extended runs, in accordance with a recently proposed model that quantifies the probability of multiple-motor engagement. In this transition, application of mechanical load using optical tweezers allows us to register maximum force values above single kinesin levels (8 pN). Yet, averages of run length and maximum force undergo little change as the probability of multiple-motor participation increases. In contrast, the measured rate of bead binding to microtubules scales linearly with the average number of motors per bead.

These include an order imposed on ion binding and unbinding events in FO, the essential role of the anion in direct activation of the ATP synthase (in addition to its role as a permeant ion), and the integration in a novel way of the functions of cooperativity and cotransport of dicarboxylic acid anions and protons during physiological ATP synthesis. Further, Wyman's pioneering classical work on the thermodynamics of linked functions has been shown to offer a new approach to distinguish between various models of energy coupling in ATP synthesis. All these results have been found to be inconsistent with Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory and are shown to be in agreement with Nath's torsional mechanism of energy transduction and ATP synthesis.",

However, the facets of innately disordered structure of tau and its conversion to a \u03b2-sheet-rich fibril during several tauopathies are poorly understood. Here, we provide a direct insight into the ensemble of highly heterogeneous conformational families of tau at physiological pH, by nano-electrospray mass spectrometry coupled with ion mobility. The average collision cross section of the most unfolded conformer was higher by >2 fold than that of the most folded one. Acidic pH largely induced unfolding in tau, obliterating the compact conformers completely. The highly unfolded conformers were the key species bestowing the unusual solubility to tau at low pH, with limited contribution from intramolecular long-range interfaces giving rise to ordered conformers. Contrarily, alkaline pH shifted tau towards folded conformations due to charge neutralization, keeping the overall random coil architecture intact. Intriguingly, the heparin-induced in vitro aggregation propensity of the protein attenuated at both acidic and alkaline pH, illustrating the significance of altered conformations in pathological functions of tau. Our observations at low pH indicate that a reorganization of the intricate network of momentary long-range contacts in tau might have implication in its aggregation pathology. Disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease targeting either to disrupt the essential fibril-forming interaction at third microtubule-binding repeat of tau or to perturb specific binding interaction of tau with endogenous polyanionic species might be of high benefit.",

The mechanical and structural properties of these structures are governed by factors such as protein concentration, temperature, pH and ionic strength. This study reports on an impedance based analysis of the elastic compliance of fibrillary assemblies of Type I collagen using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) at a fundamental frequency of 5\u202fMHz and overtones (n\u202f=\u202f3,5,7,9,11). Here, In situ partial fibrillation of the adsorbing collagen followed by its fibrillary assemblies on hydrophilic gold coated quartz surface have been crosslinked using Gallic acid (GA), Chromium (III) gallate (Cr-GA), Catechin (Cat), Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium sulfate (THPS) and Oxazolidine (Ox). This approach allows direct comparison of how viscoelastic properties track the structural evolution of the fiber and network length scales. The collagen crosslinking shows significant positive impact on the protein's mechanical behaviour and on the type of crosslinking agents used. The elastic modulus increases as collagen\u202f<GA\u202f<\u202fTHPS\u202f<\u202fCr-GA\u202f<\u202fCat\u202f<\u202fOx.

The elastic compliance evaluated from \u0394Dissipation/\u0394freq. from QCM-D showed that cross linking with GA, Cr-GA and Ox resulted in flexible fibrillary network while agents like THPS and Cat showed elastic moduli similar to that of pure collagen.

In the present study, we characterize the behavior of MorR, an RR associated with Mo homeostasis, upon acetylphosphate and phosphoramidate treatment in vitro. Our results show that MorR was phosphorylated by both phospho-donors. Fluorescence experiments showed that MorR tryptophan emission is quenched by phosphoramidate.

In spite of their role in GPCR function, the extramembranous regions of GPCRs are relatively less appreciated. The third intracellular loop (ICL3), which connects transmembrane helices V and VI, is important in this context since its crucial role in signaling has been documented for a number of GPCRs. Unfortunately, the structure of this loop is generally not visualized in x-ray crystallographic studies since this flexible loop is either stabilized using a monoclonal antibody or replaced with lysozyme. In this work, we expressed and purified the ICL3 region of the serotonin1A receptor and monitored its motional restriction and organization utilizing red edge excitation shift (REES) of its sole tryptophan and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Our results show that the tryptophan in ICL3 exhibits REES of 4\u202fnm, implying that it is localized in a restricted microenvironment. These results are further supported by wavelength-selective changes in fluorescence anisotropy and lifetime. This constrained dynamics was relaxed upon denaturation of the peptide, thereby suggesting the involvement of the peptide secondary structure in the observed motional restriction, as evident from CD spectroscopy and apparent rotational correlation time. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute one of the first measurements of motional constraint in the ICL3 region of GPCRs. Our results are relevant in the context of the reported intrinsically disordered nature of ICL3 and its role in providing functional diversity to GPCRs due to conformational plasticity.",

BMPRIA and BMPRIB generally shows temporal and spatial co-expression but some spatially different expression pattern has also been observed. BMPRIA receptor is the key receptor implicated in BMP signalling during osteogenesis and is expressed in osteoblasts during the course of bone formation. However, BMPRIB appears to be primarily expressed in mesenchymal pre-cartilage condensations and also found in differentiated osteoblast and chondrocytes. The extracellular pH affects bone cell function and it is experimentally known that mineralization of bone is affected by shift of pH in cultured osteoblast. Here we report the effect of pH on dynamics of water present at the interface of GDF-5:BMPRIA and GDF-5:BMPRIB and binding interaction energy of these complexes. Water dynamics at different pH was analysed using residence time and hydrogen bond relaxation kinetics. pH influences the interaction energy between GDF-5 and BMPRIA and BMPRIB receptors indicating the electrostatic environment modulating the activity of two receptors. This pH dependence of interaction energy is further supported by similar behaviour of hydrogen bond existence of buried water molecules at the interface. In contrast to this the slow and fast exchanging water molecules do not show similar pH dependence of hydrogen bonding relaxation kinetics. Hence; we conclude that only buried water molecule at the interface influences the protein-protein interaction and the electrostatic environment of the extracellular fluid might decide the specificity of the two receptors.",

The spectrophotometric and fluorometric studies together with fluorescence quenching, fluorescence anisotropy, urea induced denaturation studies and fluorescence lifetime measurements reveal strong binding of DSDP with both the plasma proteins.

A newer approach has been developed to have an estimate of the binding constants varying the concentration of the protein, instead of the usual practice of varying the probe. The binding constants for the 2:1 DSDP-protein complexes are determined to be 1.37\u202f\u00d7\u202f1010\u202fM\u22122 and 1.47\u202f\u00d7\u202f1010\u202fM\u22122 for HSA and BSA respectively, while those for the 1:1 complexation process come out to be 1.85\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202fM\u22121 and 1.73\u202f\u00d7\u202f105\u202fM\u22121 for DSDP-HSA and DSDP-BSA systems respectively.

Its hydrolysis requires the cleavage of C-O-C linkage and its mechanism is hitherto unknown.We report three mechanisms of hydrolysis of \u03b4-6-phosphogluconolactone based on density functional computations. In the energetically most favorable mechanism, two water molecules participate in the hydrolysis reaction and the mechanism is sequential, i.e., activation of the attacking water molecule (OH bond breaking) precedes that of the cleavage of the CO bond of the C-O-C linkage. The rate-limiting energy barrier of this mechanism is comparable to the reported experimental free energy barrier. This mechanism has similarities with the mechanism of triphosphate hydrolysis and that of hydrolytic cleavage of DNA in EcoRV enzyme.

In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of human WNTs and Klotho in the pancreatic cancer. In the cancerous cells, WNT-1 exhibited much higher expression as compared to other WNTs, while no WNT expression was detected in the normal tissue. In contrast, Klotho expression was significantly low in the cancerous tissue. Based on these observations, we intended to explore Klotho binding to WNT-1 and cystein-rich domains (CRDs) of Frizzled (FZD) homologs through molecular docking and dynamics simulation assays. Interestingly, similar region of WNT-1 was detected in binding with Klotho and CRDs of FZD-1/2. FZD-CRDs were grasped by the association of peripheral hydrophobic residues of WNT-1\u202fU-shaped cavity. Subsequently, WNT-1-bound Klotho-peptides were isolated and reevaluated for their binding abilities against WNT-1 and FZD-CRDs., The conformational readjustements of these complexes were deeply analyzed by calculating the size of WNT-1\u202fU-shaped cavity.

Dacarbazine is the drug of choice for the treatment of melanoma in Brazil through the public health system mainly because of its low cost. However, it is an alkylating agent of low specificity and elicits a therapeutic response in only 20% of cases. Other drugs available for the treatment of melanoma are expensive, and tumor cells commonly develop resistance to these drugs. The fight against melanoma demands novel, more specific drugs that are effective in killing drug-resistant tumor cells. Dibenzoylmethane (1,3-diphenylpropane-1,3-dione) derivatives are promising antitumor agents. In this study, we investigated the cytotoxic effect of 1,3-diphenyl-2-benzyl-1,3-propanedione (DPBP) on B16F10 melanoma cells as well as its direct interaction with the DNA molecule using optical tweezers. DPBP showed promising results against tumor cells and had a selectivity index of 41.94. Also, we demonstrated the ability of DPBP to interact directly with the DNA molecule. The fact that DPBP can interact with DNA in vitro allows us to hypothesize that such an interaction may also occur in vivo and, therefore, that DPBP may be an alternative to treat patients with drug-resistant melanomas. These findings can guide the development of new and more effective drugs.",

     "abstract": "Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer and its neutral inverse-phosphocholine equivalent (DPCPe) were performed to find salt-induced effects on their surface structure and the nature of ion-lipid interactions. We found that the area per lipid is not considerably affected by the inversion, but the deuterium order parameter of carbon atoms in the region of carbonyl carbons changes dramatically. MD simulations indicate that Ca2+ ions can bind to the surface of both DPPC and DPCPe membranes, but K+ ions do not bind to them. In the case of Na+, however, the ions can bind to natural lipids but not to the inverse ones. Also, our results demonstrate that the hydration level of CPe bilayers is substantially lower than PC bilayers and the averaged orientation of water dipoles in the region of CPe headgroups is effectively inverted compared to PC lipids. This might be important in the interaction of the bilayer with its biological environment. Furthermore, it was found for the CPe bilayers that the enhanced peaks of the electrostatic potential profiles shift further away from the bilayer center relative to those of PC bilayers. This behavior makes the penetration of cations into the bilayer more difficult and possibly explains the experimentally observed enhanced release rates of anionic compounds in the CPe membrane.",

When samples of the two labeled protein-preparations are combined, the sensitized emission from AF647 serves as a sensitive probe of dimer formation. At 25\u202f\u00b0C, in the absence of divalent ions, the wild-type homodimer, \u0394GF122 homodimer, and heterodimer display dissociation constants of 7.1, 26, and 4.5\u202fnM, respectively. At 35\u202f\u00b0C, subunit interaction is weaker, indicating that dimer formation is exothermic. Binding of Mg2+ in the C-terminal EF-hand (EF5) dramatically enhances ALG-2 dimer stability. Although occupation of EF5 by Ca2+ likewise has a stabilizing effect, its direct influence on dimer stability would be negligible at cytosolic Ca2+ levels. However, dimer stability is substantially increased by the Ca2+-dependent binding of ALG-2 target-peptides, suggesting that the occupation-status of the target-protein binding site is communicated to the dimer interface. Tween 20 is commonly used to improve ALG-2 solubility, the micelles ostensibly acting as target-protein surrogates. Paradoxically, however, the detergent markedly destabilizes ALG-2 dimers, particularly in the presence of Ca2+.",

     "abstract": "DNA duplexes are stabilized by many interactions, one of which is stacking interactions between the nucleic acid bases. These interactions are useful for designing small molecules that bind to DNA. Naphthalimide intercalators have been shown to be valuable anti-cancer agents that stack between the DNA bases and exhibit stabilizing effects. There is a continued need to design intercalators that will exhibit these stabilizing effects while being more selective toward DNA binding. This work investigates 4-substituted naphthalimides with varying functional groups and their interactions with nucleic acid duplexes. Mode of binding was determined via wavelength scans, circular dichroism, and viscosity measurements. Optical melting experiments were used to measure the absorbance of the sample as a function of temperature. The Tm values derived from the DNA duplexes were subtracted from the Tm values derived from the DNA-intercalator complexes, resulting in \u0394Tm values. The \u0394Tm values demonstrated that the substituents on the intercalator affect the stability of the DNA-intercalator complex. From the results of this study and comparison to results from previous work, we conclude that the substituent type and position on the core intercalator molecule affect the stability of the complex it forms with DNA.",

It is shown that for rotating dipole, \u03ba2 is significantly higher as compared to linear dipole independently of the orientation distribution of the donor and acceptor and whether the static or the dynamic rotational regimes are used for averaging \u03ba2. By this property of \u03ba2, FRET serves as an example for a phenomenon where local field interference may take place in a \u201cnatural\u201d way for emitters possessing rotating dipoles in their excited states by nature. The overlapping spatial distributions for the helicity of donor local field, torque exerted on the acceptor by the donor and for the FRET orientational factor suggest that transfer of both energy and helicity take place predominantly in the plane of rotation by keeping the original direction of helicity, i.e. in accordance with the conservation law for helicity.Orienting FRET has been proposed by engineering local field structure by using elliptically polarized light for donor excitation or by using linearly polarized light coupled with electromagnetic modification of the donor environment. The phenomenon of increased \u03ba2 can be exploited for checking helicity conservation for different FRET donors without the need for polarized detection optics. Modulation of FRET with changing ellipticity of the excited donor state might supply structural and dynamical information on the orientational distribution of dye-holding matrices even on the surface of living cells, e.g. on the level of cell surface receptor clusters. Furthermore, it might also be exploited in sensing local electromagnetic fields. Rotating excited donor states might also facilitate turning on photoswitchable acceptors.",

The approach consists of an analysis of electrophoretic migration of DNA from nucleoids obtained after cell lysis in a thin layer of agarose. Although the method is widely used the physical mechanisms of DNA track formation remained to be rather elusive for a long time. This review is devoted to our recent results pertaining to this subject, using an original approach based on the kinetic measurements of the comet formation. We argue that linear DNA fragments give an essential contribution into the tail formation in the alkaline conditions and, at neutral pH, when the level of DNA damages is very high. On the other hand, in the neutral comet assay at low levels of DNA damages (and also in the case of undamaged cells) the tail is formed by extended DNA loops. These loops are about the same as chromatin loops in the cell nuclei. Kinetic measurements in the comet assay give an opportunity to investigate the topology of the loops and large-scale features of the loop domain organization (and re-organization) in nucleoids obtained from different cell types.",

Cardiolipin is found in Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) membranes, where increased levels of this lipid are induced at the expense of diacyl phosphatidylglycerol in response to stress. We investigate cardiolipin as an inhibitor of the lytic activity of the cationic antimicrobial peptides LL-37 and \u2206M2 in model systems with varying phosphatidylglycerol/cardiolipin ratios. Using HPTLC, we show that S. aureus (RN4220), under different growth conditions, has a phosphatidylglycerol/cardiolipin ratio of 80:20. From this, we chose three model systems to evaluate (100:0, 80:20, 60:40). \u2206M2 presents higher binding affinity towards all mixtures compared to LL-37. This correlates with the higher antimicrobial activity of \u2206M2 compared to LL-37 in S. aureus (MIC90 of 14\u202f\u03bcM for \u2206M2 and 57.7\u202f\u03bcM for LL-37). Laurdan GP shows that Cardiolipin decreases lipid headgroup spacing. We find that cardiolipin does not affect \u2206M2 or LL-37 binding to phosphatidylglycerol/cardiolipin liposomes. Instead, cardiolipin inhibits the ability of both peptides to induce calcein leakage in model liposomes. In conclusion, cardiolipin can reduce cAMP activity by inhibiting lysis but not binding.",

Surface pressure-area isotherms showed the condensation of glycoside-free lipid monolayers, suggesting their adsorption on the nanoparticle surface through the hydrophilic head groups. On the other hand, monolayers containing glycoside derivatives expanded upon AuNPs incorporation, pointing that the supramolecular structure formed should facilitate the incorporation of these nanoparticles in cellular membranes.

However, the reliance on gene expression correlations rather than mechanistic insight has shown limited potential and suggests a critical need for molecular network models that better predict neuroblastoma progression. In this study, we construct and simulate a molecular network of developmental genes and downstream signals in a 6-gene input logic model that predicts a favorable/unfavorable outcome based on the outcome of the four cell states including cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. We simulate the mis-expression of the tyrosine receptor kinases, trkA and trkB, two prognostic indicators of neuroblastoma, and find differences in the number and probability distribution of steady state outcomes. We validate the mechanistic model assumptions using RNAseq of the SHSY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line to define the input states and confirm the predicted outcome with antibody staining. Lastly, we apply input gene signatures from 77 published human patient samples and show that our model makes more accurate disease outcome predictions for early stage disease than any current neuroblastoma gene list. These findings highlight the predictive strength of a logic-based model based on developmental genes and offer a better understanding of the molecular network interactions during neuroblastoma disease progression.",

Our bolalipids contain a long C32 alkyl chain bound to glycerol in the sn-3 position and a short C16 in the sn-2 position, which further carries a racemic methyl branch. The sn-1 position of the glycerol as well as the end of the long C32 alkyl chain contain polar headgroups: either two phosphocholine headgroups (PC-Gly(2C16Me)C32-PC) or a phosphocholine and a phosphodimethylethanolamine headgroup (PC-Gly(2C16Me)C32-Me2PE). We demonstrate that glycerol diether bolalipids show better miscibility with unsaturated phosphatidylcholines than with saturated ones. Both bolalipids in mixture with the unsaturated 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) form liposomes, which are stable in size upon storage.

Dimerization or oligomerization of the protein at pH higher than about 4.1 leaves no apolar surface exposed for interaction with the dye 8-Anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate (ANS). The most stable monomeric state is found near pH\u202f4 where the structure of the protein is determined to have three short \u03b2-strands and a single \u03b1-helix. By surveying the pH-dependent propensity of fibrillation we find the protein enters the amyloidogenic state at pH\u202f2, 60\u202f\u00b0C. The reaction product is not amorphous aggregate, but simple amyloid fibrils with sparse or no branching. The mean diameters of the fibril population scaled from AFM images are 13.2 and 21.2\u202fnm for precursor aggregates (PA) and proto- or elongated fibrils, respectively. These values are somewhat larger than the fibril diameters generally cited, and the reason could be larger lateral association for both PA and protofibrils. The protein AtPP16-1 is strictly pH-selective in terms of its structure and stability, and the solution structure is known at pH\u202f4. Under the conditions of pH\u202f2 used here for fibrillation, the protein retains substantial secondary structure. Even if the pH and temperature conditions used for fibrillation are hardly physiological, there is a finite possibility that some aggregation of AtPP16-1 would occur in vivo, as the case of transglutaminase aggregates in the chloroplast of transplastomic plants, for example. The pH related problem has been discussed in detail, but the questions emanating are: do phloem proteins fibrillate in vivo, and if so what implication fibrillation has for plant physiology?",

By utilizing the amber force field for nucleic acids we built the i-motif and the WC duplex either with native cytosines or using their protonated forms. We studied, by applying molecular dynamics simulations, the role of hydrogen bonds between cytosines or in cytosine-guanine pairs in the stabilization of both structures in the physiological fluid. We found that hydrogen bonds exist in the case of protonated i-motif and in the standard form of the WC duplex. They, however, vanish in the case of the deprotonated i-motif and protonated form of the WC duplex. By determining potentials of mean force in the enforced unwrapping of these structures we found that the protonated i-motif is thermodynamically the most stable. Its deprotonation leads to spontaneous and observed directly in the unbiased calculations unfolding of the i-motif to the hairpin structure at normal temperature. The WC duplex is stable in its standard form and its slight destabilization is observed at the acidic pH. However, the protonated WC duplex unwraps very slowly at 310\u202fK and its decomposition was not observed in the unbiased calculations. At higher temperatures (ca. 400\u202fK or more) the WC duplex unwraps spontaneously.",

We previously developed a technique that allowed the simultaneous determination of the fluxes of these two ions across the channel by a combined use of patch-clamp and fluorescence. In this paper we studied how potassium and calcium fluxes were influenced by modification of cytosolic concentrations of K+ and Ca2+. A decrease in cytosolic calcium from 2 to 0.5\u202fmM led to a shift of the activation curve of about +60\u202fmV; although at positive potentials currents were very similar, calcium ion permeation was significantly reduced and the ratio between the total and calcium-mediated current increased about two-fold. Upon removal of cytosolic potassium, in the presence of 2\u202fmM cytosolic calcium, the voltage-dependent activation curve was not modified but a dramatic reduction of the currents at positive voltages was apparent. However, calcium permeation did not change significantly in this condition. This work demonstrated that the electrophysiological measurements alone were not capable to predict the extent of the flow of different ions through cation channels. The parallel use of calcium detection by fluorescent dyes proved to be a valuable tool for the correct quantification of the permeation mechanisms in non-selective ion channels.",

Hence it is important to use correct pKa values in DNA interaction studies. This study takes a look at the importance of pKa values to realize binding of compounds with DNA. Since pKa of a compound determined in the presence of DNA is quite different from that determined in its absence hence, presence of different forms of a compound during interaction with DNA is different from that realized if the determination of pKa is done in normal aqueous solution in absence of DNA. Hence, calculations determining contributions of different forms of a compound interacting with DNA are affected accordingly. Two simple analogues of anthracyclines, alizarin and purpurin, were used to investigate the influence DNA has on pKa values. Indeed, they were different in presence of DNA than when determined in normal aqueous solution. pKa1 for alizarin and purpurin determined in the absence and presence of calf thymus DNA were used in equations that determine contributions of two forms (neutral and anionic) towards overall binding with DNA. The study concludes that correct pKa values, determined correctly i.e. under appropriate conditions, must be used for DNA binding experiments to evaluate contributions of individual forms.",

     "abstract": "The conjugation of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) to an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is an attractive strategy for the modification of biophysical and biodistribution properties of the API. Indeed, several therapeutic proteins conjugated to PEG have been safely administered in the clinic. While there have been studies on the configuration of these conjugates in solution, investigations on the impact of PEG geometry on protein-PEG conjugate interactions is limited. In this study, we use dynamic light scattering (DLS), rheology, and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to investigate the biophysical solution and interaction behavior of a 50\u00a0kDa Fab protein attached to either a linear or tetrameric (branched) 40\u00a0kDa PEG molecule. The hydrodynamic radii, diffusivity, viscosity and pair distance distribution function (PDDF) were obtained for the protein-PEG conjugates in solution. An analysis revealed that interactions between unconjugated proteins were quite attractive, however linear PEG-protein conjugates exhibited net repulsive interactions, similar to that of the unconjugated polymer. Tetramer PEG-protein conjugates on the other hand, exhibited a net weak attractive interaction, indicating a more balanced distribution of repulsive and attractive interaction states. Further analysis of the SANS data using geometric models consistent with the PDDF elucidated the conjugates' equilibrium configuration in solution. Insights gained from measurements and analysis used here can also be useful in predicting how conjugate geometries affect viscosity and aggregation behavior, which are important in determining suitable protein-polymer drug formulations.",

However, because of their heterogeneous membrane distribution, accurate experimental determination of the probe position is difficult. To estimate the location of the ESIPT probes in lipid membranes we have performed fluorescence measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In the series composed of 2-(2\u2032-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3-oxazole (1), 2-(2\u2032-hydroxy-phenyl)-5-(4\u2032-biphenyl)-1,3-oxazole (2), and 2-(2\u2032-hydroxy-phenyl)-phenanthro[9,10-d]-1,3-oxazole (3), the structure of the ESIPT-moiety of 2-(2\u2032-hydroxy-phenyl)-oxazole was varied by either aromatic ring substitution or annealing, leading to the systematical increase in the hydrophobic character of the probes. The comparison of the fluorescence behavior of probes 1\u20133 in a wide variety of solvents with those in phospholipid vesicles revealed that all three probes prefer to reside inside a membrane. Our MD results demonstrate that the probes locate from the glycerol residues and the polar carbonyl groups of phospholipids up to hydrophobic acyl chain units. It has been found that the probe location correlates well with the size of the aromatic moiety, being gradually shifted from 11.1\u202f\u00c5 to 7.6\u202f\u00c5 from the bilayer center for probes 1 to 3, respectively.

     "abstract": "Kex2 is the prototype of a large family of eukaryotic subtilisin-related proprotein-processing proteases that cleave at sites containing pairs of basic residues. Here, we studied the effects of KCl on the individual rate constants of association, dissociation, acylation and deacylation and determined the thermodynamic parameters at each step of the Kex2 reaction. Potassium bound Kex2 with KD\u00a0=\u00a020.3\u00a0mM. The order in which potassium entered the reaction system modified the effect of activation or inhibition, which depended on the size of the substrate. A possible allosteric potassium binding site at the S6 subsite was involved in activation, and a distant site located between the catalytic domain and the P-domain was involved in inhibition. Potassium decreased the energetic barriers of almost all steps of catalysis. The acylation of Ac-PMYKR-AMC in the absence of potassium was the rate-limiting step. Therefore, for substrates containing a P1-Arg, the deacylation step is not necessarily the rate-limiting event, and other residues at the P\u2032 positions may participate in controlling the acylation and deacylation steps. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that potassium is involved in the processing of the \u03b1-mating factor that promotes Ca2\u00a0+ mobilization by activating a high-affinity Ca2\u00a0+-influx system to increase the cytosolic [Ca2\u00a0+], resulting in the activation of channels that are essential for the survival of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells.",

The conjugation significantly improved the peptide solubility and suppressed the self-assembly propensity. This led to 30% increase of the binding affinity of LK7 for A\u03b2 in the conjugate due to increased hydrophobic interactions. Thus, LK7-\u03b2CyD suppressed the conformational transition of A\u03b2 and showed stronger inhibitory effect on A\u03b2 fibrillation than LK7.

It proved the disparity of kinetic and quantitative parameters of FFN102-stained cells acquired either at cell top and bottom.

     "abstract": "Amyloid deposition, arising from the fibrillogenesis of proteins in organs and tissues of the body, causes several neurodegenerative disorders. One therapeutic approach is based on the use of polyphenols and their derivatives for suppressing and inhibiting the accumulation of these toxic fibrils in tissues. In the present study, the anti-amyloidogenic activities of bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), a natural polyphenolic compound, and diacetylbisdemethoxycurcumin (DABC), a synthetic derivative of curcumin, on the amyloid fibrillation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) is studied in depth using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, atomic force microscopy (AFM), circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), molecular docking and Ligplot calculations. The binding parameters such as binding constants and the number of substantive binding sites were obtained experimentally. It could be shown from docking simulation that four hydrogen bonds via the two phenolic OH groups of BDMC and two \u03b2-diketone moiety of BDMC are formed with the Asp-101, Trp-63, Asn-59 and Glu-35 of HEWL, whereas, two hydrogen bonds formed via two \u03b2-diketone moiety of DABC with Asn-39 and Trp-63 of HEWL. The short F\u04e7rster's distance (r) between donor and acceptor, the binding constant values and also the nature of interaction, demonstrate strong interaction between these two curcuminoids and lysozyme. According to amyloid fibrillation and binding results, the interaction of BDMC with HEWL is stronger than that of DABC and amyloid fibrillation of HEWL was inhibited more effectively by BDMC than DABC. It can be suggested that the more inhibitory activity of BDMC than DABC is correlated to the stronger interaction of BDMC with HEWL. These natural polyphenolic compounds are thus good candidates for inhibiting of amyloid formation. The inhibitory activities of BDMC and DABC can be used in drug formulation against the dangerous amyloid-related diseases and provide health promotion for organs and tissues of the body.",

These websites fall under a number of categories including: research laboratories, training grant and program projects, and online service portals. Invariably there is content on a site, such as publication listings, that require frequent updating. A number of content management systems exist to aid in the task of developing and managing a website, each with their strengths and weaknesses. One popular choice is Wordpress, a free, open source and actively developed application for the creation of web content. During a recent site redesign for our department, the need arose to ensure publications were up to date for each of the research labs and department as a whole. Several plugins for Wordpress offer this type of functionality, but in many cases the plugins are either no longer maintained, are missing features that would require the use of several, possibly incompatible, plugins or lack features for layout on a webpage. WPBMB Entrez was developed to address these needs. WPBMB Entrez utilizes a subset of NCBI Entrez and RCSB databases to maintain up to date records of publications, and publication related information on Wordpress-based websites. The core functionality uses the same search query syntax as on the NCBI Entrez site, including advanced query syntaxes. The plugin is extensible allowing for rapid development and addition of new data sources as the need arises. WPBMB Entrez was designed to be easy to use, yet flexible enough to address more complex usage scenarios. Features of the plugin include: an easy to use interface, design customization, multiple templates for displaying publication results, a caching mechanism to reduce page load times, supports multiple distinct queries and retrieval modes, and the ability to aggregate multiple queries into unified lists. Additionally, developer documentation is provided to aid in customization of the plugin. WPBMB Entrez is available at no cost, is open source and works with all recent versions of Wordpress.",

However, the fabrication of these protein-integrated devices has been found to be strongly influenced by the instability of the \u03b2-barrel porin structure, which depends on surrounding environment. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the structural stability of a representative porin, OmpF, in three different environments: (i) aqueous solution at pH\u00a0=\u00a07; (ii) a solution of neutral detergent in a concentration similar to the critical micelle concentration; and (iii) the protein embedded into a neutral detergent bilayer. The results indicate that the surrounding environment not only alters the stability of the \u03b2-barrel but affects the internal loop responsible of the ions transport, as well as the tendency of the porin proteins to aggregate into trimers. The detergent bilayer preserves the structure of OmpF protein as is found bacteria membranes, while pure aqueous solution induces a strong destabilization of the protein. An intermediate situation occurs for detergent solution. Our results have been rationalized in terms of protein\u00a0\u22ef\u00a0water and protein\u00a0\u22ef\u00a0detergent interactions, which makes them extremely useful for the future design of new generation of bioinspired protein-integrated devices.",

In this paper we describe new approaches to the determination of thermodynamic parameters for hybridization of tandem oligonucleotide complexes with the complementary template. It makes possible to determine changes in enthalpy and entropy corresponding to the binding of an individual oligomer with the template, and to the formation of cooperative contact at the helix-helix interface of two neighboring duplex fragments (in the nick). We have experimentally analyzed the series of model tandem complexes of different length at various oligomer concentrations, ionic strength, and pH. The analysis of thermodynamic parameters of complex formation for native and modified oligomers revealed higher Gibbs free energy values of hybridization and cooperative interaction of morpholine-containing complexes at the helix-helix interface under standard conditions (1\u00a0M NaCl, pH\u00a07.2). Further comparative analysis of the hybridization properties of modified oligomers at ionic strength and pH allows us to determine the charge state of the morpholine backbone and the thermodynamic origin of the effects observed. It was found that the decrease in pH to 5.5 led to the protonation of internal morpholine nitrogens. The obtained results prove the veracity of the proposed model and the possibility to evaluate thermodynamic parameters of short native and modified oligomers with high accuracy.",

The organization of the sequences is revealed over a range of length scales, from the nanometer range down to the level of molecular packing, and their cytotoxicity toward C6 rat glioma and RAW264.7 macrophage cell lines is investigated. We found that the polymorphism is dependent on peptide length, with a progressive increase in crystalline ordering upon increasing the number of [RF] pairs along the backbone. A dependence on length was also found for other observables, including critical aggregation concentrations, formation of chiral assemblies and half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50). Whereas shorter peptides self-assemble into fractal-like aggregates, clear fibrillogenic capabilities are identified for longer sequences with octameric and decameric chains exhibiting crystalline phases organized into cross-\u03b2 structures. Cell viability assays revealed dose-dependent cytotoxicity profiles with very similar behavior for both glioma and macrophage cell lines, which has been interpreted as evidence for a nonspecific mechanism involved in toxicity. We propose that structural organization of [RF]n peptides plays a paramount role regarding toxicity due to strong increase of local charge density induced by self-assemblies rich in cationic groups when interacting with cell membranes.",

Liprotides, composed of \u03b1-lactalbumin (aLA) and oleic acid (OA), are similar in components and cytotoxicity to the original HAMLET protein-fatty acid complex. Liprotides composed of aLA and OA kill tumor cells by transferring the OA component to, and thus destabilizing, the cell membrane. Here we investigate liprotides' dynamics of transfer of contents between themselves and membranes using the hydrophobic fluorescent probe pyrene. We find that pyrene incorporated into liprotides is exchanged between liprotides within the dead time of a stopped-flow instrument, while the transfer to membranes occurs within 20\u00a0s. Transfer kinetics was not affected by the presence of the membrane stabilizing lipid cholesterol. Thus, transfer is a remarkably rapid process which illustrates liprotides' efficacy as transporters of hydrophobic compounds.",

     "abstract": "Knowledge of protein stability is of utmost importance in various fields of biotechnology. Protein stability can be assessed in solution by increasing the concentration of denaturant and recording the structural changes with spectroscopic or thermodynamic methods. The standard interpretation of the experimental data is to assume a 2-state equilibrium between completely folded and completely unfolded protein molecules. Here we propose a cooperative model based on the statistical-mechanical Zimm-Bragg theory. In this model protein unfolding is driven by the weak binding of a rather small number of denaturant molecules, inducing the cooperative unfolding with multiple dynamic intermediates. The modified Zimm-Bragg theory is applied to published thermodynamic and spectroscopic data leading to the following conclusions. (i) The binding constant KD is correlated with the midpoint concentration, c0, of the unfolding reaction according to c0\u00a0\u2245\u00a01/KD. The better the binding of denaturant the lower is the concentration to achieve unfolding. (ii) The binding constant KD agrees with direct thermodynamic measurements. A rather small number of bound denaturants suffices to induce the cooperative unfolding of the whole protein. (iii) Chemical unfolding occurs in the concentration range \u0394cD\u00a0=\u00a0cend\u00a0\u2212\u00a0cini. The theory predicts the unfolding energy per amino acid residue as gnu\u00a0=\u00a0RTKD(cend\u00a0\u2212\u00a0cini). The Gibbs free energy of an osmotic gradient of the same size is \u0394GDiff\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a0RT\u00a0ln\u00a0(cend/cini). In all examples investigated \u0394GDiff exactly balances the unfolding energy gnu. The total unfolding energy is thus close to zero. (iv) Protein cooperativity in chemical unfolding is rather low with cooperativity parameters \u03c3\u00a0\u2265\u00a03x10\u2212\u00a03. As a consequence, the theory predicts a dynamic mixture of conformations during the unfolding reaction. The probabilities of individual conformations are easily accessible via the partition function Z(cD,\u03c3).",

     "abstract": "DNA is one of the most important biomolecules since it contains all the genetic information about an organism. The tridimensional structure of DNA is a determinant factor that influences the physiological and biochemical mechanisms by which this molecule carries out its biological functions. It is believed that hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking are the most relevant non-covalent interactions regarding DNA stability. Due to its importance, several theoretical works have been made to describe these interactions, however, most of them often consider only the presence of two nitrogenous bases, having a limited overview of the participation of these in B-DNA stabilization. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the system, there are discrepancies between which involved interaction is more important in duplex stability. Therefore, in this project we describe these interactions considering the effect of chain length on the energy related to both hydrogen bonds and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, using as model TATA-box-like chains with n base pairs (n\u00a0=\u00a01 to 14) and taking into consideration two different models: ideal and optimized B-DNA. We have found that there is a cooperative effect on hydrogen bond and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking mean energies when the presence of other base pairs is considered. In addition, it was found that hydrogen bonds contribute more importantly than \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking to B-DNA stability; nevertheless, the participation of \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking is not negligible: when B-DNA looks for a conformation of lower energy, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interaction are the first to be optimized.

     "abstract": "It is often suggested that Life may lay outside the normal laws of Physics and particularly of Thermodynamics, though this point of view is refuted by many. As the Living State may be thought of as an open system, often far from equilibrium, most attempts at placing Life under the umbrella of the laws of Physics have been based, particularly in recent years, on non-equilibrium Thermodynamics and particularly the Maximum Entropy Production Principle. In this view it is the dissipation of entropy (heat) which permits the ever increasing complexity of Living Systems in biological evolution and the maintenance of this complexity. However, these studies usually consider such biological entities as whole cells, organs, whole organisms and even Life itself at the entire terrestrial level. This requires making assumptions concerning the Living State, which are often not soundly based on observation and lack a defined model structure.The present study is based on an entirely different approach, in which a classical thermodynamic analysis of a well-defined biological nanoparticle, plant Photosystem I, is performed. This photosynthetic structure, which absorbs light and performs primary and secondary charge separation, operates with a quantum efficiency close to one. It is demonstrated that when monochromatic light is absorbed by the lowest lying electronic transition, the chlorophyll Qy transition, entropy production in the system bath plus entropy changes internal to the system are numerically less than the entropy decrease of the light field. A Second Law violation is therefore suggested for these experimental conditions. This conclusion, while at first sight is supportive of the famous and much discussed statement of Schroedinger, that \u201cLife feeds on negentropy\u201d, is analysed and the conditions in which this statement may be considered valid for a Plant Photosystem are defined and delimited.The remarkably high quantum efficiency, leading to minimal entropy production (energy wastage), seems to suggest that evolution of Photosystem I has gone down the road of maximal energy efficiency as distinct from maximal entropy production. Photosystem I cannot be considered a maximum entropy dissipation structure.",

     "abstract": "P7 is the only viral channel encoded by the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genome. It is a small, highly hydrophobic protein containing 63 amino acids. Structural studies have shown that p7 has two transmembrane (TM) \u03b1 helices linked by a short dibasic cytoplasmic loop. P7, mostly placed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is a membrane-associated protein. The results obtained from different studies revealed that p7 is a polytopic membrane protein that could oligomerize in membrane bilayer to create ion channels with cation selectivity. In addition, p7 is highly conserved and plays an important role in the assembly and release of mature viral particles. Thus, it can be considered as a potential target for anti-HCV drugs. It has been found that several compounds (amantadine, rimantadine, hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) and long-alkyl-chain iminosugar (IS) derivatives) inhibit p7 channel ability. Another new inhibitor identified as BIT225, a derivative of amiloride, also inhibits the viroporin function of HIV-1 Vpu and HCV p7. In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations were applied to get insights into molecular details of a BIT225 binding site. In addition, the g_mmpbsa approach was employed to calculate the binding free energy and free energy decomposition per residue. MD simulation results in the p7\u2013BIT225 complex revealed that drug binding to hydrophobic pocket can allosterically inhibit ion conduction via the funnel tip by restricting significant intrinsic channel breath at the tip of the funnel. Based on the molecular dynamics simulation (MD) analysis and the energy profiles, the hydrophobic interactions were the main driving force for BIT225 binding.",

Depending on various physiological circumstances such as ionic strength, metal ion, and point-residue mutation, oligomeric amyloids exhibit polymorphic behavior and structural stabilities, i.e. showing different conformation and stabilities. Specifically, experimental and computational researchers have found that the capping modulates the physical and chemical properties of amyloids by preserving electrostatic energy interactions, which is one of the dominant factors for amyloid stability. Still, there is no detailed knowledge for the polymorphic amyloids with reflecting the terminal capping effects. In the present study, we investigated the role of terminal capping (i.e. N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation) on polymorphic A\u03b216\u201321 amyloid oligomer and protofibrils via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We found that the capping effects have differently altered the conformation of polymorphic antiparallel-homo and \u2013hetero A\u03b216\u201321 amyloid oligomer, but not A\u03b216\u201321 amyloid protofibrils. However, regardless of polymorphic composition of the amyloids, the capping induces the thermodynamic instabilities of A\u03b216\u201321 amyloid oligomers, but does not show any distinct affect on A\u03b216\u201321 amyloid protofibrils. Specifically, among the molecular mechanic factors, electrostatic energy dominantly contributes the thermodynamic stability of the A\u03b216\u201321 amyloids. We hope that our computation study about the role of the capping effects on the polymorphic amyloids will facilitate additional efforts to enhance degradation of amyloids and to design a selective drug in the future.",

It has been concluded that the aggregation mechanism of UV-Phb at 10\u00a0\u00b0C in the presence of crowders includes the nucleation stage and stages of protein aggregate growth (the basic aggregation pathway). The aggregation mechanism is complicated in the presence of TMAO, and the stage of aggregate-aggregate assembly induced by TMAO should be added to the basic aggregation pathway. It has been shown that the ability of TMAO at a low concentration (0.05\u00a0M) to induce aggregation of UV-Phb is due to the decrease in the absolute value of zeta potential of the protein in the presence of TMAO.",

Here, we study the mechanism of binding/unbinding and compute the free energy for the association of the Bim peptide to the BHRF1 protein. Key elements of the binding mechanism are the conformational rearrangement together with a main free energy barrier of 11.5\u00a0kcal/mol. The simulations show complete unbinding and rebinding of the Bim peptide to BHRF1. The peptide slowly dissociates, disrupting the hydrophobic contacts, then tilting to one side. The peptide then completely disrupts all the remaining interactions and moves into the bulk solvent. The rebinding of the peptide from the solvent to the receptor binding site occurs slowly. This is because the helix partially unfolds in the unbound state. Rebinding involves an intermediate state, in which the peptide interacts with the hydrophobic binding pocket, which mainly involves Leu 62, Arg 63, Ile 65, and Phe 69. This novel intermediate structure forms 65 contacts with the receptor before the peptide again reaches the bound state. The standard binding free energy value is close to the experimental Kd in the nanomolar range. Finally, we observe how the breathing motions of \u03b13-\u03b14 are coupled with the binding/unbinding of the Bim BH3 peptide.

We find that about one third of the total DPA leaks immediately upon applying pressure, but that the rest leaks slowly in hrs upon decreasing the pressure. Once DPA is fully released from the spore, the proteins of the spore become easily denatured at a mild temperature, e.g., 80\u00a0\u00b0C, much below the temperature commonly used to inactivate spores (121\u00a0\u00b0C).

Notwithstanding that, at room temperature and neutral pH, lysozyme retains its native conformation up to the solubility limit of urea, the affinity of (GlcNAc)3 for the protein steadily decreases as the concentration of urea increases. We analyze the urea dependence of the binding free energy within the framework of a simplified statistical thermodynamics-based model that accounts for the excluded volume effect and direct solute-solvent interactions. The analysis reveals that the detrimental action of urea on the inhibitor-lysozyme binding originates from competition between the free energy contributions of the excluded volume effect and direct solute-solvent interactions. The free energy contribution of direct urea-solute interactions narrowly overcomes the excluded volume contribution thereby resulting in urea weakening the protein-ligand association. More broadly, the successful application of the simple model employed in this work points to the possibility of its use in quantifying the stabilizing/destabilizing action of individual cosolvents on biochemical folding and binding reactions.",

The same approach indicates that cononsolvency, at room temperature and P\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0atm, is caused by the inability of PNIPAM to make all the attractive energetic interactions that it could be engaged in, due to competition between water and methanol molecules.

     "abstract": "High pressure NMR spectroscopy is a powerful method for identifying rare conformational states of proteins from the pressure response of their chemical shifts. Many proteins have bound adenine nucleotides at their active centers, in most cases in a complex with Mg2+-ions. The 31P NMR signals of phosphate groups of the nucleotides can be used as probes for conformational transitions in the proteins themselves. For distinguishing protein specific pressure effects from trivial pressure responses not due to the protein interaction, data of the pressure response of the free nucleotides must be available. Therefore, the pressure response of 31P chemical shifts of the adenine nucleotides AMP, ADP, and ATP and their Mg2+-complexes has been determined at pH values several units distant from the respective pK-values. It is clearly non-linear for most of the resonances. A negative first order pressure coefficient B1 was determined for all 31P resonances except Mg2+\u00b7AMP indicating an upfield shift of the resonances with pressure. The smallest and largest negative values are obtained for the \u03b1-phosphate group of ADP and \u03b2-phosphate group of Mg2+\u00b7ATP with \u2212\u00a00.32 and \u2212\u00a04.59\u00a0ppm/GPa, respectively. With exception of the \u03b1-phosphate group of Mg2+\u00b7AMP the second order pressure coefficients are positive leading to a saturation like behaviour. The pressure response of the adenine nucleotides is similar but not identical to that observed earlier for guanine nucleotides. The obtained data show that the chemical shift pressure response of the different phosphate groups is rather different dependent on the position of phosphate group in the nucleotide and the nucleotide used.",

     "abstract": "In aqueous solutions containing sodium or potassium cations, oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) rich in guanine form four-stranded DNA structures called G-quadruplexes (G4s). These structures are destabilized by elevated hydrostatic pressure. Here, we use pressure to investigate the volumetric changes arising from the formation of G4 structures. G4s display a great deal of structural heterogeneity that depends on the stabilizing cation as well as the oligonucleotide sequence. Using UV thermal unfolding at different pressures, we have investigated the volume change of the helix-coil equilibrium of a series of ODNs whose sequences are related to the G-rich ODN HTel (d[A(GGGTTA)3GGG]), which contains four repeats of the human telomeric sequence. The experiments are conducted in aqueous buffers containing either 100\u00a0mM NaCl or KCl at pH\u00a07.4. The G4s stabilized by Na+ are less sensitive to pressure perturbation than those stabilized by K+. The overall molar volume changes (\u0394Vtot) of the unfolding transition for all of the G4s are large and negative. A large fraction of the measured \u0394Vtot value arises from the re-hydration of the cations released from the interior of the folded structure. However, the differences in the measured \u0394Vtot values demonstrate that variations in the structure of G4s formed by each ODN, arising from differences in the sequence of the loops, contribute significantly to \u0394Vtot and presumably the hydration of the folded structures. Depending on the sequence of the loops, the magnitude of the measured \u0394Vtot can be larger or smaller than that of HTel in solutions containing sodium. However, the magnitude of \u0394Vtot is smaller than HTel for the unfolding of all G4s that are stabilized by potassium ions.",

     "abstract": "The phase transitions of N-methylated di-O-hexadecylphosphatidylethanolamines (DHPE, DH-N-methyl-PE (DHMePE) and DH-N,N-dimethyl-PE (DHMe2PE)) were observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorometry under atmospheric pressure and by light-transmittance measurements under high pressure. The DSC thermograms showed that the N-methylated DHPE bilayers underwent the phase transition from the gel phase to the liquid crystalline (L\u03b1) phase under atmospheric pressure. The gel phase was identified by fluorometry as the lamellar gel (L\u03b2) phase, and not interdigitated gel (L\u03b2I) phase. The gel/L\u03b1 transition temperature increased with pressure while decreased stepwise with increasing polar head-group size. This stepwise depression of the transition temperature may be caused by the inverse-proportional hydrogen-bonding capabilities of the head-group to the head-group size. The thermodynamic quantities of the gel/L\u03b1 transition were comparable for the N-methylated DHPE bilayers. The pressure-induced L\u03b2I phase was not found in these bilayers although the bilayer of di-O-hexadecylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC), which is a kind of N-methylated DHPEs, forms the L\u03b2I phase only by hydration under atmospheric pressure. Taking into account that the bilayers of diacyl-homologs of N-methylated DHPEs, N-methylated dipalmitoyl-PEs except for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), do not form the L\u03b2I phase in the whole pressure range investigated but the DPPC bilayer forms the L\u03b2I phase under high pressure, we can say that the interdigitation requires weaker interaction between large-sized head groups like the bulky choline group.",

Cluster analysis of gene expression profiles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae exposed to various stresses exhibited that gene expression profile for p-HPCD stress (0.5\u00a0MPa, 25\u00a0\u00b0C) was grouped into a cluster including profiles for Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate and Roundup herbicide. Both are detergents that can disorder membrane structurally and functionally, which suggests that cell membrane may be a target of p-HPCD stress to cause cell growth inhibition. Through metabolomic analysis, amount of S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) that is used as methyl donor to participate in phosphatidylcholine synthesis via phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation pathway, was increased after p-HPCD treatment for 2\u00a0h. The key gene OPI3 encoding phospholipid methyltransferase that catalyzes the last two steps in PE methylation pathway was confirmed significantly induced by RT-PCR. Transcriptional expression of genes (MET13, MET16, MET10, MET17, MET6 and SAM2) related to AdoMet biosynthesis was also significantly induced. Choline as the PC precursor and ethanolamine as PE precursor in Kennedy pathway were also found increased under p-HPCD condition. We also found that amounts of most of amino acids involving protein synthesis were found decreased after p-HPCD treatment for 2\u00a0h. Moreover, morphological changes on cell surface were observed by scanning electron microscope. In conclusion, the effects of p-HPCD stress on cell membrane appear to be a very likely cause of yeast growth inhibition and the enhancement of PC synthesis could contribute to maintain optimum structure and functions of cell membrane and improve cell resistance to inactivation.",

By a multiple regression analysis, the pressure and temperature dependency of the inactivation rate constants k values of both mutants, as well as the parent strain KA31a, were well approximated with high correlation coefficients (0.92 to 0.95). For both mutants, as well as strain KA31a, the lowest k value was shown at a low pressure levels with around ambient temperature. The k value approximately increased with increase in pressure level, and with increase and decrease in temperature. The piezosensitive mutant strain a924E1 showed piezosensitivity at all pressure and temperature levels, compared with the parent strain KA31a.

Here, we interrogated the AT-specific DNA complex formed with the symmetric heterocyclic diamidine DB1976 as a model for minor groove DNA recognition using both ionic (NaCl) and non-ionic cosolutes (ethylene glycol, glycine betaine, maltose, nicotinamide, urea). While the non-ionic cosolutes all destabilized the ligand/DNA complex, their quantitative effects were heterogeneous in a cosolute- and salt-dependent manner. Perturbation with NaCl in the absence of non-ionic cosolute showed that preferential hydration water was released upon formation of the DB1976/DNA complex. As salt probes counter-ion release from charged groups such as the DNA backbone, we propose that the preferential hydration uptake in DB1976/DNA binding observed in the presence of osmolytes reflects the exchange of preferentially bound cosolute with hydration water in the environs of the bound DNA, rather than a net uptake of hydration waters by the complex.",

The high lethality of human infections causes major concerns about the real risk of a possible pandemic of severe diseases to which human susceptibility may be high and universal. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) is a valuable tool for studies regarding the folding of proteins and the assembly of macromolecular structures such as viruses; furthermore, HHP has already been demonstrated to promote viral inactivation.Here, we investigated the structural stability of avian and human influenza viruses using spectroscopic and light-scattering techniques. We found that both particles have similar structural stabilities and that HHP promotes structural changes.HHP induced slight structural changes to both human and avian influenza viruses, and these changes were largely reversible when the pressure returned to its initial level. The spectroscopic data showed that H3N2 was more pressure-sensitive than H3N8. Structural changes did not predict changes in protein function, as H3N2 fusion activity was not affected, while H3N8 fusion activity drastically decreased. The fusion activity of H1N1 was also strongly affected by HHP. In all cases, HHP caused inactivation of the different influenza viruses.HHP may be a useful tool for vaccine development, as it induces minor and reversible structural changes that may be associated with partial preservation of viral biological activities and may potentiate their immunogenic response while abolishing their infectivity. We also confirmed that, although pressure does not promote drastic changes in viral particle structure, it can distinctly affect viral fusion activity.",

We measured the temperature and pressure stability of bovine serum albumin and lysozyme with various concentrations of crowding agents, dextran, Ficoll\u2122 and lysozyme itself. Our most interesting finding is that low concentration of all the studied crowding agents decreases the pressure stability of the proteins.

Furthermore, we discuss the volumetric parameters and emphasize the difference between the partial volume of the protein and the volume it influences, and their relation to the excluded volume which is responsible for the macromolecular crowding.",

The total volumes are obtained using established methods from Fluctuation Solution Theory, while the volume decomposition is new and is performed using a simple proximity method. Native and fully extended ubiquitin are used as the test conformations. Changes in the protein volumes are then followed as a function of pressure, allowing for conformation-specific protein compressibility values to also be obtained.

Pressurization at 70\u00a0\u00b0C, i.e. at a temperature above the melting transition, has no significant effect on the conformational ensemble of the sRNAh, i.e., it does not promote formation of new native stem connections after thermal denaturation.

Protein carbonylation is induced by electrophilic carbonyl species and is an highly selective process since few nucleophilic residues are carbonylated within each protein. While considering the great interest for protein carbonylation, few studies investigated the factors which render a nucleophilic residue susceptible to carbonylation. Hence, the present study is aimed to delve into the factors which modulate the reactivity of cysteine, histidine and lysine residues towards \u03b1,\u03b2 unsaturated carbonyls by a retrospective analysis of the available studies which identified the adducted residues for proteins, the structure of which was resolved. Such an analysis involved different parameters including exposure, nucleophilicity, surrounding residues and capacity to attract carbonyl species (as derived by docking simulations). The obtained results allowed a meaningful clustering of the analyzed proteins suggesting that on average carbonylation selectivity increases with protein size. The comparison between adducted and unreactive residues revealed differences in all monitored parameters which are markedly more pronounced for cysteines compared to lysines and histidines.

     "abstract": "Hydrolysis of phosphate groups is a crucial reaction in living cells. It involves the breaking of two strong bonds, i.e. the OaH bond of the attacking water molecule, and the POl bond of the substrate (Oa and Ol stand for attacking and leaving oxygen atoms). Mechanism of the hydrolysis reaction can proceed either by a concurrent or a sequential mechanism. In the concurrent mechanism, the breaking of OaH and POl bonds occurs simultaneously, whereas in the sequential mechanism, the OaH and POl bonds break at different stages of the reaction. To understand how protonation affects the mechanism of hydrolysis of phosphate monoester, we have studied the mechanism of hydrolysis of protonated and deprotonated phosphate monoester at M06-2X/6-311\u00a0+\u00a0G**//M06-2X/6-31\u00a0+\u00a0G*+ZPE level of theory (where ZPE stands for zero point energy). Our calculations show that in both protonated and deprotonated cases, the breaking of the water OaH bond occurs before the breaking of the POl bond. Because the two events are not separated by a stable intermediate, the mechanism can be categorized as semi-concurrent. The overall energy barrier is 41\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01 in the unprotonated case. Most (5/6th) of this is due to the initial breaking of the water OaH bond. This component is lowered from 34 to 25\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01 by adding one proton to the phosphate. The rest of the overall energy barrier comes from the subsequent breaking of the POl bond and is not sensitive to protonation. This is consistent with previous findings about the effect of triphosphate protonation on the hydrolysis, where the equivalent protonation (on the \u03b3-phosphate) was seen to lower the barrier of breaking the water OaH bond and to have little effect on the POl bond breaking. Hydrolysis pathways of phosphate monoester with initial breaking of the POl bond could not be found here. This is because the leaving group in phosphate monoester cannot be protonated, unlike in triphosphate hydrolysis, where protonation of the \u03b2- and \u03b3-phosphates had been shown to promote a mechanism where the POl bond breaks before the OaH bond does. We also point out that the charge shift due to POl bond breaking during sequential ATP hydrolysis in bio-molecular motors onsets the week unbinding of hydrolysis product that finally leads to the product release during power stroke.",

In these ultracompact cases, the unusually small Rg could not be specifically attributed to any experimental parameter or crystal features. Ultracompaction involves most atoms and results in their displacement toward the center of the molecule. Ultracompact structures on average have significantly shorter van der Waals and hydrogen bonds than expected for ultralow temperature structures. In addition, the number of van der Waals contacts was larger in ultracompact than in ultralow temperature structures. The structure of these ultracompact states was analyzed in detail and the implication and possible causes of the phenomenon are discussed.",

     "abstract": "The vital coupled processes of oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthetic phosphorylation synthesize molecules of adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP), the universal biological energy currency, and sustain all life on our planet. The chemiosmotic theory of energy coupling in oxidative and photophosphorylation was proposed by Mitchell >\u00a050\u00a0years ago. It has had a contentious history, with part of the accumulated body of experimental evidence supporting it, and part of it in conflict with the theory. Although the theory was strongly criticized by many prominent scientists, the controversy has never been resolved. Here, the mathematical steps of Mitchell's original derivation leading to the principal equation of the chemiosmotic theory are scrutinized, and a fundamental flaw in them has been identified. Surprisingly, this flaw had not been detected earlier. Discovery of such a defect negates, or at least considerably weakens, the theoretical foundations on which the chemiosmotic theory is based. Ad hoc or simplistic ways to remedy this defect are shown to be scientifically unproductive and sterile. A novel two-ion theory of biological energy coupling salvages the situation by rectifying the fundamental flaw in the chemiosmotic theory, and the governing equations of the new theory have been shown to accurately quantify and predict extensive recent experimental data on ATP synthesis by F1FO-ATP synthase without using adjustable parameters. Some major biological implications arising from the new thinking are discussed. The principles of energy transduction and coupling proposed in the new paradigm are shown to be of a very general and universal nature. It is concluded that the timely availability after a 25-year research struggle of Nath's torsional mechanism of energy transduction and ATP synthesis is a rational alternative that has the power to solve the problems arising from the past, and also meet present and future challenges in this important interdisciplinary field of research.",

     "publication date": "11-2017",
     "abstract": "Glucose oxidase (GOX) is a homodimeric glycoprotein with tightly bound one molecule of FAD cofactor per monomer of the protein. GOX has numerous applications, but the preparation of biotechnologically interesting GOX sensors requires a removal of the native FAD cofactor. This process often leads to unwanted irreversible deflavination and, as a consequence, to the low enzyme recovery. Molecular mechanisms of reversible reflavination are poorly understood; our current knowledge is based only on empiric rules, which is clearly insufficient for further development. To develop conceptual understanding of flavin-binding competent states, we studied the effect of deflavination protocols on conformational properties of GOX. After deflavination, the apoform assembles into soluble oligomers with nearly native-like holoform secondary structure but largely destabilized tertiary structure presumambly due to the packing density defects around the vacant flavin binding site. The reflavination is cooperative but not fully efficient; after the binding the flavin cofactor, the protein directly disassembles into native homodimers while the fraction of oligomers remains irreversibly inactivated. Importantly, the effect of Hofmeister salts on the conformational properties of GOX and reflavination efficiency indicates that the native-like residual tertiary structure in the molten-globule states favorably supports the reflavination and minimizes the inactivated oligomers. We interpret our results by combining the ligand-induced changes in quaternary structure with salt-sensitive, non-equilibrated conformational selection model. In summary, our work provides the very first steps toward molecular understanding the complexity of the GOX reflavination mechanism.",

In this study, we are extending our analysis by using urine-derived Bence Jones proteins (BJPs) from five patients with light chain (AL) amyloidosis and four patients with multiple myeloma (MM).We observed lower stability in \u03ba proteins compared to \u03bb proteins (for both MM and AL proteins) in agreement with previous studies. The kinetic component of protein stability is not a universal feature of BJPs and the hysteresis observed during refolding reactions could be attributed to the inability of the protein to refold all domains.The most stable proteins exhibited 3-state unfolding transitions. While these proteins do not refold reversibly, partial refolding shows 2-state partial refolding transitions, suggesting that one of the domains (possibly the variable domain) does not refold completely. Sequences were aligned with their respective germlines and the location and nature of the mutations were analyzed.

The results showed an unexpected pattern change of FRET in the mutants, when compared to the wild type enzyme and a probable presence of a structure created between 159 and 160 residue, that might influence the binding efficiency.

Therefore, an attempt is made herein for the first time to investigate the effects of mutations of glycine 41 by serine (G41S) and tyrosine 48 by histidine (Y48H) on the conformational and dynamic changes of apoptotic (Fe3\u00a0+) cyt-c using all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit water solvent. Our 30\u00a0ns MD simulations demonstrate considerable structural differences in G41S and Y48H compared to wild type (WT) cyt-c, such as increasing distances between the critical electron transfer residues results in open conformation at the heme active site, large fluctuations in \u03b2-turns and \u03b1-helices. Additionally, although the \u03b2-sheets remain mostly unaffected in all the three cyt-c simulations, the \u03b1-helices undergo conformational switch to \u03b2-turns in both the mutant simulations. Importantly, this conformational switch of \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-turn around heme active site should attributes to the loss of intraprotein H-bonds in the mutant simulations especially between NE2 (His26) and O (Pro44) in agreement with the experimental report. Further, essential dynamics analysis reveals that overall motions of WT cyt-c is mainly involved only in the first eigenvector, but in G41S and Y48H the overall motions are mainly in three and two eigenvectors respectively. Overall, the detailed atomistic level information provide a unifying description for the molecular mechanism of structural destabilization, disregulation of platelet formation and enhanced peroxidase activity of the mutant cyt-c's in the pathology of intrinsic apoptosis.",

Helicobacter pylori (Hp), a pathogen notoriously responsible of severe gastric infections (chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, MALT lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma), produces and accumulates the photosensitizers protoporphyrin IX and coproporphyrin, thus it might be a suitable target of antimicrobial PDT. With the aim to design and develop an ingestible LED-based robotic pill for intragastric phototherapy, so that irradiation can be performed in situ without the use of invasive endoscopic light, photophysical studies on the Hp endogenous photosensitizers were carried out. These studies represent an important prerequisite in order to select the most effective irradiation conditions for Hp eradication.

We present here a study on the stability against a chemical denaturant, of the different cytoplasmic Hsp60 species. By combining Circular Dichroism and Small Angle X-ray Scattering as experimental biophysical techniques to investigate Hsp60, we find that na\u00efve and mitochondrial Hsp60 (mtHsp60) forms differ in their stability. Furthermore, specific responses from the two forms are discussed in terms of the biological environment they are working in, thus opening new questions on their biological function.",

Experimental procedures to perform qPCR from a small set of single cells were finely tuned. The experimental platform was tested in the context of bone (cell line hFOB 1.19), a physiological environment highly subjected to mechanical stimuli. Target genes were identified in the literature, based on their involvement in the osteogenesis process or in the bone response to mechanical stimuli. qPCR analysis shows an increase in expression of the chosen targets, and confirms the effectiveness of the presented approach for studying living single cells response to dynamic compression.",

SBMA is triggered by the binding of mutant AR to its natural ligands, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). To investigate the neuronal alterations of motor neuron cell models of SBMA, we applied patch-clamp methods to verify how polyQ expansions in the AR alter cell ionic currents. We used mouse motoneuron-derived MN-1 cells expressing normal AR (MN24Q) and mutant AR (MN100Q treated cells with vehicle EtOH and DHT). We observed a reduction of the current flux mainly at depolarizing potentials in the DHT\u2013treated cells, while the dissection of macroscopic currents showed single different cationic currents belonging to voltage-gated channels. Also, we treated the cells with IGF-1 and PACAP, which have previously been shown to protect MN-1 cells from the toxicity of mutant AR, and we found an amelioration of the altered currents. Our results suggest that the electrophysiological correlate of SBMA is a suitable reference point for the identification of disease symptoms and for future therapeutic targets.",

In HGPS, a mutant form of Lamin A (progeria) leads to a dysmorphic NL structure, but how this perturbation is transduced into cellular changes is still largely unknown. Owing to the close structural relationship between NL and the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), in this work we test whether HGPS affects passive and active nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of cargoes by means of an established model based of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.

     "abstract": "The stroma of human bone marrow contains a population of skeletal stem cells (hBM-MSC) which are common ancestors, among the others, of osteoblasts and adipocytes. It has been proposed that the imbalance between hBM-MSC osteogenesis and adipogenesis, which naturally accompanies bone marrow senescence, may contribute to the development of bone-associated diseases, like osteoporosis. The possibility to reproduce this mechanism in vitro has been demonstrated, providing a good model to disclose the details of the complex bone-fat generation homeostasis. Nevertheless, the lack of a simple approach to quantitatively assess the actual stage of a cellular population hindered the adoption of this in vitro model.In this work, the direct differentiation of hBM-MSCs towards a single (osteo or adipo) lineage was characterized using quantitative biophysical and biological approaches, together with the parallel process of trans-differentiation from one lineage to the other. The results confirm that the original plasticity of hBM-MSCs is maintained along the initial stages of the differentiation, showing that in vitro conversion of pre-osteoblasts into adipocytes and, vice versa, of pre-adipocytes into osteoblasts is extremely efficient, comparable with the direct differentiation. Moreover, a method based on digital holography is proposed, providing a quantitative indication of the phenotype stage along differentiation.",

     "publication date": "10-2017",
     "abstract": "Light harvesting from the Sun by antenna complexes surrounding the reaction center of Photosystem II represents the first step of the natural oxygenic photosynthesis performed by plants, algae and cyanobacteria. The excitation energy derived from the sunlight is absorbed by the chlorophylls of the antenna and subsequently conveyed to the reaction center of Photosystem II through resonant energy transfer mechanisms. In the special pair of chlorophylls of the reaction center the charge separation occurs, eventually leading to the oxidation of water molecules into protons, electrons and molecular oxygen. The adsorption properties of the antenna chlorophylls are ad hoc modulated by the protein environment to guarantee fast energy transfer and minimize side and back reactions. At the same time these properties are influenced by the molecular fluctuations occurring at physiological temperature. In the present work, combining classical molecular dynamics simulations with the Charge Density Coupling method, we estimated the impact of the thermal fluctuations on the site energy shift of the chlorophylls embedded in the Photosystem II complex. Our results show how the effect of the molecular fluctuations is not homogeneous throughout the complex, although the symmetry of the homodimer is maintained. Many peripheral chromophores undergo fluctuations larger then 10\u00a0kJ/mol around the average values. Possible physiological roles of such fluctuations are discussed.",

On the contrary, in his opinion, mass attacks by large well financed interdisciplinary research groups with a big number of overspecialized member is useful only in a second phase in which invention and discoveries need to be implemented by designers and developers. Finally, through a conceptual matching between Wiener's ideas and the ones of Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset, it appears how the Wienerian small interdisciplinary group would fit better with the Kuhnian revolutionary phase in science, while the big interdisciplinary group would fit better to the Kuhnian normal science.",

Structurally diverse compounds revealed >\u00a010-fold different efficiency for acceleration of dissociation of the complex. These results show that the kinetic behavior of flexible biomolecular complexes possessing two spatially separated contact areas is highly dynamic.

POB-G is found to adopt many isoenergetic conformations that allow for discrete interactions between the bulky moiety and the adducted G and/or pairing base. The calculated structure and stability of the hydrogen-bonded pairs between the Watson-Crick or Hoogsteen face of POB-G and the canonical DNA nucleobases fully rationalize the previously reported mutational spectra. Specifically, the stable, non-distorted pseudo-Watson-Crick POB-G:T pair explains the predominant G\u00a0\u2794\u00a0A mutations, while the stable, yet marginally distorted pairs between the Watson-Crick face of POB-G and A or C clarify the G\u00a0\u2794\u00a0T mutations and non-mutagenic replication. Finally, the stable, yet highly distorted Hoogsteen POB-G:G pair rationalizes the experimentally-observed insertion but lack of persistence of G opposite POB-G in DNA. Overall, these structural insights are critical for guiding future studies that strive to fully understand the adduct mutagenicity, including the accessible conformations and the replication of POB-G-adducted DNA.",

We use the fast field-cycling proton NMR relaxometry technique over a wide timescale and at diverse temperatures. A model previously validated in different formulations is here employed for the relaxometric analysis of elastic vesicles. A new dynamical regime is observed for the first time in additivated DMPC and additivated/non-additivated SPC liposomes. This surprising feature is discussed in terms of vesicle shape fluctuations, enhanced elasticity and lipid & additive diffusion within the membrane. The continuum elastic theory is revisited for a better understanding of recent experiments and those here presented.

Novel anticancer strategies based on drugs able to prevent the formation of complexes between p53R175H and the p53 family members call for a deeper knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of their interaction. To this aim, p53R175H/p63 and p53R175H/p53 complexes were investigated in vitro by using Surface Plasmon Resonance and Atomic Force Spectroscopy, two emerging and complementary techniques able to provide interaction kinetic information, in near physiological conditions and without any labelling. Both approaches show that p53R175H forms a very specific and highly stable bimolecular complex with both p63 and p53; with these interactions being characterized by a very high affinity with equilibrium dissociation constant, KD, of about 10\u2212\u00a09\u00a0M.

Similar peptides were shown to interact with model membranes both in the liquid disordered phase and in the liquid ordered state. Those results indicated that such interaction is important to function and could be correlated with their effectiveness. Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to investigate the interactions between both T-2410 and T-2429 with bilayers of pure 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and a mixture of POPC/cholesterol (Chol) (1:1). It was observed that both peptides interact strongly with both membrane systems, especially with the POPC/Chol systems, where these peptides show the highest number of H-bonds observed so far. T-2410 and T-2429 showed higher extent of interaction with bilayers when compared to T-20 or T-1249 in previous studies. This is most notable in POPC/Chol membranes where, although able to form H-bonds with Chol, they do so to a lesser extent than T-1249 does, the latter being the only FI peptide so far that was observed to form H-bonds with Chol. This behavior suggests that interaction of FI peptides with rigid Chol rich membranes may not be as dependent from peptide/Chol H-bond formation as previous results of T-1249 behavior led to believe. As in other similar peptides, the higher ability to interact with membranes shown by T-2410 and T2429 is probably correlated with its higher inhibitory efficiency.",

Our results allow identifying initial oligomer structures as the effective building blocks in the amyloid fibrils formation and indicate that the oligomers growth pathway, from compact structures to flexible chain-like structures, becomes faster as the solution ionic strength is increased. Furthermore, we find no evidence of structural branching what suggests that elongation of amyloid fibrils is dominated by linear association. To describe our results we adapt a phenomenological model based on population balance equations and linear polymer growth, where the parameters required are obtained from the experiments. Model calculations are in good agreement with experimentally-obtained estimates for the radius of gyration of A\u03b2 (1-40) oligomers, thus further supporting our findings.

Bacterial assays have shown that combining ILs with antibiotics can provide a synergistic enhancement of their antibacterial activities. We have characterized the mechanism by which the conventional ILs 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMICl) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4) enhance the lipid membrane permeabilization of the well-known antibiotic polymyxin B (PMB). We studied the sizes and membrane permeabilities of multilamellar and unilamellar lipid bilayer vesicles in the presence of ILs alone in aqueous solution, PMB alone, and ILs combined together with PMB. Light scattering-based experiments show that vesicle sizes dramatically increase when ILs are combined with PMB, which suggests that the materials combine to synergistically enhance lipid membrane disruption leading to vesicle aggregation. Lipid bilayer leakage experiments using tris (2,2\u2032-bipyridyl) ruthenium (II) (Ru(bpy)32\u00a0+) trapped in lipid vesicles, in which the trapped Ru(bpy)32\u00a0+ fluorescence lifetime increases when it leaks out of the vesicle, show that combining BMIBF4 and PMB together permeabilize the membrane significantly more than with PMB or the IL alone. This demonstrates that ILs can assist in antibiotic permeabilization of lipid bilayers which could explain the increased antibiotic activities in the presence of ILs in solution.",

The disintegration potency has been monitored by a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The experimental results suggest that the frequency of the applied AC field plays a crucial role in the disruption of preformed HSA fibrils. The extent of stress generated inside the droplet due to the application of the AC field at different frequencies has been monitored as a function of the input frequency of the applied AC voltage. This has been accomplished by assessing the morphology deformation of the oscillating HSA fibril droplets. The shape deformation of the oscillating droplets is characterized using image analysis by measuring the dynamic changes in the shape dependent parameters such as contact angle and droplet footprint radius and the amplitude. It is suggested that the cumulative effects of the stress generated inside the HSA fibril droplets due to the shape deformation induced hydrodynamic flows and the torque induced by the intrinsic electric dipoles of protein due to their continuous periodic realignment in presence of the AC electric field results in the destruction of the fibrillar species.",

Electron microscopy (EM) is currently the technique of choice to directly visualize a high number of replication intermediates and to monitor their remodeling upon stress. At the same time, DNA fiber analysis is useful to gain mechanistic insight on how genotoxic agents perturb replication fork dynamics genome-wide at single-molecule resolution. Combining these techniques has proven invaluable to achieve a comprehensive view of the mechanisms that ensure error-free processing of damaged replication forks. Here, we review how EM and single-molecule DNA fiber approaches can be used together to shed light into the mechanisms of replication stress response and discuss important cautions to be taken into account when comparing results obtained by EM and DNA fiber.",

The essential role of human RecQ helicases in the genome maintenance during DNA replication is underlined by association of defects in their function with cancer predisposition.",

BRCA2 and PALB2 are tumor suppressors implicated in cancer. RMPs regulate binding of RecA-like recombinases to sites of DNA damage to initiate the most efficient non-mutagenic repair of broken chromosome and other deleterious DNA lesions. Mechanistically, RMPs stimulate a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) hand-off from ssDNA binding proteins (ssbs) such as gp32, SSB and RPA, to recombinases, activating DNA repair only at the time and site of the damage event. This review summarizes structural studies of RMPs and their implications for understanding mechanism and function. Comparative analysis of RMPs is complicated due to their convergent evolution. In contrast to the evolutionary conserved ssbs and recombinases, RMPs are extremely diverse in sequence and structure. Structural studies are particularly important in such cases to reveal common features of the entire family and specific features of regulatory mechanisms for each member. All RMPs are characterized by specific DNA-binding domains and include variable protein interaction motifs. The complexity of such RMPs corresponds to the ever-growing number of DNA metabolism events they participate in under normal and pathological conditions and requires additional comprehensive structure-functional studies.",

Paradoxically, expression of mutant constitutively active Ras protein in primary human cells results in a premature proliferation arrest known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). This is more commonly observed in human pre-neoplasia than in neoplastic lesions, and is considered a tumor suppressor mechanism. Senescent cells are still metabolically active but in a status of cell cycle arrest characterized by specific morphological and physiological features that distinguish them from both proliferating cells, and cells growth-arrested by other means. Although the molecular mechanisms by which OIS is established are not totally understood, the current view is that OIS in human cells is tightly linked to persistent activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, as a consequence of replication stress. Here we will highlight recent advances in our understanding of molecular mechanisms leading to hyper-replication stress in response to oncogene activation, and of the crosstalk between replication stress and persistent activation of the DDR. We will also discuss new evidence for DNA repair deficiencies during OIS, which might increase the genomic instability that drives senescence bypass and malignant transformation.",

The polarity of (Ca2\u00a0+)2-CaMC relative to the IQ motif was opposite to that seen in apo CaMC-Nav1.2IQp (2KXW), revealing that CaMC recognizes nested, anti-parallel sites in Nav1.2IQp.

     "abstract": "Metals play vital role in various physiological processes and are bound to biomolecules. Although cysteine sulfur is more frequently found as metal-binding ligand, methionine prefers to occur in copper-binding motifs of some proteins. To address methionine's lower preference in copper-binding sites in comparison to cysteine, we have considered copper-binding motifs (His-Cys-His-Met) from seven different high-resolution protein structures. We performed quantum chemical calculations to find out the strength of interactions between sulfur and metal ion in both Met and Cys residues. In the case of Cys, both neutral (CysH) and the deprotonated form (Cys\u2212) were considered. We used two different levels of theory (B3LYP and M06-2X) and the model compounds methyl propyl sulfide, ethanethiol and ethanethiolate were used to represent Met, CysH and Cys\u2212 respectively. To compare the metal-binding strength, we mutated Met in silico to CysH/Cys\u2212 and performed the calculations. We also carried out calculations with wild-type Cys present in the same metal-binding motif. On average, interactions of Met with copper ion are stronger by 13\u201335\u00a0kcal/mol compared to CysH. However, Cys\u2212 interactions with copper is stronger than that of Met by ~\u00a0250\u00a0kcal/mol. We then considered the entire metal-binding motif with four residues and calculated the interaction energies with the copper ion. We also considered Met\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Cys\u2212 mutation in the motif and repeated the calculations. Interaction of the wild-type motif with the copper ion is ~\u00a0160\u00a0kcal/mol weaker than that of mutated motif. Our studies suggest the factors that could explain why Met is not as frequently observed as Cys in the metal-binding motifs. Results of these studies will help in designing metal-binding motifs in proteins with varying interaction strengths.",

GSTA3-3 catalyzes this reaction with ten-fold greater efficiency than GSTA1-1, its closest competitor in the Alpha class of GSTs. In order to examine the differences between Alpha class GSTs and to better elucidate the mechanism of GSTA3-3 the roles of Tyr9 and Arg15 were examined. Tyr9 is the major catalytic residue of Alpha class GSTs and Arg15 is proposed to be catalytically important to GSTA3-3 but never before experimentally examined. While the structure and stability of the Alpha class enzymes are highly comparable, subtle differences at the G-site of the enzymes account for GSTA3-3 having a ten-fold greater affinity for the substrate GSH. Y9F and R15L mutations, singly or together, have no effect on the structure and stability of GSTA3-3 (the same effect they have on GSTA1-1) despite the R15L mutation removing an interdomain salt-bridge at the active site. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry also revealed that neither mutation had a significant effect on the conformational dynamics of GSTA3-3. The R15L and Y9F mutations are equally important to the specific activity of the steroid isomerase reaction; however, Arg15 is more important for lowering the pKa of GSH. Lowering the pKa of GSH being how GSTs catalyze their reactions. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that Arg15 is integral to allowing GSTA3-3 to differentiate between \u03945-androstene-3-17-dione and \u03944-androstene-3-17-dione, indicating that Arg15 is a more important active-site residue than previously known.",

     "abstract": "Theories of biological energy coupling in oxidative phosphorylation (OX PHOS) and photophosphorylation (PHOTO PHOS) are reviewed and applied to ATP synthesis by an experimental system containing purified ATP synthase reconstituted into liposomes. The theories are critically evaluated from the standpoint of the principle of electrical neutrality. It is shown that the obligatory requirement to maintain overall electroneutrality of bulk aqueous phases imposes strong constraints on possible theories of energy coupling and molecular mechanisms of ATP synthesis. Mitchell's chemiosmotic theory is found to violate the electroneutrality of bulk aqueous phases and is shown to be untenable on these grounds. Purely electroneutral mechanisms or mechanisms where the anion/countercation gradient is dissipated or simply flows through the lipid bilayer are also shown to be inadequate. A dynamically electrogenic but overall electroneutral mode of ion transport postulated by Nath's torsional mechanism of energy transduction and ATP synthesis is shown to be consistent both with the experimental findings and the principle of electrical neutrality. It is concluded that the ATP synthase functions as a proton-dicarboxylic acid anion cotransporter in OX PHOS or PHOTO PHOS. A logical chemical explanation for the selection of dicarboxylic acids as intermediates in OX PHOS and PHOTO PHOS is suggested based on the pioneering classical thermodynamic work of Christensen, Izatt, and Hansen. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic consequences for theories in which the protons originate from water vis-a-vis weak organic acids are compared and contrasted, and several new mechanistic and thermodynamic insights into biological energy transduction by ATP synthase are offered. These considerations make the new theory of energy coupling more complete, and lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of ATP synthesis.",

The mechanism of biased motion exhibited by molecular motors is typically described as either a thermal ratchet or a power-stroke and nucleic acid helicases are characterized by either active or passive unwinding mechanisms. We posit that both Brownian ratchet translocation and passive unwinding are examples of conformational selection and that both power-stroke translocation and active unwinding are examples of induced fit. Furthermore, in ligand-binding reactions, both conformational selection and induced fit may exist in parallel leading to a ligand-dependent flux through the different mechanistic pathways.

The RD-hTH1 is composed of a structured region (66-169) preceded by an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDP, hTH1_65) containing two phosphorylation sites (S19 and S40) which are highly relevant for its increase in activity. The NMR signals of the IDP region in the non-phosphorylated, singly phosphorylated (pS40) and doubly phosphorylated states (pS19_pS40) were assigned by non-uniformly sampled spectra with increased dimensionality (5D). The structural changes induced by phosphorylation were analyzed by means of secondary structure propensities. The phosphorylation kinetics of the S40 and S19 by kinases PKA and PRAK respectively were monitored by non-uniformly sampled time-resolved NMR spectroscopy followed by their quantitative analysis.",

     "abstract": "ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is a key reaction for metabolism. Tools from systems biology require standard reaction data in order to predict metabolic pathways accurately. However, literature values for standard Gibbs energy of ATP hydrolysis are highly uncertain and differ strongly from each other. Further, such data usually neglect the activity coefficients of reacting agents, and published data like this is apparent (condition-dependent) data instead of activity-based standard data. In this work a consistent value for the standard Gibbs energy of ATP hydrolysis was determined. The activity coefficients of reacting agents were modeled with electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT).The Gibbs energy of ATP hydrolysis was calculated by combining the standard Gibbs energies of hexokinase reaction and of glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis. While the standard Gibbs energy of hexokinase reaction was taken from previous work, standard Gibbs energy of glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis reaction was determined in this work. For this purpose, reaction equilibrium molalities of reacting agents were measured at pH\u00a07 and pH\u00a08 at 298.15\u00a0K at varying initial reacting agent molalities. The corresponding activity coefficients at experimental equilibrium molalities were predicted with ePC-SAFT yielding the Gibbs energy of glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis of \u2212\u00a013.72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.75\u00a0kJ\u00b7mol\u2212\u00a01. Combined with the value for hexokinase, the standard Gibbs energy of ATP hydrolysis was finally found to be \u2212\u00a031.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27\u00a0kJ\u00b7mol\u2212\u00a01. For both, ATP hydrolysis and glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis, a good agreement with own and literature values were obtained when influences of pH, temperature, and activity coefficients were explicitly taken into account in order to calculate standard Gibbs energy at pH\u00a07, 298.15\u00a0K and standard state.",

The protein\u2013SWCNTs interactions will play an important role in the degradation and cytotoxicity of nanotubes. Here, we investigated the binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA, a common and well-characterized model blood serum protein) to SWCNTs, and found that the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions might be crucial factors in stabilizing the binding of SWCNTs with BSA. The binding of BSA could impair SWCNTs biodegradation in vitro through the competitive adsorption to nanotube. Both SWCNTs and BSA-SWCNTs were significantly degraded in zymosan-stimulated macrophages, and the degradation degree was more for BSA-SWCNTs. The mechanism for SWCNTs degradation in activated macrophages was further investigated to demonstrate the dominant participation of MPO and ONOO\u2212-driven pathways. Moreover, binding of BSA to SWCNTs reduced cytotoxicity and degraded nanotubes induced less cytotoxicity than non-degraded nanotubes. The binding of BSA may be an important determinant for the biodegradation and cytotoxicity of SWCNTs in inflammatory cells, and therefore, provide a new route to mitigate the potential toxicity of nanotubes in future biomedical applications.",

Nitrite is a powerful oxidizing agent and a biological reservoir for NO that has been implicated in a variety of aerobic biological systems. Accordingly, it is important to elucidate the nature and variety of NO2\u2212 reaction mechanisms with Mb. We have performed principal component analysis (PCA, or essential dynamics) on Molecular Dynamics trajectories of all MbNO2 coordination states to resolve the most important motions in the protein at 298\u00a0K. We show that the coordination or removal of NO2\u2212 to/from the heme iron is associated mainly with a motion of helix E and the coordination of NO2\u2212 to the 2-vinyl is associated with a motion of helix F and a correlated motion of helices E-F. This latter correlated motion can be attributed to the interaction of Val68 and Ile107 with the 2-nitrovinyl moiety. The resonance Raman results show that coordination of NO2\u2212 to the 2-vinyl is increased at pH\u00a06.0 demonstrating that the amide protons in the F helix are not protected from access of solvent water and the helix F motion allows solvent access to the 2-vinyl group, without affecting the coordination to the heme Fe.",

In the present work, we report three nucleosome structures (NCPs) with human testis-specific histone variants hTh2a and hTh2b, [hGcH (hTh2a-hTh2b-H3-H4), hGcHV1 (hTh2a-H2b-H3-H4) and hGcHV2 (H2a-hTh2b-H3-H4)] and a 146-base pair (bp) duplex DNA fragment at ~\u00a03.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolutions. These crystal structures revealed two major changes within the nucleosomes, either with hTh2a, hTh2b or both variants, as compared to the canonical counterpart. First, the H-bonding interactions between the L1-L1\u2032 interfaces mediated by the hTh2a/hTh2a\u2032 L1-loops are lost. Second, the histone dimer-DNA contacts are considerably reduced, and these changes are localized around \u00b1\u00a031 to 35-bp from the nucleosome entry/exit sites. Thus, the modified functional residues at the N- and C-terminal ends of histone variants are responsible for the observed structural changes and regulate the gene expression through specific structural alterations in the chromatin by modulating the chromatin-associated binding proteins.",

One of the major drawbacks of the assay, however, is that only water soluble compounds can be tested for their radical-scavenging activity. Lipoic acid (LA) is an excellent scavenger of HO but it exhibits a low solubility in the aqueous milieu of the 2-DR assay and a high tendency to polymerize under a variety of conditions. We used LA as a paradigmatic substrate to evaluate the effect of several organic co-solvents in increasing its solubility. Most of these solvents, however, demonstrated to be potent scavengers of HO making their use in the 2-DR assay improper. On the other hand, acetonitrile showed a remarkably low reactivity toward HO (rate constant ~\u00a08.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) which allowed us to use it as a co-solvent in the preparation of stock solutions of LA ~\u00a05\u00a0mM. We therefore evaluated the radical-scavenging activity of LA by the 2-DR assay in a relatively large range of concentrations, 1\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM. We found that the rate constant for LA\u00a0+\u00a0HO is diffusion-controlled (~\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01010\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 in water at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) and uninfluenced by the presence of small quantities of acetonitrile.

Three synthetic xanthone derivatives (KS1, KS2, and KS3) with properties typical for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) were objects of the presented model study. NSAIDs are in common use however; several of them exhibit gastric toxicity predominantly resulting from their direct interactions with the outermost lipid layer of the gastric mucosa that impair its hydrophobic barrier property. Among the studied xanthones, gastric toxicity of only KS2 has been determined in previous pharmacological studies, and it is low. In this study, carried out using X-ray diffraction and computer simulation, a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine-cholesterol bilayer (POPC-Chol) was used as a model of a hydrophobic layer of lipids protecting gastric mucosa as POPC and Chol are the main lipids in human mucus. X-ray diffraction data were used to validate the computer model. The aim of the study was to assess potential gastric toxicity of the xanthones by analysing their atomic level interactions with lipids, ions, and water in the lipid bilayer and their effect on the bilayer physicochemical properties. The results show that xanthones have small effect on the bilayer properties except for its rigidity whereas their interactions with water, ions, and lipids depend on their protonation state and for a given state, are similar for all the xanthones. As gastric toxicity of KS2 is low, based on MD simulations one can predict that toxicity of KS1 and KS3 is also low.",

     "abstract": "The 140-residue natively disordered protein \u03b1-synuclein (aSN) is a central component in the development of a family of neurodegenerative diseases termed synucleinopathies. This is attributed to its ability to form cytotoxic aggregates such as oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Consequently there have been intense efforts to avoid aggregation or reroute the aggregation pathway using pharmaceutical agents such as small molecules, chaperones and antibodies. aSN's lack of persistent structure in the monomeric state, as well as the multitude of different oligomeric and even different fibrillar states, makes it difficult to raise antibodies that would be efficacious in neutralizing all conformations of aSN. However, the C-terminal 20\u201340 residues of aSN are a promising epitope for antibody development. It is primarily disordered in both monomeric and aggregated forms, and an anti-C-terminal antibody will therefore be able to bind all forms. Furthermore, it might not interfere with the folding of aSN into membranes, which could be important for its physiological role. Here we report a screen of a series of monoclonal antibodies, which all target the C-terminal of aSN. According to dot blot analyses, different antibodies bound different forms of aSN with different preferences and showed reduced binding to monomeric compared to aggregated (oligomeric and fibrillary) aSN. Consequently they have different effects on aSN's ability to fibrillate and permeabilize membranes. Generally, the antibodies with strongest binding to aggregated aSN in dot blot, also inhibited fibrillation and membrane permeabilization the most, and promoted formation of amorphous aggregates surrounded by small and thin fibers. This suggests that the development of antibodies that targets the C-terminus, exposed in the aggregated forms of aSN, may be beneficial for improved immunotherapy against PD.",

In order to gain insight into the fibrillization of A\u03b2(25\u201340) and the ability of the flavonoid myricetin to inhibit its aggregation, the isoleucine at position 32 (I32A) and the glycine at position 37 (G37A) in the full-length peptide were replaced with alanine. Thioflavin T assays indicate that substitution of isoleucine for alanine significantly reduces the rate and extent of fibrillization compared to the A\u03b2(25\u201340) and G37A peptides. Although all three peptides are fully disordered initially, circular dichroism studies suggest the structure of the I32A and G37A peptides are different from the parent peptide A\u03b2(25\u201340). Introduction of myricetin to the peptide samples results in modest structural changes for the A\u03b2(25\u201340) and G37A peptides but not the I32A peptide. A\u03b2(25\u201340) oligomers were predominantly tetramers, whereas I32A and G37A oligomers were a mixture of trimers and dimers. After 48\u00a0h of incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, the amount of tetramers and trimers in solution dropped for the A\u03b2(25\u201340) and G37A peptides but remained similar for the I32A peptide. Incubation of A\u03b2(25\u201340) with myricetin increased the relative proportion of trimers to tetramers. Ultraviolet resonance Raman studies suggests that the I32A peptide may be more hydrated than the A\u03b2(25\u201340) and G37A peptides. Taken together, these data indicate the structural changes observed for the A\u03b2(25\u201340) and G37A peptides upon introduction of myricetin are localized around residue 32 and could arise from hydrophobic interactions between the peptide and the flavonoid or interference with the self-association of the peptide in this region. Substitution of isoleucine at position 32 with alanine had little effect on the peptide's secondary structure but dramatically decreased the propensity of the peptide fibrillize.",

Rupintrivir, a broad-spectrum inhibitor, is a drug candidate for HFMD treatment, while other HFMD inhibitors designed from several studies have a relatively low efficiency. Therefore, in this work we aim to study the binding mechanisms of rupintrivir and a peptidic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ethyl ester (SG85) against both CV-A16 and EV-A71 3C proteases (3Cpro) using all-atoms molecular dynamics simulation. The obtained results indicate that SG85 shows a stronger binding affinity than rupintrivir against CV-A16. Both inhibitors exhibit a comparable affinity against EV-A71 3Cpro. The molecular information of the binding of the two inhibitors to the proteases will be elucidated. Thus, it is implied that these two compounds may be used as leads for further anti-HFMD drug design and development.",

The specificity of seeding is well documented in vivo for prions, where prion-variants arising from conformationally altered amyloids of the same protein, faithfully seed monomers into amyloid displaying the original variant's conformation.

While mutant human lysozyme causes renal amyloidosis, the hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) has been extensively investigated in vitro as a model amyloid protein. Here we investigated if wild-type HEWL could form self-seeding amyloid variants to examine if variant formation is more wide-spread. We found that HEWL aggregates formed under quiescent versus agitated conditions, displayed different particle sizes, detergent stabilities & \u03b2-sheet content, and they only seeded monomeric HEWL under similar incubation conditions, but not under swapped incubation conditions thereby showing amyloid variant formation by HEWL analogous to prion variants.

The binding of TPN to Kir3.2 is stable when the side chain of either Lys16 (TPNK16-Kir3.2) or Lys17 (TPNK17-Kir3.2) of the toxin protrudes into the channel pore. However, the binding affinity calculated from only TPNK17-Kir3.2 and not TPNK16-Kir3.2 is consistent with experiment, suggesting that Lys17 is the most plausible pore-blocking residue. The alanine mutation of Kir3.2-Glu127, which is not present in TPN-resistant channels, reduces the inhibitory ability of TPN by over 50 fold in TPNK17-Kir3.2, indicating that Kir3.2-Glu127 is important for the selectivity of TPN.",

Previous estimates of the thermodynamic efficiency of this vital process have ranged from Lehninger's original back-of-the-envelope calculation of 38% to the often quoted value of 55\u201360% in current textbooks of biochemistry, to high values of 90% from recent information theoretic considerations, and reports of realizations of close to ideal 100% efficiencies by single molecule experiments. Hence this problem has been reinvestigated from first principles. The overall thermodynamic efficiency of ATP synthesis in the mitochondrial energy transduction OX PHOS process has been found to lie between 40 and 41% from four different approaches based on a) estimation using structural and biochemical data, b) fundamental nonequilibrium thermodynamic analysis, c) novel insights arising from Nath's torsional mechanism of energy transduction and ATP synthesis, and d) the overall balance of cellular energetics. The torsional mechanism also offers an explanation for the observation of a thermodynamic efficiency approaching 100% in some experiments. Applications of the unique, molecular machine mode of functioning of F1FO-ATP synthase involving direct inter-conversion of chemical and mechanical energies in the design and fabrication of novel, man-made mechanochemical devices have been envisaged, and some new ways to exorcise Maxwell's demon have been proposed.

In the presence of DNA, however, relocation of the micelle-carried PSF occurs from the micelle to the DNA. Competitive binding of the probe between micelle and the DNA is assigned responsible for this relocation.

To better understand enzyme kinetics at aqueous-solid interfaces, we have carried out a high-pressure stopped-flow activity study of \u03b1-chymotrypsin (\u03b1-CT) that is adsorbed on silica particles and, for comparison, dissolved in solution. The enzyme reaction was modulated using pressures up to 2000\u00a0bar and recorded using the high-pressure stopped-flow technique. The results indicate an 8-fold enhancement of the turnover number upon \u03b1-CT adsorption and a further increase of the catalytic rate in the pressure range up to 1000\u00a0bar. From the pressure dependence of the catalytic rate, apparent activation volumes have been determined. In the adsorbed state of \u03b1-CT, a pronounced change of the activation volume is found with increasing pressure. Furthermore, owing to suppression of its autolysis, a significantly longer storage time of \u03b1-CT can be achieved when the enzyme is adsorbed on silica particles.

     "abstract": "Photosynthetic eukaryotes have a complex evolutionary history shaped by multiple endosymbiosis events that required a tight coordination between the organelles and the rest of the cell. Plant ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGLRs) form a large superfamily of proteins with a predicted or proven non-selective cation channel activity regulated by a broad range of amino acids. They are involved in different physiological processes such as C/N sensing, resistance against fungal infection, root and pollen tube growth and response to wounding and pathogens. Most of the present knowledge is limited to iGLRs located in plasma membranes. However, recent studies localized different iGLR isoforms to mitochondria and/or chloroplasts, suggesting the possibility that they play a specific role in bioenergetic processes.In this work, we performed a comparative analysis of GLR sequences from bacteria and various photosynthetic eukaryotes. In particular, novel types of selectivity filters of bacteria are reported adding new examples of the great diversity of the GLR superfamily. The highest variability in GLR sequences was found among the algal sequences (cryptophytes, diatoms, brown and green algae). GLRs of land plants are not closely related to the GLRs of green algae analyzed in this work. The GLR family underwent a great expansion in vascular plants. Among plant GLRs, Clade III includes sequences from Physcomitrella patens, Marchantia polymorpha and gymnosperms and can be considered the most ancient, while other clades likely emerged later. In silico analysis allowed the identification of sequences with a putative target to organelles. Sequences with a predicted localization to mitochondria and chloroplasts are randomly distributed among different type of GLRs, suggesting that no compartment-related specific function has been maintained across the species.",

We have evaluated lipid nanoparticles containing varying amounts of miltefosine and cholesterol, prepared by sonication, in terms of their physicochemical properties, preliminary stability, hemolytic potential toward erythrocytes, and cytotoxicity to macrophages and to promastigote and amastigote forms of Leishmania (L.) chagasi. Miltefosine loading into lipid nanoparticles was 100% for low drug concentrations (7.0 to 20.0\u00a0mg/mL). Particle size decreased from 143\u00a0nm (control) to between 43 and 69\u00a0nm. From fluorescence studies, it was observed that the presence of miltefosine and cholesterol (below 103\u00a0\u03bcM) promoted ordering effects in the phospholipid region of the nanoparticles. The formulation containing 15\u00a0mg/mL miltefosine was stable for at least six months at 4\u00a0\u00b0C and in simulated gastrointestinal fluids, and did not promote epithelial gastrointestinal irritability in Balb/C mice. When loaded into lipid nanoparticles, the hemolytic potential of miltefosine and its cytotoxicity to macrophages diminished, while its antiparasitic activity remained unaltered. The results suggested that miltefosine-loaded lipid nanoparticles may be promising for the treatment of leishmaniasis and might be suitable for oral and parenteral use.",

Biofilm forming ability of S. aureus enhances its virulence since biofilm provides the bacteria protective shield against antibiotics and host immunity. Polysaccharide independent biofilm formation by several virulent S. aureus strains have been identified recently, where protein components substitute polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) involved in bacterial cell attachment. The suhB gene has been reported to be essential in staphylococcal PIA-independent biofilm formation. Overexpression of staphylococcal SuhB (SasuhB) in E. coli produces extracellular macroscopic fibers made of recombinant SaSuhB protein. The amyloidic nature of the fiber is evaluated by high resolution electron microscopy, X-ray fiber diffraction and amyloid specific dyes, such as Congo red and thioflavin-T binding assay.

To explore the consequences of detergent binding, X-ray crystal structures of the peripheral pocket mutant CYP2B4 F202W were solved in the presence of hexaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E6) and CYMAL-5. The structure in the presence of CYMAL-5 illustrated a closed conformation indistinguishable from the previously solved wild-type. In contrast, the F202W structure in the presence of C8E6 revealed a detergent molecule that coordinated the heme-iron and extended to the protein surface through the substrate access channel 2f. Despite the overall structural similarity of these detergent complexes, remarkable differences were observed in the A, A\u2032, and H helices, the F-G cassette, the C-D and \u03b24 loop region. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) was employed to probe these differences and to test the effect of detergents in solution.

We show that amyloid-like aggregate formation can be induced at high temperature in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE).

To test this hypothesis we have measured the intramolecular diffusion of the full length and 8-residue deletion peptides at two different pHs and found a correlation with fibrillization lag time.

The studies presented in this paper, when compared with our previous results (Makowska et al., Spectrochim.

All the measurements were carried out in 20\u00a0mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer solution, pH\u00a06.0. The Stern-Volmer equations, along with spectroscopic observations, were used to determine the quenching and binding parameters. The obtained results unequivocally suggest that Cu2\u00a0+ ions quench the fluorescence of HZ1 only through a static quenching mechanism, in contrast to the fragment from the N\u2013terminal part of the FPB28 protein, with sequence Ac-Tyr-Lys-Thr-Ala-Asp-Gly-Lys-Thr-Tyr- NH2 (D9) and its derivative with a single point mutation: Ac-Tyr-Lys-Thr-Ala-Asn-Gly-Lys-Thr-Tyr- NH2 (D9_M), where dynamic quenching occurred. The thermodynamic parameters (\u0394ITCH, \u0394ITCS) for the interactions between Cu2\u00a0+ ions and the HZ1 peptide were determined from the calorimetric data.

Measurements of heat changes during the action potential suggest that the nerve pulse shares many characteristics with an adiabatic pulse. First experiments in the 1980s suggested small changes in nerve thickness and length during the action potential. Such findings have led to the suggestion that the action potential may be related to electromechanical solitons traveling without dissipation. However, there have been no modern attempts to study mechanical phenomena in nerves. Here, we present ultrasensitive AFM recordings of mechanical changes on the order of 2\u201312\u00a0\u00c5 in the giant axons of the lobster. We show that the nerve thickness changes in phase with voltage changes. When stimulated at opposite ends of the same axon, colliding action potentials pass through one another and do not annihilate.

A recent simulation analysis of the volumes of nonpolar molecular solutes in water reported that the apparent solvent-free border thickness enshrouding these solutes grows with increasing solute size, based on the assumption the solute can be treated as an individual sphere [Biophys. Chem. 161 (2012) 46]. This suggests the solvent dewets these solutes as they grow in size. Via simulations of dewetted repulsive spherical solutes, we show that the border thicknesses of the largest non-polar molecular solutes tend towards that of a repulsive sphere. When attractive interactions are accounted for, however, the spherical solute border thicknesses fall below that of the largest molecular solutes. We demonstrate that if the molecular solutes are treated with atomic detail rather than approximated as an individual sphere, the border thickness variation is minimal. A geometric model is put forward that reproduces the inferred border thickening, indicating the implied dewetting results from a breakdown in the spherical volume approximation.",

     "abstract": "Micellar aggregation behavior of polysorbate 20 (PS20) has generated significant interest because of the wide use of PS20 as a surfactant to minimize protein surface adsorption and mitigate protein aggregation. Thus, there is a need for better molecular understanding of what drives the biophysical behavior of PS20 in solution. We observe that a complex amphipathic PS20 molecule, which contains both hydrophobic tail and relatively large hydrophilic head, self-associates strongly within the course of a molecular dynamics simulation performed with a fully atomistic representation of the molecule and an explicit water solvent model. The in silico behavior is consistent with micellar models of PS20 in solution. The dynamics of this self-association is rather complex involving both internal reorganization of the molecule and diffusion to form stable micelle-like aggregates. The micellar aggregates of PS20 are long-lived and are formed by the balance between the large hydrophobic interactions associated with the aliphatic tail of PS20, and the steric repulsion of the hydrophilic sorbitan head structure. In the present work, molecular models of PS20 that represent naturally occurring PS20 fractions were produced and characterized in silico. The study investigated the monoester and diester fractions: PS20M, and PS20D. These fractions present differences in the strength of their hydrophobic effect, which influences the aggregation behavior. Adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulations were carried out with the PS20M and PS20D molecular constructs to calculate the free energy of their pairwise interaction. The free energy barrier for the dissociation is higher for PS20D compared with PS20M. The results show that hydrogen bonds can form when head groups are in close proximity, such as in the PS20 aggregate assembly, and the free energy of interaction can be used to predict the morphology of the micellar aggregate for the different PS20 fractions. We were also able to simulate PS20 in the presence of N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) to study the solution behavior of the hydrophobic molecule and of the mechanism in which it is sequestered in the hydrophobic core of the PS20 micellar aggregate.",

In particular, multi-functional nanovector systems permit diverse functions such as efficient drug/imaging agent loading and unloading and increased target specificity. To enhance the efficiency of delivery systems, particle size and shape can be altered and specific ligands can be conjugated to the particles to promote interactions with receptors expressed on target cells. Moreover, to maximize efficiency and specificity, multiple types of ligands can be conjugated to the particle surface. To analyze the multi-ligand-receptor mediated adhesion process, we developed a stochastic model considering diverse biophysical parameters, including non-specific interactions, ligand-receptor specific interactions, kinetic affinity between ligand and receptor, hydrodynamic force and particle size. The results demonstrate that limited contact area restricts the probability of adhesion such that multiple ligand-receptor pairs do not always show enhanced adhesion characteristics. To optimize the effect of multiple ligand-receptor pairs, biophysical parameters must be considered.",

The steep exponential increase in the apparent binding rate near the equilibrium potential is explained, when the encounter frequency is construed as the likelihood of transfer events down or against the electrochemical potential gradient. The exponent of flux ratio, nf\u00a0=\u00a02.62, implies that the blockage of the internal blocker may be coupled with the outward transport of 2 to 3\u00a0K+ ions. The flux-coupled block in the single-file multi-ion pore can be demonstrated by the concentration gradient alone, as well as when the driving force is the electrochemical potential difference across the membrane.",

Decay of the radical is governed by pseudo-first order kinetics with small deviation in the case of GSH. H+ ions displayed second order inhibition of the reaction with all the studied compounds. The reaction of BUC exhibits zero order kinetics to the radical at lower acidities with a moderate acceleration of the reaction rate by H+ ions. A significant catalytic effect of Cu2\u00a0+ ions on the reactions with all the reductants was observed. The most sensitive to Cu2\u00a0+-catalysis was the reaction of BUC with the radical cation, while Cu2\u00a0+ ions showed much lower effect on the reaction with GSH. The presence of EDTA strongly inhibited the reactions and equalized the reaction rates for all the reductants. A Cu(I) selective chelator bathocuproine disulfonate reduced the reaction rate with Cys, but accelerated the reaction with BUC at the lower acidities.

By studying dynamic instability of MTs in a ROS free environment and comparing with that in the presence of ROS, we disclosed that MTs showed enhanced dynamics in the ROS free environment. All the parameters that define dynamic instability of MTs e.g., growth and shrinkage rates, rescue and catastrophe frequencies were significantly affected by the presence of ROS.

However, a modest increase in sarcomere length or radius led to a decrease in maximal force. Lowering the Ca2+ release rate caused a lower maximal force, but increasing the rate led to only modest gains in maximal force while incurring much greater ATP costs associated with reuptake. Greater parvalbumin binding rates decreased maximal force but enhanced relaxation, and this effect was magnified when Ca2+ uptake rates were lowered as may occur during fatigue. These results show a physiological set of parameters that lead to a functional sarcomere of known dimensions and contractile function, and the effects of parameter variation on muscle function.",

The PMFs calculated using steered molecular dynamics (SMD) were validated by umbrella sampling (US) in the strongly restrained regime. A series of restraint force constants ranging from 1000 down to 5 kJ/(mol nm2) were used in SMD simulations. This range was validated using US, however noting that weaker restraints give rise to a broader sampling of configurations. This comparison was further tested by a pulling simulation conducted without any restraints, which was observed to have a value closest to the experimentally measured free energy for binding of 4-BP to DHP based on ultraviolet\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) and resonance Raman spectroscopies. The protein-inhibitor system is well suited for fundamental study of free energy calculations because the DHP protein is relatively small and the inhibitor is quite rigid.

To understand the NA unwinding mechanism, here we study theoretically the unwinding dynamics of both the monomeric and hexameric helicases based on our proposed model. Various available single-molecule experimental data on unwinding speed of both the monomeric and hexameric helicases versus the external force applied to the ends of the NA duplex to unzip the duplex or versus the stability of the NA duplex are consistently and quantitatively explained. We provide quantitative explanations of the experimental data showing that while the unwinding speeds of some monomeric helicases are insensitively dependent on the external force they are sensitively dependent on the stability of the NA duplex. The experimental data showing that wild-type Rep translocates along ssDNA with a lower speed than Rep\u03942B (removal of the 2B subdomain of Rep) and that Rep\u03942B monomer can unwind DNA whereas the wild-type monomer is unable to unwind DNA are also quantitatively explained.

From the time resolved fluorescence anisotropy it has been observed that in the lower concentration region of GnHCl the sucrose induced stabilization is small as compared to the higher concentrations of GnHCl.

Our studies use CD spectroscopy and spectroscopically monitored heat denaturation.

We previously solved the crystal structure of the Thermus thermophilus enzyme and conducted a biophysical study to characterize the interaction between TrmI and tRNA. TrmI enzymes are active as a tetramer and up to two tRNAs can bind to TrmI simultaneously. In this paper, we present the structures of two TrmI mutants (D170A and Y78A). These residues are conserved in the active site of TrmIs and their mutations result in a dramatic alteration of TrmI activity. Both structures of TrmI mutants revealed the flexibility of the N-terminal domain that is probably important to bind tRNA. The structure of TrmI Y78A catalytic domain is unmodified regarding the binding of the SAM co-factor and the conformation of residues potentially interacting with the substrate adenine. This structure reinforces the previously proposed role of Y78, i.e. stabilize the conformation of the A58 ribose needed to hold the adenosine in the active site. The structure of the D170A mutant shows a flexible active site with one loop occupying in part the place of the co-factor and the second loop moving at the entrance to the active site.

They interact with bacterial membranes where they cause channel formation and membrane disruption. When added as a cocktail magainin 2 and PGLa are considerably more efficient when compared to the corresponding amounts of individual components. In order to investigate this synergistic interaction of PGLa and magainin a number of magainin variants have been prepared and investigated in biological and biophysical assays. In particular we report on the antimicrobial activities and solid-state NMR investigations of magainins that have been extended by a carboxyterminal GGC tripeptide to form covalently linked dimers. Notably, when the formation of the covalent linkage is prevented by exchanging the cystein by serine or alanine no loss in efficiency was observed indicating that the covalent interaction is not necessary for synergistic interaction. In a next step peptides labelled with 15N and 2H were reconstituted into oriented membranes and their topology studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The tendency of some of these peptides to adopt membrane-spanning alignments does not correlate with their synergistic activities in antimicrobial assays. In contrast, the stable alignment of PGLa parallel to the surface of membranes made of Escherichia coli lipid extracts is strongly suggestive that the peptides develop synergistic activities when in an in-planar configuration. Notably, the phospholipid head groups of these samples show a high degree of disturbance suggesting that the synergistic interactions between the magainin peptides could be mediated through the lipid phase.",

     "abstract": "Water-miscible cosolvents may stabilize or destabilize proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes or may exert no influence. The mode of action of a specific cosolvent is determined by the interplay between the excluded volume effect and direct solute\u2013cosolvent interactions. Excluded volume refers to the steric exclusion of water and cosolvent molecules from the space occupied by solute, an event accompanied by a decrease in translational entropy. In thermodynamic terms, the excluded volume effect is modeled by creating a cavity which is sufficiently large to accommodate the solute and which is inaccessible to surrounding molecules of water and cosolvent(s). An understanding of the relationship between the energetic contributions of cavity formation and direct solute\u2013cosolvent interactions is required for elucidating the molecular origins of the stabilizing or destabilizing influence of specific cosolvents. In this work, we employed the concepts of scaled particle theory to compute changes in free energy of cavity formation, \u2206\u2206GC, accompanying the ligand\u2013protein binding, protein dimerization, protein folding, and DNA duplex formation events. The computations were performed as a function of the concentration of methanol, urea, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycine betaine. Resulting data were used in conjunction with a previously developed statistical thermodynamic algorithm to estimate the excluded volume contribution to changes in preferential hydration, \u2206\u00a0\u039321, and interaction, \u2206\u00a0\u039323, parameters and m-values associated with the reactions under study. The excluded volume contributions to \u2206\u00a0\u039321, \u2206\u00a0\u039323, and m-values are very significant ranging from 30 to 70% correlating with the size of the cosolvent molecule. Our results suggest that a pair of \u201cfully excluded cosolvents\u201d with negligible solute\u2013solvent interactions may differ significantly with respect to their excluded volume contributions to \u2206\u00a0\u039321, \u2206\u00a0\u039323, and m-values thereby differently influencing the equilibrium of the reaction being sampled. This notion has implications for understanding the long-standing observation that, in osmotic stress studies, various osmolytes may produce significantly distinct estimates of hydration/dehydration for the same reaction.",

It has been hypothesized that the flow condition could induce a loop to \u03b2-sheet conformational change in the \u03b2-switch region of glycoprotein Ib\u03b1, which regulates it binding to the von Willebrand factor and facilitates the blood clot formation and wound healing. In this work, direct molecular dynamics (MD), flow MD and metadynamics, were employed to investigate the mechanisms of this flow induced conformational transition process. Specifically, the free energy landscape of the whole transition process was drawn by metadynamics with the path collective variable approach. The results reveal that without flow, the free energy landscape has two main basins, including a random loop basin stabilized by large conformational entropy and a partially folded \u03b2-sheet basin. The free energy barrier separating these two basins is relatively high and the \u03b2-switch could not fold from loop to \u03b2-sheet state spontaneously. The fully \u03b2-sheet conformations located in high free energy regions, which are also unstable and gradually unfold into partially folded \u03b2-sheet state with flow. Relatively weak flow could trigger some folding of the \u03b2-switch but could not fold it into fully \u03b2-sheet state. Under strong flow conditions, the \u03b2-switch could readily overcome the high free energy barrier and fold into fully \u03b2-sheet state.",

     "abstract": "The path to the discovery of the actoclampins began with efforts to define profilin's role in actin-based pathogen and endosome rocketing. That research identified a set of FPPPP-containing cargo proteins and FPPPP-binding proteins that are consistently stationed within the polymerization zone during episodes of active motility. The very same biophysical clues that forced us to abandon Brownian Ratchet models guided us to the Actoclampin Hypothesis, which asserts that every propulsive filament possesses a (+)-end-tracking motor that generates the forces cells need to crawl. Each actoclampin motor is a multi-arm oligomeric complex, employing one arm to recruit/deliver Profilin\u2022Actin\u2022ATP to a growth-site located at the (+)-end of the lagging subfilament, while a second arm maintains an affinity-modulated binding interaction with the extreme (+)-end of the other subfilament. The alternating actions of these arms define a true molecular motor, the processivity of which explains why propelling filaments maintain full possession of their cargo. The Actoclampin Hypothesis also suggests how the energetics of tracker interactions with the (+)-end determines whether a given actoclampin is a passive (low force-producing) or active (high force-producing) motor, the latter requiring the Gibbs free energy of ATP hydrolysis. Another aim of this review is to acknowledge an earlier notional model that emerged from efforts to comprehend profilin's pivotal role(s) in actin-based cell motility.",

The most common parameter employed to describe protein stability is the temperature of melting, at which the populations of folded and unfolded species are identical. This parameter may yield ambiguous results. It would always be preferable to measure the whole stability curve. The calculation of this curve is greatly facilitated whenever it is possible to observe cold denaturation. Using Yfh1, one of the few proteins whose cold denaturation occurs at neutral pH and low ionic strength, we could measure the variation of its full stability curve under several environmental conditions. Here we show the advantages of gauging stability as a function of external variables using stability curves.",

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry highlighted the importance of the presence of GM1 in recruiting monomeric A\u03b2 toward the lipid bilayer. Light and Small Angle X-ray Scattering revealed a different pattern for GM1 containing liposomes, both before and after interaction with A\u03b2.

It was found that for random initial conditions of the longitudinal conformational field the presence of the kink promotes the creation of phonons propagating along the chain axis. Moreover, the presence of forcing, describing the active role of RNA polymerase, determines in agreement to the experimental data a modulation of the velocity of the transcription bubble.

     "abstract": "Non-native aggregation is a common issue in a number of degenerative diseases and during manufacturing of protein-based therapeutics. There is a growing interest to monitor protein stability at intermediate to high protein concentrations, which are required for therapeutic dosing of subcutaneous injections. An understanding of the impact of protein structural changes and interactions on the protein aggregation mechanisms and resulting aggregate size and morphology may lead to improved strategies to reduce aggregation and solution viscosity. This report investigates non-native aggregation of a model protein, \u03b1-chymotrypsinogen, under accelerated conditions at elevated protein concentrations. Far-UV circular dichroism and Raman scattering show structural changes during aggregation. Size exclusion chromatography and laser light scattering are used to monitor the progression of aggregate growth and monomer loss. Monomer loss is concomitant with increased \u03b2-sheet structures as monomers are added to aggregates, which illustrate a transition from a native monomeric state to an aggregate state. Aggregates grow predominantly through monomer-addition, resulting in a semi-flexible polymer morphology. Analysis of aggregation growth kinetics shows that pH strongly affects the characteristic timescales for nucleation (\u03c4n) and growth (\u03c4g), while the initial protein concentration has only minor effects on \u03c4n or \u03c4g. Low-shear viscosity measurements follow a common scaling relationship between average aggregate molecular weight (Mwagg) and concentration (\u03c3), which is consistent with semi-dilute polymer-solution theory. The results establish a link between aggregate growth mechanisms, which couple Mwagg and \u03c3, to increases in solution viscosity even at these intermediate protein concentrations (less than 3\u00a0w/v %).",

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 90\u00b0 light scattering (RLS), thioflavine T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) binding studies demonstrated that both F (pH\u00a03.4) and E (pH\u00a01.8) isomers of human serum albumin (HSA) in the absence and presence of curcumin initially converted into amorphous aggregates. Interestingly, only the sample containing F isomer preincubated with curcumin formed fibrils on incubation for longer period. We also found that curcumin strongly bind to the F isomer, alter its secondary, tertiary structures and thermal stability. We conclude that the conversion of intermediate states into amorphous aggregate to fibrils is dictated by its conformation. This study provides unique insights into ligand-controlled HSA aggregation pathway and should provide a useful model system to study both amorphous and the fibrillar aggregation of multidomain proteins.",

We hypothesize that the electrostatic interaction between the positively charged amines of the cell-penetrating compounds and the negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) extending from cell surfaces is the initiating step in the internalization process. The interactions of generation 5 PAMAM dendrimer, Tat peptide and 25\u00a0kDa linear PEI with four different GAGs have been studied using isothermal titration calorimetry to elucidate structure\u2013function relationships that could lead to improved drug and gene delivery methods to a wide variety of cell types. Detailed thermodynamic analysis has determined that CPC-GAG binding constants range from 8.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103 to 2.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 and that affinity is dependent upon GAG charge density and stereochemistry and CPC molecular weight. The effect of GAG composition on affinity is likely due to hydrogen bonding between CPC amines and amides and GAG hydroxyl and amine groups. These results were compared to the association of CPCs with lipid vesicles of varying composition as model plasma membranes to finally clarify the relative importance of each cell surface component in initial cell recognition. CPC-lipid affinity increases with anionic lipid content, but GAG affinity is higher for all cell-penetrating compounds, confirming the role these heterogeneous polysaccharides play in cellular association and clustering.",

Pneumococcal surface antigen A (PsaA) is the primary Mn2+-recruiting protein of the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae and is essential for its in vivo colonization and virulence. The recently reported high-resolution structures of metal-free and metal-bound PsaA have provided the first insights into the mechanism of PsaA-facilitated metal binding. However, the conformational dynamics of metal-free PsaA in solution remain unknown. Here, we use continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the relative flexibility of the structural domains in metal-free PsaA and its distribution of conformations in solution. The results show that the crystal structure of metal-free PsaA is a good representation of the dominant conformation in solution, but the protein also samples structurally distinct conformations that are not captured by the crystal structure. Further, these results suggest that the metal binding site is both larger and more solvent exposed than indicated by the metal-free crystal structure. Collectively, this study provides atomic-resolution insight into the conformational dynamics of PsaA prior to metal binding and lays the groundwork for future EPR and MD based studies of PsaA in solution.",

Slow thermal-dissociation of CO transforms the NCO-state to native-state (N-state), where the native Fe2\u00a0+\u2013M80 bond recovers. To determine the role of crowding agents and salt ions on the structural-fluctuation of NCO, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for CO-dissociation from NCO (NCO\u00a0\u2192\u00a0N\u00a0+\u00a0CO) were measured at varying concentrations of crowding agents (dextran 70, dextran 40, ficoll 70) and salt ions (anion: ClO4\u2212, I\u2212, Br\u2212, NO3\u2212, Cl\u2212; cation: NH4+, K+, Na+).

     "abstract": "Directional growth caused by gravitropism and corresponding bending of plant cells has been explored since 19th century, however, many aspects of mechanisms underlying the perception of gravity at the molecular level are still not well known. Perception of gravity in root and shoot gravitropisms is usually attributed to gravisensitive cells, called statocytes, which exploit sedimentation of macroscopic and heavy organelles, amyloplasts, to sense the direction of gravity. Gravity stimulus is then transduced into distal elongation zone, which is several mm far from statocytes, where it causes stretching. It is suggested that gravity stimulus is conveyed by gradients in auxin flux. We propose a theoretical model that may explain how concentration gradients and/or stretching may indirectly affect the global orientation of cortical microtubules, attached to the cell membrane and induce their dynamic reorientation perpendicular to the gradients. In turn, oriented microtubule arrays direct the growth and orientation of cellulose microfibrils, forming part of the cell external skeleton and determine the shape of the cell. Reorientation of microtubules is also observed in reaction to light in phototropism and mechanical bending, thus suggesting universality of the proposed mechanism.",

Several protein markers of cancer stem cell were reported but none of those is fully reliable to grade the content of stem cells in a tumor. Hereby we propose Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy as an alternative, labelfree, non-damaging and fast method to identify glioma stem cells based on their own spectral characteristics. The analysis of FTIR data revealed that in NCH421k cells, a model of glioma stem cells, the relative content of lipids is higher than in their all-trans retinoic acid-differentiated counterparts. Moreover, it has been assessed that stem cells have more rigid cellular membranes and more phosphorylated proteins, whereas after differentiation glycogen level increases. The ability of FTIR to estimate the content of stem cells in a heterogeneous sample, on the base of the identified spectral markers, and to classify stem and non-stem cells into two separate populations was probed. Although it was not possible to calculate the exact percentage of each subpopulation, we could clearly see that with the increasing amount of differentiated cells in a sample, more hits occupy the PC space previously identified as a space of differentiated cells. The present study is therefore an initial step towards the development of a FTIR based protocol in clinical practice to estimate the content of stem cells in a tumor sample.",

The quantum and coulomb blockade effects of different thicknesses in the membrane have also been specifically investigated. It has been exhibited the quantum effects can appear in a small region of the free space within the membrane thickness due to the number and type of phospholipid layers. In addition, from the viewpoint of quantum effects by Heisenberg rule, it is shown the quantum tunneling is allowed in some micro positions while it is forbidden in other forms of membrane capacitor systems. Due to the dynamical behavior of the cell membrane, its capacitance is not fixed which results a variable capacitor. In presence of the external fields through protein trance membrane or ions, charges exert forces that can influence the state of the cell membrane.

To this purpose the exploitation of small molecules interacting with A\u03b2 aggregation represents one of the possible routes. Moreover, the use specific labeling has represented so far one of the most common and effective methods to investigate such a process.

This makes this class of molecules a popular candidate for biofuel cell and bioenergy applications insofar as they can be used as cargo to ship electrons to an electrode immersed in the cellular suspension. Nevertheless, such electron carriers are mostly selected empirically. This is why we report on a method involving fluorescence measurements to estimate the ability of seven different quinones to accept photosynthetic electrons downstream of photosystem II, the first protein complex in the light-dependent reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. To this aim we use a mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular green alga, impaired in electron downstream of photosystem II and assess the ability of quinones to restore electron flow by fluorescence. In this work, we defined and extracted a \u201cderivation parameter\u201d D that indicates the derivation efficiency of the exogenous quinones investigated. D then allows electing 2,6-dichlorobenzoquinone, 2,5-dichlorobenzoquinone and p-phenylbenzoquinone as good candidates. More particularly, our investigations suggested that other key parameters like the partition of quinones between different cellular compartments and their propensity to saturate these various compartments should also be taken into account in the process of selecting exogenous quinones for the purpose of deriving photoelectrons from intact algae.",

Replacement of the central G base by the I base resulted in a slight decrease in thermal stability. On the other hand, the stability of the G-quadruplex decreased to a significant extent when it was replaced with the A base. The optimized structure of the G-quadruplex, which was obtained by a molecular dynamic simulation, showed that the carbonyl group of the C5 position of the central G base could form hydrogen bonds with the G1 amine group at the C7 position on the upper G-quartet. This formation of a hydrogen bond contributes to the stability of the G-quadruplex. The spectral property of meso-tetrakis(N-methylpyridium-4yl)porphyrin (TMPyP) associated with the G-quadruplex was characterized by a moderate red shift and hypochromism in the absorption spectrum, a positive CD signal, and two emission maxima in the fluorescence emission spectrum, suggesting that TMPyP binds at the exterior of the G-quadruplex. Spectral properties were slightly altered when the G base at the central loop was replaced with A or I, while the fluorescence decay times of TMPyP associated with the G-quadruplex were identical. Observed spectral properties removes the possibility of intercalation binding mode for TMPyP. TMPyP binds at the exterior of the quadruplex. Whether it stacks on the central loop or binds at the side of the quadruplex is unclear at this stage.",

Previously we reported that MAP2c possesses chaperone-like activity while tau does not (Sarkar et al., 2004, Eur J Biochem., 271(8), 1488-96). Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation severely impaired the chaperone activity of MAP2c, implying a crucial role of chaperone in preventing tau fibrillation. Additionally, the ability of MAP2c to induce microtubule polymerization was abolished completely upon phosphorylation. As tau and MAP2c possess highly homologous C-termini, we speculated that the N-terminus of MAP2c might account for its chaperone activity. Nevertheless, experiments showed that N-terminus of MAP2c alone is inactive as a chaperone. Our preliminary findings suggest that MAP2c/MAP2 could be one of the regulators maintaining tau homeostasis in the cell.",

In immunological synapse, Kv1.3 plays a pivotal role in antigen dependent activation and proliferation of lymphocytes along with the KCa3.1. The up-regulation of Kv1.3 leads to several T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases, hence considered as an attractive pharmacological drug target. Here, we have employed molecular modeling, docking and simulation techniques to examine the dynamical properties of Kv1.3 in both open and closed state conformation embedded in DPPC membrane as well as its modes of inhibition against the popularly known scorpion venom OSK1 and its three mutant analogues. The Kv1.3 in open conformation took comparatively more time to get stabilized than the closed state. Both conformations ascertain their stability and the transition between closed to active states is more consistent with the paddle model of channel gating. The binding modes of channel\u2013toxin complexes are well established by identifying strongly interacting amino acids lining at their polar surfaces. Our findings suggest that, two mutant derivatives OSK1-K16,D20 & OSK1-P12,K16,D20 have increased inhibitory potency against Kv1.3. We also pointed out some particular residues responsible for binding of OSK1 with Kv1.3 over other Shaker-type ion channels.

These effects suggest a major role played by electrostatic forces in regulating multi-subunit enzyme assembly and function.

This study focuses on a unique mechanism of cytotoxicity, cell membrane destabilization, which is principally dependent on the nanoparticle nature of the material rather than on its molecular properties. We investigated the interactions of 2, 5, 10, and 40\u00a0nm gold NPs with supported lipid bilayer (SLB) of L-\u03b1-phosphatidylcholine using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Gold NPs were tested both in the absence of and in the presence of polymethacrylic acid (PMAA), used to simulate the natural organic matter (NOM) in the environment. In the absence of PMAA, for all NP sizes, we observed only small mass losses (1 to 6\u00a0ng) from the membrane. This small lipid removal may be a free energy lowering mechanism to relieve stresses induced by the adsorption of NPs, with the changes too small to affect the membrane integrity. In the presence of PMAA, we observed a net mass increase in the case of smaller NPs. We suggest that the increased adhesion between the NP and the bilayer, promoted by PMAA, causes sufficient NP adsorption on the bilayer to overcompensate for any loss of lipid. The most remarkable observation is the significant mass loss (60\u00a0ng) for the case of 40\u00a0nm NPs. We attribute this to the lipid bilayer engulfing the NP and leaving the crystal surface. We propose a simple phenomenological model to describe the competition between the particle-bilayer adhesion energy, the bilayer bending energy, and the interfacial energy at bilayer defect edges. The model shows that the larger NPs, which become more adhesive because of the polymer adsorption, are engulfed by the bilayer and leave the crystal surface, causing large mass loss and membrane disruption. The QCM-D measurements thus offer direct evidence that even if NPs are intrinsically not cytotoxic, they can become cytotoxic in the presence of environmental organic matter which modulates the adhesive interactions between the nanoparticle and the membrane.",

It is in particular shown for the first time that the folded fraction is the composition of a universal function which depends solely on the molecularity and a dimensionless function which is governed by the concrete thermodynamic regime but is independent of the molecularity. The results will prove useful for extracting the thermodynamic parameters from experimental data on the basis of regression analysis. As supporting information, open-source Matlab scripts for the computer implementation of the equations are provided.",

Here, we studied the internal Ba2+ block of the Kir2.1 channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes. We showed that the driving force and thus the K+ ion flux significantly influenced the apparent affinity of the block by internal Ba2+. Kinetic analysis revealed that the binding rate shifted with the driving force and changed steeply near the equilibrium point, either in the presence or absence of the transmembrane electrical field. The unbinding rate was determined by the intrinsic affinity of the site. Mutagenesis studies revealed that the high-affinity binding site for Ba2+ was located near T141 at the internal entrance of the selectivity filter. The steep change of the blocking affinity near the equilibrium potential may result from the flux-coupling effect in the single-file, multi-ion cytoplasmic pore.",

Here, 13C NMR is used to confirm our previous hypothesis, that cyanide directly affects glycolytic fluxes through reaction with carbonyl-containing compounds. Intracellularly, at least 3 cyanohydrins were identified. Extracellularly, all signals could be identified and lactonitrile was found to account for ~66% of total cyanide removal. Simulations of our updated computational model show that intracellular cyanide reactions increase the amplitude of oscillations and that cyanide addition lowers [ACA] instantaneously. We conclude that cyanide provides the following means of inducing global oscillations: a) by reducing [ACAx] relative to oscillation amplitude, b) by targeting multiple intracellular carbonyl compounds during fermentation, and c) by acting as a phase resetting stimulus.",

We find that reverse-engineering CYP5A1 to contain either threonine or serine in this position dramatically increases TXA2 formation.

Furthermore, spectral analysis using two PGH2 substrate analogs supports the observed activity changes in the hydroxyl-containing mutants.

The decay of the pump-induced ground-state bleaching occurs in a single step and is modulated by clearly visible oscillations. Global analysis of the two-dimensional differential transmission map shows that the excited state exponentially decays with a time constant of 375\u00a0fs, thus featuring a decay rate slower than those occurring in quite all the investigated T1 copper site proteins. The ultrashort pump pulse induces a vibrational coherence in the protein, which is mainly assigned to ground state activity, as expected in a system with fast excited state decay. Vibrational features are discussed also in comparison with the traditional resonance Raman spectrum of the enzyme. The results indicate that both excited state dynamics and vibrational modes associated with the T1 Cu laccase charge transfer have main characteristics similar to those of all the T1 copper site-containing proteins.

Significant variations may exist in the supramolecular organization of the commonly termed cross-\u03b2 structure that constitutes the amyloid core. In this context, a fine knowledge of the structural details in fibrils may give significant information on the assembly process and on possible ways of tuning or inhibiting it.

We also provide evidence that in the singly-ligated complex Rap1DBD binds quite differently to these sequences.

In order to better elucidate the fundamental interactions between PfAQP and its permeants and among the permeants, I conducted over three microseconds in silico experiments of atomistic models of the PfAQP\u2013membrane system to obtain the free-energy profiles of five permeants (erythritol, water, glycerol, urea, and ammonia) throughout the amphipathic conducting pore of PfAQP.

This leads to the possibility that erythritol, a sweetener generally considered safe, may inhibit or kill the malarial parasite in vivo without causing undesired side effects.

     "abstract": "Cyanine dyes are important chemical modifications of oligonucleotides exhibiting intensive and stable fluorescence at visible light wavelengths. When Cy3 or Cy5 dye is attached to 5\u2032 end of a DNA duplex, the dye stacks on the terminal base pair and stabilizes the duplex. Using optical melting experiments, we have determined thermodynamic parameters that can predict the effects of the dyes on duplex stability quantitatively (\u0394G\u00b0, Tm). Both Cy dyes enhance duplex formation by 1.2\u00a0kcal/mol on average, however, this Gibbs energy contribution is sequence-dependent. If the Cy5 is attached to a pyrimidine nucleotide of pyrimidine\u2013purine base pair, the stabilization is larger compared to the attachment to a purine nucleotide. This is likely due to increased stacking interactions of the dye to the purine of the complementary strand. Dangling (unpaired) nucleotides at duplex terminus are also known to enhance duplex stability. Stabilization originated from the Cy dyes is significantly larger than the stabilization due to the presence of dangling nucleotides. If both the dangling base and Cy3 are present, their thermodynamic contributions are approximately additive. New thermodynamic parameters improve predictions of duplex folding, which will help design oligonucleotide sequences for biophysical, biological, engineering, and nanotechnology applications.",

EPR spectra of a spin-label lipid allowed the identification of two well-resolved spectral components at temperatures below and above the main phase transition of the lipid bilayer. Terpenes caused only slight mobility increases in each of these spectral components; however, they substantially increased the population of the more mobile component. In addition, the terpenes reduced the temperature of the main phase transition by more than 8 \u00b0C and caused the extraction of the spin-labeled lipid. Nerolidol, which had the highest octanol\u2013water partition coefficient, generated the highest amount of spin label extraction. Acting as spacers, terpenes should cause major reorganization in cell membranes, leading to an increase in the overall molecular dynamics of the membrane. At higher concentrations, terpenes may cause lipid extraction and thus leakage of the cytoplasmic content.",

Herein, we replace the canonical CD-loop residues in rat \u03b1-PV with their rat \u03b2-PV counterparts. Although the mutations have a generally modest impact on affinity, E59D confers Ca2\u00a0+-specificity on the CD site, in the presence or absence of the other mutations. Despite their minimal impact on \u0394G, several CD-loop mutations markedly alter \u0394H, evidently by perturbing the apo-protein conformation. The L85F mutation was also examined. In wild-type rat \u03b1, L85F increases EF-site Ca2\u00a0+ affinity. In the CD-loop variants, the mutation leaves the \u0394G for Ca2\u00a0+-binding largely unaffected.

It is found that the stabilization effect increases with increasing polyol concentration with a comparable trend for all of the tested polyols. However, the stabilization effect at a given polyol concentration is polyol specific. In particular, the stabilization effect increases as a function of polyol size until a plateau is reached above a critical polyol size corresponding to six carbon atoms.

Here we use Random Matrix Theory to analyze a series of short-time molecular dynamics experiments which are specifically designed to be simulations with high cosine content. We use as a model system the protein apoCox17, a mitochondrial copper chaperone. Spectral analysis on correlation matrices allows to easily differentiate random correlations, simply deriving from the finite length of the process, from non-random signals reflecting the intrinsic system properties.

Using all-atom molecular dynamics with explicit water molecules, we examine the response of FF monomers to the application of a constant external electric field over a range of intensities. We probe the aggregation mechanism of FF peptides, and find that the presence of even relatively weak fields can accelerate ordered aggregation, primarily by facilitating the alignment of individual molecular dipole moments. This is modulated by the conformational response of individual FF peptides (e.g., backbone stretching) and by the cooperative alignment of neighboring FF and water molecules. These observations may facilitate future studies on the controlled formation of nanostructured aggregates of piezoelectric peptides and the understanding of their electro-mechanical properties.",

In this work the effect of GdmCl on hydrophobic interactions has been studied by observing how the denaturant influences model systems of phenyl and alkyl hydrophobic contact pairs. Contact pair formation is monitored through the use of fluorescence spectroscopy, i.e., measuring the intrinsic phenol fluorescence being quenched by carboxylate ions. Hydrophobic interactions are isolated from other interactions through a previously developed methodology.

Interaction between MT and lipid vesicles was monitored by fluorescence and the drug promotes only minor changes in the surface of the vesicles.

     "abstract": "As compounds are optimized for greater potency during pharmaceutical discovery, their aqueous solubility often decreases, making them less viable as orally-administered drugs. To investigate whether potency and insolubility share a common origin, we examined the structural and thermodynamic properties of telaprevir, a sparingly soluble inhibitor of hepatitis C virus protease. Comparison of the hydrogen bond motifs in crystalline telaprevir with those present in the protease\u2013telaprevir complex revealed striking similarities. Additionally, the thermodynamics of telaprevir dissolution closely resembles those of protein\u2013ligand dissociation. Together, these findings point to a common origin of potency and insolubility rooted in particular amide\u2013amide hydrogen bond patterns. The insolubility of telaprevir is shown by computational analysis to be caused by interactions in the crystal, not unfavorable hydrophobic hydration. Accordingly, competing out the particular amide\u2013amide hydrogen bond motifs in crystalline telaprevir with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid yielded a co-crystalline solid with excellent aqueous dissolution and oral absorption. The analysis suggests a generalizable approach for identifying drug candidate compounds that either can or cannot be rendered orally bioavailable by alteration of their crystalline solid phases, in an approach that provides a pragmatic way to attain substantial enhancements in the success rate of drug discovery and development.",

Handling of natural blood in in vitro investigations of CMOs is quite complex and time-consuming. Since the conventional blood analog fluids (e.g. water/glycerol) lack a substance with an affinity to capture oxygen comparable to hemoglobin's affinity, in this study a novel approach using modified sulfite solution is proposed to address this challenge. The solution comprises sodium sulfite as a component, simulating the role of hemoglobin in blood oxygenation. This approach is validated by OTR (oxygen transfer rate) measured using native porcine blood, in two types of commercially available CMOs. Consequently, the number of complicated natural blood investigations in the evolution procedure of newly developed oxygenators would considerably decrease. Moreover, the reassessing of failed devices, in clinics, would be performed more precisely using a modified sulfite solution than simple water/glycerol testing.",

The energy associated with this parameter has been calculated for a hypothetical isoenergetic photosystem, photosystem I and photosystem II, and comes out in the range of 3.5 - 8% of the photon energy considering 680\u00a0nm. 2.

Many of the cellular pathologies of HGPS are thought to be a consequence of protein\u2013membrane association mediated by the retained farnesyl group. To better characterize the protein\u2013membrane interface, we quantified binding of purified recombinant \u220650LA tail domain (\u220650LA-TD) to tethered bilayer membranes composed of phosphatidylserine and phosphocholine using surface plasmon resonance. Farnesylated \u220650LA-TD binds to the membrane interface only in the presence of Ca2\u00a0+ or Mg2\u00a0+ at physiological ionic strength. At extremely low ionic strength, both the farnesylated and non-farnesylated forms of \u220650LA-TD bind to the membrane surface in amounts that exceed those expected for a densely packed protein monolayer. Interestingly, the wild-type LA-TD with no farnesylation also associates with membranes at low ionic strength but forms only a single layer. We suggest that electrostatic interactions are mediated by charge clusters with a net positive charge that we calculate on the surface of the LA-TDs. These studies suggest that the accumulation of \u220650LA at the inner nuclear membrane observed in cells is due to a combination of aggregation and membrane association rather than simple membrane binding; electrostatics plays an important role in mediating this association.",

We designed a dsDNA with various lengths of single-stranded overhang and determined the flexibility of the single-stranded segment by measuring the FRET value.

This technique can be applied to interpret volumetric data, obtained, for example, in studies of proteins in aqueous solution. In particular, it allows replacing qualitatively and descriptively introduced properties by strictly defined quantities, such as the thermal volume, by the boundary voids. The extension and the temperature behavior of the boundary region, its structure and composition are discussed in detail, using the example of a molecular dynamics model of an aqueous solution of the human amyloid polypeptide, hIAPP.

According to ESR measurements, the kinetic rate constant (2kd) of the bimolecular self-reaction of \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radicals in micelles and in human plasma was calculated to be of the order of 105\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. This value was obtained considering that the reactive radicals are confined into the micellar pseudophase and is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the value we found in homogeneous phase. The physiological significance of this high value is discussed considering the competition between bimolecular self-reaction and the \u03b1-tocopheroxyl radical recycling by ascorbate.",

The central metal ions were vanadium and zinc. At a [porphyrin]/[G-quadruplex] ratio of less than one, the absorption and CD spectra were unaffected by the mixing ratio for all three porphyrins, suggesting that the binding mode is homogeneous. Relatively small changes in the absorption spectrum when forming the complexes with the G-quadruplex, the positive CD signal, and the large accessibility of the I\u2212 quencher, suggested that all these porphyrins are not intercalated between the G-quartet. Stabilization of the G-quadruplex by ZnTMPyP was most effective. The effect of VOTMPyP on G-quadruplex stabilization was moderate, whereas TMPyP slightly destabilized G-quadruplex.

Although there is some experimental evidence suggesting that sorption occurs through hydrophobic interactions, there is not a complete understanding of this association. Therefore, we sought to more extensively characterize binding between humic acid (HA), a major component of DOM, with E2 and E3 using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Our results indicate that binding between these estrogens and HA occurs primarily at the aromatic ring, and takes place even at relatively low HA concentration. Specific interactions between E2 and HA were confirmed by assessing binding via ELISA assay, and the effect of binding on estrogenic activity was studied via a yeast bioassay. Together, these studies build upon previously theorized interactions, yielding a more comprehensive model of binding between estrogens and HA, as well as demonstrate the value of the confluence of biochemical assay methods with analytical NMR techniques.",

TTR dimer is an important intermediate that is hard to be observed from the biological experiments. To date, the molecular origin and the structural motifs for TTR dimer dissociation, as well as the unfolding process have not been rationalized at atomic resolution. To this end, we have investigated the effect of low pH and mutation L55P on stability as well as the unfolding pathway of TTR dimer using constant pH molecular dynamics simulations. The result shows that acidic environment results in loose TTR dimer structure. Mutation L55P causes the disruption of strand D and makes the CE-loop very flexible. In acidic conditions, dimeric L55P mutant exhibits notable conformation changes and an evident trend to separate. Our work shows that the movements of strand C and the loops nearby are the beginning of the unfolding process. In addition, hydrogen bond network at the interface of the two monomers plays a part in stabilizing TTR dimer. The dynamic investigation on TTR dimer provides important insights into the structure\u2013function relationships of TTR, and rationalizes the structural origin for the tendency of unfolding and changes of structure that occur upon introduction of mutation and pH along the TTR dimer dissociation and unfolding process.",

The results show that in the GB\u2013urea mixture, GB acts as a stronger osmolyte and urea becomes a weaker denaturing agent. This is reflected by an increase in the exclusion of GB from the peptide surface and a decrease in interactions between the peptide and urea. The cause of this synergistic behaviour includes direct interactions between GB and urea through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions between them and strengthening of hydrogen bonding network of water in the GB\u2013urea mixture.

Chem., 186, 2014, 13-21) and the current interest in binding mechanisms emerging from observed sampling of distinct conformations in protein domains, as well as from the field of intrinsically disordered proteins, we here describe a kinetic method that, at least in some cases, unequivocally distinguishes induced fit from conformational selection. The method relies on measuring the observed rate constant \u03bb for binding and varying both the protein and the ligand in separate experiments. Whereas induced fit always yields a hyperbolic dependence of increasing \u03bb values, the conformational selection mechanism gives rise to distinct kinetics when the ligand and protein (displaying the conformational change) concentration is varied in separate experiments.

     "abstract": "Despite their presence in many aspects of biology, the study of membrane proteins lags behind that of their soluble counterparts. Improving structural analysis of membrane proteins is essential. Deep-UV resonance Raman (DUVRR) spectroscopy is an emerging technique in this area and has demonstrated sensitivity to subtle structural transitions and changes in protein environment. The pH low insertion peptide (pHLIP) has three distinct structural states: disordered in an aqueous environment, partially folded and associated with a lipid membrane, and inserted into a lipid bilayer as a transmembrane helix. While the soluble and membrane-inserted forms are well characterized, the partially folded membrane-associated state has not yet been clearly described. The amide I mode, known to be sensitive to protein environment, is the same in spectra of membrane-associated and membrane-inserted pHLIP, indicating comparable levels of backbone dehydration. The amide S mode, sensitive to helical structure, indicates less helical character in the membrane-associated form compared to the membrane-inserted state, consistent with previous findings. However, the structurally sensitive amide III region is very similar in both membrane-associated and membrane-inserted pHLIP, suggesting that the membrane-associated form has a large amount of ordered structure. Where before the membrane-associated state was thought to contain mostly unordered structure and reside in a predominantly aqueous environment, we have shown that it contains a significant amount of ordered structure and rests deeper within the lipid membrane.",

Fluorescent intercalator displacement assay implied the displacement ability of the complexes with thiazole orange. In addition, circular dichroism spectra of both quadruplex forms converge to the Na+ isoform after binding to the porphyrazines.

     "abstract": "Simultaneous flipped-out conformation of two neighboring bases on opposite strands of DNAs has been observed in several X-ray structures. It has also been detected for two cytosines on opposite strands in different contexts of CpG sites. In this paper, we study by MD simulations the dual base flipping of the two cytosines in hemi-methylated CpG site. We calculate the potential of mean force of flipping-out the unmethylated cytosine in three model systems. The first is for DNA bound to the regulatory protein UHRF1. In this case, the methyl-cytosine on the complementary strand is flipped-out into the binding pocket of the SRA domain of the protein. The other two systems are for unbound DNAs in which the methyl-cytosine is either intra-helical or extra-helical. We find that when the methyl-cytosine is flipped-out it is easier to flip-out the other (unmethylated) cytosine on the opposite strand by about 14\u201316\u00a0kJ/mol. This lower penalty for dual-base flipping is observed for both the bound and unbound states of the DNA. Analyses of the hydrogen bond network and stacking interactions within the CpG site indicate that the lower penalty is due to stabilization of the dual-base flipped-out conformation via interactions involving the orphan guanines. The results presented in this paper suggest that the extra-helical conformation of the methyl-cytosine recognized by UHRF1 can facilitate the base-flipping process of the target cytosine to be methylated by Dnmt1.",

Cells finely tune the torsional state of their genomes to strike a balance between stability and accessibility. For example, while mesophilic life forms maintain negatively superhelical genomes, thermophilic life forms use unique mechanisms to maintain relaxed or even positively supercoiled genomes. Here, we use a single-molecule magnetic tweezers approach to quantify the force-dependent equilibrium between DNA melting and supercoiling at high temperatures populated by Thermophiles. We show that negatively supercoiled DNA denatures at 0.5 pN lower tension at thermophilic vs. mesophilic temperatures. This work demonstrates the ability to monitor DNA supercoiling at high temperature and opens the possibility to perform magnetic tweezers assays on thermophilic systems. The data allow for an estimation of the relative energies of base-pairing and DNA bending as a function of temperature and support speculation as to different general mechanisms of DNA opening in different environments. Lastly, our results imply that average in vivo DNA tensions range between 0.3 and 1.1 pN.",

Conversely, due to the rapid energy transfer among pigments, each photosystem is ergodic and the configurational entropy is positive. This decreases the free energy of the single photosystem pigment array by a small amount. On the other hand, the suspension of photosystems is non-ergodic and the configurational entropy approaches zero. The overall configurational entropy which, in principle, includes contributions from both the single excited photosystems and the suspension which contains excited photosystems, also approaches zero.

Several structural and dynamical parameters of DMPC bilayers with varying amounts of cholesterol (0, 25, and 50\u00a0mol%) in the presence and absence of drug molecules were calculated. Moreover, the free energy barriers for translocation of one 5-FU molecule from water to the lipid bilayer were determined by using the potential of mean force (PMF). PMF studies indicated that the location of the maximum free energy barrier was in the hydrophobic middle region of bilayer, while the minimums of the barrier were located at the hydrophilic part of bilayer at the interface with water. The minimum and maximum of the free energy profiles were independent of cholesterol concentration and suggested that the drug molecules 5-FU were accumulated in the vicinity of the polar head group of lipid bilayers. Moreover, the results showed that with increasing cholesterol concentration in the bilayer, the free energy barrier for translocation of 5-FU across the bilayer also increases which can be attributed to the condensing effect of the cholesterol on the bilayer.",

     "publication date": "02-2014",
     "abstract": "The binding of ligands and substrates to proteins has been extensively studied for many years and can be described, in its simplest form, by two limiting mechanisms: conformational selection and induced fit. Conformational selection involves the binding of ligand to a pre-existing sparsely-populated conformation of the free protein that is the same as that in the final protein\u2013ligand complex. In the case of induced fit, the ligand binds to the major conformation of the free protein and only subsequent to binding undergoes a conformational change to the final protein\u2013ligand complex. While these two mechanisms can be dissected and distinguished by transient kinetic measurements, direct direction, characterization and visualization of transient, sparsely-populated states of proteins are experimentally challenging. Unless trapped, sparsely-populated states are generally invisible to conventional structural and biophysical techniques, including crystallography and most NMR measurements. In this review we summarize some recent developments in the use of paramagnetic relaxation enhancement to directly study sparsely-populated states of proteins and illustrate the application of this approach to two proteins, maltose binding protein and calmodulin, both of which undergo large rigid body conformational rearrangements upon ligand binding from an open apo state to a closed ligand-bound holo state. We show that the apo state ensemble comprises a small population of partially-closed configurations that are similar but not identical to that of the holo state. These results highlight the complementarity and interplay of induced fit and conformational selection and suggest that the existence of partially-closed states in the absence of ligand facilitates the transition to the closed ligand-bound state.",

     "abstract": "Two competing and mutually exclusive mechanisms of ligand recognition \u2013 conformational selection and induced fit \u2013 have dominated our interpretation of ligand binding in biological macromolecules for almost six decades. Conformational selection posits the pre-existence of multiple conformations of the macromolecule from which the ligand selects the optimal one. Induced fit, on the other hand, postulates the existence of conformational rearrangements of the original conformation into an optimal one that are induced by binding of the ligand. In the former case, conformational transitions precede the binding event; in the latter, conformational changes follow the binding step. Kineticists have used a facile criterion to distinguish between the two mechanisms based on the dependence of the rate of relaxation to equilibrium, kobs, on the ligand concentration, [L]. A value of kobs decreasing hyperbolically with [L] has been seen as diagnostic of conformational selection, while a value of kobs increasing hyperbolically with [L] has been considered diagnostic of induced fit. However, this simple conclusion is only valid under the rather unrealistic assumption of conformational transitions being much slower than binding and dissociation events. In general, induced fit only produces values of kobs that increase with [L] but conformational selection is more versatile and is associated with values of kobs that increase with, decrease with or are independent of [L]. The richer repertoire of kinetic properties of conformational selection applies to kinetic mechanisms with single or multiple saturable relaxations and explains the behavior of nearly all experimental systems reported in the literature thus far. Conformational selection is always sufficient and often necessary to account for the relaxation kinetics of ligand binding to a biological macromolecule and is therefore an essential component of any binding mechanism. On the other hand, induced fit is never necessary and only sufficient in a few cases. Therefore, the long assumed importance and preponderance of induced fit as a mechanism of ligand binding should be reconsidered.",

This view generalizes conformational selection and makes it applicable also to other allosteric events, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs) and photon absorption. Similar to binding, at each step along a propagation pathway, conformational selection is coupled with induced fit which optimizes the interactions. Thus, as in binding, the allosteric effects induced by PTMs and light relate not only to population shift; but to conformational selection as well. Conformational selection and population shift take place conjointly.",

     "abstract": "The proper understanding of biomolecular recognition mechanisms that take place in a drug target is of paramount importance to improve the efficiency of drug discovery and development. The intrinsic dynamic character of proteins has a strong influence on biomolecular recognition mechanisms and models such as conformational selection have been widely used to account for this dynamic association process. However, conformational changes occurring in the receptor prior and upon association with other molecules are diverse and not obvious to predict when only a few structures of the receptor are available. In view of the prominent role of protein flexibility in ligand binding and its implications for drug discovery, it is of great interest to identify receptor conformations that play a major role in biomolecular recognition before starting rational drug design efforts. In this review, we discuss a number of recent advances in computer-aided drug discovery techniques that have been proposed to incorporate receptor flexibility into structure-based drug design. The allowance for receptor flexibility provided by computational techniques such as molecular dynamics simulations or enhanced sampling techniques helps to improve the accuracy of methods used to estimate binding affinities and, thus, such methods can contribute to the discovery of novel drug leads.",

These reactions were chosen as model enzymatic processes occurring in different in vitro crowded media. The systems crowding has been built by introducing Dextran of several concentrations and sizes. Our results indicate that the volume occupied by the crowding agent, but not its size, plays an important role on the initial velocity of reactions involving tiny enzymes. However, the enzyme size is another important factor influencing the velocity of the reactions of large enzymes occurring in Dextran crowded media. In this situation, the reaction initial velocity depends on both occupied volume and dimension of the crowding agent that is present in the reaction media.",

This assay is based on a DNA quadruplex, GGGTGGGTGGGTGGG (G3T), which in the presence of specific cations possesses unusually high thermal stability. QPA employs truncated G3T sequences as primers, which upon polymerase elongation, self-dissociate from the binding site and allow the next round of priming without thermal unfolding of amplicons. The rate of amplification strongly depends on the thermal stability of the primer/primer binding site (PBS) complex and to date QPA has been demonstrated to work over a narrow temperature range. To expand the capabilities of QPA, in the present study, we studied the fold and thermodynamic properties of the wild-type G3T and variants containing sequence modifications or extensions at the 5\u2032-end. Circular dichroism studies demonstrate that the substitution of thymidines by other nucleotides or GC addition at the 5\u2032-end does not change the parallel fold of G3T. Thermal unfolding experiments revealed that purine bases incorporated at loop positions and 5\u2032-end dinucleotide extension significantly destabilize the quadruplex, while loop pyrimidines have almost no effect.

Complementary FTIR- and CD-spectra were measured in a wide concentration range and repeated heating and cooling cycles revealed the thermal stability of formed \u03b2-sheets. The shortest glutamine sequence K2Q10K2 shows solely random structure for concentrations up to 10\u00a0mg/ml. By increasing the peptide length to K2Q20K2, a significant fraction of \u03b2-sheet is observed even at low concentrations of 0.01\u00a0mg/ml. The higher the concentration, the more the structural composition is dominated by the intermolecular \u03b2-sheet. The formation of highly thermostable \u03b2-sheet is much more pronounced in K2Q30K2. K2Q30K2 precipitates at a concentration of 0.3\u00a0mg/ml. Our spectroscopic study shows that the aggregation tendency is enhanced with increased glutamine repeat expansion and that the concentration plays another critical factor in the \u03b2-sheet formation.",

It is mainly due to protein misfolding and aggregation resulting from the enhanced peroxidase activity of SOD1 mutants. In this study, we have carried out a 20\u00a0ns molecular dynamics simulation for wild type (WT), H43R and W32F mutated SOD1's dimer and compared their structure and conformational properties by extracting several quantitative properties from the trajectory to understand the pathology of fALS disease. Our results show considerable differences in H43R compared to WT and W32F mutated SOD1, such as increasing distances between the critical residues results in open conformation at the active site, strong fluctuations in the important loops (Zinc and electrostatic loops) and weakening of important hydrogen bonds especially between N (His 43/Arg 43) and carbonyl oxygen (His 120) in agreement with the experimental report. The calculated buried surface area of dimer interface for WT, H43R and W32F are 682, 726 and 657\u00a0\u00c52 respectively, representing the loss of dimerization in H43R. Essential dynamics reveal that overall motions of WT and W32F are mainly involved in three to four eigenvectors, but in H43R the overall motions are mainly in the first eigenvector. These data thus provide a unifying description for the structural destabilization, enhanced peroxidase activity, loss of dismutation activity and increase in aggregation propensity in the pathology of fALS diseases.",

For proteins that must unfold in order to aggregate, disruption of native disulfides may therefore promote aggregation. This study characterizes differences in the aggregation process for wild-type (WT) \u03b1-chymostrypsinogen A (aCgn) and the same molecule with one of its native disulfides (C191-C220) reduced to free thiols (aCgnSH) at acidic pH, where WT aCgn forms semi-flexible amyloid polymers. Loss of the disulfide leads to no discernable differences in folded monomer secondary or tertiary structure based on circular dichroism (CD) or intrinsic fluorescence (FL), and causes a small decrease in the free energy change upon unfolding. After unfolding-mediated aggregation, the resulting amyloid morphology and structure are similar or indistinguishable for aCgn and aCgnSH by CD, FL, ThT binding, multi-angle laser light scattering, and transmission electron microscopy. Aggregates of aCgn and aCgnSH are also able to cross-seed with monomers of the other species. However, aggregates of aCgnSH are more resistive than aCgn aggregates to urea-mediated dissociation, suggesting some degree of structural differences in the aggregated species that was not resolvable in detail without higher resolution methods. Mechanistic analyses of aggregation kinetics indicate that the initiation or nucleation of new aggregates from aCgnSH involves a mono-molecular rate limiting step, possibly the unfolding step. In contrast, that for aCgn involves an oligomeric intermediate, suggesting native disulfide linkages help to hinder non-native protein aggregation by providing conformational barriers to key nucleation event(s).",

SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of size-exclusion chromatography eluted fractions indicated the presence of both monomeric and dimeric populations of TLL. The stability of the enzyme upon thermal and guanidine hydrochloride treatment was examined by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectroscopy. Small angle x-ray scattering and ion mobility mass spectrometry analysis revealed that TLL is found as a mixture of monomers and dimers at the assayed concentrations. Although previous x-ray diffraction data showed TLL as a dimer in the crystal (PDB: 1DT3), to our knowledge our report is the first evidencing that TLL co-exists as stable dimeric and monomeric forms in solution.",

Free energy methods are used to quantify the thermodynamics of drug movement between water and octanol as well as for permeation across a POPC membrane. Both drugs are shown to favourably partition into the lipid bilayer from water and are likely to accumulate just inside the lipid headgroups where they may alter bilayer properties or interact with target proteins. Phenytoin experiences a large barrier to cross the centre of the bilayer due to less favourable energetic interactions in this less dense region of the bilayer. Remarkably, in our simulations both drugs are able to pull water into the bilayer, creating water chains that extend back to bulk, and which may modify the local bilayer properties. We find that the choice of atomic partial charges can have a significant impact on the quantitative results, meaning that careful validation of parameters for new drugs, such as performed here, should be performed prior to their use in biomolecular simulations.",

Recently, a single-molecule assay based on alternating laser excitation has been established for the quantitative detection of transcription factors. These proteins specifically recognize and bind DNA and play an important role in controlling gene expression. We implemented this assay format on a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope to detect transcription factors with immobilized single-molecule DNA biosensors. We quantify transcription factors via colocalization of the two halves of their binding site with immobilized single molecules of a two-color DNA biosensor. We could detect a model transcription factor, the bacterial lactose repressor, at different concentrations down to 150\u00a0pM. We found that robust modeling of stoichiometry derived TIRF data is achieved with Student's t-distributions and nonlinear least-squares estimation with weights equal to the inverse of the expected number of bin entries. This significantly improved transcription factor concentration estimates with respect to distribution modeling with Gaussians without adding notable computational effort. The proposed model may enhance the precision of other single-molecule assays quantifying molecular distributions.

Constant pH replica exchange simulations showed that a percentage of TMAO is indeed protonated, thus contributing to the stability of the tertiary but not the secondary structure of PreQ1. TMAOP results in an unfavorable dehydration of phosphodiester backbone, which is compensated by electrostatic attraction between TMAOP and the phosphate groups. In addition, TMAOP interacts with specific sites in the tertiary RNA structure, mimicking the behavior of positively charged ions and of the PreQ1 ligand in stabilizing RNA. Finally, we predict that TMAO-induced stabilization of RNA tertiary structures should be strongly pH dependent.",

     "abstract": "A negative second virial coefficient has long been a predictor of potential protein crystallization and salting out. However, the assumption that this is due to attractive solute\u2013solute interactions remains a source of debate. Here we reexamine the second virial coefficient from protein osmometry in terms of the free-solvent model. The free-solvent model has been shown to provide excellent predictions of the osmotic pressure of concentrated and crowded environments for aqueous protein solutions in moderate ionic strengths. The free-solvent model relies on two critical parameters, hydration and ion binding, both which can be determined independently of osmotic pressure data. Herein, the free-solvent model is mathematically represented as a virial expansion model and the second virial coefficient is expressed in terms of solute\u2013solvent interactions, namely hydration and ion binding. Hydration and ion binding values are then used to estimate the second virial coefficient at various protein concentrations for three model proteins ovalbumin (OVA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and hen egg lysozyme (HEL) in various monovalent salt aqueous solutions. The results show that the conditions for obtaining a negative second virial coefficient emerge when the ionic strength of the influenced region of the protein is higher than that of the bulk. This analysis suggests a plausible explanation as to why proteins are more favorable for salting out or crystallization when the solution is represented by a negative second virial coefficient.",

However, the dielectric polarization from Gauss's law differs from that obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. To mimic the dielectric polarization surrounding a solute in molecular dynamics simulations, the first-shell water molecule was modeled using a charge distribution of TIP4P molecule in a hard sphere. The dielectric polarization of the first-shell water was modeled as a pair of surface charge layers with a fixed distance between them, but with variable, equal, and opposite charge magnitudes that respond to the electric field on the first-shell water. The water outside the first shell water is treated as a bulk solvent, and the electric effect of the bulk solvent can be modeled as a surface charge. Based on this strategy, the analytical solution describing the solvation free energy of ions was derived, and the values of computed solvation free energy were compared to the values of experiments.",

     "abstract": "The role of counterion condensation as a dominant force governing the stability of DNA duplexes and triplexes is well established. In contrast, the effect of counterion condensation on the stability of G-quadrupex conformations is poorly understood. Unlike other ordered nucleic acid structures, G-quadruplexes exhibit a specific binding of counterions (typically, Na+ or K+) which are buried inside the central cavity and coordinated to the O6 carbonyls of the guanines forming the G-quartets. While it has been known that the G-quadruplex-to-coil transition temperature, TM, increases with an increase in the concentration of the stabilizing ion, the contributions of the specific (coordination in the central cavity) and nonspecific (condensation) ion binding have not been resolved. In this work, we separate the two contributions by studying the change in TM of preformed G-quadruplexes following the addition of nonstabilizing ions Li+, Cs+, and TMA+ (tetramethylammonium). In our studies, we used two G-quadruplexes formed by the human telomeric sequences which are distinct with respect to the folding topology and the identity and the number of sequestered stabilizing ions. Our data suggest that the predominant ionic contribution to G-quadruplex stability comes from the specifically bound Na+ or K+ ions and not from counterion condensation. We offer molecular rationalizations to the observed insensitivity of G-quadruplex stability to counterion condensation and emphasize the need to expand such studies to assess the generality of our findings.",

These molecules have also been shown to have significant effects on the stability of proteins. Perhaps one of the most studied osmolytes is Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). Thermodynamic studies of the effects of TMAO on proteins have shown that this molecule is a strong stabilizer of the protein folded state, thus being able to counteract the effects of protein denaturants such as urea and guanidine hydrochloride. Most studies of TMAO effects on bio-molecular stability have until now been focused on how the osmolyte reduces the solubility of polypeptide backbones, while the effects of TMAO on hydrophobic interactions are still not well understood. In fact, there are few experimental data measuring the effect of TMAO on hydrophobic interactions. This work studies phenyl and alkyl contact pairs as model hydrophobic contact pairs. The formation of these contact pairs is monitored using fluorescence, i.e., through the quenching of phenol fluorescence by carboxylate ions; and a methodology is developed to isolate hydrophobic contributions from other interactions. The data demonstrate that the addition of TMAO to the aqueous solvent destabilizes hydrophobic contact pairs formed between alkyl and phenyl moieties. In other words, TMAO acts as a \u201cdenaturant\u201d for hydrophobic interactions.",

We report here the effects of sharply reducing both aromatic and hydrophobic character within the peptide's central hydrophobic core on its free and surface behavior. In such an altered peptide, complete surface adsorption is found to induce, rather than prevent, the adsorbed peptide's collapse. The weakened surface interactions of the central hydrophobic core allow its greater translational mobility on the surface, thereby facilitating interactions that lead to compaction. Both the adsorption and the subsequent collapse are accompanied by a loss of surface hydration in the modified peptide. We further find that such a two-step dewetting leads to hydration levels comparable to that obtained after compaction of the free peptide. These insights may be leveraged for designing molecular surfaces for disrupting intrinsic A\u03b2 behavior.",

Neutrophils acquire distinct cellular states necessary to fulfill these functions each associated with a particular phenotype. The cells constituting the neutrophil population are presumably not synchronized with respect to their actual state, e.g. due to maturity or preactivation. It is also likely that they exhibit a different degree of phenotypic plasticity (that is, the ability to switch to a particular state). Calcium is known to play a crucial role in neutrophils such as for cell motility. The present study focuses on characterizing the cell-to-cell variability at the morphological as well as at the level of calcium dynamics by studying single primary human neutrophils. We apply long-term multivariate live cell imaging to (i) characterize neutrophil phenotypes of different functional states, (ii) analyze the distribution of cells being in these states and, (iii) study the individual intracellular calcium response simultaneously with shape changes. We are able to differentiate the five distinct subpopulations of neutrophils based on quantitative parameters of cell morphology and motility. As a major result, we demonstrate that the calcium dynamics of individual cells correlates with their respective functional state. Finally, we see a number of cells that undergo spontaneous phenotypic changes from one cellular state to another. These events are preceded either by exhibiting the calcium dynamics of the future state or by switching to the respective calcium dynamics in parallel to switching the morphology. Based on our results we conclude that specific calcium dynamics carries crucial information for the function and phenotype of neutrophils.",

Fluorescence kinetics measurements indicated that 30\u00a0min after dispersion in seawater QDs lost the 60% of the initial emission intensity, possibly due to the occurrence of aggregation processes. However, the presence of algae seemed to mitigate this effect. By using confocal microscopy, we highlighted the presence of QDs adsorbed on the surface of both algae, but not inside the cells. The toxicity of QDs was evaluated in terms of inhibition of growth rate, oxidative stress, and lipid peroxidation. QDs in the range of 1\u20132.5\u00a0nM gradually inhibited the growth rate of P. tricornutum and increased the oxidative stress, as evinced by the increase in lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activity of two main antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase). On the contrary, QDs did not inhibit the growth rate of D. tertiolecta, at most a modest stimulation was observed in the range of 0.5\u20132\u00a0nM, suggesting a hormetic response.

The difference in the unfolding volume between F29A and wild type azurin was smaller than the volume of the space theoretically created in the mutant, indicating that the cavity is, at least partially, filled with water molecules. The complex temperature dependence of the unfolding volume, for temperatures up to 20\u00a0\u00b0C, suggests the formation of an expanded form of the protein and highlights how the packing efficiency of azurin appears to contribute to the magnitude of internal void volume at any given temperature. Changes in flexibility of the protein matrix around the chromophore were monitored by the intrinsic phosphorescence lifetime. At 40\u00a0\u00b0C the application of pressure in the predenaturation range initially decreases the internal flexibility of azurin, the trend eventually reverting on approaching unfolding. The main difference between wild type and the cavity mutant is the inversion point which happens at 300\u00a0MPa for wild type and at 150\u00a0MPa for F29A. This suggests that, for the cavity mutant, pressure-induced internal hydration is more dominant than any compaction of the globular fold at relatively low pressures.",

Oxygenic photosynthesis takes place in thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts and photosynthetic prokaryote cyanobacteria. An ancestral photoautotrophic prokaryote related to cyanobacteria has been proposed to give rise to chloroplasts of plants and algae through an endosymbiotic event. Indeed, photosynthetic complexes involved in the electron transport coupled to H+ translocation and ATP synthesis are similar in higher plants and cyanobacteria. Furthermore, some of the protein and solute/ion conducting machineries also share common structure and function. Electrophysiological and biochemical evidence support the existence of ion channels in the thylakoid membrane in both types of organisms. By allowing specific ion fluxes across thylakoid membranes, ion channels have been hypothesized to either directly or indirectly regulate photosynthesis, by modulating the proton motive force. Recent molecular identification of some of the thylakoid-located channels allowed to obtain genetic proof in favor of such hypothesis. Furthermore, some ion channels of the envelope membrane in chloroplasts have also been shown to impact on this light-driven process.

With respect to others, the techniques based on vibrational spectroscopy present a clear advantage: the molecular composition and the modification of subcellular compartments can be obtained in label-free conditions. In fact, from the evolution of positions, intensities and line widths of Raman and infrared bands in the cell spectra, characteristic information on cellular activities can be achieved, and particularly, cellular death can be investigated. In this work we present the time evolution of the Raman spectra of single live Jurkat cells (T-lymphocyte) by looking at the high frequency part of their Raman spectra, that is the CH stretching region, around 3000\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01. In particular, investigation into the composition or rearrangement of CH bounds, markers of cellular membrane fatty acids, can represent an important method to study and to recognize cell death. The experimental procedure we used, together with the analysis of these high frequency vibrational bands, may represent a new, improved and advantageous approach to this kind of study.",

Among different possibilities, which are currently under investigation, there is the exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and biodiesel in particular. Some algae species have the ability of accumulating large amount of lipids within their cells which can be exploited as feedstock for the production of biodiesel. Strong research efforts are however still needed to fulfill this potential and optimize cultivation systems and biomass harvesting.Light provides the energy supporting algae growth and available radiation must be exploited with the highest possible efficiency to optimize productivity and make microalgae large scale cultivation energetically and economically sustainable. Investigation of the molecular bases influencing light use efficiency is thus seminal for the success of this biotechnology.

The data here reported highlight that the Arno River was an important source of both DOC and CDOM for this coastal area. CDOM optical properties suggested that terrestrial DOM did not undergo simple dilution at the river mouth but, other physical\u2013chemical and biological processes were probably at work to change its molecular characteristics. This observation was further supported by the \u201cpotential\u201d enzymatic activity of \u03b2-glucosidase (BG) and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP).

The analysis is carried out by comparing among themselves different Zn+\u00a02-ligand force fields and studying their influence on metal coordination and long-range peptide folding. The system in the non-physiological so-called \u201cgas phase\u201d (no solvent) was also simulated with the purpose of identifying to what extent, if at all, the solvent can affect the Zn coordination mode, besides its long-range structural properties. There are two main results of this investigation. The first is that the Zn+\u00a02 coordination mode in classical molecular dynamics simulations markedly depends on the partial charge attributed to the ion and the atoms surrounding it. Comparing with experiments, it is possible to identify the most appropriate Zn+\u00a02 force field for the Zn+\u00a02\u2013A\u03b21\u201316 complex in study. Secondly, although the presence of water naturally influences the peptide folding propensity, it does not affect the structure of the Zn+\u00a02 inner coordination shell. A useful way to validate classical results and in particular those referring to the structural differences visible when different force fields are employed, was to use a hybrid QM/MM optimization step. When the classical system configurations are submitted to such a quantum minimization step, the geometries of the resulting Zn+\u00a02 site turn out to be all very similar and structurally in good agreement with what is experimentally known.",

GABAARs belonging to the Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels have been identified as key targets for many clinical drugs, and the motions that govern the gating mechanism are still not well understood. In this study, an open-state GABAAR was constructed using the structure of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl), which has a high sequence identity to GABAAR. A closed-state model was constructed using the structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). Molecular dynamics simulations of the open-state and closed-state GABAAR were performed. We calculated the electrostatic potential of the two conformations, the pore radius of the two ion channels and the root-mean-square fluctuation. We observed the presence of two positively charged girdles around the ion channel and found flexible regions in the GABAAR. Then, the free-energy of chloride ion permeations through the closed-state and open-state GABAAR has been estimated using adaptive biasing force (ABF) simulation. For the closed-state GABAAR, we observed two major energy barriers for chloride ion translocation in the transmembrane domain (TMD). For the open-state GABAAR, there was only one energy barrier formed by two Thr261 (\u03b11), two Thr255 (\u03b22) and one Thr271 (\u03b32). By using ABF simulation, the overall free-energy profile is obtained for Cl\u2212 transporting through GABAAR, which gives a complete map of the ion channel of Cl\u2212 permeation.",

     "abstract": "The role and importance of the conformation of antimicrobial peptides for their binding and incorporation into lipid membranes as well as for their bioactivity are still not well understood. In this paper, we studied the interaction between four cationic alpha-helical KLA peptides, which differ primarily in their helical propensity, and the anionic gel-state lipid DPPG (1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol). Of particular interest was the influence of the peptide conformation and membrane surface properties on the electrostatic binding process. Dynamic light scattering (DSL) showed that generally the KLA peptides possess high aggregation power but modest solubilization power. Circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD) spectra revealed that the KLA peptides with the low helical propensity tend to form beta-structures at low lipid/peptide ratios. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms showed that the helical KLA peptides stabilize the DPPG bilayer, whereas the beta-structured peptides induce pronounced membrane perturbations. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) isotherms showed that the helical KLA peptides bind more efficiently to DPPG vesicles than the beta-structured KLA peptides, and that the binding affinity of the peptides is proportional to the peptide helical propensity and membrane negative surface charge. The stoichiometry values (N) deduced from the ITC isotherms suggest that the helical KLA peptides have a higher capacity to translocate the DPPG lipid bilayer. The new data presented in this study demonstrate the flexibility of KLA peptides in adopting various conformations in response to the surrounding and also how the peptide structuring controls the mode of peptide\u2013membrane interaction.",

However, some important issues concerning the molecular mechanism of the tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation catalyzed by EF-G.GTP or by EF-G.GDPNP remain controversial. For example, can EF-G.GTP selectively bind to the hybrid pretranslocation state or bind to both the non-rotated pretranslocation and the hybrid pretranslocation states? Does the greater potency of EF-G in the presence of GTP rather than GDPNP in facilitating translocation derive from the effects on transition from the classical non-rotated to hybrid state (the first step of the translocation) or on transition from the hybrid to posttranslocation state (the second step)? Here, based on our proposed model, we study theoretically the dynamics of the tRNA\u2013mRNA translocation through the ribosome catalyzed by EF-G.GTP and by EF-G.GDPNP. By comparing our theoretical results with the available experimental data, we show that EF-G.GTP can also bind to the classical non-rotated pretranslocation state and the greater potency of GTP hydrolysis in facilitating translocation of tRNA\u2013mRNA complex derives from its effects on the second step of the translocation process.",

It has been shown that CasSD can be stretched to promote phosphorylation, the mechanism of which needs to be explored in detail. Thus, it is important to uncover the native structure(s) of CasSD and the structural changes associated with mechanical stretching, both of which are still unclear. Here, we used atomic force microscopy force mode and magnetic tweezers to stretch individual molecules of CasSD constructs. Our results showed that the CasSD domain was intrinsically disordered. Natively, CasSD domains took many conformations beside random coils, while most of these conformations possessed limited mechanical stability. In magnetic tweezers experiments, the intramolecular interactions stabilizing the varied native conformations of CasSD were found similar in strength. Such diversity in native conformations of CasSD domains, as discovered here, should play important role in their signaling functions and their limited strength should be relevant to the mechanical activation of those signaling pathways.",

     "abstract": "RNA oligonucleotides exhibit a large tendency to bend and form a loop conformation which is a major motif contributing to their complex three-dimensional structure. This is in contrast to DNA molecules that predominantly form the double-helix structure. In this paper we investigate by molecular dynamics simulation, as well as, by its combination with the replica-exchange method, the propensity of RNA chains containing the GCUAA pentaloop to form spontaneously a hairpin conformation. The results were then compared with those of analogous hybrid oligonucleotides in which the ribose groups in the loop-region were substituted by deoxyriboses. We find that the RNA oligomers exhibit a marginal excess stability to form loop structures. The equilibrium constant for opening the loop to an extended conformation is twice as large in the hybrid than it is in the RNA chain. Analyses of the hydrogen bonds indicate that the excess stability for forming a hairpin is a result of hydrogen bonds the 2\u2032-hydroxyls in the loop region form with other groups in the loop. Of these hydrogen bonds, the most important is the hydrogen bond donated from the 2\u2032-OH at the first position of the loop to N7 of adenine at the forth position. RNA and DNA backbones are characterized by different backbone dihedral angles and sugar puckering that can potentially facilitate or hamper the hydrogen bonds involving the 2\u2032-OH. Nevertheless, the sugar puckerings of all the pentaloop nucleotides were not significantly different between the two chains displaying the C3\u2032-endo conformation characteristic to the A-form double helix. All of the other backbone dihedrals also did not show any considerable difference in the loop-region except of the \u03b4-dihedral. In this case, the RNA loop exhibited bimodal distributions corresponding to, both, the RNA and DNA backbones, whereas the loop of the hybrid chain behaved mostly as that of a DNA backbone. Thus, it is possible that the behavior of the \u03b4-dihedrals in the loop-region of the RNA adopts conformations that facilitate the intra-nucleotide hydrogen bondings of the 2\u2032-hydroxyls, and consequently renders loop structures in RNA more stable.",

Using the primary sequence analysis, we show that both C23Os have only 30% identity and 48% similarity but contain conserved amino acid residues forming an active site area around the iron ion. The corresponding differences in homology, but structural similarity in active area residues, appear to provide completely different responses to heating the two enzymes. We confirm this by small angle X-ray scattering and demonstrate that the overall structure of C23O from P. putida is slightly different from its crystalline form whereas the solution scattering of C23O from S. acidocaldarius at temperatures between 4 and 85\u00a0\u00b0C ideally fits the calculated scattering from the single crystal structure. The thermostability of C23O from S. acidocaldarius correlates well with conformation in solution during thermal treatment.

     "abstract": "The BclXL apoptotic repressor bears the propensity to associate into megadalton oligomers in solution, particularly under acidic pH. Herein, using various biophysical methods, we analyze the effect of temperature on the oligomerization of BclXL. Our data show that BclXL undergoes irreversible aggregation and assembles into highly-ordered rope-like homogeneous fibrils with length in the order of mm and a diameter in the \u03bcm-range under elevated temperatures. Remarkably, the formation of such fibrils correlates with the decay of a largely \u03b1-helical fold into a predominantly \u03b2-sheet architecture of BclXL in a manner akin to the formation of amyloid fibrils. Further interrogation reveals that while BclXL fibrils formed under elevated temperatures show no observable affinity toward BH3 ligands, they appear to be optimally primed for insertion into cardiolipin bicelles. This salient observation strongly argues that BclXL fibrils likely represent an on-pathway intermediate for insertion into mitochondrial outer membrane during the onset of apoptosis. Collectively, our study sheds light on the propensity of BclXL to form amyloid-like fibrils with important consequences on its mechanism of action in gauging the apoptotic fate of cells in health and disease.",

     "abstract": "Lysozyme adsorption on carboxyl-terminated self-assembled monolayers under external electric fields has been studied by all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Lysozyme adsorption on negatively charged surfaces could generally be enhanced by positive electric fields and retarded by negative ones. Under positive electric fields, electrostatic interactions between protein and surface are strengthened; however, the interaction energy descends with field strength increases probably due to the co-adsorption of counterions onto the surface to neutralize surface charge. Comparison of orientation distributions of lysozyme adsorption on the surface in the presence and in the absence of electric fields reveals that an applied electric field could narrow the distribution and therefore helps to immobilize protein on surface with uniform orientation. Orientation angle analysis shows that lysozyme is adsorbed on the surface with \u201cbottom end-on\u201d, \u201cside-on\u201d, \u201cback-on\u201d or \u201ctop end-on\u201d orientation under different field strengths, suggesting the possibility of controlling the preferred orientation of lysozyme on surface by applying electric fields. Conformation analysis of protein implies that the structure deformation of adsorbed lysozyme does not increase monotonically with the rising field strength. Under some field strengths, there is no additional structure deformation caused by the electric fields compared with that in the absence of electric fields; while under some other field strengths, there are larger conformational change occurrences. We propose that due to the rearrangement of positions of the local atomic charges of protein to couple its dipole with an external electric field, large position alterations of atoms might be avoided and thus conformational changes be restricted. This work may provide guidance for controlling protein adsorption behaviors via external electric fields for applications of protein immobilization and anti-fouling surfaces.",

The early cycles before midblastula transition lack significant inhibitory Cdk1 phosphorylations and are driven by periodic accumulation of Cyclin B before M phase and its degradation by APC/C at the end of M phase. Both experiments and mathematical modelling suggest that while Cdk1:CycB phosphorylation activates APC/C, it inhibits its co-activator Cdc20 (Fizzy). These interactions create an amplified negative-feedback loop which is at the heart of all cell cycle oscillations. Recent experiments find that the APC/C inhibitor, Emi2/XErp1 is essential for large amplitude and short period Cyclin B oscillations during early divisions in the intact Xenopus embryo. This finding is counter-intuitive since larger amplitudes should come with slower cycle times. We explain this paradox by analysing the amplified negative feedback model extended with APC/C inhibition by Emi2. We show that Emi2 interferes with the intrinsic time-delay in APC/C activation and inactivation to increase the amplitude as well as shorten the period of Cyclin B oscillation.",

The key observation is that tetrapeptide-conjugates of cationic porphyrins with two or three positive charges bind to encapsidated DNA in T7 phage nucleoprotein complex. The binding modes were analyzed by fluorescent energy transfer, fluorescent life time and CD measurements. Intercalative binding is most feasible when tricationic ligands complex with DNA, especially when it is in close connection with protein capsid. It was found that larger ligand BMPCP-4P2 binds externally to encapsidated T7 DNA, and complex externally as well as by intercalation when the DNA accommodate to relaxed B-conformation. In the case of TMPCP and TMPCP-4P the intercalation is the predominant binding form both in nucleoprotein (NP) and preheated complexes.

We explored an impact of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the moderate effector of multilateral action, on the kinetic (functional) and thermodynamic (thermal unfolding) patterns of a hydrolytic enzyme, \u03b1-chymotrypsin (\u03b1-CT), over a wide range of additive concentrations, 0\u201370% (v/v). Both the calorimetric and kinetic data exhibited rich behavior pointing to the complex interplay of global/local stability (and flexibility) patterns. The complex action of DMSO is explained through the negative and positive preferential solvation motifs that prevail for the extreme opposite, native-like and unfolded states, respectively, implying essential stabilization of compact domains by enhancement of interfacial water networks and destabilization of a flexible active site by direct binding of DMSO to the unoccupied specific positions intended for elongated polypeptide substrates.",

     "abstract": "Absorption and fluorescence properties of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) monomers and aggregates in various model systems are presented in this study. The absorption and fluorescence maxima, and fluorescence lifetimes of Pchlide monomers were not dependent on liposome composition. Fluorescence quenching experiments using KI and SASLs as fluorescence quenchers, revealed that Pchlide molecules entered a lipid bilayer and were localized close to the polar lipid headgroup area. The process of Pchlide aggregation was evident for high (i.e. at least 9\u00a0mol%) Pchlide content in liposomes prepared from galactolipids. To our knowledge, this is the first study of Pchlide aggregation in membrane-mimicking model systems. The aggregates showed absorption maxima at 480 and 650\u00a0nm. Fluorescence of the aggregates measured for excitation at 480\u00a0nm had a maximum at 656\u00a0nm and was characterized with two fluorescence lifetime components, i.e. 0.1 and 1\u20132\u00a0ns. Pchlide aggregates observed in the buffer had similar position of absorption and fluorescence bands to those observed in liposomes, although the overall fluorescence intensity was considerably lower. Some differences in the relative intensity of Soret absorption bands were observed. These results showed that the presence of liposomes decreased the efficiency of the process of Pchlide aggregation. Water bound at the interface region of AOT/isooctane/water reversed micelles induced disaggregation of the Pchlide aggregates indicating that Pchlide aggregates are buried into hydrophilic core of micelles. The results are discussed with respect to the role of lipids in Pchlide aggregation found in plant etioplasts and their significance for light-induced Pchlide photoreduction.",

We assigned the amide bands for different conformations of PLL in water. At low pH values PLL mainly possesses the PII and \u03b2 structures while at higher pH values and low temperatures characteristic bands for the \u03b1-helical conformation are found. The increase in temperature induces the formation of \u03b2 structures. The obtained assignment of the infrared bands for various conformations was used to determine the conformational populations of PLL in non-aqueous solvents. In TFE, PLL possesses an \u03b1-helix structure that is after heating partially transformed into the PII conformation. DMSO enables a uniform \u03b1-helical conformation of PLL. A similar uniform conformation (PII, 88%) was found for PLL dissolved in ethylene glycol, suggesting that the PII structure is not limited to the presence of water molecules or charged side chains. The role of intermolecular interactions between the solvent molecules and PLL in stabilizing the PII conformation is discussed.",

Of particular interest is the observation that while chemical denaturation of PR domain results in the formation of a significant amount of polyproline II (PPII) helices, it has little or negligible effect on its overall size as measured by its hydrodynamic radius. Our data also show that the PR domain displays a highly dynamic conformational basin in agreement with the knowledge that the intrinsically unstructured proteins rapidly interconvert between an ensemble of conformations.

Experiments have shown the strong inhibition of the HA hydrolysis catalyzed by HAase when performed at high HA over HAase concentration ratio and low ionic strength. The substrate-dependence thus shows a non-classic inhibition of HAase at high substrate concentrations due to the sequestration of HAase by HA in the electrostatic complex. The modeling of the HA/HAase system is characteristic of a reaction\u2013complexation coupling and it is very difficult to study reaction or binding, separately. Here, we have established the equation controlling the global system and shown that the substrate-dependence of such a system is a direct combination of a pure Michaelis\u2013Menten equation associated with the reaction and a hyperbolic curve associated with the binding. At low substrate concentrations, the hyperbola, representing the relative part of HAase not sequestered by HA, can be assimilated to a straight line.

     "abstract": "The Gibbs energy of reaction (\u0394Rg) is the key quantity in the thermodynamic characterization of biological reactions. Its calculation requires precise standard Gibbs energy of reaction (\u0394Rg+) values. The value of \u0394Rg+ is usually determined by measuring the apparent (concentration-dependent) equilibrium constants K, e.g., the molality-based Km. However, the thermodynamically consistent determination of \u0394Rg+ requires the thermodynamic (activity-based) equilibrium constant Ka. These values (Km and Ka) are equal only if the ratio of the activity coefficients of the reactants to the activity coefficients of the products (K\u03b3) is equal to unity.In this work, the impact of K\u03b3 on the estimation of Ka for biological reactions was investigated using methyl ferulate (MF) hydrolysis as a model reaction. The value of K\u03b3 was experimentally determined from Km values that were measured at different reactant concentrations. Moreover, K\u03b3 was independently predicted using the thermodynamic model ePC-SAFT. Both the experimentally determined and the predicted K\u03b3 values indicate that this value cannot be assumed to be unity in the considered reaction. In fact, in the reaction conditions considered in this work, K\u03b3 was shown to be in the range of 3\u00a0<\u00a0K\u03b3\u00a0<\u00a06 for different reactant molalities (2\u00a0<\u00a0mmol MF kg\u2212\u00a01\u00a0<\u00a010). The inclusion of K\u03b3 and thus the use of the thermodynamically correct Ka value instead of Km lead to remarkable differences (almost 40%) in the determination of \u0394Rg+. Moreover, the new value for \u0394Rg+ increases the concentration window at which the reaction can thermodynamically occur.The influence of additives was also investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Both procedures consistently indicated that the addition of NaCl (0 to 1\u00a0mol\u00a0kg\u2212\u00a01 water) moderately decreased the value of K\u03b3, which means that the values of Km increase and that a higher amount of products is obtained as a result of the addition of salt. Additionally, Km was found to strongly depend on pH. A ten-fold increase in the Km values was observed in the pH range of 6 to 7; this increase corresponds to a change of more than 100% in the value of \u0394Rg+.",

(I27SS)8 contains eight tandem repeats of identical immunoglobulin-like modules with one disulfide bond in each module. Single (I27SS)8 molecules are stretched at constant force applied by a cantilever in a force-clamp mode of atomic force microscopy (FC-AFM). Disulfide reduction events are accurately detected from stepwise increases in the end-to-end length of (I27SS)8. Earlier FC-AFM studies observed one disulfide reduction pathway used by hTrx and suggested an additional electron tunneling mechanism. Here, a very large set of unbiased FC-AFM data is collected in a range of clamping forces. By analyzing the data using exponential fits and dwell time histograms two disulfide reduction pathways used by hTrx are resolved. Based on previous studies one of these pathways is attributed to force-dependent Michaelis\u2013Menten catalysis. The latter reduction pathway is weakly force-inhibited and occurs sporadically. Bimolecular nucleophilic substitutions (SN2) and electron tunneling (ET) mechanisms are discussed to explain the second pathway.

From these molecular dynamic simulations, we observed how the thermodynamic barrier associated with benzocaine insertion into the lipid bilayers diminished exponentially as the fraction of DPPS in the bilayer increased, especially when the ionic strength of the aqueous solution increased.

Our work has focused on dissecting the energetics associated with these events and quantitatively correlating the results with function. A recent finding is that different receptors dimerize with large differences in energetics. For example, estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER-\u03b1) dimerizes with a \u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a012.0\u00a0kcal/mol under conditions in which the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) dimerizes with a \u0394G\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u2212\u00a05.1\u00a0kcal/mol. To determine the molecular forces responsible for such differences, we created a GR/ER chimera, replacing the hormone-binding domain (HBD) of GR with that of ER-\u03b1. Cellular and biophysical analyses demonstrate that the chimera is functionally active. However, GR/ER dimerization energetics are intermediate between the parent proteins and coupled to a strong ionic linkage. Since the ER-\u03b1 HBD is the primary contributor to dimerization, we suggest that GR residues constrain an ion-regulated HBD assembly reaction.",

Z-DNA can be induced in long genomic DNA by Z-DNA binding proteins through the formation of two B\u2013Z junctions with the extrusion of one base pair from each junction. We performed NMR experiments on complexes of Z\u03b1ADAR1 with three DNA duplexes at a variety of protein-to-DNA molar ratios. This study confirmed that the Z\u03b1ADAR1 first binds to an 8-bp CG-rich DNA segment via a unique conformation during B\u2013Z transition and the neighboring AT-rich region becomes destabilized. We also found that, when DNA duplexes have only 6-bp CG-rich segment, the interaction with Z\u03b1ADAR1 did not affect the thermal stabilities of the 6-bp CG-rich segment as well as the neighboring two A\u00b7T base pairs. These results indicate that four Z\u03b1ADAR1 proteins interact with the 8-bp DNA sequence containing a 6-bp CG-repeat segment as well as a dinucleotide step, even though the dinucleotid step contains A\u2219T base pairs. Thus this study suggests that the length of the CG-rich region is more important than the specific DNA sequence for determining which base-pair is extruded from the B\u2013Z junction structure.

Aggregation rates were strongly influenced by conformational stability of at least the Fab regions, but were only weakly affected by changes in electrostatic colloidal interactions. This was in contrast to the effects of electrostatic interactions on aggregate growth, as the dominant growth mechanism shifted dramatically with pH and [NaCl]. Pre-formed aggregates also displayed a reversible cloud-point boundary that quantitatively aligned with the overall pattern of aggregation mechanisms as a function of pH and [NaCl], suggesting an underlying thermodynamic transition may dictate whether molecular aggregates will coalesce into macroscopic particles. Structural changes upon unfolding and aggregation were also sensitive to pH and [NaCl]. Interestingly, Thioflavin T binding was essentially indistinguishable for aggregates formed in different pH and [NaCl] conditions, however, the other assays indicated notable differences across different solvent conditions. This suggests that the overall degree of conformational change during aggregation can be influenced by electrostatic interactions, but suggests caution in interpreting whether available techniques detect changes that are directly relevant to the mechanism(s) of aggregate formation and growth.",

StL refolds more efficiently than TlL from gastric pH in bile salts, regaining activity when refolding from pH as low as 1.8 and above while TlL cannot go below pH 2.6. StL also unfolds 10\u201340 fold more slowly in the denaturant guanidinium chloride and the anionic surfactant SDS. We ascribe StL's superior performance to general alterations in its electrostatic potential which makes it more acid-resistant. These superior properties make StL a good candidate for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.",

     "abstract": "Glycolytic oscillations in yeast have been extensively studied. It is still unclear, if these oscillations are caused by the allosteric enzyme phosphofructokinase or the stoichiometry of glycolysis which contains an autocatalysis with respect to ATP. Bacterial glycolysis shows a different stoichiometry, however, also containing a stoichiometric autocatalysis. For Escherichia coli, the regulation of the enzyme phosphofructokinase is also assumed to be a major reason for oscillations to occur. We investigated glycolytic oscillations in a quantitative kinetic model for Streptococcus pyogenes set-up on the basis of experimental data. We found oscillations within physiologically feasible parameter ranges. We investigated the origin of these oscillations and conclude that, again, both the stoichiometry of the system, as well as its allosterically regulated enzymes can give rise to these oscillations. For the analysis we employed established and new optimization methods for finding oscillatory regimes and present these in the context of this study.",

     "abstract": "We previously developed a method, known as quadruplex priming amplification (QPA), which permits isothermal amplification of DNA. The assay is based on a DNA quadruplex formed by the GGGTGGGTGGGTGGG (G3T) sequence. G3T has three unique properties that are fundamental for QPA; (i) G3T forms a quadruplex with significantly more favorable thermodynamics than the corresponding DNA duplexes; (ii) removal of guanines at the 3\u2032-end inhibits quadruplex formation; and (iii) incorporated fluorescent nucleotides, such as 2-aminopurine (2AP) or 6-methylisoxanthopterin (6MI), which are quenched by neighboring nucleotides, regain maximum emission upon quadruplex formation. New model studies carried out here with primers missing one, two and three guanines reveal that the driving force for QPA comes from the difference in thermal stability between the primer/template and the product complexes. Primers missing one and two guanines are able to self-dissociate from the template upon elongation, whereas QPA is not observed when the primer lacks three 3\u2032-nucleotides. QPA reaches its maximum rate at temperatures slightly higher than the Tm of the primer/template complex and is more efficient in the presence of only dGTP. QPA-based assays also revealed that Taq is able to incorporate thymidines opposite template 2AP, while no significant incorporation was observed opposite template 6MI.",

Our results show strong interaction between sarcosine and urea molecules. Addition of sarcosine enhanced the urea\u2013water structure and urea\u2013water lifetime indicated an increase in the solvation of urea. These findings suggest that sarcosine indirectly stabilizes protein by enhancing water\u2013water structure thus decreasing the hydrophobic effect and counteracts the effect of urea by increasing the solvation of urea and directly interacting with it leaving urea less available to interact with protein.",

Binding of the PPIase activity inhibitors to the FKBP domain suppressed the conformational freedom of the remote IF domain. A single side-chain mutation in the active site strongly reduced the rate of substrate turnover and changed the conformational dynamics of all amino acids involved in catalysis. This dynamic interplay between substrate-binding domain and PPIase domain determines the high catalytic activity of SlyD and inhibitor-binding modulates the backbone plasticity required for enzyme activity.",

In particular, a 2008 experiment produced its crystal structure at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, which is in a tetrameric conformation consisting of four protomers. Each protomer forms an amphipathic pore that is fit for water permeation. The tetramer has a pore along its quasi-symmetry axis formed by quadruplets of hydrophobic residues (every protomer contributes equally to the quadruplets). A lipid, phosphatidylserine (PS6), is bound to AQP5 in the central pore, totally occluding it. A 2009 experiment showed that AQP5 facilitates not only permeation of water but also permeation of hydrophobic gas molecules across the cell membrane. In this article, we present an in silico study of AQP5 to elucidate the effects of PS6's binding to and dissociating from AQP5's central pore. Computing the lipid's chemical-potential along its dissociation path, we find that PS6 inhibits the function of the central pore with an IC50 in the micromolar range. Examining the central pore and the interstices between two adjacent protomers, we propose that nonpolar gas molecules (O2) permeate through AQP5's hydrophobic central pore when un-occluded.",

     "abstract": "ABC transporters are involved in countless processes from lipid excretion over cellular detoxification to multidrug resistance of cancer cells. The latter is especially conferred by the ABCC subfamily also called multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) that excrete a variety of amphipathics including anticancer drugs by ATP-dependent transport. As the mechanisms of substrate translocation and ATP hydrolysis are still unclear for MRPs, we investigated the kinetics of both processes with focus on cooperativity and coupling between ATPase activity and substrate transport using purified MRP3 in proteoliposomes. Although the ATP-dependent uptake of amphipathics and the hydrophilic 5(6)-carboxy-2\u2032-7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein (CDCF) into the lumen of proteoliposomes showed affinity constants similar to those reported for cell-based assays, the maximal uptake rates were up to 250 times higher. Moreover, all substrates showed cooperative interactions of two subunits. Upon stimulation with amphipathics, ATPase activity of MRP3 increased from 80\u00a0nmol/(mg\u00a0min) to 180\u00a0nmol/(mg\u00a0min) showing positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient of 2. While Hill coefficient and maximal ATPase activity were found to be substrate independent, the affinity constants are characteristic for a given substrate and correspond to the value for transport. Therefore, cooperative interactions of the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) in MRP3 are mediated by substrate binding to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). In contrast to amphipathic substrates, CDCF did not stimulate ATPase activity despite being transported in an ATP-dependent manner. This indicates that ATP hydrolysis and substrate translocation are half-coupled in MRP3 as CDCF shuttles on a basal TMD activity resulting from the basal ATPase activity.",

Although the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation reaction after replication is Dnmt1, it was found that the protein UHRF1 is essential for maintaining DNA methylation. UHRF1 exhibits preferential binding to hemi-methylated DNA relative to both unmethylated and fully-methylated DNA strands. In this paper we report results from molecular dynamics simulations aiming to elucidate the mechanism for the discrimination of UHRF1 to bind fully-methylated DNA. From alchemical mutation free energy calculations we find that the binding affinity of fully-methylated DNA to UHRF1 is weaker by 17.9\u00a0kJ/mol relative to the binding of hemi-methylated DNA. Structural analyses reveal, in agreement with the steric clash model, that a methyl group at the C5 position of the target cytosine induces a displacement of the NKR finger domain away from the DNA. As a result a net loss of, approximately, one hydrogen bond between the protein and the DNA is observed. These weakened protein\u2013DNA interactions are located between the target cytosine and the NKR domain, as well as, between the flipped methylcytosine and the binding pocket of the SRA domain. Due to the conformational changes of the fully-methylated bound complex, water molecules intrude the protein\u2013DNA interface and substitute the majority of the hydrogen bonds that are lost.",

Finally, DNA condensation was studied and the lipoplexes were tested in vitro to quantify their transfection efficiency. From the results obtained on these cationic lipophosphoramidates series, we show that aliphatic chain length and unsaturation number have an important influence on liposomes physicochemical properties and transfection efficiency. However there is no direct link between fluidity and fusion efficiency or between fluidity and DNA condensation.

While individual experiments can be interpreted in terms of a simple monomer\u2013trimer refolding/unfolding reaction mechanism, comparison of equilibrium and kinetic data reveals that some variants clearly deviate from this two-state behavior and that most proteins cannot be classified as two-state folders without some reservations.

To examine its contribution to binding site density, we investigated the ability of two closely related benzothiazole derivatives ((E)-2-[[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]azo]-6-methoxybenzothiazole) and ((E)-2-[2-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]ethenyl]-6-methoxybenzothiazole) that differed in polarizability to displace probes of high (Thioflavin S) and low (radiolabeled (E,E)-1-iodo-2,5-bis(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-methoxy)styrylbenzene; IMSB) density sites. Consistent with their site densities, Thioflavin S completely displaced radiolabeled IMSB, but IMSB was incapable of displacing Thioflavin S. Although both benzothiazoles displaced the low Bmax IMSB probe, only the highly polarizable analog displaced near saturating concentrations of the Thioflavin S probe. Quantum calculations showed that high polarizability reflected extensive pi-electron delocalization fostered by the presence of electron donating and accepting groups. These data suggest that electron delocalization promotes ligand binding at a subset of sites on tau aggregates that are present at high density, and that optimizing this aspect of ligand structure can yield tau-directed agents with superior diagnostic and therapeutic performance.",

The relative thermodynamic stability of A, U, and N states was estimated semi-quantitatively as a function of temperature (T) and [urea] via a combination of calorimetry, urea-assisted unfolding and dissociation, aggregation kinetics, and changes in solvent-exposed surface area, combined with thermodynamic integration and a linear transfer free energy model. The results at first suggest that N is more thermodynamically stable than A at sufficiently low T and [urea], but this may be convoluted with kinetic effects.

Using an IgG2 monoclonal antibody as a model multi-domain therapeutic protein, we have investigated the salt effect on the reversible formation of protein clusters with small aggregation number. The oligomer formation has been quantified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). It is found that the salt effect is strongly ion specific and pH dependent. In particular, at pH 3.0 only anions affect the aggregation propensity, while at pH 4.0 both anions and cations influence the aggregation rate. The ranking of the anion effect follows the Hofmeister series with the only exception of sulfate, while that of the cation effect does not. In addition, a maximum of the aggregation propensity as a function of salt concentration is observed (i.e., presence of re-stabilization).By correlating the aggregation kinetics to the experimental investigation of protein structure and surface energy, it is shown that changes in pH and salt concentration induce aggregation not only through charge screening and various solvation forces, but also through the formation of protein intermediates characterized by partially ordered structures and certain degrees of hydrophobicity. The complex interaction between the solvation forces and such protein secondary structures induced by salts explains the observed experimental results relative to re-stabilization at large salt concentrations, ion specificity and the peculiar behavior of the sulfate anion.",

Superposition of adjacent trajectory frames yields the unique rotation axis and angle of rotation that characterizes each transformation. By proportionally scaling the rotation angles relating each consecutive pair of frames, the rotational diffusion in the RVR-MD trajectory was adjusted to correct for the elevated self-diffusion rate of TIP3P water. 15N T1 and T2 values for 32 residues in the regular secondary structures of GB3 were predicted with an rms deviation of 2.2%, modestly larger than the estimated experimental uncertainties. Residue-specific chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) values reported from isotropic solution, liquid crystal and microcrystalline solid measurements less accurately predict GB3 relaxation than does applying a constant CSA value, potentially indicating structure-dependent correlated variations in 1H15N bond length and 15N CSA. By circumventing the quasi-static analysis of NMR order parameters often applied in MD studies, a more direct test is provided for assessing the accuracy with which molecular simulations predict protein motion in the ps\u2013ns timeframe.

To uncover the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we have investigated the tripeptide/ACE complexes through molecular dynamics simulations coupled with quantum mechanical simulations. Comparative structural analysis has identified a hydrophobic subsite in the active site of cACE comprising hydrophobic residues Val379, Val380, Phe457, Phe527, and Ala418. The interactions of the side chains of Leu and Ile with the hydrophobic residues determine the binding positions of N-terminal residues of the tripeptides, that influence the interaction of the residues of tripeptides with the active site of cACE.

Furthermore, the amplitude decreases with increasing inhibition of the three ATPases (i) F0F1 ATPase, (ii) plasma membrane ATPase (Pma1p) and (iii) vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase). The amplitude of the oscillations also decreases by stimulating the ATPase activity, e.g. by FCCP or Amphotericin B. Thus, ATPase activity strongly affects the glycolytic oscillations. We discuss these data in relation to a simple autocatalytic model of glycolysis which can reproduce the experimental data and explain the role of membrane-bound ATPases . In addition we also studied a recent detailed model of glycolysis and found that, although this model faithfully reproduces the oscillations of glycolytic intermediates observed experimentally, it is not able to explain the role of ATPase activity on the oscillations.",

Counterion mixing effects were also observed for both transitions; the most effective combinations to induce the transitions were Li+/Cs+ and Li+/K+, respectively. Solution viscometry, circular dichroism and alkali metal NMR line width measurements for the single-counterion systems revealed that the contact ion-pair formation hardly occurs for Li+ even at the collapsed globule state and in the helix conformation. Unexpectedly, however, the specific binding of Li+ was induced just by mixing with K+ or Cs+, when the helix content concomitantly increased. Mechanism for the counterion-specific \u201cdouble transition\u201d as well as the counterion mixing effect is discussed referring to the size-fitting model that has been proposed for the coil\u2013globule transition of alkali metal poly(acrylate)s.",

     "abstract": "The acute sensitivity to conformation exhibited by amide hydrogen exchange reactivity provides a valuable test for the physical accuracy of model ensembles developed to represent the Boltzmann distribution of the protein native state. A number of molecular dynamics studies of ubiquitin have predicted a well-populated transition in the tight turn immediately preceding the primary site of proteasome-directed polyubiquitylation Lys 48. Amide exchange reactivity analysis demonstrates that this transition is 103-fold rarer than these predictions. More strikingly, for the most populated novel conformational basin predicted from a recent 1\u00a0ms MD simulation of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (at 13% of total), experimental hydrogen exchange data indicates a population below 10\u2212\u00a06. The most sophisticated efforts to directly incorporate experimental constraints into the derivation of model protein ensembles have been applied to ubiquitin, as illustrated by three recently deposited studies (PDB codes 2NR2, 2K39 and 2KOX2K392KOX). Utilizing the extensive set of experimental NOE constraints, each of these three ensembles yields a modestly more accurate prediction of the exchange rates for the highly exposed amides than does a standard unconstrained molecular simulation. However, for the less frequently exposed amide hydrogens, the 2NR2 ensemble offers no improvement in rate predictions as compared to the unconstrained MD ensemble. The other two NMR-constrained ensembles performed markedly worse, either underestimating (2KOX) or overestimating (2K39) the extent of conformational diversity.",

     "abstract": "Ionic species have been shown to significantly perturb the interactions between non-polar solutes in aqueous solution. These perturbations are often analyzed in terms of the interactions existing between hydrophobic surfaces and ions. It has been known for some time, that ions with a high charge density are repelled from hydrophobic surfaces while ions with a low charge density tend to stick to these surfaces. Therefore, from a continuum model standpoint, small monovalent ions promote hydrophobicity by minimizing the exposed hydrophobic surface area, while \u201csticky\u201d large monovalent ions interact with the hydrophobic surfaces and discourage aggregation. However, the charge-dense lithium ion often exhibits anomalous behaviour different from these predicted trends: instead of enhancing, the addition of lithium ions often seems to weaken the hydrophobic effect and on the contrary help dissolve hydrophobic molecules. This weakening of apparent hydrophobicity is considered to be one of the reasons for the protein denaturing properties of lithium salts. Recent theoretical and experimental results however have shown that lithium cations can interact with a variety of molecular functional groups. This suggests that this apparent lithium-induced lowering of hydrophobicity, that is often reported in the literature may be a result of specific interactions between these molecular functional groups and lithium, rather than weakening the interaction between hydrophobic surfaces. This work examines these possibilities by studying the effect of various cations on the simple hydrophobic interaction existing between methyl and phenyl contact-pairs and demonstrates that the effect of lithium cations on the hydrophobic effect follows the trend predicted by continuum models. In other words, the influence of an ion on the hydrophobic interaction between two non-polar surfaces is a function of the interaction of that ion and each non-polar surface.",

     "abstract": "A mathematical model was developed to study nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) transport in an arteriole and surrounding tissues exposed to a mixture of red blood cells (RBCs) and hemoglobin (Hb)-based O2 carriers (HBOCs). A unique feature of this model is the inclusion of blood vessel wall shear stress-induced production of endothelial-derived NO, which is very sensitive to the viscosity of the RBC and HBOC mixture traversing the blood vessel lumen. Therefore in this study, a series of polymerized bovine Hb (PolyHb) solutions with high viscosity, varying O2 affinities, NO dioxygenation rate constants and O2 dissociation rate constants that were previously synthesized and characterized by our group was evaluated via mathematical modeling, in order to investigate the effect of these biophysical properties on the transport of NO and O2 in an arteriole and its surrounding tissues subjected to anemia with the commercial HBOC Oxyglobin\u00ae and cell-free bovine Hb (bHb) serving as appropriate controls. The computer simulation results indicated that transfusion of high viscosity PolyHb solutions promoted blood vessel wall shear stress dependent generation of the vasodilator NO, especially in the blood vessel wall and should transport enough NO inside the smooth muscle layer to activate vasodilation compared to the commercial HBOC Oxyglobin\u00ae and cell-free bHb. However, NO scavenging in the arteriole lumen was unavoidable due to the intrinsic high NO dioxygenation rate constant of the HBOCs being studied. This study also observed that all PolyHbs could potentially improve tissue oxygenation under hypoxic conditions, while low O2 affinity PolyHbs were more effective in oxygenating tissues under normoxic conditions compared with high O2 affinity PolyHbs. In addition, all ultrahigh molecular weight PolyHbs displayed higher O2 transfer rates than the commercial HBOC Oxyglobin\u00ae and cell-free bHb. Therefore, these results suggest that ultrahigh molecular weight PolyHb solutions could be used as safe and efficacious O2 carriers for use in transfusion medicine. It also suggests that future generations of PolyHb solutions should possess lower NO dioxygenation reaction rate constants in order to reduce NO scavenging, while maintaining high solution viscosity to take advantage of wall shear stress-induced NO production. Taken together, we suggest that this mathematical model can be used to predict the vasoactivity of HBOCs and help guide the design and optimization of the next generation of HBOCs for use in transfusion medicine.",

Induced dipole polarization density within viscoelastic biomaterials is calculated via the real and imaginary components of the complex dielectric constant, according to the Debye equation, to quantify electro-kinetic stimulation. Rates of nutrient consumption under zero-field conditions are described by third-order kinetics that include local mass densities of nutrients, oxygen, and attached cells. Thinner nutrient boundary layers are stabilized at shorter dimensionless diffusion times when the zero-field intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number increases above its initial-condition-sensitive critical value [i.e., {\u039b2zero-field}critical\u00a0\u2265\u00a053, see Eq. (23)], such that the biomaterial core is starved of essential ingredients required for successful proliferation. When tissue regeneration occurs above the critical electric-field-sensitive intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number, the electro-kinetic contribution to nutrient consumption cannot be neglected. The critical electric-field-sensitive intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number is proportional to the Deborah number.",

In a previous study, we have theoretically studied the complex between PKA and the heptapeptide substrate Kemptide by classical molecular dynamics. On the basis of the results obtained for Kemptide, the aim of the present work is to explore how the different conditions, such as phosphorylation state, substrate, and mutations of key residues affect the enzyme dynamics. We have built different models of the complex; particularly we have focused our attention on two crystallographic structures which main difference consists in their phosphorylation state. The first one has the residue Thr197 modified into a phospho-threonine (pThr197); the second one, in addition to the same Thr197, has also the residue Ser338 modified into a phospho-serine (pSer338). In addition, we have analyzed the effect of the choice of the substrate by building a model of the PKA-SP20 Michaelis complex. Finally, we have theoretically studied the effect of the mutation of the highly conserved residue Asp166 that, experimentally, leads to a decrease of the reaction rate. The results of this study give insight into the dynamical states of the enzyme and their relationship with different elements of the model, which correspond to different natural or human guided situations of the active biological system.",

     "abstract": "Salt ions affect protein stability in a variety of ways. In general, these effects have either been interpreted from a charge solvation/charge screening standpoint or they have been considered to be the result of ion-specific interactions with a particular protein. Recent theoretical work suggests that a major contribution to salt effects on proteins is through the interaction of salt ions that are located near the protein surface and their induced point image charges that are located in the low-dielectric protein cavity. These interactions form the basis of \u201csalting-out\u201d interactions. Salt ions induce an image charge of the same sign in the low dielectric protein medium. The interaction between the induced charge and its mirror charge is repulsive and consequently thermodynamically destabilizing. However, a folded protein that has a much smaller surface area will be less destabilized than the unfolded state. Consequently, the folded state will be stabilized relative to the unfolded state. This work analyzes salt effects in the model enzyme ribonuclease t1, and demonstrates that interactions between salt ions and their induced point charges provide a major contribution to the observed salt-induced increase in protein stability. This work also demonstrates that in the case of weakly-binding ions (ions with binding constants that are in the order of 50\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 and less), salting-out effects should still be considered in order to provide a more realistic interpretation of ion binding. These results should therefore be considered when salt effects are used to analyze electrostatic contributions to protein structure or are used to study the thermodynamics of proteins associated with halophillic organisms.",

The efficacy of volumetric investigations of hydration depends on our ability to reliably discriminate between the cavity, VC, and interaction, VI, contributions to the partial molar volume. The cavity volume, VC, consists of the intrinsic volume, VM, of a solute molecule and the thermal volume, VT, with the latter representing the volume of the effective void created around the solute. In this work, we use molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with the Kirkwood\u2013Buff theory to compute the partial molar volumes for organic solutes of varying sizes in water. We perform our computations using the Lennard-Jones and Coulombic pair potentials as well as truncated potentials which contain only the Lennard-Jones but not the Coulombic contribution. The partial molar volume computed with the Lennard-Jones potentials in the absence of the Coulombic term nearly coincides with the cavity volume, VC. We determine the thermal volume, VT, for each compound by subtracting its van der Waals volume, VW, from VC. Finally, we apply the spherical approximation of solute geometry to evaluate the thickness of the thermal volume, \u03b4. Our results reveal an increase in the thickness of thermal volume, \u03b4, with an increase in the size of the solute. This finding may be related to dewetting of large nonpolar solutes and the concomitant increase in the compressibility of water of hydration.",

We have recently shown that in vitro oxidation of Met1606, under conditions mimicking those found in diseases characterized by high oxidative stress, severely impairs proteolysis by ADAMTS13, with a resulting pro-thrombotic effect caused by the accumulation of UL-vWF species. Conversely, Val1607Asp mutation, found in vWF from patients with type 2A von Willebrand disease, accelerates proteolysis of vWF, with a final hemorrhagic effect. Considering the physio-pathological importance of ADAMTS13-vWF interaction and the absence of experimental structural data, here we produced by homology modeling techniques a three-dimensional model of ADAMTS13 metalloprotease domain (M13).

Such changes in membrane structure may induce disordering of the tail group. This scenario explains the reduction of the main transition temperature of lipid membranes, as the fraction of lidocaine per lipid molecules increases, which was evident from differential scanning calorimetry results. Furthermore neutron spin echo spectroscopy was used for the dynamics measurements and the results reveal that presence of charged lidocaine increases the bending elasticity of the lipid membranes in the fluid phase and slows the temperature-dependent change of bending elasticity across the main transition temperature.",

A popular solution-phase assay for nucleotide flipping employs the fluorescent adenine analogue, 2-aminopurine (2AP), substituted at the methylation target site; a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity on enzyme binding indicates flipping. However, this appeared to fail for M.EcoRV, since 2AP substituted for the non-target adenine in the recognition sequence showed a much greater intensity increase than 2AP at the target site. This anomaly is resolved by recording the fluorescence decay of 2AP which shows that the target 2AP is indeed flipped by the enzyme, but its fluorescence is quenched by interaction with aromatic residues in the catalytic site, whereas bending of the duplex at the non-target site alleviates inter-base quenching and exposes the 2AP to solvent.",

Despite many previous studies, there is still no uniform picture quantitatively explaining this phenomenon. Here we calculate the lifetime for a particular hydration pattern in the DNA minor groove, the water bridge, for various DNA sequences to show that the water-bridge lifetime varies from 1 to ~\u00a0300\u00a0ps in a sequence-dependent manner. We find that it follows 1/k(Vstep)Pm, where Pm and Vstep are two crucial factors, namely the probability of forming a specific hydrogen bond in which more than one donor atom participates, and the structural fluctuation of DNA, respectively. This relationship provides a picture of the water kinetics with atomistic detail and shows that water dissociation occurs when a particular hydrogen-bonding pattern appears. The rate constant of water dissociation k can be described as a function of the structural fluctuations of DNA. This picture is consistent with the model of Laage and Hynes proposing that hydrogen-bond switching occurs when an unusual number of hydrogen bonds are formed. The two new factors suggested here are discussed in the context of the surface's geometry and electrostatic nature, which were previously proposed as the determinants of water lifetimes.",

For this purpose, it is suitable to control the molecular packing in protein crystals by changing the volume of solvent channels through variation of the environmental relative humidity. Here, we studied conformational responses of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) in the tetragonal crystal by X-ray diffraction experiments using a humidity-control apparatus, which provided air flow of 20\u201398%rh at 298\u00a0K.

Then two crystal structures at a resolution of 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 using diffraction data obtained at 84.2 and 71.9%rh were determined to discuss the conformational responses of HEWL against the external perturbation induced by changes in molecular packing. The structure at 71.9%rh displayed a closure movement that was likely induced by the molecular contacts formed during dehydration and could be approximated by ten low-frequency normal modes for the crystal structure obtained at 84.2%rh. In addition, we observed reorganization of hydration structures at the molecular interfaces between symmetry neighbors. These findings suggest that humidity-controlled X-ray crystallography is an effective tool to investigate the responses of inherent intramolecular motions of proteins to external perturbations.",

The exploration resulted in 10 conformations with a relative energy difference smaller than 22\u00a0kJ.mol\u22121 at the HF/3-21G level of theory.

     "abstract": "The conformational change of a protein upon ligand binding was examined by normal mode analysis (NMA) based on an elastic-network model (ENM) for a full-atom system using dihedral angles as independent variables. Specifically, we investigated the extent to which conformational change vectors of atoms from an apo form to a holo form of a protein can be represented by a linear combination of the displacement vectors of atoms in the apo form calculated for the lowest-frequency m normal modes (m\u00a0=\u00a01, 2, \u2026, 20). In this analysis, the latter vectors were best fitted to the former ones by the least-squares method. Twenty-two paired proteins in the holo and apo forms, including three dimer pairs, were examined. The results showed that, in most cases, the conformational change vectors were reproduced well by a linear combination of the displacement vectors of a small number of low-frequency normal modes. The conformational change around an active site was reproduced as well as the entire conformational change, except for some proteins that only undergo significant conformational changes around active sites. The weighting factors for 20 normal modes optimized by the least-squares fitting characterize the conformational changes upon ligand binding for these proteins. The conformational changes sampled around the apo form of a protein by the linear combination of the displacement vectors obtained by ENM-based NMA may help solve the flexible-docking problem of a protein with another molecule because the results presented herein suggest that they have a relatively high probability of being involved in an actual conformational change.",

     "abstract": "T-20 (also known as enfuvirtide) is a fusion inhibitor peptide known to have some effectiveness in the control of progression of HIV infection by inhibiting the fusion of the HIV envelope with the target cell membrane. Recent results indicate that T-20 is able to interact with membranes in the liquid disordered state but not with membranes in an ordered state, which could be linked to its effectiveness. A detailed molecular picture of the interaction of these molecules with membranes is still lacking. To this effect, extensive molecular dynamics simulations (100\u00a0ns) were carried out to investigate the interaction between T-20 and bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and POPC/cholesterol (1:1). Membrane properties such as area/lipid, density profiles, order parameters and membrane thickness were studied. It was observed that T-20 has the ability to interact to different extents with both model membranes in this study and that peptide interaction with the bilayer surface has a local effect on membrane structure. The formation of hydrogen bonding between certain peptide residues and the POPC phosphate group was observed. However, T-20 showed a more limited extent of interaction with model membranes when compared with other, more efficient, peptides (such as T-1249). This effect is most notable in POPC/Chol membranes in which interaction is especially weak, owing to less peptide residues acting as H bond donors to POPC and virtually no H bonds being formed between T-20 and cholesterol. This lower ability to interact with membranes is probably correlated with its smaller inhibitory efficiency.",

Although the formation of a complex between the two proteins has been demonstrated, little is known about their binding features. We investigated the interaction between the transcription activation domain of p53 (p53(1-63)) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin using fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopic techniques. Trp phosphorescence lifetime measurements revealed conformational changes in azurin induced by the interaction with p53(1-63). Acrylamide quenching of Trp phosphorescence also indicated a significant increase in the overall flexibility of azurin upon binding to p53(1-63). We show that azurin binds to the N-terminal region of p53 with a dissociation constant in the 5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM range. No change in the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission of p53(1-63) was detected in the presence of azurin. This result indicated that no Trp residue of p53(1-63) is located in the interaction site with azurin and therefore suggested that the azurin binding site does not overlap that of MDM2, the protein that plays a crucial role in the p53 regulation. The present results may assist in the design of novel cancer treatments based on p53 stabilization by azurin.",

     "abstract": "Binding of Na+ to thrombin ensures high activity toward physiological substrates and optimizes the procoagulant and prothrombotic roles of the enzyme in vivo. Under physiological conditions of pH and temperature, the binding affinity of Na+ is weak due to large heat capacity and enthalpy changes associated with binding, and the Kd\u00a0=\u00a080\u00a0mM ensures only 64% saturation of the site at the concentration of Na+ in the blood (140\u00a0mM). Residues controlling Na+ binding and activation have been identified. Yet, attempts to improve the interaction of Na+ with thrombin and possibly increase catalytic activity under physiological conditions have so far been unsuccessful. Here we report how replacement of the flexible autolysis loop of human thrombin with the homologous rigid domain of the murine enzyme results in a drastic (up to 10-fold) increase in Na+ affinity and a significant improvement in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Rigidification of the autolysis loop abolishes the heat capacity change associated with Na+ binding observed in the wild-type and also increases the stability of thrombin. These findings have general relevance to protein engineering studies of clotting proteases and trypsin-like enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Polyglutamine aggregation is associated with neurodegeneration in nine different disorders. The effects of polyglutamine length and peptide concentration on the kinetics of aggregation were previously analyzed using a homogeneous nucleation model that assumes the presence of a single bottleneck along the free energy profile G(n), where n denotes the number of polyglutamine molecules. The observation of stable, soluble oligomers as intermediates along aggregation pathways is refractory to the assumptions of homogeneous nucleation. Furthermore, the analysis of in vitro kinetic data using a specific variant of homogeneous nucleation leads to confounding observations such as fractional and/or negative values for estimates of the critical nucleus size. Here, we show that the homogeneous nucleation model is inherently robust and is unlikely to yield fractional values if the underlying process is strictly homogeneous with a free energy profile G(n) that displays a sharp maximum at n\u00a0=\u00a0n*, where n* corresponds to the critical nucleus. Conversely, a model that includes oligomers of different size and different potentials for supporting turnover into fibrils yields estimates of fractional and/or negative nucleus sizes when the kinetic data are analyzed using the assumption of a homogeneous process. This model provides a route to reconcile independent observations of heterogeneous distributions of oligomers and other non-fibrillar aggregates with results obtained from analysis of aggregation kinetics using the assumption of a homogeneous nucleation model. In the new model, the mechanisms of fibril assembly are governed by the relative stabilities of two types of oligomers viz., fibril-competent and fibril-incompetent oligomers, the size of the smallest fibril competent oligomer, and rates for conformational conversion within different oligomers.",

Peptides that are enthalpically driven completely silence the millisecond\u2013microsecond relaxation signal, suggesting a significant rigidifying of the binding groove, while peptides in the entropically favored group exhibit the same conformational dynamics as the free protein, suggesting that the peptide sits loosely in the binding groove and so retains flexibility of the groove, and presumably of the bound peptide.

This study describes experimental folding/unfolding equilibrium and kinetic studies of the engineered protein Ubq\u2013UIM, consisting of ubiquitin (Ubq) fused to the sequence of the ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) via a short linker. Urea-induced folding/unfolding profiles of Ubq\u2013UIM were monitored by far-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies and compared to those of the isolated Ubq domain. It was found that the equilibrium data for Ubq\u2013UIM is inconsistent with a two-state model. Analysis of the kinetics of folding shows similarity in the folding transition state ensemble between Ubq and Ubq\u2013UIM, suggesting that formation of Ubq domain is independent of UIM. The major contribution to the stabilization of Ubq\u2013UIM, relative to Ubq, was found to be in the rates of unfolding. Moreover, it was found that the kinetic m-values for Ubq\u2013UIM unfolding, monitored by different probes (far-UV circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies), are different; thereby, further supporting deviations from a two-state behavior. A thermodynamic linkage model that involves four states was found to be applicable to the urea-induced unfolding of Ubq\u2013UIM, which is in agreement with the previous temperature-induced unfolding study. The applicability of the model was further supported by site-directed variants of Ubq\u2013UIM that have altered stabilities of Ubq/UIM interface and/or stabilities of individual Ubq- and UIM-domains.

In the U2 snRNP, it is bound to Stem-Loop IV (SLIV) of the U2 snRNA. We find that in vitro it binds not only to human SLIV, but also to Stem-Loop II (SLII) from human U1 snRNA and to Drosophila U2 snRNA SLIV. The thermodynamics of these binding interactions show a striking similarity, leading to the conclusion that U2B\u2033 has a relaxed specificity for its RNA targets. The binding properties of U2B\u2033 are distinct from those of human U1A and of Drosophila SNF, despite its high homology to those proteins, and so provide important new information on how this protein family has modulated its target preferences.",

We've addressed such questions using the premise that from atomic coordinates, the transfer free energy of a native protein (\u0394Gtr,\u00a0N) can be predicted by summing measured water-to-osmolyte transfer free energies of the protein's solvent exposed side chain and backbone component parts. \u0394Gtr,\u00a0D is predicted using a self avoiding random coil model for the protein, and \u0394Gtr,\u00a0D\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u0394Gtr,\u00a0N, predicts the m-value, a quantity that measures the osmolyte effect on the N\u00a0\u21cc\u00a0D transition. Using literature and newly measured m-values we show 1:1 correspondence between predicted and measured m-values covering a range of 12\u00a0kcal/mol/M in protein stability for 46 proteins and 9 different osmolytes.

     "abstract": "The dimer interface of caspase-3 contains a bifunctional allosteric site in which the enzyme can be activated or inactivated, depending on the context of the protein. In the mature caspase-3, the binding of allosteric inhibitors to the interface results in an order-to-disorder transition in the active site loops. In procaspase-3, by contrast, the binding of allosteric activators to the interface results in a disorder-to-order transition in the active site. We have utilized the allosteric site to identify a small molecule activator of procaspase and to characterize its binding to the protease. The data suggest that an efficient activator must stabilize the active conformer of the zymogen by expelling the intersubunit linker from the interface, and it must interact with active site residues found in the allosteric site. Small molecule activators that fulfill the two requirements should provide scaffolds for drug candidates as a therapeutic strategy for directly promoting procaspase-3 activation in cancer cells.",

Analytical ultracentrifugation has been a fundamental technique in the determination of macromolecular reaction stoichiometry and energetics for 85\u00a0years. This approach is highly amenable to the extraction of thermodynamic couplings to small molecule binding in the overall reaction pathway. In the 1980s this approach was extended to the use of sedimentation velocity techniques, primarily by the analysis of tubulin\u2013drug interactions by Na and Timasheff. This transport method necessarily incorporates the complexity of both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonideality. The advent of modern computational methods in the last 20\u00a0years has subsequently made the analysis of sedimentation velocity data for interacting systems more robust and rigorous. Here we review three examples where sedimentation velocity has been useful at extracting thermodynamic information about reaction stoichiometry and energetics.

Here we review from an ensemble perspective important biological effects of such spontaneous fluctuations on protein allostery, function, and evolution. However, rather than present a thorough literature review on each subject, we focus instead on connecting these phenomena through the ensemble-based experimental, theoretical, and computational investigations from our laboratory over the past decade. Special emphasis is given to insights that run counter to some of the prevailing ideas that have emerged over the past 40\u00a0years of structural biology research. For instance, when proteins are viewed as conformational ensembles rather than as single structures, the commonly held notion of an allosteric pathway as an obligate series of individual structural distortions loses its meaning. Instead, allostery can result from energetic linkage between distal sites as one Boltzmann distribution of states transitions to another. Additionally, the emerging principles from this ensemble view of proteins have proven surprisingly useful in describing the role of intrinsic disorder in inter-domain communication, functional adaptation mediated by mutational control of fluctuations, and evolutionary conservation of the energetics of protein stability.",

     "abstract": "Mapping the stability distributions of proteins in their native folded states provides a critical link between structure, thermodynamics, and function. Linear repeat proteins have proven more amenable to this kind of mapping than globular proteins. C-terminal deletion studies of YopM, a large, linear leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein, show that stability is distributed quite heterogeneously, yet a high level of cooperativity is maintained [1]. Key components of this distribution are three interfaces that strongly stabilize adjacent sequences, thereby maintaining structural integrity and promoting cooperativity.To better understand the distribution of interaction energy around these critical interfaces, we studied internal (rather than terminal) deletions of three LRRs in this region, including one of these stabilizing interfaces. Contrary to our expectation that deletion of structured repeats should be destabilizing, we find that internal deletion of folded repeats can actually stabilize the native state, suggesting that these repeats are destabilizing, although paradoxically, they are folded in the native state. We identified two residues within this destabilizing segment that deviate from the consensus sequence at a position that normally forms a stacked leucine ladder in the hydrophobic core. Replacement of these nonconsensus residues with leucine is stabilizing. This stability enhancement can be reproduced in the context of nonnative interfaces, but it requires an extended hydrophobic core. Our results demonstrate that different LRRs vary widely in their contribution to stability, and that this variation is context-dependent. These two factors are likely to determine the types of rearrangements that lead to folded, functional proteins, and in turn, are likely to restrict the pathways available for the evolution of linear repeat proteins.",

CaM binding Ca2+, and the domains of CaM binding the CTT are linked thermodynamic functions.

Klenow polymerase binds primed-template DNA (the replication substrate) with up to 50\u00d7 higher affinity than it binds to nicked DNA, DNA with a 2 base single-stranded gap, blunt-ended DNA, or to a DNA end with a 3\u2032 overhang. In contrast, Klentaq binds all of these DNAs almost identically, indicating that Klenow has a stronger ability to discriminate between replication and repair substrates than Klentaq. In contrast, both polymerases bind mismatched primed-template and blunt-ended DNA tighter than they bind matched primed-template DNA, suggesting that these two proteins may share a similar mechanism to identify mismatched DNA, despite the fact that Klentaq has no proofreading ability. In addition, the presence or absence of 5\u2032- or 3\u2032-phosphates has slightly different effects on DNA binding by the two polymerases, but again reinforce Klenow's more effective substrate discrimination capability.",

However, only half of the OmpA mass encodes its transmembrane \u03b2-barrel; the remaining sequence is a soluble domain that is localized to the periplasmic side of the outer membrane. To understand how the OmpA periplasmic domain contributes to the stability and folding of the full-length OmpA protein, we cloned, expressed, purified and studied the OmpA periplasmic domain independently of the OmpA transmembrane \u03b2-barrel region. Our experiments showed that the OmpA periplasmic domain exists as an independent folding unit with a free energy of folding equal to \u2212\u00a06.2 (\u00b1\u00a00.1) kcal\u00a0mol-1 at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Using circular dichroism, we determined that the OmpA periplasmic domain adopts a mixed alpha/beta secondary structure, a conformation that has previously been used to describe the partially folded non-native state of the full-length OmpA. We further discovered that the OmpA periplasmic domain reduces the self-association propensity of the unfolded barrel domain, but only when covalently attached (in cis). In vitro folding experiments showed that self-association competes with \u03b2-barrel folding when allowed to occur before the addition of membranes, and the periplasmic domain enhances the folding efficiency of the full-length protein by reducing its self-association. These results identify a novel chaperone function for the periplasmic domain of OmpA that may be relevant for folding in vivo. We have also extensively investigated the properties of the self-association reaction of unfolded OmpA and found that the transmembrane region must form a critical nucleus comprised of three molecules before undergoing further oligomerization to form large molecular weight species. Finally, we studied the conformation of the unfolded OmpA monomer and found that the folding-competent form of the transmembrane region adopts an expanded conformation, which is in contrast to previous studies that have suggested a collapsed unfolded state.",

As a tool to explore the communication mechanism, the mutations at various positions in the cAMP-binding (K52N, D53H, S62F and T127L) or the DNA- binding (H159L) domain or both (K52N/H159L) were generated. The sites and specific nature of side chain substitutions were defined by earlier genetic studies, the results of which show that these mutants have a similar phenotype i.e. they are activated without exogenous cAMP. Presently, no significant changes in the structures of WT and mutant CRPs have been observed. Hence, the pressing issue is to identify a physical parameter that reflects the effects of mutations. In this study, the stability of these various CRP species in the presence of GuHCl was monitored by three spectroscopic techniques, namely, CD, tryptophan fluorescence and FT-IR which could provide data on the stability of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands separately. Results of this study led to the following conclusions: 1. The \u03b1-helices can be grouped into two families with different stabilities. Mutations exert a differential effect on the stability of helices as demonstrated by a biphasic unfolding curve for the helices. 2. Regardless of the locations of mutations, the effects can be communicated to the other domain resulting in a perturbation of the stability of both domains, although the effects are more significantly expressed in the stability of the helices. 3. Although in an earlier study [Gekko, et al. Biochemistry 43 (2004) 3844] we showed that cooperativity of cAMP binding is generally correlated to the global dynamics of the protein and DNA binding affinity, in this study we found that generally there is no clear correlation between functional energetics and stability of secondary structures. Thus, results of this study imply that modulation of allostery in CRP is entropic in nature.",

     "abstract": "The general thermodynamic principles behind pH driven conformational transitions of biological macromolecules are well understood. What is less obvious is how they can be used to engineer pH switches in proteins. The acid unfolding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was used to illustrate different factors that can affect pH-driven conformational transitions. Acid unfolding is a structural transition driven by preferential H+ binding to the acid unfolded state (U) over the native (N) state of a protein. It is the result of carboxylic groups that titrate with more normal pKa values in the U state than in the N state. Acid unfolding profiles of proteins reflect a balance between electrostatic and non-electrostatic contributions to stability. Several strategies were used in attempts to turn SNase into an acid insensitive protein: (1) enhancing global stability of the protein with mutagenesis or with osmolytes, (2) use of high salt concentrations to screen Coulomb interactions, (3) stabilizing the N state through specific anion effects, (4) removing Asp or Glu residues that titrate with depressed pKa values in the N state, and (5) removing basic residues that might have strong repulsive interactions in the N state at low pH. The only effective way to engineer acid resistance in SNase is not through modulation of pKa values of Asp/Glu but by enhancing the global stability of the protein. Modulation of pH-driven conformational transitions by selective manipulation of the electrostatic component of the switch is an extremely difficult undertaking.",

As previously shown, optimizing the equilibrium geometry configurations with B3LYP density functional theory, followed by ZINDO calculations of the electronic excitations, yields positions of the optical bands in good agreement with experimental data. These large scale quantum calculations elucidate the role of the hydrogen bonded network as well as point mutations in the absorption spectra of the DsRed and mCherry proteins. The effect of an external electric field applied to the fluorescent protein chromophores is examined and shows that such fields may result in large shifts in spectral bands. These strategies can be applied for rational design of the fluorescent proteins by site-directed mutagenesis.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism by which flavonoids prevent formation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) fibrils, as well as how they associate with non-fibrillar A\u03b2 is still unclear. Fresh, un-oxidized myricetin exhibited excitation and emission fluorescence maxima at 481 and 531\u00a0nm, respectively. Introduction of either A\u03b2(1\u201342) or A\u03b2(25\u201340) resulted in a fluorescence decrease, when measured at 481\u00a0nm, suggesting formation of a myricetin\u2013A\u03b2 complex. Circular dichroism (CD) and ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) studies indicate that the association of myricetin with the A\u03b2 peptide or its hydrophobic fragment, A\u03b2(25\u201340), leads to subtle changes in each peptide's conformation. A\u03b2(25\u201340) formed amyloid fibrils at a similar rate, when compared to the full-length peptide, A\u03b2(1\u201342), using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. Studies also indicated that myricetin was equally effective at preventing the formation of both A\u03b2(1\u201342) and A\u03b2(25\u201340) fibrils. Although ThT assays indicated that A\u03b2(1\u201316) did not form amyloid fibrils, CD studies of the hydrophilic fragment, A\u03b2(1\u201316), suggest possible interactions between myricetin and aromatic side chains. UVRR studies of the full-length peptide and A\u03b2(1\u201316) showed increases in the intensity of the aromatic modes upon introduction of myricetin. Our findings suggest that myricetin interacts with soluble A\u03b2 via two mechanisms, association with the hydrophobic C-terminal region and interactions with the aromatic side chains.",

     "abstract": "Equilibrium unfolding at neutral pH of the third PDZ domain of PSD95 is well described by the presence of a partly unfolded intermediate that presents association phenomena. After some days' incubation annular and fibrillar structures form from the oligomers. At pH values below 3, however, differential scanning calorimetry shows that PDZ3 seems to unfold under a two-state scheme. Kinetic measurements followed by dynamic light scattering, ThT and ANS fluorescence reveal that the misfolding pathway still exists despite the absence of any populated intermediates and shows an irreversible assembling of the supramacromolecular structures as well as an appreciable lag-phase, contrary to what is found in similar experiments at neutral pH. Moreover, as shown by transmission-electron-microscopy images, the annular structures seen at neutral pH completely disappear from incubated solutions. According to the structural information, this titration behavior appears to be the consequence of a conformational equilibrium that depends on the protonation of some Glu residues located at the C-terminal \u03b13 helix and at the hairpin formed by strands \u03b22 and \u03b23. Our calculations suggest that the enthalpic contribution of these interactions may well be as much as 40\u00a0kJ\u00b7mol\u22121.

     "abstract": "Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) is associated to the plasma membrane via a GPI-anchor and plays a key role in the biomineralization process. In plasma membranes, most GPI-anchored proteins are associated with \u201clipid rafts\u201d, ordered microdomains enriched in sphingolipids, glycosphingolipids and cholesterol. In order to better understand the role of lipids present in rafts and their interactions with GPI-anchored proteins, the insertion of TNAP into different lipid raft models was studied using dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), cholesterol (Chol), sphingomyelin (SM) and ganglioside (GM1). Thus, the membrane models studied were binary systems (9:1 molar ratio) containing DPPC:Chol, DPPC:SM and DPPC:GM1, ternary systems (8:1:1 molar ratio) containing DPPC:Chol:SM, DPPC:Chol:GM1 and DPPC:SM:GM1 and finally, a quaternary system (7:1:1:1 molar ratio) containing DPPC:Chol:SM:GM1. Calorimetry analysis of the liposomes and proteoliposomes indicate that lateral phase segregation could be noted only in the presence of cholesterol, with the formation of cholesterol-rich microdomains centered above Tc\u00a0=\u00a041.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The presence of GM1 and SM into DPPC-liposomes influenced mainly \u0394H and \u0394t1/2 values. The gradual increase in the complexity of the systems decreased the activity of the enzyme incorporated. The presence of the enzyme also fluidifies the systems, as seen by the intense reduction in \u2206H values, but do not alter Tc values significantly. Therefore, the study of different microdomains and its biophysical characterization may contribute to the knowledge of the interactions between the lipids present in MVs and its interactions with TNAP.",

The results showed a lipid film structure with three distinct phases: liquid expanded, liquid ordered and liquid condensed. The area covered by the liquid condensed domains increased as surface pressure increased. The presence of liquid ordered phase within these structures correlated with the cholesterol content. At a surface pressure of 50\u00a0mN/m, stacks of bilayers appeared. Several structural details of these films differ from previous observations made with goat and exogenous surfactants. Overall, the data indicate that surfactant films demonstrate phase separation at low surface pressures and multilayer formation at higher pressure, features likely important for normal surfactant function.",

Previous reports based on in vitro studies claim that carriers possessing a mixture of primary, secondary and tertiary amines are able to buffer the acidic environment within the endosome, allowing for timely release of their contents, leading to higher transfection rates. In this report, we adopt an atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach, comparing the complexation of 21-bp siRNA with low-generation polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers (G0 and G1) at both neutral and acidic pHs, the latter of which mimics the degradative environment within maturing \u2018late-endosomes\u2019. Our simulations reveal that the time taken for the dendrimer\u2013gene complex (dendriplex) to reach equilibrium is appreciably longer at low pH and this is accompanied by more compact packaging of the dendriplex, as compared to simulations performed at neutral pH. We also note larger absolute values of calculated binding free energies of the dendriplex at low pH, indicating a higher dendrimer\u2013nucleic acid affinity in comparison with neutral pH. These novel simulations provide a more detailed understanding of low molecular-weight polymer\u2013siRNA behavior, mimicking the endosomal environment and provide input of direct relevance to the \u201cproton sponge theory\u201d, thereby advancing the rational design of non-viral gene delivery systems.",

Intracellular distribution was affected by lowering the temperature from 37 to 4\u00a0\u00b0C and by the disruption of cytoskeleton by cytochalasin D, but it was minimally perturbed by the inhibition of ATP dependent molecular motors.

However, the complete structure of the full length protein is still unknown. We have investigated the global architecture of human PARN by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in buffered milieu and report for the first time the dimensions of the full length protein at subnanometer resolution.

The unsteady state reaction\u2013diffusion equation (i.e., modified diffusion equation) is solved according to the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u2013Pohlhausen integral method of boundary layer analysis when nutrient consumption and tissue regeneration are stimulated by harmonically imposed stress. The mass balance with diffusion and stress-sensitive kinetics represents a rare example where the Damk\u00f6hler and Deborah numbers appear together in an effort to simulate the development of mass transfer boundary layers in porous viscoelastic biomaterials. The Boltzmann superposition integral is employed to calculate time-dependent strain in terms of the real and imaginary components of dynamic compliance for viscoelastic solids that transmit harmonic excitation to anchorage-dependent cells. Rates of nutrient consumption under stress-free conditions are described by third-order kinetics which include local mass densities of nutrients, oxygen, and attached cells that maintain dynamic equilibrium with active protein sites in the porous matrix. Thinner nutrient mass transfer boundary layers are stabilized at shorter dimensionless diffusion times when the stress-free intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number increases above its initial-condition-sensitive critical value. The critical stress-sensitive intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number, above which it is necessary to consider the effect of harmonic strain on nutrient consumption and tissue regeneration, is proportional to the Deborah number and corresponds to a larger fraction of the stress-free intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number in rigid biomaterials.",

It is found that internal noise can induce circadian oscillation even if the delay time \u03c4 is below the deterministic Hopf bifurcation \u03c4h. We use signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to quantitatively characterize the performance of such noise induced oscillations and a threshold value of SNR is introduced to define the so-called effective oscillation. Interestingly, the \u03c4-range for effective stochastic oscillation, denoted as \u0394\u03c4EO, shows a bell-shaped dependence on the intensity of internal noise which is inversely proportional to the system size.

     "abstract": "The relation between the conservation of active site residues and the molecular mechanism of aminoacylation reaction is an unexplored problem. In the present paper, the influences of the conserved active site residues on the reaction mechanism as well as the electrostatic potential near the reaction center are analyzed for Histidyl tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli, Thermus thermophilus and Staphylococcus aureus. While the primary structures show both convergence as well as divergence, the secondary level structures of the active sites of the three species show considerable conservation in the respective structural organizations. The conserved active site residues near the reaction center, which have a major role in the reaction mechanism and catalysis, retain their specific position and orientation relative to the substrate in the three species. In order to understand the influence of different conserved and nonconserved residues near the reaction center, two different models are considered. First, a large model of active site with the substrates, Mg2+ ions and water is constructed in which the first shell residues (including both conserved as well as nonconserved) near the reaction center are studied. From the large model, a smaller model is constructed for reaction path modeling individually for three species. Validation of the smaller model is carried out by comparing the energy surfaces of large and small models as a function of reaction coordinates. Further, the electrostatic potential near the reaction center for the large and small model are compared. The transition state structures of the activation step of aminoacylation reaction for E. coli, T. thermophilus and S. aureus are calculated using the combined ab-initio/semi-empirical calculation. The similarity of the energy profiles as a function of the relevant reaction coordinate and the orientation of the catalytic residue, Arg259, indicate that the reaction mechanisms are identical which are guided by the strikingly similar structural pattern formed by conserved residues for three species. The energy surfaces have close resemblance in three species and present a clear perspective that how the reaction proceeds with the aid of different conserved residues. The study of electrostatic potential confirms this view. The present study provides an understanding of the relationship between the conservation of residues and the efficient reaction mechanism of aminoacylation reaction.",

Despite being a critical component in biomolecular systems, characterizing the properties of hydration water poses a challenge for both experiments and simulations. In this context we investigate the local structure of hydration water molecules as a function of the distance from the protein and water molecules respectively in 188 high resolution protein structures and compare it with those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Tetrahedral order parameter of water in proteins calculated from previous and present simulation studies show that the potential of bulk water overestimates the average tetrahedral order parameter compared to those calculated from crystal structures. Hydration waters are found to be more ordered at a distance between the first and second solvation shell from the protein surface. The values of the order parameter decrease sharply when the water molecules are located very near or far away from the protein surface. At small water\u2013water distance, the values of order parameter of water are very low. The average order parameter records a maximum value at a distance equivalent to the first solvation layer with respect to the water\u2013water radial distribution and asymptotically approaches a constant value at large distances. Results from present analysis will help to get a better insight into structure of hydration water around proteins.

Glycosaminoglycans are highly charged polymers known to associate with tissue amyloid deposits that have been shown to accelerate amyloidogenesis in vitro. We studied two immunoglobulin light chain variable domains from light chain amyloidosis patients with 90% sequence identity, analyzing their fibril formation kinetics and binding properties with different glycosaminoglycan molecules. We find that the less amyloidogenic of the proteins shows a weak dependence on glycosaminoglycan size and charge, while the more amyloidogenic protein responds only minimally to changes in the glycosaminoglycan. These glycosaminoglycan effects on fibril formation do not depend on a stable interaction between the two species but still show characteristic traits of an interaction-dependent mechanism. We propose that transient, predominantly electrostatic interactions between glycosaminoglycans and the precursor proteins mediate the acceleration of fibril formation in vitro.",

Hahellin, a microbial homolog, is a natively unfolded protein that acquires a well-folded structure upon Ca2+ binding. Although the structure of \u03b2\u03b3-crystallin domains is well understood, the dynamical features are yet to be explored. We have investigated for the first time the equilibrium dynamics, conformational heterogeneity and associated low-lying free-energy states of hahellin in its Ca2+-bound form using NMR spectroscopy to understand the dynamics of a \u03b2\u03b3-crystallin domain. Hahellin shows large conformational heterogeneity with nearly 40% of the residues, some of which are part of Ca2+-binding loops, accessing alternative states. Further, out of the two Greek key motifs, which together constitute the \u03b2\u03b3-crystallin domain, the second Greek key motif is floppy as compared to its relatively rigid counterpart.

     "abstract": "SpvC, a virulence effector injected through type III secretion system by some Salmonella serovars, belongs to the newly discovered enzyme family, phosphothreonine lyase. Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that SpvC irreversibly inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases by removing the phosphate group from phosphothreonine-containing substrate through a \u03b2-elimination mechanism, and results in a \u03b2-methyldehydroalanine product. Interestingly, further biochemical investigations also indicated a secondary reaction occurring other than elimination, where a covalently bound complex is formed. Here, we employed molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations to gain insights on the microscopic details of such novel reaction mechanisms. Our theoretical results are consistent with the experimental observations, in which the critical stages of SpvC catalyzed reaction are revealed and the roles of several important binding site residues are reconciled. The deprotonation and precise position of the catalytic base K136 are facilitated by the formation of the fully desolvated active site upon substrate binding. The abstraction of the alpha hydrogen by K136 and the elimination of the phosphate group occur nearly simultaneously, promoted by the proton donation from the catalytic acid H106, and thus strongly supports an E2-like mechanism. K104, which is not directly involved in the enzymatic reaction, stabilizes the transition state and facilitates the reaction to occur. Remarkably, the subsequent deprotonation of K136 happens to be a natural sequel of the primary elimination reaction, restores its nucleophile capacity to attack the double bond containing elimination product, and leads to a covalently bound complex via a Michael-addition mechanism. The reaction mechanism used by phosphothreonine lyases might serve as a method of programmed regulation to fine tune their enzymatic activity.",

     "publication date": "08-2011",
     "abstract": "It is known that Ca2+ signal regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade by a central Ras protein in GTPase-cycle. Therefore, we construct an integrated theoretical model comprising Ca2+ oscillations, GTPase-cycle and MAPK cascade modules sequentially. Meanwhile, based on multiple feedback regulations in MAPK cascade, three operation modes of this model are introduced. An extended version of this model is further built when spatial heterogeneity is involved. These models allow us to investigate the very interesting and broad question about the effects of Ca2+ oscillations on the activation of MAPK cascade in both the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. When the Li\u2013Rinzel model is adopted to simulate endogenous Ca2+ oscillations, our theoretical results illustrate that the appropriate operation mode of MAPK cascade is required for the negative correlation between a decreasing frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and activation of MAPK cascade, which was found in the experiment (S. Kupzig et al. PNAS 102 (2005) 7577\u20137582). While a piecewise function is used to generate Ca2+ signal to explore much larger range of periods of Ca2+ oscillations, it is found that the negative correlation feature is independent on the operation mode of MAPK cascade. In this case, different operation modes only influence the strength of negative correlation between activation of MAPK cascade and periods of Ca2+ oscillations. The quantitative results may be of great use in analyzing interaction of IP3\u00a0\u2212\u00a0Ca2+ and Ras\u2013MAPK signaling pathways, and motivate the further experimental research.",

Cellular RNA polymerases are thought to be ratchets that can push each other forward to reduce pausing during elongation. Here, by constructing a two-dimensional energy landscape from the individual landscapes of active and backtracked enzymes, we identify a new pushing mechanism which is the result of a saddle trajectory that arises in the two-dimensional energy landscape of interacting enzymes. We show that this mechanism is more effective with an early transition state suggesting that interacting RNAPs might translocate via a power stroke.",

The ionisation state of Tyr-9, a residue critical to catalysis, influences \u03b19 dynamics, although the mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to probe the binding energetics of G-site (glutathione and glutathione sulfonate) and H-site (ethacrynic acid) ligands to wild-type and a Y9F mutant of human glutathione transferase A1-1. Although previous studies have reported a favourable entropic component to the binding of conjugates occupying both sites, our data reveal that ligand binding is enthalpically driven when either the G- or H-site is occupied independently. Also, heat capacity changes demonstrate that \u03b19 is fully localised by H-site but not G-site occupation. The Tyr-9 hydroxyl group contributes significantly to ligand binding energetics, although the effect differs between the two binding sites. G-site binding is made slightly enthalpically more favourable and entropically less favourable by the Y9F mutation. Binding to the H-site is more dramatically affected, with the Kd for ethacrynic acid increasing 5 fold despite a more favourable \u0394S. The heat capacity change is more negative for G-site binding in the absence of the Tyr-9 hydroxyl (\u0394\u0394Cp\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.73\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0K\u22121), but less negative for H-site binding to the Y9F mutant (\u0394\u0394Cp\u00a0=\u00a00.63\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0K\u22121).

The resonances of a number of residues were found to be selectively broadened, as the temperature was lowered at a pressure of 2000\u00a0bar. The resulting disappearance of cross-peaks includes those of residues in the \u03b2-domain of the protein and the cleft between the \u03b2- and \u03b1-domains, both located close to water-containing cavities. The results indicate that low-lying excited state conformers of hen lysozyme are characterized by slowly fluctuating local conformations around these cavities, attributed to the opportunities for water molecules to penetrate into the cavities. Furthermore, we have found that these water-containing cavities are conserved in similar positions in lysozymes from a range of different biological species, indicating that they are a common evolutionary feature of this family of enzymes.",

The whole hydration sites (HS) of lysozyme are composed of 195 single HSs and 38 clustered ones (CHS), and divided into 231 external HSs (EHS) and 2 internal ones (IHS).

The largest EHS, \u2018Clft\u2019, is located in the cleft region. The real hydration structure of a CHS is an ensemble of multiple structures. The transition between two structures occurs through recombinations of some H-bonds.

     "abstract": "Conformational properties of the full-length human and rat islet amyloid polypeptide 1\u201337 (amyloidogenic hIAPP and non-amyloidogenic rIAPP, respectively) were studied at 310 and 330\u00a0K by MD simulations both for the cysteine (reduced IAPP) and cystine (oxidized IAPP) moieties. At all temperatures studied, IAPP does not adopt a well-defined conformation and is essentially random coil in solution, although transient helices appear forming along the peptide between residues 8 and 22, particularly in the reduced form. Above the water percolation transition (at 320\u00a0K), the reduced hIAPP moiety presents a considerably diminished helical content remaining unstructured, while the natural cystine moiety reaches a rather compact state, presenting a radius of gyration that is almost 10% smaller and characterized by intrapeptide H-bonds that form many \u03b2-bridges in the C-terminal region. This compact conformation presents a short end-to-end distance and seems to form through the formation of \u03b2-sheet conformations in the C-terminal region with a minimization of the Y/F distances in a two-step mechanism: the first step taking place when the Y37/F23 distance is ~\u00a01.1\u00a0nm, and subsequently Y37/F15 reaches its minimum of ~\u00a00.86\u00a0nm. rIAPP, which does not aggregate, also presents transient helical conformations. A particularly stable helix is located in proximity of the C-terminal region, starting from residues L27 and P28. Our MD simulations show that P28 in rIAPP influences the secondary structure of IAPP by stabilizing the peptide in helical conformations. When this helix is not present, the peptide presents bends or H-bonded turns at P28 that seem to inhibit the formation of the \u03b2-bridges seen in hIAPP. Conversely, hIAPP is highly disordered in the C-terminal region, presenting transient isolated \u03b2-strand conformations, particularly at higher temperatures and when the natural disulfide bond is present. Such conformational differences found in our simulations could be responsible for the different aggregational propensities of the two different homologues. In fact, the fragment 30\u201337, which is identical in both homologues, is known to aggregate in vitro, hence the overall sequence must be responsible for the amyloidogenicity of hIAPP. The increased helicity in rIAPP induced by the serine-to-proline variation at residue 28 seems to be a plausible inhibitor of its aggregation.",

     "abstract": "The hydrophobic hydration processes have been analysed under the light of a mixture model of water that is assumed to be composed by clusters (W5)I, clusters (W4)II and free water molecules WIII. The hydrophobic hydration processes can be subdivided into two Classes A and B. In the processes of Class A, the transformation A(\u2212\u00a0\u03bewWI\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03bewWII\u00a0+\u00a0\u03bewWIII\u00a0+\u00a0cavity) takes place, with expulsion from the bulk of \u03bew water molecules WIII, whereas in the processes of Class B the opposite transformation B(\u2212\u00a0\u03bewWIII\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03bewWII\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03bewWI\u00a0\u2212\u00a0cavity) takes place, with condensation into the bulk of \u03bew water molecules WIII. The thermal equivalent dilution (TED) principle is exploited to determine the number \u03bew. The denaturation (unfolding) process belongs to Class A whereas folding (or renaturation) belongs to Class B. The enthalpy \u0394Hden and entropy \u0394Sden functions can be disaggregated in thermal and motive components, \u0394Hden\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394Htherm\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394Hmot, and \u0394Sden\u00a0=\u00a0\u0394Stherm\u00a0+\u00a0\u0394Smot, respectively. The terms \u0394Htherm and \u0394Stherm are related to phase change of water molecules WIII, and give no contribution to free energy (\u0394Gtherm\u00a0=\u00a00). The motive functions refer to the process of cavity formation (Class A) or cavity reduction (Class B), respectively and are the only contributors to free energy \u0394Gmot. The folded native protein is thermodynamically favoured (\u0394Gfold\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\u0394Gmot\u00a0<\u00a00) because of the outstanding contribution of the positive entropy term for cavity reduction, \u0394Sred\u00a0\u226b\u00a00. The native protein can be brought to a stable denatured state (\u0394Gden\u00a0\u2261\u00a0\u0394Gmot\u00a0<\u00a00) by coupled reactions. Processes of protonation coupled to denaturation have been identified. In thermal denaturation by calorimetry, however, is the heat gradually supplied to the system that yields a change of phase of water WIII, with creation of cavity and negative entropy production, \u0394Sfor\u00a0\u226a\u00a00. The negative entropy change reduces and at last neutralises the positive entropy of folding. In molecular terms, this means the gradual disruption by cavity formation of the entropy-driven hydrophobic bonds that had been keeping the chains folded in the native protein. The action of the chemical denaturants is similar to that of heat, by modulating the equilibrium between WI, WII, and WIII toward cavity formation and negative entropy production. The salting-in effect produced by denaturants has been recognised as a hydrophobic hydration process belonging to Class A with cavity formation, whereas the salting-out effect produced by stabilisers belongs to Class B with cavity reduction.Some algorithms of denaturation thermodynamics are presented in the Appendices.",

Although the phase behavior of the three proteins is quantitatively different, general trends emerge. Stable crystal nucleation does not occur within the salting-in region for the proteins examined, despite the crystal being observed as the most stable solid phase. Instead, two types of amorphous phases were found within the salting-in region; additionally, an analog to the instantaneous clouding curve was observed within the salting-in region for chymosin B. Also, protein solutions containing sulfate salts resulted in different crystal morphologies depending on whether Li2SO4 or (NH4)2SO4 was used.",

These facts allow one to obtain predictions of SK using a simplified charge model along with the DHE that are highly correlated with both the PBE and experimental binding data. The DHE-based model developed here, which was derived from the generalized Born model, explains the lack of correlation between SK and \u0394Gel in the presence of a dielectric discontinuity, which conflicts with the popular use of this supposed correlation to parse experimental binding free energies into electrostatic and nonelectrostatic components. Moreover, the DHE model also provides a clear justification for the correlations between SK and various empirical quantities, like the number of ion pairs, the ligand charge on the interface, the Coulomb binding free energy, and the product of the charges on the complex's components, but these correlations are weak, questioning their usefulness.",

     "abstract": "DNA hairpins consist of two distinct structural domains: a double stranded stem and a single-stranded loop that connect the two strands of the stem. Previous studies of short DNA hairpins have revealed that loop and stem sequences can significantly affect the thermodynamic stability of short DNA hairpins. In this work we present the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the helix-coil transition temperature (TM) for 11 16-base, hairpin-forming DNA oligonucleotides. All of the samples form a hairpin with a 6-base pair stem and a four-base loop. In addition, the four base pairs at the end of the stem distal from the loop are the same for every molecule. We have varied loop sequence and identity of the two duplex base pairs adjacent to the loop. Using the change in UV absorption to monitor the conformational state of the oligonucleotide the hairpin-coil transition temperature of these molecules was studied as a function of sodium ion concentration and pressure. From these data we calculated the volume change accompanying the transition. Model-dependent (van't Hoff) transition parameters such as \u0394HvH and transition volume (\u0394V) were estimated from the analysis of conformational transitions. Experiments revealed that the \u0394V for denaturation of these molecules range from \u2212\u00a02.35 to +\u00a06.74\u00a0cm3\u00a0mol\u22121. The expansibility (\u0394\u0394V/\u0394T) and the pressure dependence of cation release are also presented. The difference in the volume change for this transition is related to the differences in the hydration of these molecules.",

In the present study we investigated binding properties and the thermodynamic parameters of a water-soluble, cationic planar Cu(II)-containing meso-tetrakis(4-N-butyl-pyridiniumyl)porphyrin [CuTButPyP4] and nonplanar Co(II)-containing meso-tetrakis(4-N-butyl-pyridiniumyl)porphyrin [CoButPyP4] with calf thymus DNA in the presence of divalent manganese ions. For displaying the changes of thermodynamic parameters (Tm and \u0394T) the melting curves of DNA\u2013porphyrin complexes in the presence of Mn2+ ions have been obtained. The enthalpy (\u0394H) of helix\u2013coil transition has been also evaluated. It was shown that the binding of ions to DNA proceeds in two stages depending on the manganese/DNA phosphates molar ratio [Mn]/[P]. At the first stage (0.001\u00a0<\u00a0[Mn]/[P]\u00a0<\u00a01), the interaction of manganese ions with DNA phosphates occurs, causing an additional screening of their negative charge and the stabilization of the double helix. As a result, the best conditions for intercalation of CuTButPyP4 or of peripheral rings of CoButPyP4 occur. The significant increase of Tm, but less changes of \u0394T were observed. At the second stage (1\u00a0<\u00a0[Mn]/[P]\u00a0<\u00a04), the ions interact with both the phosphates and the nitrogen bases of DNA. At this stage, it is possible for the manganese ion to coordinate simultaneously to the oxygen atom of the phosphate and the neighboring base of DNA. At a higher [Mn]/[P] ratio, the destabilization of the double helix begins, and partial breakage of the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogen bases occurs. Respectively the destabilization of DNA in the presence of both porphyrins takes place.",

Computational analyses attempt at decoding the experimental nucleosome maps of genomes in terms of certain dinucleotide step periodicity observed along DNA. Such investigations show that highly significant information about the occurrence of a nucleosome along DNA is intrinsic in certain features of the sequence suggesting that DNA of eukaryotic genomes encodes nucleosome organization. Besides the bioinformatic approaches, physical models were proposed based on the sequence dependent conformational features of the DNA chain, which govern the free energy needed to transform recurrent DNA tracts along the genome into the nucleosomal shape.",

[(Griffith and Swartz, 2006) 1]. The functional form of the molar density profile for each species depends on geometry and the magnitude of the species-specific intra-tissue Damk\u00f6hler number. The tissue's central core is reactant starved at high consumption rates and low rates of intra-tissue diffusion when the Damk\u00f6hler number exceeds its geometry-sensitive critical value. Ideal tissue engineering designs avoid the diffusion-limited regime such that attached cells are exposed to all of the ingredients required for proliferation everywhere within a regenerative matrix. Analytical and numerical molar density profiles that satisfy the unsteady state modified diffusion equation with pseudo-homogeneous nth-order rates of intra-tissue consumption (i.e., n\u00a0=\u00a00,1,2) allow one to (i) predict von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u2013Pohlhausen mass transfer boundary layer thicknesses, measured inward from the external biomaterial surface toward its central core, and, most importantly, (ii) estimate the time required to achieve steady state conditions for regenerative tissue growth and biocatalytic sensing.",

Although the protein-film experimental set up is relatively simple, the redox mechanisms of many proteins are quite complicated, and very often they cannot be resolved without having support from adequate mathematical models. In this work we continue our contribution to modeling relevant redox mechanisms in protein-film voltammetry. We present results from the theoretical simulations of catalytic mechanism at the two-step successive surface redox reaction under conditions of square-wave voltammetry. This mechanism is assigned as a surface EEC\u2032, and it can be presented by the following simplified scheme: A(ads)\u00a0+\u00a0ne\u2212\u00a0\u21c4\u00a0B(ads)\u00a0+\u00a0ne\u2212\u00a0\u21c4\u00a0C(ads)\u00a0+\u00a0Substrate \u2192 k cat B(ads). Our attention is focused on several phenomena of this complex protein-film mechanism, while we give set of qualitative criteria to distinguish this mechanism from similar ones studied under voltammetric conditions. Moreover, we also provide hints to use methodologies for the determination of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters relevant to the protein-film EEC\u2032 mechanism. The considered protein-film EEC\u2032 mechanism is applicable to all lipophilic redox proteins that undergo electrochemical transformations in more than one successive electron steps.

Moderate perturbation of circular dichroic spectra of both the conformations of poly(A) in presence of these molecules with concomitant formation of prominent extrinsic CD bands in the 300\u2013450\u00a0nm region further revealed the association. Isothermal titration calorimetry results showed an overall entropy driven binding in all the four systems though the entropy change was maximum in daunomycin-ss poly(A) binding. The binding affinity was also maximum for daunomycin-ss poly(A) and varied as daunomycin-ds poly(A)>aristololactam-\u03b2-D-glucoside-ds poly(A)>aristololactam-\u03b2-D-glucoside-ss poly(A). A 1:1 binding stoichiometry was observed in all the cases, as confirmed by Job plot analysis, indicating the interaction to consist of a single binding mode. Ferrocyanide quenching studies showed good stacking interaction in all cases but was best for daunomycin-ss poly(A) interaction. No self-structure formation was observed in poly(A) with both daunomycin and aristololactam-\u03b2-D-glucoside suggesting the hindrance of the sugar moiety for such structural organization.",

Understanding their interactions with cellulose can improve biomass saccharification and enzyme recycling in biofuel production. This paper presents a study on binding and binding reversibility of Thermobifida fusca cellulases Cel5A, Cel6B, and Cel9A bound onto Bacterial Microcrystalline Cellulose. Cellulase binding was assessed through fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) at 23, 34, and 45\u00a0\u00b0C. It was found that cellulase binding is only partially reversible. For processive cellulases Cel6B and Cel9A, an increase in temperature resulted in a decrease of the fraction of cellulases reversibly bound, while for endocellulase Cel5A this fraction remained constant. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the FRAP curves to a binding-dominated model. The unbinding rate constants obtained for all temperatures were highest for Cel5A and lowest for Cel9A. The results presented demonstrate the usefulness of FRAP to access the fast binding kinetics characteristic of cellulases operating at their optimal temperature.",

Tetra-peptides were linked to the tri-cationic meso-tri(4-N-methylpyridyl)-mono-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin and bi-cationic meso-5,10-bis(4-N-methylpyridyl)-15,20-di-(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin. DNA binding of porphyrin derivatives, and their peptide conjugates was investigated with comprehensive spectroscopic methods. Titration of porphyrin conjugates with DNA showed changes in Soret bands with bathocromic shifts and hypochromicities. Decomposition of absorption spectra suggested the formation of two populations of bound porphyrins.Evidence provided by the decomposition of absorption spectra, fluorescence decay components, fluorescence energy transfer and induced CD signals reveals that peptide conjugates of di- and tricationic porphyrins bind to DNA by two distinct binding modes which can be identified as intercalation and external binding. Tri-cationic structure and elimination of negative charges in the peptide conjugates are preferable for the binding. Our findings provide essential information for the design of DNA-targeted porphyrin\u2013peptide conjugates.",

Bundles form fast, simultaneously with the polymerization of MgATP-G-actins, upon the addition of polycations to solutions of actins at low ionic strength conditions. This indicates that nuclei and/or nascent filaments bundle due to attractive, electrostatic effect of polycations and the neutralization of repulsive interactions of negative charges on actin. The attractive forces between the filaments are strong, as shown by the low (in nanomolar range) critical concentration of their bundling at low ionic strength. These bundles are sensitive to ionic strength and disassemble partially in 100\u00a0mM NaCl, but both the dissociation and ionic strength sensitivity can be countered by higher polycation concentrations. Cys374 residues of actin monomers residing on neighboring filaments in the bundles can be cross-linked by the short span (5.4\u00a0\u00c5) MTS-1 (1,1-Methanedyl Bismethanethiosulfonate) cross-linker, which indicates a tight packing of filaments in the bundles. The interfilament cross-links, which connect monomers located on oppositely oriented filaments, prevent disassembly of bundles at high ionic strength. Cofilin and the polysaccharide polyanion heparin disassemble lysozyme induced actin bundles more effectively than the polylysine-induced bundles. The actin-lysozyme bundles are pathologically significant as both proteins are found in the pulmonary airways of cystic fibrosis patients. Their bundles contribute to the formation of viscous mucus, which is the main cause of breathing difficulties and eventual death in this disorder.",

The observed changes in the fluorescence characteristics of polarity-sensitive probes Prodan and DMC, located in interfacial bilayer region, were interpreted due to the partial dehydration of the glycerol backbone, which was under the influence of aggregated protein. Cholesterol was found to prevent the perturbations of membrane polar part by lysozyme aggregates. Analysis of the pyrene excimerization data revealed an oligomer-induced reduction in bilayer free volume, presumably caused by an increased packing density of hydrocarbon chains. This effect proved to be virtually independent of membrane composition. It was demonstrated that membranotropic activity of oligomeric lysozyme markedly exceeds that of monomeric protein.

     "abstract": "There are many examples in the literature that deal explicitly with the coupling of ligand oligomerization with receptor binding. For example, many transcription factors dimerize and this plays a fundamental role in sequence specific DNA recognition. However, many biological macromolecules undergo reversible, large scale aggregation processes, some of which are indefinite. The thermodynamic coupling of these aggregation processes to other processes, such as protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013DNA interactions, has not been explored in depth. Here we consider the thermodynamic consequences of large scale ligand aggregation on the determination of fundamental thermodynamic parameters, such as equilibrium binding constants and ligand\u2013receptor stoichiometries. We find that a fundamental consequence of an aggregating ligand is that the free ligand concentration (ligand that is not found in aggregates) is buffered over a wide total ligand concentration range. In general, the larger the size of the aggregates, the wider the range over which the free ligand concentration is buffered. An additional consequence of this observation is that an upper limit is set on the fractional occupancy of the ligand's receptor, such that even if the ligand is over-expressed to very high levels in the cell, this will not necessarily ensure that 100% of the ligand's receptors will be occupied. The implications of these results for sequence specific DNA binding proteins will be discussed.",

We have proposed that this effect is due to the obstruction of ends by other polymers in the crowded gel. Here we use Ogston's theory describing spaces amid arrays of random rods to provide a framework for describing the failure of the polymers to propagate.

     "abstract": "Successful use of fluorescence sensing in elucidating the biophysical properties of lipid membranes requires knowledge of the distribution and location of an emitting molecule in the bilayer. We report here that 2,6-bis(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)pyridine (BBP), which is almost non-fluorescent in aqueous solutions, reveals a strong emission enhancement in a hydrophobic environment of a phospholipid bilayer, making it interesting for fluorescence probing of water content in a lipid membrane. Comparing the fluorescence behavior of BBP in a wide variety of solvents with those in phospholipid vesicles, we suggest that the hydrogen bonding interactions between a BBP fluorophore and water molecules play a crucial role in the observed \u201clight switch effect\u201d. Therefore, the loss of water-induced fluorescence quenching inside a membrane are thought to be due to deep penetration of BBP into the hydrophobic, water-free region of a bilayer. Characterized by strong quenching by transition metal ions in solution, BBP also demonstrated significant shielding from the action of the quencher in the presence of phospholipid vesicles. We used the increase in fluorescence intensity, measured upon titration of probe molecules with lipid vesicles, to estimate the partition constant and the Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) of transfer of BBP from aqueous buffer into a membrane. Partitioning BBP revealed strongly favorable \u0394G, which depends only slightly on the lipid composition of a bilayer, varying in a range from \u2212\u00a06.5 to \u2212\u00a07.0\u00a0kcal/mol. To elucidate the binding interactions of the probe with a membrane on the molecular level, a distribution and favorable location of BBP in a POPC bilayer were modeled via atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two different approaches: (i) free, diffusion-driven partitioning of the probe molecules into a bilayer and (ii) constrained umbrella sampling of a penetration profile of the dye molecule across a bilayer. Both of these MD approaches agreed with regard to the preferred location of a BBP fluorophore within the interfacial region of a bilayer, located between the hydrocarbon acyl tails and the initial portion of the lipid headgroups. MD simulations also revealed restricted permeability of water molecules into this region of a POPC bilayer, determining the strong fluorescence enhancement observed experimentally for the membrane-partitioned form of BBP.",

In the present study, our aim was to gain a deeper understanding of the penetration of articaine through biological membranes by studying the interactions of articaine with a phospholipid membrane. Our approach involves Langmuir monolayer experiments combined with molecular dynamics simulations. Membrane permeability of LAs can be modulated by pH due to a titratable amine group with a pKa value close to physiological pH. A change in protonation state is thus known to act as a lipophilicity switch in LAs. Our study shows that articaine has an additional unique lipophilicity switch in its ability to form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.

B/Z ratios were measured by CD and conformational effects of the aryl substitution determined by NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling. The para-substituent was found to have a significant effect on the B/Z DNA equilibrium caused by altering base-pair stacking of the B form and modifying the hydration/ion shell of the B form. A unique melting temperature versus salt concentration was observed and provides evidence relevant to the mechanism of B/Z conformational interconversion.",

These molecules varied in the type of the covalently attached lipid group, the nucleobase, and the number of hydrophobic moieties attached to the nucleoside. All five lipidated nucleosides were found to be surface-active and capable of forming stable monolayers. They could also be incorporated into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) monolayers, four of which induced expansion in the surface pressure isotherm and a decrease in the surface compression modulus of DPPC. In contrast, one nucleoside possessing three alkyl chain modifications formed very condensed monolayers and induced film condensation and an increase in the compression modulus for the DPPC monolayer, thus reflecting the importance of the ability of the nucleoside molecules to be arranged in a closely packed manner. The implications of these results lie on the possibility of tuning nucleic acid pairing by modifying structural characteristics of the liponucleosides.",

After introducing the general theory of the effects of shear forces on protein conformation, selected examples are presented in this review for biological macromolecules sensitive to shear stress. In particular, the biochemical effects of shear stress in controlling the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) conformation are extensively described. This protein, together with blood platelets, is the main actor of the early steps of primary haemostasis. Under the effect of shear forces >\u00a030\u00a0dyn/cm2, VWF unfolding occurs and the protein exhibits an extended chain conformation oriented in the general direction of the shear stress field. The stretched VWF conformation favors also a process of self aggregation, responsible for the formation of a spider web network, particularly efficient in the trapping process of flowing platelets. Thus, the effect of shear stress on conformational changes in VWF shows a close structure\u2013function relationship in VWF for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in arterial circulation, where high shear stress is present. The investigation of biophysical effects of shear forces on VWF conformation contributes to unraveling the molecular interaction mechanisms involved in arterial thrombosis.",

ITC was also used to measure the binding thermodynamics of a variety of sequence variants of the cocaine-binding aptamer that analyzed which regions and nucleotides of the aptamer are important for maintaining high-affinity binding. Individually, each of the three stems can be shortened, resulting in a reduced binding affinity. If all three stems are shortened, no binding occurs. If all three of the stems in the aptamer are lengthened by five base pairs ligand affinity increases. Changes in nucleotide identity at the three-way junction all decrease the affinity of the aptamer to cocaine.

     "abstract": "At equilibrium, every energetically feasible conformation of a protein occurs with a non-zero probability. Quantitative analysis of protein flexibility is thus synonymous with determining the proper Boltzmann-weighting of this conformational distribution. The exchange reactivity of solvent-exposed amide hydrogens greatly varies with conformation, while the short-lived peptide anion intermediate implies an insensitivity to the dynamics of conformational motion. Amides that are well-exposed in model conformational ensembles of ubiquitin vary a million-fold in exchange rates which continuum dielectric methods can predict with an rmsd of 3. However, the exchange rates for many of the more rarely exposed amides are markedly overestimated in the PDB-deposited 2K39 and 2KN5 ubiquitin ensembles, while the 2NR2 ensemble predictions are largely consistent with those of the Boltzmann-weighted conformational distribution sampled at the level of 1%. The correlation between the fraction of solvent-accessible conformations for a given amide hydrogen and the exchange rate constant for that residue provides a useful monitor of the degree of completeness with which a given ensemble has sampled the energetically accessible conformational space. These exchange predictions correlate with the degree to which each ensemble deviates from a set of 46 ubiquitin X-ray structures. Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov analysis for the distribution of intra- and inter-ensemble pairwise structural rmsd values assisted the identification of a subensemble of 2K39 that eliminates the overestimations of hydrogen exchange rates observed for the full ensemble. The relative merits of incorporating experimental restraints into the conformational sampling process are compared to using these restraints as filters to select subpopulations consistent with the experimental data.",

They lead to the prediction that the Arrhenius activation barrier is nearly zero for transitions from the dissociated state to the bound state. The second set of in silico experiments are nonequilibrium dynamics of pulling the drug molecules out of the binding pocket of scFv and the equilibration runs for drugs to fall back into the binding pocket. They demonstrate that extra water molecules (in addition to the two crystallographic waters) exist inside the binding pocket, underneath the drug molecules. These extra waters must have been evaporated from the binding pockets during the crystallization process of the in vitro experiments of structural determination. The third set of in silico experiments are nonequilibrium steered molecular dynamics simulations to determine the absolute binding free energies of METH and AMP to scFv. The center of mass of a drug molecule (METH or AMP) is steered (pulled) towards (forward) and away from (reverse) the binding site, sampling forward and reverse pulling paths. Mechanic work is measured along the pulling paths. The work measurements are averaged through the Brownian dynamics fluctuation dissipation theorem to produce the free-energy profiles of the scFv:drug complexes as a function of the drug\u2013scFv separation. These experiments lead to the theoretical prediction of absolute binding energies of METH and AMP that are in agreement with the in vitro experimental results.",

Recently, it has been argued that all cold-adapted enzymes with catalytic efficiency greater than that of their mesophilic counterparts display local flexibility or rigidity that are likely to cooperate, each acting on specific areas of the enzyme structure. Here we report an analysis of the normalized thermal B-factor distributions in psychrophilic proteins compared with those of their mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts with the aim to detect statistically significant local variations of relative backbone flexibility possibly linked to cold adaptation. We utilized a strategy based mainly on intra-family comparison of local distribution of normalized B-factors. After careful statistical treatment of data, the picture emerging from our results suggests that the distribution of the flexibility in psychrophilic enzymes is locally more heterogeneous than in their respective mesophilic homologues.",

Recent studies, which examined individual fibrin fibers or cylindrical fibrin clots, have shown that the mechanical properties of fibrin depend on the mechanical properties of the individual fibrin monomers. Within the fibrin monomer, three structures could contribute to these properties: the coiled-coil connectors the folded globular nodules and the relatively unstructured \u03b1C regions.

Recently, the ferrous derivative of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans cytochrome c\u2032 (Axcyt c\u2032) and of cardiolipin-bound horse heart cytochrome c (CL-hhcyt c) have been reported to bind NO to the \u201cdark side\u201d of the heme (i.e., as the proximal axial ligand) replacing the endogenous ligand His.

In contrast, CL-free hhcyt c does not bind CO and does not show peroxidase activity.

     "abstract": "Compatible solutes like ectoine and its derivatives are deployed by halophile organisms as osmolytes to sustain the high salt concentration in the environment. This work investigates the relation of the thermodynamic properties of compatible solutes and their impact as osmolytes. The ectoines considered in this work are ectoine, hydroxyectoine, and homoectoine. Besides solution densities (15\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C) and solubilities in water (3\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C), component activity coefficients in the aqueous solutions were determined in the temperature range between 0 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. The latter is important for adjusting a certain water activity and therewith a respective osmotic pressure within a cell. The characteristic effect of ectoines is compared to that of prolines, as well as to that of incompatible solutes as salts and urea. The experimental results show that the influence on the activity (coefficient) of water is quite different for compatible and incompatible solutes: whereas compatible solutes cause decreasing water activity coefficients, incompatible solutes lead to an increase in water activity coefficients. Based on this quantity, the paper discusses the impact of various osmolytes on biological systems and contributes to the explanation why some osmolytes are more often and at other temperatures used than others. Moreover, it was found that the anti-stress effect of an osmolyte is weakened in the presence of a salt.Finally, it is shown that the thermodynamic properties of compatible solutes can be modeled and even predicted using the thermodynamic model PC-SAFT (Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory).",

Budding, as a specific example of such shape transformations, was studied using giant unilamellar vesicles. Our aim was to identify the vesicle parameters that influence the degree of membrane budding by studying this process qualitatively and quantitatively. A simple theoretical model has been developed and assessed against the experimental observations. The results show that \u03b22GPI binds in a concentration dependent manner, causing transitions between vesicle shapes with increasing numbers of buds. Higher numbers of buds are characteristic of larger and/or more flaccid vesicles. When the vesicle membrane is strained, a higher \u03b22GPI concentration is needed to produce the same effects as on the unstrained vesicle. Vesicles were found to be highly individual in their behaviour, so each was treated individually.

In this FLIM\u2013FRET approach we study six different constructs where the BSA is covalently linked to one (BSA-F1) or five (BSA-F5) fluorescein molecules, one (BSA-T1) or seven (BSA-T7) rhodamine molecules, and hetero labeled with both (BSA-F4-T2 and BSA-F6-T1). The fluorescence intensity and decays were simultaneously measured at two different emission regions (green and red channels) of the labeled BSA deposited on substrates of different hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. To generate reliable data, several different regions (104\u00a0\u03bcm2 in each case) of the surfaces were scanned for each measurement. The amplitude-weighted lifetimes, obtained from the fluorescence decay parameters, are discussed based on the average distance between the conjugated fluorophores acting as a donor and acceptor pair in the Energy Transfer framework. The number of probes conjugated has significant effects on the fluorescence emission intensity and lifetimes in solution and on surfaces. The BSA-F4-T2 constructs showed a significant ability to differentiate using lifetime the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the surfaces, by detecting local expansion and contraction of protein structure in the deposited layers. Using these multiple labeled BSA probes in conjunction with FLIM\u2013FRET can provide a way to assess structural changes in proteins induced by variations in surface chemistry of biomaterials.",

These experiments were carried out at high and low temperatures and showed that OLP had a more pronounced effect on the packing of the phospholipid (PL) monolayers than CPZ. At pH 7.36, where OLP consists of one positive and one neutral species. In the present work we have studied the interaction of the drugs with monolayers of PLs by the Langmuir technique at pH 6.00 and 10.00 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The PLs were palmitoylphosphatidyl-choline(DPPC), 1-stearoyl-2-arachinodonoylphoshatidylcholine(SAPC),dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-serine(DPPS) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine(POPS). OLP has a pKa around 7.4, with one neutral and one positive species at pH 6.00 and pH 10.00, respectively. CPZ has pKa value around 9.4, and is positively charged at pH 6.00 and neutral at pH 10.00. Our studies revealed that the surface area of DPPC with CPZ in the subphase did not change at pH 6.00. In contrast, OLP increased the mean molecular area(MMA) of DPPC at pH 6.00, while CPZ caused distinct increase in MMA on the monolayer packing of all the other PLs, including monolayers of DPPC at pH 10.00. OLP, increased MMA of all PLs at both pHs. Further, OLP increased MMA of DPPC (pH 10.00), SAPC (pH 10.00), DPPS (pH 6.00) and POPS (pH 6.00) at 30\u00a0mN/m, the expected MMA of biological membranes. CPZ had the more pronounced effect at lift-off and gave an effect of the monolayers with negatively charged head groups in accordance our earlier experiments. However, CPZ affected the packing of the SAPC monolayer both at pH 6.00 and 10.00, and DPPC at pH 10.00. Both these PLs have neutral choline head group. Our results suggest that both drugs intercalate in the PL monolayers, and that the intercalation might involve electrostatic interaction with the head groups or hydrophobic interaction with the acyl chains of the PLs, or both. Probably the drugs intercalate to different extents depending on charge of both the drugs and the PL head groups. Our investigation may suggest that the interaction of CPZ and OLP with membrane PLs could be linked to both the psychotropic and the side effects.",

     "abstract": "Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP), present on the surface of chondrocyte- and osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs), plays key enzymatic functions during endochondral ossification. Many studies have shown that MVs are enriched in TNAP and also in cholesterol compared to the plasma membrane. Here we have studied the influence of cholesterol on the reconstitution of TNAP into dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-liposomes, monitoring the changes in lipid critical transition temperature (Tc) and enthalpy variation (\u2206H) using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DPPC-liposomes revealed a Tc of 41.5\u00a0\u00b0C and \u2206H of 7.63\u00a0Kcal\u00a0mol\u22121. The gradual increase in cholesterol concentration decrease \u2206H values, reaching a \u2206H of 0.87\u00a0Kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 for DPPC:cholesterol system with 36\u00a0mol% of cholesterol. An increase in Tc, up to 47\u00a0\u00b0C for the DPPC:cholesterol liposomes (36\u00a0mol% of Chol), resulted from the increase in the area per molecule in the gel phase. TNAP (0.02\u00a0mg/mL) reconstitution was done with protein:lipid 1:10,000 (molar ratio), resulting in 85% of the added enzyme being incorporated. The presence of cholesterol reduced the incorporation of TNAP to 42% of the added enzyme when a lipid composition of 36\u00a0mol% of Chol was used. Furthermore, the presence of TNAP in proteoliposomes resulted in a reduction in \u2206H. The gradual proportional increase of cholesterol in liposomes results in broadening of the phase transition peak and eventually eliminates the cooperative gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase transition of phospholipids bilayers. Thus, the formation of microdomains may facilitate the clustering of enzymes and transporters known to be functional in MVs during endochondral ossification.",

Synthesis and folding yields are optimal in phosphocholine lipids, particularly in short chain lipids and small vesicles, while lipid rafts do not promote folding compared to the folding in the absence of lipids. Truncated species are observed during translation in the presence of the periplasmic chaperone Skp, which likely binds to the newly synthesized polypeptide chain during cell-free translation and thus prematurely terminate polypeptide chain synthesis.

This suggests that dimer formation competes with folding and insertion of monomeric OmpA, though folded dimers slowly appear to convert to folded monomers.",

     "abstract": "The human DNA alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) is a DNA repair enzyme catalyzing the initial step of DNA repair via lesion excision. Its binding site has an incredible plasticity, and recognizes a variety of DNA lesions resulting from deamination or alkylation of adenine. Based on this plasticity, it is natural to wonder how, and if AAG can discriminate against undamaged adenine. It has even been proposed that it cannot. If, however, AAG is specific, the specificity can be expressed at the stage of the base binding, or base excision. There is also a possibility that the propensity of the base to flip out of the DNA double helix governs its selective subsequent removal. Here, we show that binding to AAG is, in fact, dramatically more thermodynamically favorable for hypoxanthine, at least, a specific lesion, produced by oxidative deamination of adenine, than for undamaged adenine. This preference originates from the more constructive interactions of the lesion with the binding site. Of these, a shorter hydrogen bond between the lesion and the backbone of His136 that does not cause a structural distortion of the base in a major player, in agreement with an earlier kinetic study (P.J. O'Brien and T. J. Ellenberger, J. Biol. Chem. 279 (2004), 9750\u20139757). Mutating His136 to Pro almost completely eliminates the selectivity. Otherwise, bound adenine and the lesion are positioned very similarly at the binding site, suggesting no predisposition to selective removal. The base flip out of the double helix that precedes the binding has approximately equal thermodynamic facility for the lesion and undamaged adenine. This study employs the Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with Free Energy Perturbation, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.",

We have constructed homology models of the ligand binding domains of the human umami receptor (based on crystallographic structures of the metabotropic glutamate receptor of the central nervous system). We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the ligand binding domains, and we find that the likely conformation is that T1R1 receptor protein exists in the closed conformation, and T1R3 receptor in the open conformation in the heterodimer. Further, we have identified the important binding interactions and have made an estimate of the relative free energies associated with the two glutamate binding sites.",

Both peptides bind to DOPC/lipid II membranes with high affinity (KD 0.30\u00a0\u03bcM and 0.27\u00a0\u03bcM).

Here we present a detailed thermodynamic description of radicicol binding to human Hsp90 and yeast Hsc82 studied by isothermal titration calorimetry and thermal shift assay. Titrations as a function of pH showed a linked protonation event upon radicicol binding. The intrinsic binding constant and the thermodynamic parameters (including the enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity) were determined for yeast Hsc82, and human alpha and beta Hsp90. Recent experimental evidence in literature shows that yeast Hsc82 has significant differences from human Hsp90 isozymes. Here we support this by demonstrating differences in radicicol binding thermodynamics to these proteins. The intrinsic enthalpy of radicicol binding to Hsc82 was \u221246.7\u00a0kJ/mol, to Hsp90alpha \u221270.7\u00a0kJ/mol, and to Hsp90beta was \u221266.8\u00a0kJ/mol.

Exposure to OS induces the accumulation of intracellular ROS, which in turn causes cell damage in the form of protein, lipid, and/or DNA oxidations. Such conditions are believed to be linked to numerous diseases or simply to the ageing of tissues. However, the controlled generation of ROS via photosensitizing drugs or photosensitizers (PS) is now widely used to treat various tumors and other infections [2], [3]. Here we present a method to track the chemical changes in a cell after exposure to oxidative stress. OS is induced via fullerols, a custom made water soluble derivative of fullerene (C60), under visible light illumination. Synchrotron-based Fourier Transform InfraRed Microspectroscopy (S-FTIRM) was used to assess the chemical makeup of single cells after OS exposure. Consequently, a chemical fingerprint of oxidative stress was probed in this study through an increase in the bands linked with lipid peroxidation (carbonyl ester group at 1740\u00a0cm\u22121) and protein phosphorylation (asymmetric phosphate stretching at 1240\u00a0cm\u22121).",

Two parameters, a distance metric, P, and correlation coefficient, r, are combined to produce a \u2018similarity metric,\u2019 \u03c1, which can be used to classify unknown thermograms into pre-characterized categories. Simulated thermograms known to lie within or fall outside of the 90% quantile range around a median reference are also analyzed.

In this review we discuss a family of sensors that have been developed in our laboratory that share a common simple biophysical mechanism of action and that are capable of rapid detection of a diverse range of biological targets. The sensors generate fluorescence signal in the presence of the target molecule through target-induced association of short fluorochrome-labeled complementary oligonucleotides that are attached to target recognition elements of the sensors (antibodies, aptamers, etc.) via nanometer scale flexible linkers. This sensor design can be used for detecting proteins, antibodies, nucleic acids and whole cells. The assays using these sensors require only adding a sample to the sensor mix followed by simple fluorescence intensity readout. The simplicity, the speed of detection and the potential for miniaturization are the main assets of these sensors.",

The principle of this method is to construct a network of the initial components, reaction intermediates and end-products by forming a network of nodes. This network is then solved, node by node, breaking the initial problem into smaller partial problems, still obeying the laws of chemical reaction kinetics and without ignoring any parts of the problem.This method provides an easy and quick way to study complex binding reactions since simulation networks are simple to construct directly from the reaction scheme.

The principle of thermal equivalent dilution (TED) is the potent tool (Ergodic Hypothesis) employed to monitor the water equilibrium and to determine the number \u03bew of water molecules WIII involved in each process. The hydrophobic hydration processes can be subdivided into two Classes: Class A includes those processes for which the transformation A(\u2212\u03bewWI\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03bewWII\u00a0+\u00a0\u03bewWIII\u00a0+\u00a0cavity) takes place with the formation of a cavity, by expulsion of \u03bew water molecules WIII whereas Class B includes those processes for which the opposite transformation B(\u2212\u03bewWII\u00a0\u2212\u00a0\u03bewWIII\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03bewWI\u00a0\u2212\u00a0cavity) takes place with reduction of the cavity, by condensation of \u03bew water molecules WIII.

In this article, we discuss the results of experimental studies (circular-dichroism, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry) of the structure of \u03b2-hairpin-forming peptides excised from the B1 domain of protein G, which are known to fold on their own. We demonstrate that local interactions at the turn sequence and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues are the dominant structure-determining factors, while there is no convincing evidence that stable backbone hydrogen bonds are formed in these peptides in aqueous solution. Consequently, the most plausible mechanism for folding of the \u03b2-hairpin sequence appears to be the broken-zipper mechanism consisting of the following three steps: (i) bending the chain at the turn sequence owing to favorable local interactions, (ii) formation of loose hydrophobic contacts between nonpolar residues, which occur close to the contacts in the native structure of the protein but not exactly in the same position and, finally, (iii) formation of backbone hydrogen bonds and locking the hydrophobic contacts in the native positions as a hydrophobic core develops, sufficient to dehydrate the backbone peptide groups. This mechanism provides sufficient uniqueness (contacts form between residues that become close together because the chain is bent at the turn position) and robustness (contacts need not occur at once in the native positions) for folding a \u03b2-hairpin sequence.",

While the intrinsically inhomogeneous and dynamic nature of unfolded and partially folded states limits the efficacy of traditional X-ray diffraction and solution NMR in structural studies, solid state NMR methods applied to frozen solutions can circumvent the complications due to molecular motions and conformational exchange encountered in unfolded and partially folded states. Moreover, solid state NMR methods can provide both qualitative and quantitative structural information at the site-specific level, even in the presence of structural inhomogeneity. This article reviews relevant solid state NMR methods and their initial applications to protein folding studies. Using either chemical denaturation to prepare unfolded states at equilibrium or a rapid freezing apparatus to trap non-equilibrium, transient structural states on a sub-millisecond time scale, recent results demonstrate that solid state NMR can contribute essential information about folding processes that is not available from more familiar biophysical methods.",

Due to the lack of an organizing mastermind, the decision whether a protein participates in anterograde/retrograde transport or rather stays in its compartment has to be made by a self-organization process on the molecular scale. Minimizing the hydrophobic mismatch between a protein and the surrounding lipid bilayer has been shown to be an important determinant of protein localization. It has remained elusive, however, how mislocalized proteins sense that remote organelles may provide a better lipid environment, i.e. how proteins differentially control their journey along the secretory pathway. Here we show by coarse-grained membrane simulations that proteins partition into the lipid phase with the smallest hydrophobic mismatch on heterogeneous membranes while they cluster and even segregate as homo-oligomers according to their hydrophobic mismatch on a homogeneous bilayer. We propose that protein sorting is facilitated by stabilizing coat proteins at clusters of mislocalized proteins that experience a hydrophobic mismatch.",

When using a protein coil library to model the Boltzmann-weighted conformational distribution for the various N-acetyl-[X-Ala]-N-methylamides and N-acetyl-[Ala-Y]-N-methylamides, the acidity of the central amide in the individual conformers of each peptide spans nearly a million-fold range. Nevertheless, population averaging of these conformer acidities predicts the standard sidechain-dependent hydrogen exchange correction factors for nonpolar model peptides to within a factor of 30% (100.11) with a correlation coefficient r\u00a0=\u00a00.91. Comparison with the analogous continuum dielectric calculations for the other N-acetyl-[X-Y]-N-methylamides indicates that deviations from the isolated residue hypothesis of classical polymer theory predict appreciable errors in the exchange rates for conformationally disordered peptides when the standard sidechain-dependent hydrogen exchange rate correction factors are assumed to be independently additive. Although electronic polarizability generally dominates the dielectric shielding for the \u223c\u00a010\u00a0ps lifetime of peptide ionization, evidence is presented for modest contributions from rapid intrarotamer conformational reorganization of Asn and Gln sidechains.",

     "abstract": "It is puzzling that in spite of its single-headed structure, myosin-IX can move processively along actin. Here, based on the experimental evidence that the strong binding of myosin to actin in rigor state induces structural changes to several local actin monomers, a Brownian ratchet model is proposed to describe this processive movement. In the model, the actin plays an active role in the motility of single-headed myosin, in contrast to the common belief that the actin acts only as a passive track for the motility of the myosin. The unidirectional movement is due to both the asymmetric periodic potential of the myosin interacting with actin and the forward Stokes force induced by the relative rotation of the neck domain to the motor domain, while the processivity is determined by the binding affinity of the myosin for actin in ATP state. This gives a good explanation to the high processivity of myosin-IX, which results from its high binding affinity for actin in ATP state due to the presence of unique loop 2 insertion or N-terminal extension. The experimental results on the motility of myosin-IX such as the step size, large forward/backward stepping ratio, run length, stall force, etc, are explained well.",

     "abstract": "The interpretation of electrical phenomena in biomembranes is usually based on the assumption that the experimentally found discrete ion conduction events are due to a particular class of proteins called ion channels while the lipid membrane is considered being an inert electrical insulator. The particular protein structure is thought to be related to ion specificity, specific recognition of drugs by receptors and to macroscopic phenomena as nerve pulse propagation. However, lipid membranes in their chain melting regime are known to be highly permeable to ions, water and small molecules, and are therefore not always inert. In voltage-clamp experiments one finds quantized conduction events through protein-free membranes in their melting regime similar to or even undistinguishable from those attributed to proteins. This constitutes a conceptual problem for the interpretation of electrophysiological data obtained from biological membrane preparations.Here, we review the experimental evidence for lipid ion channels, their properties and the physical chemistry underlying their creation. We introduce into the thermodynamic theory of membrane fluctuations from which the lipid channels originate. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the appearance of lipid channels can be influenced by the alteration of the thermodynamic variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, tension and chemical potentials) in a coherent description that is free of parameters. This description leads to pores that display dwell times closely coupled to the fluctuation lifetime via the fluctuation\u2013dissipation theorem. Drugs as anesthetics and neurotransmitters are shown to influence the channel likelihood and their lifetimes in a predictable manner. We also discuss the role of proteins in influencing the likelihood of lipid channel formation.",

The related complex SRII\u2013HtrII from Natronobacterium pharaonis exhibits a hydrogen bond between the receptor Y199 and transducer N54. This bond has been suggested to mediate signal relay in the SRII\u2013HtrII system. Our previous results on the SRI\u2013HtrI complex indicated that HtrI N53 forms a hydrogen bond at the cytoplasm-proximity of the membrane.

Each of the tyrosine residues Y197, Y208, Y210 and Y213 were conservatively exchanged for phenylalanine but only the Y210F mutation led to the disappearance of the infrared band of the terminal amide C=O of N53.

     "abstract": "Compatible solutes are small organic osmolytes responsible for osmotic balance and at the same time compatible with the cellular metabolism. Here, we have investigated the effect of the compatible solutes, ectoine and hydroxyectoine, on the fluid\u2013rigid domain structure of lipid monolayer and bilayer membranes. Mainly saturated dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine membranes exhibiting a clear le/lc phase transition were used. Fluorescence microscopy showed that ectoines added to the aqueous subphase expand and fluidize the lipid monolayers especially at surface pressures below 30\u00a0mN/m. The domain structure at the le/lc phase transition is sensitively modified leading to smaller but more numerous domains in the presence of ectoines. Hydroxyectoine was more efficient than ectoine. These results are explained by the replacement theory assuming that the ectoines are likely to be expelled from the membrane surface thus favoring the hydration of the lipid membrane. This effect reduces the line tension, which is the interfacial energy at the domain edges leading to reduced domain sizes and increased number of rigid domains. Isotherms of negatively charged phosphatidylglycerol membranes show a similar expansion, while unsaturated lipids are less affected. Mixed phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol membranes exhibit the same effect on the line tension increasing the tendency for a phase separation. This could be shown also in bilayer vesicles, where the compatible solutes have only a minor effect on the lipid main phase transition in pure DPPC membranes but reduce the extent of the pretransition. In mixed DPPC/DPPG bilayer membranes ectoines cause a phase separation leading to the enrichment of expanded DPPC domains. In conclusion, our study gives for the first time evidence that ectoines have an effect on lipid membranes increasing the hydration of the surface and thus increasing the mobility of the lipid head groups and fluidizing the lipid layer accordingly. This increased fluidity may be of advantage for cell membranes to withstand extreme conditions like temperature or osmotic pressure and might also accelerate cellular repair mechanisms.",

The interactions of amyloidogenic peptides with surfaces such as biological membranes are considered to play an important role regarding the onset of secondary structure changes. In our project, we used a peptide designed to have specific secondary structure propensities in order to investigate the driving forces and conditions which lead to the \u03b2-sheet formation. The model peptide is able to adopt the coiled coil conformation, \u03b1-helical peptide strands that wind around each other in a superhelical structure. In addition to building principles stabilizing this \u03b1-helical conformation it also has \u03b2-sheet stabilizing features. We focused on the interactions of the peptide with the hydrophobic air\u2013water interface. Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy was used as a surface sensitive method and complemented with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction and reflectivity. Furthermore, the model peptide provides metal binding sites. The binding of transition metal ions leads to a local preference of certain secondary structure elements, depending on the metal ion and the geometry of metal ion binding sites. The interplay and competition of the two trigger mechanisms (1) interaction with surfaces and (2) metal ion complexation were investigated. We found that the secondary structure of the peptide strongly depends on the interactions with the hydrophobic air-water interface and the orientation imposed by it. The metal ions Zn2+ and Cu2+ were used for complexation. The structure of the peptide surface layer differs according to the bound metal ion.",

     "abstract": "Aggregation of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) into cytotoxic \u03b2-sheet oligomers and amyloid plaques is considered a key event in pancreatic \u03b2-cell degeneration in type 2 diabetes (T2D). hIAPP is synthesized in the pancreatic \u03b2-cells and it is stored, co-processed in the secretory granules, and co-secreted to the extracellular matrix together with insulin. In vivo, hIAPP aggregation may start and proceed at the water-cell membrane interface and anionic lipid membranes strongly enhance the process of hIAPP fibrillization which is causally linked to membrane disintegration and cell degeneration. In this study we explored the amyloidogenic propensity and conformational properties of hIAPP in the presence of negatively charged membrane (DOPC/DOPG phospholipid bilayers) surfaces upon addition of two recently designed potent hIAPP-derived inhibitors of hIAPP amyloidogenesis, the hexapeptide NF(N-Me)GA(N-Me)IL (NFGAIL-GI) and the 37-residue non-amyloidogenic hIAPP analog [(N-Me)G24, (N-Me)I26]-IAPP (IAPP-GI). For comparison, the effects of insulin, which is a natively occurring hIAPP aggregation inhibitor, rat IAPP (rIAPP), which is a natively non-amyloidogenic hIAPP analog, and the hIAPP amyloid core peptide hIAPP(22-27) or NFGAIL were also studied. The aim of our study was to test whether and how the above peptides which have been shown to completely block or suppress hIAPP amyloidogenesis in bulk solution in vitro would also affect these processes in the presence of lipid membranes. To this end, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) was applied. We find that IAPP-GI, NFGAIL-GI, insulin, and rIAPP are potent inhibitors of hIAPP fibrillization. Importantly, our data also suggest that the hetero-complexes of IAPP-GI, rIAPP, and insulin with hIAPP although non-amyloidogenic per se are still able to adsorb at the lipid membrane. By contrast, in the presence of NFGAIL-GI, interaction of hIAPP with the lipid membrane is completely abolished, consistent with NFGAIL-GI mediated sequestration of hIAPP via hetero-complexation in the aqueous phase mainly accounting for the observed strong effect of NFGAIL-GI on hIAPP fibrillogenesis at the lipid membrane interface. Finally, our studies show that once hIAPP is fibrillized at the water-lipid membrane interface with fibrils being attached to the lipid membrane, it cannot be disaggregated by all above peptides.",

Data obtained over a range of detergent and lipid concentrations could be rationalised in terms of a three-stage phase separation model involving bilayer, bilayer/micelle coexistence, and micellar ranges, yielding the detergent/lipid phase diagrams and the bilayer-to-micelle partition coefficients of both detergent and lipid. The most notable difference between the lipids investigated was a substantial widening of the bilayer/micelle coexistence range for E. coli lipid, which was due to an increased preference of the detergent and a decreased affinity of the lipid for the micellar phase as compared with the bilayer phase. These effects on the bilayer-to-micelle partition coefficients could be explained by the high proportion in E. coli membranes of lipids possessing negative spontaneous curvature, which hampers both their transfer into strongly curved micellar structures as well as the insertion of detergent into condensed bilayers.",

We present a model for the electrostatic contribution to the nonideality of a two-component acidic\u2013zwitterionic lipid membrane. Our model is based on the mean-field Poisson\u2013Boltzmann approach; it includes a protonation/deprotonation equilibrium applicable to acidic lipids such as phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylglycerol. It also includes an electrostatic model for zwitterionic lipids such as phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine that accounts for the spatial separation of the two headgroup charges and the orientational freedom of the headgroup. Modeling the nonelectrostatic contribution to the free energy using the Bragg\u2013Williams approximation of a binary lattice gas enables us to compute binodal lines that reflect the influence of membrane electrostatics on the nonideal mixing properties of the bilayer. If we neglect the zwitterionic lipid's electrostatic contribution, then increasing pH is predicted to always oppose demixing, stabilizing the membrane due to the repulsion between the charged lipids. If the electrostatic properties of the zwitterionic lipids are accounted for, this opposing tendency weakens and may even reverse. In this case, increasing the fraction of charged lipids through increasing pH would, somewhat unexpectedly, promote domain formation. We discuss the corresponding physical mechanism.",

     "abstract": "The current mid-infrared spectroscopic study is a systematic investigation of hydrated stratum corneum lipid barrier model systems composed of an equimolar mixture of a ceramide, free palmitic acid and cholesterol. Four different ceramide molecules (CER NS, CER NP, CER NP-18:1, CER AS) were investigated with regard to their microstructure arrangement in a stratum corneum lipid barrier model system. Ceramide molecules were chosen from the sphingosine and phytosphingosine groups. The main differences in the used ceramide molecules result from their polar head group architecture as well as hydrocarbon chain properties. The mixing properties with cholesterol and palmitic acid are considered. This is feasible by using perdeuterated palmitic acid and proteated ceramides. Both molecules can be monitored separately, within the same experiment, using mid-infrared spectroscopy; no external label is necessary.At physiological relevant temperatures, between 30 and 35\u00a0\u00b0C, orthorhombic as well as hexagonal chain packing of the ceramide molecules is observed. The formation of these chain packings are extremely dependent on lipid hydration, with a decrease in ceramide hydration favouring the formation of orthorhombic hydrocarbon chain packing, as well as temperature. The presented data suggest in specific cases phase segregation in ceramide and palmitic acid rich phases. However, other ceramides like CER NP-18:1 show a rather high miscibility with palmitic acid and cholesterol. For all investigated ternary systems, more or less mixing of palmitic acid with cholesterol is observed. The investigated stratum corneum mixtures exhibit a rich polymorphism from crystalline domains with heterogeneous lipid composition to a \u201cfluid\u201d homogeneous phase. Thus, a single gel phase is not evident for the presented stratum corneum model systems.The study shows, that under skin physiological conditions (pH 5.5, hydrated, 30\u201335\u00a0\u00b0C) ternary systems composed of an equimolar ratio of ceramides, free palmitic acid and cholesterol may form gel-like domains delimitated by a liquid-crystalline phase boundary.

Remarkably, the balance between these different activities seems to be regulated by protein oligomerization.

Such analysis of simulated sedimentation equilibrium distributions points to the adequacy of both the scaled particle theory and potential-of-mean-force methods for determining the self-association constant. Although the latter method usually entails the assignment of a magnitude to monomer net charge, this requirement can be obviated to some extent by repeating the analysis for a range of monomer charges and identifying the most appropriate value as that associated with a minimum in the sum-of-squares-of-residuals (SSR) of the best-fit descriptions of the sedimentation equilibrium distribution. Reasonable estimates of the association constant are usually obtained from corresponding analyses of the same sedimentation equilibrium distributions with activity coefficients obtained by scaled particle theory, an approach which also involves the identification of parameters on the basis of a minimum in SSR. However, the value of monomer charge determined must be regarded as a curve-fitting parameter rather than a true measure of monomer charge. Similar qualifications are shown to prevail in the scaled particle theory approach, which also involves the identification of parameters (the effective monomer volume and the polymer/monomer volume ratio) on the basis of a minimum in SSR. We therefore recommend discontinuation of the practice whereby quite precise distinction between modes of self-association has been attempted on the grounds of the physical credibility of the magnitudes of these additional curve-fitting parameters.",

We show by luminescence spectroscopy that by substituting the dppz ligand with alkyl ether chains of increasing length the complexes can be tuned from preferential intercalation into DNA to insertion in model phospholipid membranes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) on methanol fixed CHO-K1 cells show an analogous distribution in the cell, where the least hydrophobic complex exclusively stains the nucleus whereas the more hydrophobic ones seem to predominantly stain membrane structures in the cytoplasm. In live cells CLSM show that initially only the more hydrophobic derivatives stain the plasma membrane. However, brief further exposure to the laser light causes permeabilization of the membrane and accumulation of extracellular ruthenium complexes in internal cellular structures, similarly to the distribution found in fixed cells.",

When combined with conformational sampling techniques, they allow for an exhaustive exploration of the enzymatic mechanism. Heme proteins are ubiquitous and essential for every organism. In this review we summarize our efforts towards the understanding of heme biochemistry. We present: 1) results on ligand migration on globins coupled to the ligand binding event, 2) results on the localization of the spin density in compound I of cytochromes and peroxidases, 3) novel methodologies for mapping the electron transfer pathways and 4) novel data on Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. For this enzyme our results strongly indicate that the distal oxygen will end up on the C3 indole carbon, whereas the proximal oxygen will end up in the C2 position. Interestingly, the process involves the formation of an epoxide and a heme ferryl intermediate. The overall energy profile indicates an energy barrier of approximately 18\u00a0kcal/mol and an exothermic driving force of almost 80\u00a0kcal/mol.",

     "abstract": "Amyloid-like fibrils had been associated with many fatal diseases, and the rational design of the fibrillization inhibitors holds the great promise of finding the prevention and treatment options. The understanding of the mechanisms by which the small molecules can inhibit the aggregation plays the key role in such design. Here we present the results of MD simulations that provide the atomistic details of the process, by which the small molecules may destabilize the ordered amyloid oligomers formed by the model hexapeptide. We select a heptapeptide fragment (GNNQQNY) from Sup-35 yeast prion protein, which is capable to form both amyloid fibrils and microcrystals. Atomic-resolution structures of its crystals were reported by Eisenberg et al. (Nature 447:453, 2007). We analyze several MD trajectories describing the evolution of the decamer fragment taken from this crystal structure, both by itself and in the presence of myricetin and kaempferol (two naturally occurring polyphenols, found to be strong and weak aggregation inhibitors). While the decamer of GNNQQNY demonstrates remarkable stability of its structure after 2\u00a0ns simulation, myricretin disturbs the aggregation. The simulations show myricetin interacts with the \u03b2-sheet due to polar interactions with side chains of the peptide weakening the interstrand hydrogen bonds, wrapping the \u03b2-sheet and disaggregating the outer layer. Both backbone to backbone and side chain to side chain hydrogen bonds are lost, and the \u03b2-sheets are moving away from each other. This leads to the loss of backbone H-bonding and eventual separation of one \u03b2-strands from the outer layer. We also test several AMBER force fields and implicit solvent models for their ability to keep the decamer of GNNQQNY aggregated. The RMSDs of decamer of GNNQQNY with force field 99SB and implicit solvent models of igb2 and igb5, were maintained at less than 4\u00a0\u00c5.",

Site-directed multi-distance measurements using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between functional loops register two excited protein states for low- and high-affinity ligand binding.

A \u201ccrankshaft\u201d like movement is detected for the loop AB in a low pH transition. At pH 7.3 the holo-protein assumes a high-affinity excited protein state, in which the loop AB is more compact (RMS\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u00a0\u00c5). In the apo-holo transition, the reporter Trp 28 moves about 4.5\u00a0\u00c5 that reflects a decrease in distance between Glu27 and Lys108.

     "abstract": "The relevance of protein stability for biological function and molecular evolution is widely recognized. Protein stability, however, comes in two flavours: thermodynamic stability, which is related to a low amount of unfolded and partially-unfolded states in equilibrium with the native, functional protein; kinetic stability, which is related to a high free-energy barrier \u201cseparating\u201d the native state from the non-functional forms (unfolded states, irreversibly-denatured protein). Such barrier may guarantee that the biological function of the protein is maintained, at least during a physiologically relevant time-scale, even if the native state is not thermodynamically stable with respect to non-functional forms. Kinetic stabilization is likely required in many cases, since proteins often work under conditions (harsh extracellular or crowded intracellular environments) in which deleterious alterations (proteolysis, aggregation, undesirable interactions with other macromolecular components) are prone to occur. Also, kinetic stability may provide a mechanism for the evolution of optimal functional properties. Furthermore, enhancement of kinetic stability is essential for many biotechnological applications of proteins. Despite all this, many published studies focus on thermodynamic stability, partly because it can be easily quantified in vitro for small model proteins and, also, because of the availability of computational algorithms to estimate mutation effects on thermodynamic stability. In this review, the opposite bias is purposely adopted: the experimental evidence supporting widespread kinetic stabilization of proteins is summarized, the role of natural selection in determining this feature is discussed, possible molecular mechanisms responsible for kinetic stability are described and the relation between kinetic destabilization and protein misfolding diseases is highlighted.",

The isodesmic association scheme was also found to quantitatively account for the concentration dependence of the weight-average molecular weight derived from previously published sedimentation equilibrium measurements made at pH 7.0, and the best-fit value of the stepwise equilibrium constant obtained therefrom was in excellent agreement with that obtained from analysis of the light scattering data obtained at pH 7.2.",

As a case study the crystalline form (a monoclinic polymorph) of l-cysteine (+NH3\u2013CH(CH2SH)\u2013COO\u2212) \u2014 an essential amino acid \u2014 has been selected. Crystals of amino acids are widely used to mimic important structural and dynamic features of peptides. The conformational lability of cysteine and the dynamics of the thiol-side chains are known to account for various phase transitions in the crystalline state and for the conformational transitions important for the biological function in the peptides. The effect of temperature on the monoclinic polymorph of l-cysteine, metastable at ambient conditions, has been studied for the first time. A dynamical transition at about 150\u00a0K, marking a crossover of the molecular fluctuations between harmonic and non-harmonic dynamical regimes, was evidenced by evaluating the evolution of the mean-square displacement obtained from the elastic fixed window approach using the backscattering spectrometer IN10 located at the ILL. Although this transition does not manifest itself in the DSC, it was clearly observed by incoherent inelastic neutron scattering. By analyzing the dynamical susceptibility contribution (\u03c7\u2033(\u03c9)) obtained using IN6 also at ILL we were able to evidence another relaxation process at a different time scale. The disordered soft l-cysteine structure has an excess of inelastic scattering at about 3\u00a0meV, analogous to the \u201cboson peak\u201d observed in glass-like materials and proteins. High-precision X-ray diffraction has revealed an anomaly in the changes of selected unit cell parameters and volume at about 240\u00a0K.",

Hence, it is not surprising that different aspects of Ca2+ dynamics are in the focus of in-depth and extensive investigations. Efforts concentrate on the development of proper theoretical models that would provide a unified description of Ca2+ signaling. Remarkably, experimentally recorded Ca2+ signals exhibit a rather large diversity, which can be observed irrespective of the cell type, measuring techniques, or the nature of the signal. Our goal in the present study therefore is to present a theoretical explanation for the variability observed in experiments, whereby we focus on caffeine-induced Ca2+ responses in isolated airway myocytes. By employing a stochastic model, we first test whether the observed variability can be attributed to intrinsic fluctuations that are a common feature of biochemical reactions that govern Ca2+ signalization. We find that stochastic effects, within ranges that correspond to actual conditions in the cell, are far too modest to explain the large diversity observed in experimental data. Foremost, we reveal that only cell variability in theoretical modeling can appropriately describe the observed diversity in single-cell responses.",

     "abstract": "We have investigated the regulation of the oscillatory generation of H2O2 and oscillations in shape and size in neutrophils in suspension. The oscillations are independent of cell density and hence do not represent a collective phenomena. Furthermore, the oscillations are independent of the external glucose concentration and the oscillations in H2O2 production are 180\u00b0 out of phase with the oscillations in NAD(P)H. Cytochalasin B blocked the oscillations in shape and size whereas it increased the period of the oscillations in H2O2 production. 1- and 2-butanol also blocked the oscillations in shape and size, but only 1-butanol inhibited the oscillations in H2O2 production. We conjecture that the oscillations are likely to be due to feedback regulations in the signal transduction cascade involving phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K). We have tested this using a simple mathematical model, which explains most of our experimental observations.",

     "abstract": "In this study absorbance, fluorescence, circular dichroic spectroscopy, viscosity, thermal melting and calorimetric techniques were employed to understand the binding of the phenothiazinium dye, thionine, with deoxyribonucleic acids of varying base composition. Strong hypochromic and bathochromic effects and quenching of fluorescence were observed that showed strong binding of thionine to the DNAs. The binding parameters evaluated from Scatchard analysis through McGhee\u2013von Hippel analysis showed that the binding was non-cooperative and affinities of the order of 105\u00a0M\u22121. The results of ferrocyanide fluorescence quenching studies and viscosity experiments, taken together suggested the intercalation of thionine while thermal melting, differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroic studies provided evidence for the thermal stabilization and conformational perturbations associated with the binding. The thermodynamic parameters elucidated through sensitive isothermal titration calorimetric studies suggested that the binding was exothermic, characterized by negative enthalpy and large positive entropy changes and that the non-electrostatic contributions play a significant role for thionine association to DNA. The heat capacity changes obtained from the temperature dependence of enthalpy changes gave negative values suggesting substantial hydrophobic contribution in the DNA binding process of thionine. Further, an observation of enthalpy\u2013entropy compensation in the DNA binding also suggested the involvement of multiplicity of non covalent interactions in the binding process. The base specificity of the complexation and energetics of the interaction of thionine to DNA are obtained for the first time from this study.",

Those results have been analyzed by assuming that the absolute mobility of a particular topoisomer is mainly a function of the integral number of superhelical turns, and thus a slowly varying function of plasmid molecular weight. In examining the mobilities of Lk topoisomers for a series of plasmids that differ incrementally in size over more than one helical turn, we found that the size-dependent agarose-gel mobility of individual topoisomers with identical values of Lk (but different values of the excess linking number, \u0394Lk) vary dramatically over a duplex turn.

The magnitude of LD in the DNA absorption region reflects the flexibility and length of DNA when the conditions for measurement are properly adjusted. The double stranded DNA cleavage increases the flexibility of DNA and reduces the length, reducing the magnitude of LD in DNA absorption region. Utilizing this LD property, the cleavage was detected in real-time by measuring the LD magnitude with respect to time. The decrease in the LD magnitude was described as the sum of two exponentials. The fast component was tentatively assigned to the cleavage of the single strand, reflecting the increase in the flexibility of DNA, and the slow component was assigned to the cut of the double strand which reduced the length of DNA. The average reaction time was the fastest for the ZnII complex and the slowest for the NiII complex. The reaction time of the CdII complex was as fast as that of the ZnII complex.

     "abstract": "Protein denaturation events are generally associated with a change in the state of ionization of abnormally titrating groups and, therefore, are coupled with changes in buffer ionization/neutralization equilibria. Consequently, buffer ionization should influence the measured change in volume accompanying protein denaturation. Changes in volume accompanying protein denaturation reflect the differential packing and hydration of polypeptide chains in their native and denatured conformations while also describing the pressure stability of proteins. A characteristic feature of conformational transitions of globular proteins is a near zero change in volume that is comparable in magnitude with the volume of ionization of biologically relevant buffers. Thus, the impact of buffer ionization on the volume of protein denaturation could be very significant with the potential to affect not only its magnitude but also its sign. To investigate this point quantitatively, we performed pressure perturbation calorimetric (PPC) studies of lysozyme and ribonuclease A at pH 3.0 in four buffers differing in their ionization volumes. Our results identify buffer ionization as an important determinant of protein transition volume that needs to be carefully taken into account. We emphasize that the importance of our results is not limited to PPC measurements but is more general and applies to all volumetric investigations, in particular, extending to the derivation of the pressure\u2013temperature phase diagram of protein stability.",

     "abstract": "Obesity is a serious public health concern with an increasing prevalence worldwide. The diet contributes strongly to this problem and high-fat food leads to unhealthy conditions. Fat digestion is an energy intensive process as it requires hydrolysis to allow the body to profit from this nutrient. This additional energy expenditure is also present in a highly redundant hormonal regulation system for fat storage which is converted in not a readily accessible form (therefore, an upstream is required in order to tackle fat-related diseases).Due to the low water solubility of oils and fats, the lipase catalyzed reactions take place at a specific locus, the oil\u2013water interface. Despite considerable efforts in the past the effects of the interfacial composition on lipase activity have been only qualitatively understood until recently. It has recently been undertaken a detailed study of the interfacial behavior of lipases, their substrates and products which have contributed to shed light into the mechanism of lipolysis [1\u20134]. In addition, there are strong evidences that lipase activity is a function of interfacial composition and changes concurrently with lipolytic conversion [1]. In these cases lipase \u201cinhibition\u201d should be attributed to substrate depletion and not to lipase desorption or denaturation as previously hypothesized [5]. This self-limiting effect through the feedback of interfacial composition to the reaction conditions of the enzyme opens a new avenue to control lipase catalysis through the interface. A set of experiments are proposed which can be performed to further characterize and gain a deeper insight into interfacial enzymology.",

An increase in sedimentation rate and static light scattering, and changes in the nucleic acid CD spectrum all suggest that this ligand acts to condense the plasmid. Dynamic light scattering suggests the hydrodynamic radii of the condensate particles are a few micrometers, ca. 50-fold larger than that of the monomeric plasmid. Condensation of the plasmid also produces a ca. 100-fold decrease in the strand break yield produced by gamma irradiation. This extensive protection against reactive intermediates in the bulk of the solution implies that condensed plasmid DNA may offer a model system with which to study the direct effect of ionizing radiation (ionization of the DNA itself). The use of peptide ligands as condensing agents in this application is attractive because the derivatives of several amino acids (particularly tryptophan and tyrosine) have been shown to modify the radiation chemistry of DNA extensively.",

     "abstract": "Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) technique, supported by light scattering measurements and spectroscopic data (circular dichroism and fluorescence) allowed us to restore the 3D structure at low resolution of defatted human serum albumin (HSA) in interaction with ibuprofen. The data were carried out on a set of HSA solutions with urea concentrations between 0.00 and 9.00\u00a0M. The Singular Value Decomposition method, applied to the complete SAXS data set allowed us to distinguish three different states in solution. In particular a native conformation N (at 0.00\u00a0M urea), an intermediate I1 (at 6.05\u00a0M urea) and an unfolded structure U (at 9.00\u00a0M urea) were recognized. The low-resolution structures of these states were obtained by exploiting both ab initio and rigid body fitting methods. In particular, for the protein without denaturant, a conformation recently described (Leggio et al., PCCP, 2008, 10, 6741\u20136750), very similar to the crystallographic heart shape, with only a slight reciprocal movement of the three domains, was confirmed. The I1 structure was instead characterized by only a closed domain (domain III) and finally, the recovered structure of the U state revealed the characteristic feature of a completely open state. A direct comparison with the free HSA pointed out that the presence of the ibuprofen provokes a shift of the equilibrium towards higher urea concentrations without changing the unfolding sequence. The work represents a type of analysis which could be exploited in future investigations on proteins in solution, in the binding of drugs or endogenous compounds and in the pharmacokinetic properties as well as in the study of allosteric effects, cooperation or anticooperation mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) with long, terminal runs of consecutive guanines, and either a dA or dT tract at the other end form higher-order structures called DNA frayed wires. These aggregates self-assemble into species consisting of 2, 3, 4, 5, \u2026 associated strands. Some of the remarkable features of these structures are their extreme thermostability and resistance to chemical denaturants and nucleases. However, the nature of the molecular interactions that stabilize these structures remains unclear. Based on dimethyl sulfate (DMS) methylation results, our group previously proposed DNA frayed wires to be a unique set of nucleic-acid assemblies in which the N7 of guanine does not participate in the guanine\u2013guanine interactions. To probe the hydrogen bonding involved in the stabilization of d(A15G15) frayed wires, we used Raman spectroscopy in which the DNA sample is held in photonic crystal fibers. This technique significantly enhances the signals thus allowing the use of very low laser power. Based on our results for d(A15G15) and those of incorporating the isoelectronic guanine analog pyrazolo[3,4,-d]pyrimidine or PPG, into a frayed wire-forming sequence, we provide evidence that these structures are based on the G-quadruplex model. Furthermore, from the Raman spectrum, we observed markers that are consistent with the presence of deoxyguanosine residues in the syn conformation, this suggests the presence of anti-parallel G-quadruplexes. To identify the species that contain syn guanine residues, we used circular dichroism and gel electrophoresis to study an ODN in which all of the guanine residues were brominated, d(A158-BrG15). In the presence of potassium, d(A158-BrG15) forms what appears to be an anti-parallel dimeric G-quadruplex. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a DNA sequence having all its guanine residues replaced by 8-bromo-guanine and maintaining its ability to form a G-quadruplex structure.",

In order to verify the connection between conformational substates of the Fe(III)\u2013Met80 linkage and the 695\u00a0nm band spectral heterogeneity, we have performed experiments as a function of pH (neutral and acidic) and temperature (room and 20\u00a0K). At room temperature, the ECD spectrum is blue shifted with respect to the absorption one; the shift is more pronounced at acidic pH and is compatible with the presence of sub-bands. ECD measurements at 20\u00a0K highlighted the heterogeneous nature of the 695\u00a0nm band and provided direct experimental evidence for the presence of sub-bands. Indeed, while the absorption spectra remained deceivingly unstructured, the ECD spectra showed well resolved peaks and shoulders. A consistent fit of the 20\u00a0K absorption and ECD spectra showed that five Gaussians (each centered at the same frequency in the absorption and ECD spectrum) are able to reproduce the observed lineshapes. A careful analysis of frequency shifts and intensity ratios of these sub-bands enabled us to identify at least three distinct sub-bands arising from taxonomic conformational substates of the Fe(III)\u2013Met80 linkage. In view of the major influence of the Fe(III)\u2013Met80 linkage on the redox potential of ferricytochrome c, we speculate that these spectrally distinguishable substates may have different functional roles.",

     "abstract": "Many enzymes possess, besides their native function, additional promiscuous activities. Proteins with several activities (multipurpose catalysts) may have a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical applications. Natural promiscuity, however, appears to be of limited scope in this context, because the latent (promiscuous) function is often related to the evolved one (sharing the active site and even the chemical mechanism) and its enhancement upon suitable mutations usually brings about a decrease in the native activity. Here we explore the use of computational protein design to overcome these limitations. The high-plasticity positions close to the original (\u201cnative\u201d) active-site are the most promising candidates for mutations that create a second active-site associated to a new function. To avoid compromising protein folding and native activity, we propose a minimal-perturbation approach based on the combinatorial optimization of, both the de novo catalytic activity and the folding free-energy: essentially, we construct the Pareto Set of optimal stability/promiscuous-function solutions. We validate our approach by introducing a promiscuous esterase activity in E. coli thioredoxin on the basis of mutations at positions close to the native-active-site disulfide-bridge. Native oxidoreductase activity is not compromised and it is, in fact, found to be 1.5-fold enhanced, as determined by an insulin-reduction assay. This work provides general guidelines as to how computational design can be used to expand the scope and applications of protein promiscuity. From a more general viewpoint, it illustrates the potential of multi-objective optimization as the computational analogue of multi-feature natural selection.",

     "abstract": "In aqueous solution, the monofluorinated phospholipid 1-palmitoyl-2-[16-fluoropalmitoyl]sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (F-DPPC) interdigitates without the use of inducing agents. To understand the thermal and physical properties of this unique lipid, F-DPPC was combined with the non-fluorinated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and 1,2-diarachidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DAPC). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the miscibility and thermotropic phase behavior of these binary lipid mixtures. In addition, the fluorescent probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and a DPH-labeled analogue of DPPC, 2-(3-(diphenylhexatrienyl) propanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (\u03b2-DPH HPC, aka DPH-PC or DPHpPC), were used to detect interdigitation. In F-DPPC, the fluorescence intensity of both probes decreased a similar amount and to a degree that is consistent with an interdigitated system. We also determined that there are two separate effects of increasing the ratio of F-DPPC in the DPPC/F-DPPC system. With low amounts of F-DPPC, there is little evidence that the system is heavily interdigitated. Instead, we hypothesize that the introduction of F-DPPC provides nucleation sites that alter the kinetics, reversibility, and temperature of the main transition (Tm). At higher mol% of F-DPPC, we propose that interdigitated F-DPPC-rich domains form to create a phase-segregated system. While DPPC/F-DPPC was highly miscible, the DAPC/F-DPPC system was significantly less miscible. Additionally, we observed that DAPC/F-DPPC samples have reduced solubility in water, which affected the acquisition of fluorescence data. However, our DSC results indicate the existence of DAPC-rich and F-DPPC-rich components. Furthermore, this data support that the mixing was disruptive to lipid packing and that the presence of DAPC hinders the interdigitation of F-DPPC.",

Recent studies demonstrate that the nature product curcumin is an efficient inhibitor of GLOI, but its binding mechanism towards GLOI is still unclear. In the present study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to better understand the inhibitory mechanism of curcumin towards GLOI. The enol form of curcumin coordinates with the catalytic zinc ion of GLOI and forms a strong hydrogen bond with Glu 172, whereas its keto tautomer displays unfavorable electrostatic interactions with Glu 172 and Glu 99. The calculated binding free energies suggest that GLOI prefers the primary enol form (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a030.38\u00a0kcal/mol) to the keto tautomer (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212\u00a024.16\u00a0kcal/mol). The present work also reveals that bisdemethoxycurcumin binds to GLOI in a similar manner as curcumin and exhibits a slightly less negative predicted binding free energy, which is further validated by our comparative kinetics analysis (Ki\u00a0=\u00a018.2 and 10.3\u00a0\u03bcM for bisdemethoxycurcumin and curcumin, respectively). Results of the study can provide an insight into the development of novel and more effective GLOI inhibitors.",

In this paper, an implicit biological membrane environment has been constructed in lattice space, in which the lipid chains and water molecules were represented by the unoccupied lattice sites. The biological membrane was characterized with three features: stronger hydrogen bonding interaction, membrane lateral pressure, and lipophobicity index for the amino acid residues. In addition to the hydrocarbon core spanning region and the water solution, the lipid interface has also been represented in this implicit membrane environment, which was proved to be effective for the transmembrane protein's folding. The associated Monte Carlo simulations have been performed for SARS-CoV E protein and M2 protein segment (residues 18\u201360) of influenza A virus. It was found that the coil\u2013helix transition of the transmembrane segment occurred earlier than the coil\u2013globule transition of the two terminal domains. The folding process and final orientation of the amphipathic helical block in water solution are obviously influenced by its corresponding hydrophobicity/lipophobicity. Therefore, this implicit membrane environment, though in lattice space, can make an elaborate balance between different driving forces for the membrane protein's folding, thus offering a potential means for the simulation of transmembrane protein oligomers in feasible time.",

Analysis of the molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that anions induced unfolding of the \u03b12 and \u03b11 helices at the carboxyl ends which are located on the opposite ends of the \u03b1-helix core. An internalized water molecule was observed inside the unfolded \u03b12 C-end. Strong interactions of anions with the R30 regulating network or simultaneous interactions of anions with the phospholipid-binding site and the R30 hydrogen bonding network triggered unfolding of the \u03b12 C-end. An increase of anion density for two residues of the phospholipid-binding site (K1, R17, and Q22) or R17 and R19 and a preceding unfolding of the \u03b12 C-end were necessary for unfolding of the \u03b11 C-end. Anions interacted primarily with residues of the phospholipid-binding site and the R30 network while the \u03b11/\u03b12 hydrophobic region was void of anions. However, during strong interactions of anions with the R30 network and phospholipid-binding site, the \u03b11/\u03b12 hydrophobic region attracted anions which interacted with conserved residues of the \u03b11 C-end. Analysis of anion-induced rearrangements pointed to auxiliary residues of the R30 network and the phospholipid-binding site.

The latter consisted in bilayers built-up of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), classes of lipids found in the outer and inner moieties of the erythrocyte and most cell membranes, respectively. This report presents evidence that naproxen interacts with red cell membranes as follows: a) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies on human erythrocytes it has been observed that the drug induced shape changes, forming echinocytes at a concentration as low as 10\u00a0\u00b5M; b) X-ray diffraction showed that naproxen strongly interacted with DMPC multilayers; in contrast, no perturbing effects on DMPE multilayers were detected; c) differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data showed a decrease in the melting temperature (Tm) of DMPC liposomes, which was attributed to a destabilization of the gel phase, effect that was less pronounced for DMPE. These experimental results were observed at concentrations lower than those reported for plasma after therapeutic administration.

     "abstract": "Transport across the cell membrane is crucial in drug delivery. However, the process is complicated because nucleoside derivatives that are commonly used as anti-viral drugs are transported through two different types of specific transporters: concentrative transporters and equilibrative transporters. Cross-disciplinary approaches involving both biological experiments and theoretical considerations are therefore necessary to study the transport of nucleoside analogues such as ribavirin. Here we constructed an experimental model system using the Xenopus laevis oocyte that expressed examples of both types of transporters: human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 and human equilibrative transporter 1. We also performed a kinetic study. Experimental results showed that the transport of ribavirin could be reduced by inhibiting one of the two types of transporters, which seems to be counterintuitive. We therefore designed a simple mathematical model of the dynamics of ribavirin uptake and analyzed the model behaviors using a numerical simulation. The theoretical results reproduced the experimentally observed phenomena and suggested a possible mechanism for the process. Based on this mechanism, we predicted some potential methods for the effective uptake of ribavirin from a dynamics point of view.",

First, the energy decomposition approach is applied to natural sequences associated to a well-defined structure to identify the principal energetic coupling interactions necessary to stabilize it, defining the specific energetic signature for the fold. Then, several different sequences are threaded on the defined 3D structure and only those sequences whose energetic signature (pattern) is close to that of the natural sequence, according to a similarity criterion, are selected as able to populate the specific fold. Furthermore, it is possible to evaluate the fitness of a certain sequence for a fold by combining the information provided by the energetic signature to that contained in the contact map, which recapitulates the fold topology. The results show that the better fit between the energetic properties of a sequence and the topology corresponds to a better stabilization of the protein fold by that sequence. We applied this approach to a library of natural and artificial WW domain sequences, previously developed by the Ranganathan group, containing sequences that are experimentally known to be able and unable to fold into native structures. The results show that our approach can correctly identify 70% of the sequences known to populate the typical WW domain fold.",

     "abstract": "The interactions of oxidative stress biomarkers: homocysteine (Hcys) and cysteine (Cys) with the multifunctional gold nanoparticles, important in view of novel biomedical applications in diagnostics and therapy, have been investigated using resonance elastic light scattering (RELS), UV\u2013Vis plasmonic spectroscopy, and high-resolution TEM imaging. The Hcys-induced assembly of gold nanoparticles has been observed for non-ionic surfactant-capped gold nanoparticles as well as for negatively-charged citrate-capped gold nanoparticles. We have observed for the first time the de-aggregation of citrate-capped gold nanoparticle ensembles followed by their conversion to citrate-linked Hcys-capped nanoparticle assemblies. The Cys molecules, which are smaller than Hcys by only one CH2 group, show much less activity. The mechanisms leading to this intriguing disparity in the abilities of these two thioaminoacids to ligand exchange with surfactant- or citrate-capping molecules of the gold nanoparticle shells are proposed on the basis of the experimental evidence, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. For citrate-capped gold nanoparticles, we postulate the formation of surface complexes facilitated by electrostatic attractions and formation of double hydrogen bonds for both Hcys and Cys. The conformational differences between these two kinds of complexes result in marked differences in the distance between \u2013SH groups of the biomarkers to the gold surface and different abilities to induce nanoparticle assembly. Analytical implications of these mechanistic differences are discussed.",

Analysis of the distribution of the particles formed in the solution of \u03b1-lactalbumin after the addition of DTT by size showed that the initial stage of the aggregation process was the stage of formation of the start aggregates with the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 80\u2013100\u00a0nm. Further growth of the protein aggregates proceeds as a result of sticking of the start aggregates. Suppression of \u03b1-lactalbumin aggregation by \u03b1-crystallin is mainly due to the increase in the duration of the lag period on the kinetic curves of aggregation. It is assumed that the initially formed complexes of unfolded \u03b1-lactalbumin with \u03b1-crystallin were transformed to the primary clusters prone to aggregation as a result of the redistribution of the denatured protein molecules on the surface of the \u03b1-crystallin particles.",

Arg15 in human GSTA1-1 was replaced with a leucine and crystallographic, spectroscopic, thermodynamic and molecular docking methods were used to investigate the contribution made by Arg15 towards (i) the binding of glutathione (GSH) to the G-site, (ii) the pKa of the thiol group of GSH, (iii) the stabilization of an analog of the anionic transition state of the SNAr reaction between 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and GSH, and, (iv) the binding of the anionic non-substrate ligand 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS) to the H-site. While the R15L mutation substantially diminishes the CDNB\u2013GSH conjugating activity of the enzyme, it has little effect on protein structure and stability. Arg15 does not contribute significantly towards the enzyme's affinity for GSH but does determine the reactivity of GSH by reducing the thiol's pKa from 7.6 to 6.6. The anionic \u03c3-complex formed between GSH and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene is stabilized by Arg15, suggesting that it also stabilizes the transition state formed in the SNAr reaction between GSH and CDNB. The trinitrocyclohexadienate moiety of the \u03c3-complex binds the H-site where the catalytic residue, Tyr9, was identified to hydrogen bond to an o-nitro group of the \u03c3-complex. The affinity for ANS at the H-site is decreased about 3-fold by the R15L mutation implicating the positive electrostatic potential of Arg15 in securing the organic anion at this site.",

     "abstract": "We have numerically studied the firing synchronization transitions on random thermo-sensitive neuron networks in dependence on information transmission delay \u03c4, network randomness p, and coupling strength g. It is found that as \u03c4 is increased the neurons can exhibit transitions from burst synchronization (BS) to clustering anti-phase synchronization (APS), and further to spike synchronization (SS). It is also found that, with increasing p or g, there are transitions from spatiotemporal chaos to BS, then to APS, and finally to SS. However, the APS state with p or g exists only for intermediate \u03c4 values within a narrow range. For \u03c4 values outside this range, the APS state does not appear and the firings change directly from spatiotemporal chaos to BS or SS. These results show that, as time delay can do, network topology and coupling strength can also cause complex synchronization transitions in the neurons. In particular, the novel phenomenon of APS state with p or g shows that, with the help of appropriate random connections or coupling strength, the neurons may exhibit the APS behavior at a certain time delay for which the APS does not appear originally. These findings imply that time delay, network randomness, and coupling strength may have subtle effects on the firing behaviors on neuronal networks, and thus could play important roles in the information processing in neural systems.",

We have studied conformations and thermodynamic stability of a number of modified TBA oligonucleotides containing thiophosphoryl substitution at different internucleotide sites. Using circular dichroism such modifications were found not to disrupt the antiparallel intramolecular quadruplex specific for TBA. Nevertheless, the presence of a single thiophosphoryl bond between two G-quartet planes led to a significant decrease in the quadruplex thermostability. On the contrary, modifications in each of the loop regions either stabilized an aptamer structure or did not reduce its stability. According to the thrombin time test, the aptamer with thio-modifications in both TT loops (LL11) exhibits the same antithrombin efficiency as the original TBA. This aptamer shows better stability against DNA nuclease compared to that of TBA. We conclude that such thio-modification patterns are very promising for the design of anticoagulation agents.",

It is shown that, under white-light illumination and aerobic conditions, chlorophyll a (Chl a) bound in the intact Cyt b6f can be bleached by light-induced 1O2*, and that the 1O2* production can be promoted by D2O or scavenged by extraneous antioxidants such as l-histidine, ascorbate, \u03b2-carotene and glutathione. Under similar experimental conditions, 1O2* was also detected in the Rieske-depleted Cyt b6f complex, but not in the isolated Rieske Fe\u2013S protein. The results prove that Chl a cofactor, rather than Rieske Fe\u2013S protein, is the specific site of 1O2* formation, a conclusion which draws further support from the generation of 1O2* with selective excitation of Chl a using monocolor red light.",

In this work, a computational model that enables a quantitative description of the light-induced proton gradients across the membrane of PSI proteoliposomes is presented. Using a set of electrodiffusion equations, a compartmental model of a vesicle suspended in aqueous medium was studied. The light-mediated proton movement was modeled as a single proton pumping step with backpressure of the electric potential. The model fits determinations of pH obtained from PSI proteoliposomes illuminated in the presence of mediators of cyclic electron transport. The model also allows analysis of the proton gradients in relation to the transmembrane ion fluxes and electric potential. Sensitivity analysis enabled a determination of the parameters that have greater influence on steady-state levels and onset/decay rates of transmembrane pH and electric potential. This model could be used as a tool for optimizing PSI proteoliposomes for photo-electrochemical applications.",

We demonstrated that proteins involved into apo \u03b1-LA/LYS microspheres exchange with those free in solution. The exchange process takes place from the periphery to the centre of the microspheres. The formed spherical particles observed after fixed incubation time were found to be either individual or aggregated according to the total protein concentration leading to structures with different size and morphology. It appears that protein assembly occurs throughout successive steps of aggregated spherical particles that reorganise into biggest isolated microspheres. Direct microscopic observations over time confirm that microspheres resulted from a reorganisation of aggregated, clustered nanospheres.

The voltammetric transduction was achieved by coupling ferrocene moiety to streptavidin linked to biotinylated tDNA. The mass-related frequency transduction was implemented by immobilizing the sensory pDNA on a gold-coated quartz crystal piezoresonators oscillating in the 10\u00a0MHz band. The high sensitivity of these sensors enabled us to study DNA damage caused by representative toxicants and environmental pollutants, including Cr(VI) species, common pesticides and herbicides. We have found that the sensor responds rapidly to any damage caused by Cr(VI) species, with more severe DNA damage observed for Cr2O72\u2212 and for CrO42\u2212 in the presence of H2O2 as compared to CrO42\u2212 alone. All herbicides and pesticides examined caused DNA damage or structural alterations leading to the double-helix unwinding. Among these compounds, paraoxon-ethyl and atrazine caused the fastest and most severe damage to DNA. The physico-chemical mechanism of damaging interactions between toxicants and DNA has been proposed. The methodology of testing voltammetric and nanogravimetric DNA-hybridization biosensors developed in this work can be employed as a simple protocol to obtain rapid comparative data concerning DNA damage caused by herbicide, pesticides and other toxic pollutants. The DNA-hybridization biosensor can, therefore, be utilized as a rapid screening device for classifying environmental pollutants and to evaluate DNA damage induced by these compounds.",
