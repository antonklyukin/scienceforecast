     "abstract": "Binge alcohol drinking is a health burden in the United States, which has an alarming economic impact. Unfortunately, medications available for alcohol abuse have low efficacy or adverse side effects, creating a need to evaluate novel therapies. Growing research suggests that 18-Methoxycoronaridine (18-MC), an \u03b13\u03b24 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, may be effective at reducing ethanol consumption. However, its effects on binge-like ethanol consumption and other ethanol behaviors have not been examined. The present study examined the effect of \u03b13\u03b24 nAChRs antagonism on basal locomotor activity in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Next we tested the effect of 18-MC on binge-like ethanol consumption, ethanol-induced sedation, and ethanol metabolism. Finally, we tested the effect of \u03b13\u03b24 nAChRs on saccharin consumption to ensure effects were specific for ethanol. We observed that 18-MC decreased binge-like ethanol consumption without altering saccharin consumption, the sedative effects of ethanol, or ethanol metabolism. High doses of 18-MC caused locomotor sedation in C57BL/6J mice, but the effects were brief and likely did not contribute to differences in ethanol consumption. Our results support the involvement of the \u03b13\u03b24 nAChRs in binge-like ethanol intake, and further work should explore the use of 18-MC for treatment of alcohol use disorders.",

     "publication date": "09-2019",
     "abstract": "Early life stress (ELS) or alcohol consumption can influence DNA methylation and affect gene expression. Monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) encodes the enzyme that metabolizes monoaminergic neurotransmitters crucial for the stress response, alcohol reward, and reinforcement. Previously, we reported lower Maoa expression in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum of male rats exposed to ELS during the first three postnatal weeks, and to voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood, compared with controls. The present study continued to investigate the effect of ELS and alcohol consumption on Maoa methylation, and its relation to Maoa expression in these animals. We selected candidate CpGs after performing next-generation bisulfite sequencing of the Maoa promoter, intron 1\u20135, and exons 5 and 6, together composed of 107 CpGs (5\u2032-cytosine-phosphate-guanosine-3\u2032), in a subgroup of rats. Pyrosequencing was used to analyze the methylation of 10 candidate CpGs in the promoter and intron 1 in the entire sample. ELS and alcohol displayed an interactive effect on CpG-specific methylation in the dorsal striatum. CpG-specific methylation correlated with Maoa expression, corticosterone levels, and alcohol consumption in a brain region-specific manner. CpG-specific methylation in the Maoa promoter was a potential moderator of the interaction of ELS with alcohol consumption on Maoa expression in the NAc. However, the findings were sparse, did not survive correction for multiple testing, and the magnitude of differences in methylation levels was small. In conclusion, CpG-specific Maoa methylation in the promoter and intron 1 may associate with ELS, alcohol consumption, and Maoa expression in reward-related brain regions.",

     "abstract": "Individuals fetally exposed to alcohol have a disproportionate risk for developing lifetime alcohol dependence, an association that may be confounded by the presence of comorbid conditions, such as anxiety. Anxiety is also observed following fetal alcohol exposure and is known to exacerbate ethanol consumption, highlighting the utility of animal models to assess this relationship. The present study evaluated the impact of third-trimester equivalent ethanol exposure on ethanol consumption and anxiety-like, marble burying behavior in adult, male C57BL/6 mice following exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol vapor, proposed to model dependence. Neonatal mice (P5\u20136, 2.5\u20133.0\u00a0g) were administered one injection of saline or ethanol (2.5\u00a0g/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.]). Pre-vapor marble burying and limited-access two-bottle choice ethanol intake (15% v/v, 2\u00a0h) were comparable in adults (8 weeks of age) across neonatal treatment groups. Five consecutive drinking sessions were repeated 72\u00a0h after each weekly ethanol vapor exposure procedure for a total of five vapor/drinking cycles. Consistent with prior research, an increase in voluntary ethanol drinking was observed in vapor-exposed, neonatal saline-treated mice throughout the study starting after the second vapor cycle compared to both air-exposed control groups. In neonatal ethanol-treated mice, this increase in ethanol intake and preference following vapor exposure was accelerated, being observed after the first vapor cycle, and observed at an augmented level compared to vapor-exposed, neonatal saline-treated mice and air controls for both neonatal conditions. Conversely, marble burying was enhanced equivalently in vapor-exposed mice from either neonatal treatment group relative to their respective air-exposed controls. These data recapitulate clinical observations of enhanced sensitivity for alcohol dependence following developmental alcohol exposure, which may reflect enhanced motivational drive rather than potentiated negative affect. The present model will facilitate the future exploration of mechanisms that underlie increased risk for alcohol use after early developmental exposure.",

     "abstract": "Developmental exposure to ethanol may cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), and the immature central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to ethanol. In addition to vulnerability in the developing brain, we previously showed that ethanol also caused neuroapoptosis, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord. Minocycline is an antibiotic that inhibits microglial activation and alleviates neuroinflammation. We sought to determine whether minocycline could protect spinal cord neurons against ethanol-induced damage. In this study, we showed that minocycline significantly inhibited ethanol-induced caspase-3 activation, microglial activation, and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the developing spinal cord. Moreover, minocycline blocked ethanol-induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3\u03b2), a key regulator of microglial activation. Meanwhile, minocycline significantly restored ethanol-induced inhibition of protein kinase B (AKT), mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR), and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, which were important pro-survival signaling pathways for neurons. Together, minocycline may attenuate ethanol-induced damage to the developing spinal cord by inhibiting microglial activation/neuroinflammation and by restoring the pro-survival signaling.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated brain cytokine fluctuations associated with acute ethanol intoxication (increased IL-6) and withdrawal (increased IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1). The purpose of the present studies was to examine the potential functional role of increased central interleukin-6 (IL-6). We utilized two tests of ethanol sensitivity to establish a potential role for IL-6 after high (3.5\u20134.0\u00a0g/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) or moderate (2.0\u00a0g/kg, i.p.) doses of ethanol: loss of righting reflex (LORR) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA), respectively. Briefly, guide cannulae were implanted into the third ventricle of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the first experiments, rats were infused with 25, 50, 100, or 200\u00a0ng of IL-6; or 0.3, 3.0, or 9.0\u00a0\u03bcg of the JAK/STAT inhibitor AG490 30\u00a0min prior to a high-dose ethanol challenge. Although sleep time was not affected by exogenous IL-6, infusion of AG490 increased latency to lose the righting reflex relative to vehicle-infused rats. Next, we assessed whether IL-6 was sufficient to produce a CTA. Moderately water-deprived rats received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of 25, 50, or 100\u00a0ng IL-6 immediately after 60-min access to 5% sucrose solution. Forty-eight hours later, rats were returned to the context and given 60-min access to sucrose solution. IL-6 infusion had no significant effect on sucrose intake when all rats were considered together. However, a median split revealed that low sucrose-consuming rats significantly increased their drinking on test day, an effect that was not seen in rats that received 50 or 100\u00a0ng of IL-6. In the last study, AG490 had no effect on ethanol-induced CTA (2\u00a0g/kg). Overall, these studies suggest that IL-6 had only a minor influence on ethanol-induced behavioral changes, yet phenotypic differences in sensitivity to IL-6 were apparent. These studies are among the first to examine a potential functional role for IL-6 in ethanol-related behaviors, and may have important implications for understanding the relationship between acute ethanol intoxication and its associated behavioral alterations.",

     "abstract": "Ethanol-paired conditioned stimuli (CSs) are widely thought to invigorate ethanol responding, and thus, precipitate relapse to drinking. However, preclinical studies investigating this issue using Pavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer (PIT) procedures have had mixed results, with some studies finding PIT while others did not. The studies failing to show PIT used Lewis rats and induced ethanol drinking using a post-prandial drinking procedure. The present experiments examined whether either of these two variables influenced the magnitude of PIT observed. In the first experiment, ethanol drinking in Lewis rats was induced using either sucrose fading or post-prandial drinking. In the second experiment, ethanol drinking was induced using post-prandial drinking in either Long-Evans Hooded or Lewis rats. In both experiments, rats were trained to respond for ethanol under a random interval schedule. Subsequently with the lever removed, 2-min light presentations were paired with ethanol deliveries. Finally, with the lever returned, the effect of light presentations on responding was tested while responding was in extinction. Light presentations similarly affected responding in Lewis rats regardless of the method of drinking induction. Likewise, light presentations similarly affected responding in both Lewis and Long-Evans Hooded rats. Neither ethanol induction method nor rat strain affected the magnitude of PIT observed, and thus, neither likely explains previous failures to observe PIT with ethanol-maintained behavior.",

     "abstract": "The present set of experiments investigated the effects of a moderate dose of ethanol (2\u00a0g/kg; 20% v/v intragastrically) during late gestation (G17\u201320 [gestational day]) on ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in adolescence, and on ethanol consumption during adolescence and early adulthood. In experiment 1, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were given 30-min access to a sweetened \u201csupersaccharin\u201d (SS) solution or sodium chloride (NaCl), followed by an intraperitoneal injection of 20% ethanol (0, 1, 1.25, or 1.5\u00a0g/kg) for three conditioning/test sessions. Among animals conditioned with SS, prenatally ethanol-exposed males exhibited attenuated ethanol-induced CTA relative to males prenatally gavaged with water or non-manipulated, whereas prenatal treatment had no effect on CTA in females. Among animals conditioned with NaCl, there were no exposure group differences in males, with modest evidence for attenuated CTA in prenatally ethanol-exposed females. In experiment 2, the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on ethanol consumption in adolescents (P35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 day [postnatal day]) and adults (P56\u201360) were explored. At the beginning of the dark cycle, pair-housed rats were given three bottles containing 0, 5, and 10% ethanol for 18\u00a0h every other day (i.e., Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for 3 weeks. Relative to water controls, adult males prenatally exposed to ethanol showed greater preference and more intake (g/kg) of 5% ethanol, while showing lower intake of 10% ethanol. These intake and preference differences were not evident in adolescent males. Among females at both ages, ethanol-exposed animals showed lower preference and intake (g/kg) of 5% ethanol than their water-exposed controls. Thus, moderate ethanol exposure during late gestation produced a largely male-specific attenuation in the aversive effects of ethanol during adolescence that could contribute to later increases in preference and intake of a 5% ethanol solution, although this emergent effect was not evident in adolescence (or in females), but only manifested in adulthood.",

Here, we sought to determine whether Nano treatment attenuates alcohol-associated liver disease (AALD) and AT inflammation in alcohol-fed mice.We pre-treated E-47 cells (HepG2 cells that over-express CYP2E1) with native- or nano- SOD for 6 h, followed by treatment with ethanol and/or linoleic acid (LA), a free fatty acid. For in vivo studies, male C57BL/6 mice were fed the Lieber-DeCarli control or ethanol liquid diet for 4 wk. The mice received Nano once every two days during the last 2 wk of ethanol feeding.Our in vitro studies revealed that Nano pretreatment reduced LA+ethanol-induced oxidative stress in E-47 cells. Our in vivo experiments showed that ethanol-fed Nano-treated mice had 22% lower hepatic triglyceride levels than mice fed ethanol alone. Nano-treated ethanol-fed mice also had 2-fold lower levels of Cd68 and similarly-reduced levels of Ccl2 and Mmp12 mRNAs, than in untreated ethanol-fed mice. We also noted that ethanol feeding caused a remarkable increase in hepatic and/or plasma MCP-1 and CCR2 protein which was blunted in ethanol+Nano-treated animals. The hepatic content of SREBP-1c a transcription factor that promotes lipogenesis, was higher in ethanol-fed mice than controls but was attenuated in ethanol+Nano-treated animals. Further, livers of ethanol+Nano-treated mice had significantly higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK than both control and ethanol-fed mice. In AT, the level of Il6 mRNA a hepatoprotective cytokine, and that of Arg1, a marker of anti-inflammatory macrophages, were significantly increased in ethanol+Nano-treated mice compared with control mice.Our data indicate that Nano treatment attenuates ethanol-induced steatohepatitis and this effect is associated with an apparent activation of AMPK signaling. Our data also suggest that Nano induces Arg1 and IL-6 expression in AT suggesting anti-inflammatory effects in this tissue.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "Little is known about the influence of rearing environments concurrent with voluntary intermittent access to ethanol on subsequent adult ethanol-related behaviors. Previous research has shown that adult rats reared in post-weaning, social isolation conditions (IC) respond more for operant ethanol compared to laboratory standard conditions (SC). Ethanol-exposed adolescents tend to consume more ethanol in adulthood than rats exposed as adults. The current study examined voluntary ethanol consumption during adolescence between IC and SC rats, subsequent operant responding for ethanol, and extinction of responding in the same rats as adults. Differences in ethanol metabolism may alter the amount of reward value per unit of ethanol consumed. Therefore, the current study also examined blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) between IC rats and SC rats. Ethanol-na\u00efve Long-Evans rats arrived in the lab at postnatal day (PND) 21 and were separated into either IC or SC where they remained for the duration of the experiments. On PND 27, rats received intermittent access to 20% ethanol (3 days/week) for 4 or 6 weeks. Rats in the 6-week cohort were then trained to lever press for 20% ethanol in 30-min sessions followed by extinction. A separate cohort was reared in IC or SC, injected with 1.5 or 3.0\u00a0g/kg of ethanol (intraperitoneally [i.p.]), followed by BEC measurement. Overall, IC rats had higher ethanol preference and consumption during adolescence/early adulthood. IC and SC rats did not differ in their rates of operant responding for ethanol, and SC rats responded more than IC rats during extinction. There were no differences in BEC between IC and SC rats. These findings highlight the importance of the environment during rat adolescent development with isolation conditions increasing binge-like drinking and ethanol preference after 3\u20134 weeks without differences in metabolism as a potential factor. Additionally, the findings indicate that intermittent adolescent access to ethanol may change typical differences in operant responding patterns between IC and SC rats in adulthood.",

Multilevel modeling tested predictors of pain, substance use, and relief from pain by examining within- and between-person relationships.Results revealed an associational, reciprocal relationship between daily worst pain and daily drinking, where greater worst pain ratings predicted heavier drinking and heavier drinking predicted greater daily and overall pain. Greater happiness and poorer quality of sleep predicted greater daily worst pain. Exercising and overall confidence to cope with pain without medication were associated with lower levels of daily worst pain. Finally, spending less time with a loved one over time and reporting any coping behavior were associated with relief from pain.Investigation of daily factors that drive pain and substance use behaviors among this unique population help inform which daily factors are most risky to their health and well-being. Alcohol use emerged as the only substance associated with both driving pain and responding to pain. Findings suggest key points for prevention and intervention.",

Harmonious passion is characterized by an autonomous orientation toward an activity, while obsessive passion is characterized by a more controlled orientation toward an activity. Similar but not congruent conceptualizations of approaches to religion have been explored. Moreover, the preponderance of research suggests that religiousness is associated with decreased problematic alcohol use. However, little research has been done into contrasting approaches to religious devotion. We explored harmonious and obsessive passion for religious beliefs and practices and their association with alcohol use and alcohol-related problems. Perceived stress and satisfaction with life were examined as mediators. Participants included 707 undergraduate students (54.8% female) from a large southwestern university who were recruited as a part of a larger alcohol-related intervention trial. Data were collected at three time points: baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up, and were analyzed prospectively, with passion and mental health at time 1 and time 2 predicting alcohol outcomes at time 2 and time 3. The indirect effects of both obsessive passion and harmonious passion on alcohol problems through perceived stress were significant, and in opposite directions. Additionally, moderation analyses showed that both obsessive and harmonious passion for religion moderated the associations between perceived stress and drinking and between perceived stress and alcohol problems.",

     "abstract": "Tramadol is an opioid agonist with activation monoaminergic properties. It can be administered orally, rectally, intravenously, or intramuscularly as a centrally acting analgesic. Liver injury can lead to changes in the metabolism of tramadol. In this study, the rate of tramadol metabolism in rats with damaged liver induced by ethanol and acetaminophen was assessed in a recirculation perfusion system. Acetaminophen is a mild analgesic and antipyretic agent, which can cause centrilobular hepatic necrosis in toxic doses, whereas alcohol causes death due to liver diseases. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), such as alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and alcoholic fibrosis, is the most common liver disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the alteration in tramadol metabolism in different hepatotoxicity conditions in animal models. Male rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The control group received normal saline, group 2 received acetaminophen at the dose of 250\u00a0mg/kg/day, and group 3 received ethanol at the beginning dose of 3\u00a0g/kg/day, which was slowly increased to 6\u00a0g/kg/day. Tramadol was added to the perfusion solution at the concentration of 500\u00a0ng/mL. Samples were collected during 180\u00a0min, and analyte concentrations were determined by the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. The concentration of tramadol and its three main metabolites, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), N-desmethyltramadol (M2), and N,O-didesmethyltramadol (M5), were determined in perfusate samples. Ethanol and acetaminophen significantly affected the pattern of weight gain and liver weights before perfusion and caused a significant increase in enzyme activities. Moreover, histopathologic examination revealed that ethanol and acetaminophen caused liver damage. An increase in the elimination half-life and reduced clearance rate of tramadol were seen in the acetaminophen and ethanol groups, in comparison to the control group. Additionally, significant reductions in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of metabolites of tramadol (M1, M2, and M5) were observed in the acetaminophen and ethanol groups in the perfused rat liver model. Liver damage caused by ethanol and acetaminophen during 45 days in animals leads to a significant reduction in the level of tramadol metabolites. Therefore, in patients with liver damage caused by ethanol and acetaminophen, caution needs to be considered when prescribing tramadol.",

     "abstract": "Consumption of toxic substances such as alcohol is widespread in the general population and thus also in patients receiving orthodontic treatment. Since human periodontal ligament (hPDL) fibroblasts play a key role in orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) by expressing cytokines and chemokines, we wanted to clarify whether ethanol modulates the physiological activity and expression pattern of hPDL fibroblasts during static compressive force application. We pre-incubated hPDL fibroblasts for 24\u00a0h with different ethanol concentrations, corresponding to casual (0.041% blood alcohol concentration [BAC], % by volume) and excessive (0.179%) alcohol consumption. At each ethanol concentration, we incubated the cells for another 48\u00a0h with and without an additional physiological compressive force of 2\u00a0g/cm2 occurring during orthodontic tooth movement in compression areas of the periodontal ligament. Thereafter, we analyzed expression and secretion of genes and proteins involved in OTM regulation by RT-qPCR and ELISA. We also performed co-culture experiments to observe hPDL-fibroblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis. We observed no effects of ethanol on cytotoxicity or cell viability of hPDL fibroblasts in the applied concentrations. Ethanol showed an enhancing effect on angiogenesis and activity of alkaline phosphatase. Simultaneously, ethanol reduced the induction of IL-6 and increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis as well as hPDL-fibroblast-mediated osteoclastogenesis without affecting the RANK-L/OPG-system. hPDL fibroblasts thus seem to be a cell type quite resistant to ethanol, as no cytotoxic effects or influence on cell viability were detected. High ethanol concentrations, however, seem to promote bone formation and angiogenesis. Ethanol at 0.179% also enhanced hPDL-induced osteoclastogenesis, indicating increased bone resorption and thus tooth movement velocity to be expected during orthodontic therapy.",

Twenty-two hazardous drinkers and 22 non-hazardous drinking controls were recruited to participate in the study. They were required to produce a 3-key response sequence physically or mentally 3\u00a0s after the appearance of a corresponding cue. Here we showed significantly smaller amplitudes of both early and late negative contingent variation in hazardous drinkers compared to controls. In addition, the early negative contingent variation preceding motor execution was greater than those in the motor imagery conditions in both groups. Results of this study suggest impairments of attentional control and motor preparation in hazardous drinkers. Preparatory processes of motor execution and motor imagery mainly differ from each other in voluntary attention orientation, but not in motor preparation.",

This research examined the effects of MPD and ethanol on flash-evoked potentials (FEPs; cortical responses frequently used to assess neural activity and sensory processing) recorded from the visual cortex (VC) and superior colliculus (SC; a structure involved in attention and orientation) of chronically implanted male Long-Evans rats, and on body temperature and open field behavior. For one group of rats, either saline or ethanol (2.0\u00a0g/kg) was given 5\u00a0min prior to either saline or MPD (2.9\u00a0mg/kg). FEPs were recorded 10 and 20\u00a0min later. In the VC, ethanol decreased amplitudes of several components, but increased P2. MPD increased N3, but decreased P3 and P4. Ethanol increased the latency of several components. In the SC, ethanol decreased all three components, while MPD increased P3. Ethanol increased latency of all components. During FEP testing, ethanol decreased body movement while MPD increased movement. In the open field, line crossings were increased but rearings were decreased by ethanol. Both ethanol and MPD produced hypothermia. A second group of rats was given MPD at 11.6\u00a0mg/kg. Ethanol decreased several VC amplitudes, but increased P2. MPD increased N3 amplitude but decreased amplitude for other components. MPD also counteracted the effect of ethanol on the amplitude of P2 and N3. Both ethanol and MPD increased the latency of several components. In the SC, ethanol decreased all component amplitudes, while MPD increased P3 but decreased N4. Ethanol increased all component latencies, while MPD increased latency for two components. During FEP testing, ethanol decreased body movement while MPD increased movement. In the open field, line crossings were increased by ethanol and MPD. Rearings were eliminated by ethanol in the open field but increased by MPD, and MPD counteracted the effect of ethanol on rearings. Both ethanol and MPD produced hypothermia. Some of these results might help explain why users take MPD and ethanol in combination in order to enable consuming larger amounts of alcohol.",

     "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopaminergic reward pathway is activated by both alcohol and exercise, suggesting exercise as a possible treatment or preventative method for alcohol-use disorders (AUDs). Prior studies conducted in our lab have demonstrated the hedonic substitution of voluntary alcohol consumption for voluntary wheel running in female C57Bl/6Ibg mice, and a trend in male C57Bl/6Ibg mice. Given the important contribution of genetic background on AUDs, this study aims to assess the effects of voluntary wheel running on voluntary alcohol consumption in two moderate alcohol-consuming strains of mice, C3H/Ibg and 129/SvEvTac. Contrary to our previous studies conducted in C57Bl/6Ibg mice, 129/SvEvTac and male C3H/Ibg mice housed without a wheel consumed significantly more alcohol than mice housed with a free or locked wheel. This suggests that 129/SvEvTac and male C3H/Ibg mice are reducing their alcohol consumption due to an enriched environment and not exercise. Interestingly, the three groups of female C3H/Ibg mice (free wheel, locked wheel, no wheel) did not significantly differ in alcohol consumption, suggesting sex-specific differences in C3H/Ibg mice. In addition, genetic and sex effects were observed for running phenotypes in the presence of alcohol. Female 129/SvEvTac and C57Bl/6Ibg mice ran longer distances than male mice, whereas male and female C3H/Ibg mice did not differ in distance run. C3H/Ibg and female 129/SvEvTav mice with access only to water ran longer distances than mice with access to both alcohol and water. However, this effect was not observed in C57Bl/6Ibg or male 129/SvEvTac mice. The results of this mouse model highlight the importance of genetic background and sex on an animal's response to exercise as an enrichment to reduce voluntary alcohol consumption.",

However, it is little known how the combination of both might trigger astrogliosis and the morphological changes capable of affecting a differential susceptibility of hippocampal regions to these licit drugs. The present study investigated the chronic effects of exposure to cigarette smoke and/or ethanol on behavioral parameters, apoptosis, and alteration in immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and S100\u03b2 in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) of the rat hippocampus. Adult male Wistar rats (n\u00a0=\u00a032) were divided into four groups: vehicle (VE, glucose 3% in water, 10\u00a0mL/kg), cigarette smoke (TOB, total 12 cigarettes per day), ethanol (ethanol, 2\u00a0g/kg), and cigarette smoke plus ethanol (TOB plus ethanol, total 12 cigarettes per day plus ethanol 2\u00a0g/kg) for 54 days. The groups were submitted to tail-flick, open-field, and inhibitory avoidance tasks. The results showed that ethanol per se worsened the short-term memory. The association between TOB and ethanol increased the immunoreactivity of cleaved caspase-3 in the CA3 and DG regions. The TOB plus ethanol group showed a lower immunoreactivity to GFAP in all regions of the hippocampus. In addition, ethanol and TOB per se also reduced the immunoreactivity for GFAP in the DG. Ethanol increased S100\u03b2 immunoreactivity only in the DG. In conclusion, this study showed that only ethanol worsened short-term memory, and the DG became more susceptible to changes in the markers investigated. This evidence suggests that DG is more sensitive to neurotoxicity induced by cigarette smoke and ethanol.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol hangover (AH) has been associated with oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We herein postulate that AH-induced mitochondrial alterations can be due to a different pattern of response in synaptosomes and non-synaptic (NS) mitochondria. Mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of ethanol (3.8\u00a0g/kg) or saline and were sacrificed 6\u00a0h afterward. Brain cortex NS mitochondria and synaptosomes were isolated by Ficoll gradient. Oxygen consumption rates were measured in NS mitochondria and synaptosomes by high-resolution respirometry. Results showed that NS-synaptic mitochondria from AH animals presented a 26% decrease in malate-glutamate state 3 respiration, a 64% reduction in ATP content, 28\u201337% decrements in ATP production rates (malate-glutamate or succinate-dependent, respectively), and 44% inhibition in complex IV activity. No changes were observed in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03a8) or in UCP-2 expression in NS-mitochondria. Synaptosome respiration driving proton leak (in the presence of oligomycin), and spare respiratory capacity (percentage ratio between maximum and basal respiration) were 30% and 15% increased in hangover condition, respectively. Synaptosomal ATP content was 26% decreased, and ATP production rates were 40\u201355% decreased (malate-glutamate or succinate-dependent, respectively) in AH mice. In addition, a 24% decrease in \u0394\u03a8 and a 21% increase in UCP-2 protein expression were observed in synaptosomes from AH mice. Moreover, mitochondrial respiratory complexes I\u2013III, II\u2013III, and IV activities measured in synaptosomes from AH mice were decreased by 18%, 34%, and 50%, respectively. Results of this study reveal that alterations in bioenergetics status during AH could be mainly due to changes in mitochondrial function at the level of synapses.",

     "abstract": "Self-administration of ethanol (E) and nicotine (N) occurs frequently in tandem orders (i.e., N\u2192E vs. E\u2192N) and thereby produces differing interoceptive profiles of subjective effects in humans. If the interoceptive stimulus characteristics of N\u2192E differ from E\u2192N, it is possible that such differences contribute to their co-dependence. The rationale for the present investigation was to determine whether ethanol, when preceded or followed by nicotine, produces different discriminative stimulus effects in rats. In two experiments, using a one-manipulandum operant drug discrimination procedure, rats were trained to discriminate temporal sequential administrations of ethanol (1.0\u00a0g/kg) that was followed or preceded by nicotine (0.3\u00a0mg/kg). Sessions alternated between food-reinforcement sessions on a variable interval 30-sec schedule (i.e., SD) and non-reinforcement sessions (i.e., S\u0394). In Experiment 1, administrations of ethanol were followed or preceded by a 10-min interval of nicotine. Training sessions took place 10\u00a0min following the second drug injection. Four groups of rats were trained to discriminate only one sequence from sequential administrations of saline, and each drug sequence was counterbalanced across groups for their roles as SD or S\u0394. There was robust stimulus control. N\u2192E and E\u2192N functioned equally well as SD or S\u0394. Experiment 2 used two groups of rats. For one group, the E\u2192N sequence functioned as the SD and the N\u2192E sequence functioned as the S\u0394. The drug sequences were counterbalanced for the other group. Brief non-reinforcement tests revealed significantly greater responding during the SD sequence compared to the S\u0394 sequence for both groups. These results suggest that different drug sequences of ethanol followed or preceded by nicotine established reliable discriminative stimulus control over operant responding, potentially because of characteristic differences in the overlapping pharmacokinetic profiles of the NE compound. The results are discussed in terms of: 1) conditional stimulus control among two interoceptive drug states; and 2) the clinical modulation of human alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking.",

The development of rodent models is imperative for investigating the underlying changes behind these pathological states. In the present study, we investigated whether hind paw treatment with the inflammatory agent Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) could generate hyperalgesia and alter alcohol consumption in male and female C57BL/6J mice. CFA treatment led to greater nociceptive sensitivity for both sexes in the Hargreaves test, and increased alcohol drinking for males in a continuous-access two-bottle choice (CA2BC) paradigm. Regardless of treatment, female mice exhibited greater alcohol drinking than males. Following a 2-h terminal drinking session, CFA treatment failed to produce changes in alcohol drinking, blood ethanol concentration (BEC), and plasma corticosterone (CORT) for both sexes. Two-hour alcohol consumption and CORT was higher in females than males, regardless of CFA treatment. Taken together, these findings have established that male mice are more susceptible to escalations in alcohol drinking when undergoing pain, despite higher levels of total alcohol drinking and CORT in females. Furthermore, the exposure of CFA-treated C57BL/6J mice to the CA2BC drinking paradigm has proven to be a useful model for studying the relationship between chronic pain and alcohol abuse. Future applications of the CFA/CA2BC model should incorporate manipulations of stress signaling and other related biological systems to improve our mechanistic understanding of pain and alcohol interactions.",

Here a high-resolution computerized method was employed in the same cohort to evaluate four regions where neuroimaging studies have found atrophy in smokers and alcoholics: insula, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Brain images from 44 cases comprising 16 non-smoking controls, nine smoking controls, eight non-smoking alcoholics, and 11 smoking alcoholics were quantified. No significant differences between the groups were found, although the alcoholic groups tended to have smaller volumes in most regions. Furthermore, there were no smoking or interactive effects, and no correlation between gray matter volumes and either tobacco pack-years or lifetime alcohol consumption.

For the individual subscales of SSP, there were no significant differences by neglect category.Postnatal neglect in this group did not make the developmental outcome any worse, suggesting that prenatal alcohol influences these outcomes independently. Professionals who support families looking after a child with both FASD and a history of neglect should be aware that the behavioral difficulties are likely to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure and not necessarily reflective of parenting quality.",

     "abstract": "Among those in close relationships, the perception that one's partner has a drinking problem is more strongly related to detriments in relationship quality than are the actual rates of the partner's drinking. The current study extends this work by examining the effects of this perception on relationship functioning longitudinally and whether this association is mediated by changes in how one behaves in response to their partner's drinking. Spouses and partners of military service members who were concerned about their partner's drinking (n\u00a0=\u00a0234) completed a baseline survey and a follow-up assessment five months later. Structural equation modeling was used to prospectively examine the association between concern about partner drinking and relationship functioning (i.e., relationship quality, conflict, communication patterns), and the mediated effect of regulation strategies. Results suggested that changes in participant concern were related to changes in relationship functioning, and these changes were mediated by changes in punishment and rewarding sobriety regulation strategies. This research suggests that concern about partner drinking is linked with poorer relationship functioning partly because of the increased use of punishment and the decreased use of rewarding sobriety.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol produces complex effects on the immune system. Moderate alcohol use (1\u20132 drinks per day) has been shown to produce anti-inflammatory responses in human blood monocytes, whereas, the post mortem brains of severe alcoholics show increased immune gene expression and activated microglial markers. The present study was conducted to evaluate the time course of alcohol effects during exposure and after withdrawal, and to determine the relationship between microglial and cytokine responses in brain and blood. Forty-eight adult, male Wistar rats were exposed to chronic ethanol vapors, or air control, for 5 weeks. Following ethanol/air exposure blood and brains were collected at three time points: 1) while intoxicated, following 35 days of air/vapor exposure; 2) following 24\u00a0h of withdrawal from exposure, and 3) 28 days after withdrawal. One hemisphere of the brain was flash-frozen for cytokine analysis, and the other was fixed for immunohistochemical analysis. The ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) was used to evaluate microglia activation at the three time points, and rat cytokine/chemokine Magnetic Bead Panels (Millipore) were used to analyze frontal cortex tissue lysate and serum. Ethanol induced a significant increase in Iba-1 that peaked at day 35, remained significant after 1 day of withdrawal, and was elevated at day 28 in frontal cortex, amygdala, and substantia nigra. Ethanol exposure was associated with a transient reduction of the serum level of the major pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and a transient increase of effectors of sterile inflammation. Little or no changes in these molecules were seen in the frontal cortex except for HMG1 and fractalkine that were reduced and elevated, respectively, at day 28 following withdrawal. These data show that ethanol exposure produces robust microglial activation; however, measures of inflammation in the blood differ from those in the brain over a protracted time course.",

Here, we investigated whether PAE alters other markers of histaminergic neurotransmission. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0% or a 5% ethanol solution 4\u00a0h each day throughout gestation. Young adult female offspring from each prenatal treatment group were used in histidine decarboxylase (HDC) immunohistochemical studies of histamine neuron number in ventral hypothalamus, quantitative Western blotting studies of HDC expression in multiple brain regions, radiohistochemical studies of H2 receptor density in multiple brain regions, and in biochemical studies of H2 receptor-effector coupling in dentate gyrus. Rat dams consumed a mean of 1.90\u00a0g of ethanol/kg/day during pregnancy. This level of consumption did not affect maternal weight gain, offspring birth weight, or litter size. PAE did not affect the number of HDC-positive neurons in ventral hypothalamus. However, HDC expression was reduced in frontal cortex, dentate gyrus, and cerebellum of PAE rats compared to controls. Specific [125I]-iodoaminopotentidine binding to H2 receptors was not altered in any of the brain regions measured, nor was basal or H2 receptor agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation in DG altered in PAE rats compared to controls. These results suggest that not all markers of histaminergic neurotransmission are altered by PAE. However, the observation that HDC levels were reduced in the same brain regions where elevated H3 receptor-effector coupling was observed previously raises the question of whether a cause-effect relationship exists between HDC expression and H3 receptor function in affected brain regions of PAE rats. This relationship, along with the question of why these effects occur in some, but not all brain regions, requires more-detailed investigation.",

     "abstract": "Several studies showed that chronic ethanol exposure can cause color vision deficiencies. There has been no agreement about the axis of color defects due to alcohol misuse since changes in the red-green and the blue-yellow axis have been described in literature. The acute influence of alcohol on the blue-yellow color vision has not been studied as well. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of acute alcohol ingestion on blue-yellow color vision by using short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) and anomaloscopy with the Moreland equation. This is the first study evaluating that question by using SWAP and anomaloscopy.Sixteen healthy subjects without a history of alcohol-related and ophthalmological problems were examined by SWAP and anomaloscopy (Moreland equation) before and after alcohol ingestion. Mean sensitivity (MS), mean deviation (MD), loss of variance (LV), reliability factor (RF), and duration of examination were assessed for perimetry and match midpoint (MP), matching range (MR), and duration of examination for anomaloscopy. Blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) were determined by gas chromatography and phosphatidylethanol concentrations (marker of an alcohol misuse) by liquid-chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry in venous blood samples from a cubital vein.Mean blood BAC was 0.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\u00a0g/kg while performing perimetry and 0.84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20\u00a0g/kg while performing anomaloscopy (BAC: 0.1\u00a0g/kg\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.01\u00a0g/dL). MS, MD, RF, MP, MR, and duration of perimetry examination were not altered significantly after alcohol intake. LV showed a significant increase. The duration of anomaloscope testing was shortened significantly under the influence of alcohol. The subjects also revealed a significantly narrower matching range after alcohol intake.In the range of 0.8\u00a0g/kg BAC, no blue-yellow vision deficiencies could be demonstrated. In further studies, the effect of higher BAC on blue-yellow vision should be investigated by different methods.",

Children and rodents exposed to alcohol during pregnancy, or those whose fathers consumed alcohol prior to mating, often exhibit neurodevelopmental, physiological, and behavioral deficits. The present study assessed cognitive function and alcohol intake in male and female rats that were offspring of alcohol-exposed fathers. Adult male rats were exposed to alcohol or vehicle (0.0 or 2.0\u00a0g/kg, respectively; twice daily for 2 days followed by a rest day, for a total of eight alcohol or vehicle exposure days), or were left untreated and then mated with non-manipulated females. The offspring were assessed for alcohol intake, via intraoral infusion, followed by cognitive assessment via an alternating T-maze task. The results indicated that paternal ethanol exposure, prior to breeding, resulted in offspring that consumed significantly more ethanol than vehicle or untreated controls. Furthermore, the offspring of alcohol-exposed fathers exhibited a significant failure to initiate and complete the T-maze performance tests. Although, when they did engage in the tests they performed at the level of controls (i.e., 80% correct). The present results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that paternal pre-conception alcohol exposure can have deleterious effects on the offspring.",

To date, no studies have ystematically assessed physical fitness and physical activity in patients with alcohol use disorders (AUD) vs. a healthy comparison group. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess and compare the physical fitness and physical activity levels in patients with AUD against healthy controls. Thirty inpatients with AUD (22 males, 40.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5 years, illness duration\u00a0=\u00a09.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.3 years) and 30 age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-matched healthy controls were included. All participants performed the Eurofit test battery and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Patients also completed the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). The PANAS positive and negative scores were 30.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5 and 27.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2; the AUDIT score was 27.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0.

Backward regression analyses demonstrated that older age and higher BMI explained lower physical fitness levels, whereas longer illness duration and impaired explosive muscle strength explained lower total physical activity levels. The current findings suggest that lower physical fitness and physical activity are emerging as prominent modifiable risk factors in patients with AUD. Future research should explore the benefits of specific rehabilitation interventions aimed at increasing physical activity and physical fitness in this vulnerable group.",

     "abstract": "Low-dose alcohol consumption (LAC) has been shown to suppress post-ischemic inflammation and alleviate cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Cystathionine \u03b3-Lyase (CSE) is one of the enzymes that endogenously produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which has an anti-inflammatory property at low concentration. We determined the potential role of CSE in the protective effect of LAC. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups, an ethanol group and a control group, and gavage fed with 0.7\u00a0g/kg/day ethanol or volume-matched water once a day for 8 weeks. Transient focal cerebral ischemia was induced by unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90\u00a0min. CSE inhibitors were intraperitoneally given 30\u00a0min prior to the ischemia. Cerebral I/R injury, H2S production, adhesion molecules, IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), IL-1\u03b2, microglial activation, and neutrophil infiltration were evaluated at 24\u00a0h of reperfusion. Eight-week ethanol feeding upregulated CSE in the cerebral cortex and reduced cerebral I/R injury. Moreover, ethanol increased post-ischemic H2S production and alleviated the post-ischemic inflammatory response (expression of adhesion molecules, IL-1RAcP, IL-1\u03b2, microglial activation, and neutrophil infiltration) in the peri-infarct cerebral cortex. Both inhibitors of CSE, DL-Propargylglycine (PAG) and \u03b2-cyano-L-alanine (BCA), abolished the protective effect of ethanol on cerebral I/R injury. In addition, PAG attenuated the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the post-ischemic inflammation. Thus, LAC may protect against cerebral I/R injury by suppressing post-ischemic inflammation via an upregulated CSE.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol self-administration produces brain and behavior adaptations that facilitate a progressive loss of control over drinking and contribute to relapse. One possible adaptation is the ability of antecedent environmental stimuli that are consistently paired with alcohol to trigger alcohol-seeking behaviors. We previously modeled this adaptation in rats using a Pavlovian conditioning procedure in which illumination of a houselight preceded the presentation of a sipper tube that produced unsweetened alcohol when licked. However, in our previous work we did not demonstrate whether this adaptation represented a consequence of repeated exposure to alcohol or the houselight, or whether it was the consequence of associative learning and memory. Thus, in the present study, we tested the associative basis of alcohol seeking in response to houselight illumination in our task using adult male rats that were not food- or water-deprived and were not dependent on alcohol. Separate groups of rats received houselight illumination that was explicitly paired or unpaired with presentation of the retractable sipper that provided access to unsweetened alcohol. Our primary dependent variable was appetitive alcohol-directed behavior: the frequency of movement toward and interaction with the hole in the wall of the chamber through which the sipper was presented during the period of houselight illumination trial before each sipper presentation. However, we also analyzed consummatory sipper licking behavior and blood ethanol concentration in the same rats. Finally, we explored the brain basis of cue-elicited alcohol seeking using c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Our findings confirmed the associative basis of cue-elicited alcohol seeking in our paradigm and mapped these onto the insular cortex, suggesting a role for this brain region in early stages of brain and behavior adaptation to regular alcohol use.",

However, staying at the nadir of this J-shaped curve appears difficult. Furthermore, concern and distrust have also been raised about the quality of evidence for such \u201ccardioprotection\u201d, emphasizing the need for further randomized controlled trials. Another concern relates to the risk of moderate drinking leading to problem drinking, since alcohol is the most common addictive substance.Optimal exposure to alcohol (light/moderate use) means that one needs to stay at the nadir of the J-shaped curve for alcohol use to avail oneself of possible cardioprotection, and this may not be an easy thing to accomplish and/or adhere to, especially if one \u201clikes\u201d alcohol drinking.

     "abstract": "The acquired motivational impact of conditioned stimuli has been studied using the Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) task, where a cue paired with a reward is consistently shown to energize responses separately trained with that same reward (\u201cspecific\u201d PIT). However, most alcohol studies have shown that alcohol-related cues elevate responses trained with either the same alcohol reward or with other non-alcoholic rewards (\u201cgeneral\u201d PIT). The effects of extinction on this alcohol PIT effect have not been fully explored. We tested the hypothesis that cues signaling different-tasting alcohols might acquire specific craving reactions for those alcohols leading to specific PIT, but that these effects might be sensitive to extinction. Three experiments examined the specificity of PIT using alcohol and non-alcohol outcomes. Rats first consumed different-flavored alcohol solutions in their home cages. Then they were trained to perform two responses, each reinforced with distinctly flavored solutions, using a Polycose fading procedure. The outcomes were sweet (4% sucrose) or salty (0.9% NaCl) ethanol (10% v/v) solutions (Experiments 1 and 2) or one plain or salty alcohol vs. a non-alcoholic sweet solution (Experiment 3). Then, two cues were each differentially paired with these outcomes. In PIT tests, animals performed both responses in the presence and absence of these cues without any rewards. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 showed that a cue paired with a flavored alcohol produced a small but consistent bias toward the response trained with the same alcohol solution (specific PIT). Experiment 2 showed that extinction eliminated this effect. Experiment 3 demonstrated that specific PIT occurred when contrasting salty, or plain, alcohol to a non-alcoholic solution. These results provide evidence that alcohol-related stimuli can elicit craving for specific types of alcohol (as revealed by specific PIT), but that this effect is sensitive to extinction. This paradigm of contrasting two distinctly flavored alcohols may be an especially useful animal model of alcohol addiction.",

Consumption of 10% (v/v) ethanol by inbred C57BL/6J female mice from 0.5 to 8.5 days post coitum was used to model alcohol exposure during the first 3\u20134 weeks of gestation in humans, when pregnancy is not typically recognized. At adolescence (postnatal day [P] 28) and adulthood (P64), the brains of male offspring were scanned ex\u00a0vivo using ultra-high field (16.4\u00a0T) magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Energy metabolism and body composition were measured in adulthood by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively. Ethanol exposure had no substantial impact on white matter organization in the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, internal capsule, optic tract, or thalamus. Whole brain volume and the volumes of the neocortex, cerebellum, and caudate putamen were also unaffected. Subtle, but non-significant, effects were observed on the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in adult ethanol-exposed male offspring. Ethanol exposure was additionally associated with a trend toward decreased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and reduced daily energy expenditure, as well as significantly increased adiposity, albeit with normal body weight and food intake, in adult male offspring. In summary, ethanol exposure restricted to early gestation had subtle long-term effects on the structure of specific brain regions in male offspring. The sensitivity of the hippocampus to ethanol-induced damage is reminiscent of that reported by other studies \u2013 despite differences in the level, timing, and duration of exposure \u2013 and likely contributes to the cognitive impairment that characteristically results from prenatal ethanol exposure. The hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Our finding of altered daily energy expenditure and adiposity in adult ethanol-exposed males is consistent with the idea that central nervous system abnormalities also underpin some of the metabolic phenotypes associated with ethanol exposure in pregnancy.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing psychiatric disease characterized by the emergence of negative emotional states and the development of motivational deficits that manifest during alcohol withdrawal. Accordingly, alcohol may be sought after and taken in excessive amounts to alleviate withdrawal-related symptoms. To develop more effective treatments for AUD, it is necessary to identify potential molecular targets that underlie the transition from initial alcohol use to alcohol dependence, and our previous work has implicated a role for potentiated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in this regard. As a key negative regulator of GR-mediated signaling, the current study first measured c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in animals following an acute alcohol challenge. We found that JNK phosphorylation (pJNK) was significantly increased in the hippocampus, frontal cortical regions, and striatum of adult male Wistar rats following alcohol challenge, indicating that initial alcohol exposure increases JNK activity across several brain regions. A separate group of adult male Wistar rats were made dependent via chronic, intermittent ethanol vapor exposure and were trained to self-administer alcohol. We found that alcohol-dependent animals consumed significantly more alcohol and escalated their drinking over time compared to non-dependent animals. We then measured alterations in JNK phosphorylation in this alcohol-dependent group during acute withdrawal and found that pJNK was selectively decreased in the dorsal hippocampus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and cingulate cortex. These findings demonstrate that withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure leads to region-specific deficits in JNK phosphorylation. JNK signaling dysregulation may foster long-lasting behavioral and motivational impairments in alcohol dependence, either as a result of increased GR-mediated stress signaling or via other downstream mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use initiated early in adolescence is a major predictor for the development of alcohol use disorders. This risk may be increased when drinking is initiated around the time of puberty, given evidence of bidirectional relationships between alcohol and gonadal hormones. The current study examined the effects of adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure (AIE) on pubertal timing and expression of novelty-seeking and peer-directed behaviors as well as neural correlates of these behaviors. AIE did not affect pubertal timing or the later expression of novelty-seeking and peer-directed behaviors. AIE increased corticosterone (CORT) levels in females not tested behaviorally in adulthood or tested in the novel-object exploration paradigm, whereas social interaction blunted CORT levels in AIE females. Delays in pubertal timing and decreases in CORT levels were correlated, however, with increased novelty seeking in adult males \u2013 a phenotype associated with increased addiction vulnerability. In females, social testing elevated oxytocin receptor (OXTR) mRNA expression in the central amygdala (CeA), with this social testing-associated elevation evident in the lateral septum (LS), regardless of sex. Vasopressin receptor 1a (AVP-1aR) mRNA expression in the CeA was enhanced by social testing in females, but not males, with expression of this gene suppressed by social testing in the LS in males, but not females. Together, these data demonstrate that behavioral and neural alterations that may serve as risk factors in later drug vulnerabilities are likely not the result of a single insult, but may reflect interactions among several variables including sex, pubertal timing, stress reactivity, and test circumstances.",

     "abstract": "Excessive alcohol consumption impairs mucociliary clearance, in part, by compromising ciliary movement. Our previous study found alcohol reduces ciliary beat frequency in Chlamydomonas through a mechanism that involves the \u03b2 and \u03b3 heavy chains of the outer dynein arm (ODA). Moreover, we identified DC1, a subunit of the ODA-docking complex (ODA-DC), as the first ciliary target for alcohol. DC1 phosphorylation is alcohol sensitive and correlates with alcohol-induced ciliary dysfunction (AICD). Furthermore, DC1 phosphorylation is disrupted in the absence of the central pair and ODA. These results implicate a role for DC1 phosphorylation in regulating the ODA activity and mediating AICD. In our current study, we identified four alcohol-sensitive phosphosites in DC1: S33, T73, T351, and S628. Mutations of these sites rescue the assembly of the ODA-DC and ODA, resulting in wild-type swimming velocities. When cells were challenged with alcohol, we determined that three sites, S33, T351, and S628, are critical for mediating the ciliary slowing effects of alcohol. This result is consistent with our pharmacological studies, which reveal that both PP1 and PKA activities are required for AICD.",

The present study analyzed ethanol intake in male Sprague-Dawley rats after protracted prenatal and early postnatal ethanol exposure and tested whether social isolation during the sensitive period of adolescence modulates the effects of PEE on ethanol drinking. The dams were given 10% ethanol (or its vehicle) as the sole drinking fluid from gestational day 0 (GD0) to postnatal day 7 (PD7). On PD21, male offspring were housed individually (isolated housing group) or in pairs in standard cages (standard housing group). From PD56 to PD84, these male rats were tested for ethanol intake in 24-h, intermittent two-bottle choice sessions that were conducted across 4 weeks. Maternal ethanol consumption during gestation and during the first week of life of the offspring averaged 6.10\u20138.20\u00a0g/kg/22\u00a0h. Isolation housing during adolescence increased free-choice ethanol drinking in young adulthood.

Participants completed a battery of assessments, including measures of demographics, affect, alcohol and other drug use, presence/absence of significant recurrent pain, recent pain severity, and chronic pain type. Analyses indicated significant recurrent pain was highly prevalent in the study sample (53.66%), and was significantly more common among women (62.57%) than men (47.35%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Typical drinking prior to treatment did not differ by pain status, but participants with pain were more likely to report current opioid use.

Both men and women with pain indicated that pain had affected their substance use. In addition, both later age of first treatment and longer transition time from alcohol dependence to treatment were associated with greater pain severity, especially among men. These data suggest chronic pain is highly prevalent among treatment-seeking alcoholics, especially women, and that delays to first treatment are associated with pain presence and intensity.

COR659 apparently exerts its effects via a composite mechanism, including positive allosteric modulation of the GABAB receptor and an action at the cannabinoid CB1 receptor. The present study investigated whether the reducing effect of COR659 on alcohol and chocolate self-administration was maintained after repeated treatment and if COR659 affected cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking; additionally, it evaluated the ability of 9 structural analogues of COR659 \u2013 designed modifying the substituents on the phenylcarboxamido moiety and replacing the thiophene with the pyridine ring \u2013 to affect alcohol and chocolate self-administration. Alcohol self-administration experiments employed Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats trained to lever-respond for alcohol (15% v/v). Chocolate self-administration experiments employed Wistar rats trained to lever-respond for a chocolate solution (5% w/v Nesquik\u00ae). In the reinstatement experiment, previously extinguished lever-responding for alcohol in sP rats was reinstated by the non-contingent presentation of an alcohol-associated complex of cues. All drugs were tested at the doses of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg (i.p.). 10-Day treatment with COR659 produced a dose-related reduction of both alcohol and chocolate self-administration, with limited loss of efficacy on continuing treatment. Acute COR659 suppressed reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Among the 9 tested analogues, only COR657 (methyl 2-(benzoylamino)-4-ethyl-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate) decreased alcohol self-administration similarly to COR659; all other compounds produced modest, or even no, effect on alcohol self-administration. COR659 excluded, no compound altered chocolate self-administration. These results confirm and extend the ability of COR659 to reduce several behaviors motivated by alcohol and palatable food in rats. Comparison of COR659 to its analogues provided disparate results that do not currently allow any conclusive structure-activity relationship to be hypothesized, as their diverse pharmacological profile apparently does not depend on physicochemical properties.",

Further, we have shown that two neurosteroids, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and pregnanolone, can readily decrease ethanol self-administration in males. The present study used the same procedures in an attempt to systematically replicate the previous findings in female outbred rats. Rats were first trained to self-administer ethanol in the home cage using a saccharin-fading procedure. Subsequently, a two-bottle preference test was initiated by substituting different ethanol concentrations after subjects reliably consumed 10% ethanol alone. Water was always available during this phase. Next, subjects were transitioned to a fixed-ratio 10 (FR-10) schedule of reinforcement with 0.1\u00a0mL of ethanol (18% v/v) serving as the reinforcer so that a concentration-effect curve could be established. Upon completion, subjects were transitioned to an FR-10 FR-20 multiple schedule of ethanol (32% v/v) and food reinforcement to determine whether noncontingent ethanol, DHEA, and pregnanolone could selectively decrease ethanol intake. Not surprisingly, female subjects preferentially consumed ethanol over water at concentrations of 3.2\u201318% (v/v) during the home-cage procedure, and significantly increased the mean dose of ethanol consumed and blood ethanol concentration (BEC). Similarly, increasing concentrations under an FR-10 schedule significantly increased the dose of ethanol presented and BEC compared to control (water). Finally, under the multiple schedule, noncontingent injections of ethanol (0.32\u20131.8\u00a0g/kg), DHEA (10\u2013100\u00a0mg/kg), and pregnanolone (1.8\u201332\u00a0mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased food- and ethanol-maintained responding and the dose of ethanol presented. BEC was significantly decreased by the neurosteroids, but increased by ethanol due to its noncontingent administration. Together, these data replicate only a subset of the data previously obtained in males, suggesting there are sex differences particularly with respect to the effects of DHEA and pregnanolone.",

CMPPE is a novel GABAB PAM, still limitedly characterized in\u00a0vivo. It was therefore of interest to test its ability to affect operant, oral self-administration of alcohol and cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking in alcohol-preferring rats. To this end, female Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats were trained to lever-respond for alcohol (15% v/v) under the fixed ratio (FR) 5 (FR5) schedule of reinforcement. Once lever-responding had stabilized, rats were exposed to test sessions (under the FR5 [Experiment 1] and progressive ratio [PR; Experiment 2] schedules of reinforcement) preceded by treatment with CMPPE (0, 2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg; intraperitoneally [i.p.]). In Experiment 3, once lever-responding had stabilized, rats underwent an extinction responding phase and then a single reinstatement session during which lever-responding was resumed by the non-contingent presentation of a complex of alcohol-associated cues; CMPPE (0, 2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) was administered before the reinstatement session. Selectivity of CMPPE action was assessed by evaluating the effect of CMPPE (0, 2.5, 5, and 10\u00a0mg/kg; i.p.) on self-administration of a chocolate solution in male Wistar rats (Experiment 4). In Experiments 1 and 2, treatment with 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg CMPPE reduced lever-responding and breakpoint for alcohol. In Experiment 3, treatment with 5 and 10\u00a0mg/kg CMPPE suppressed reinstatement of alcohol seeking. In Experiment 4, no dose of CMPPE affected lever-responding for the chocolate solution. These results extend to CMPPE the ability of all previously tested GABAB PAMs to affect alcohol-motivated behaviors in rodents and confirm that these effects are a shared feature of the entire class of GABAB PAMs. This conclusion is of relevance in view of the forthcoming transition of GABAB PAMs to clinical testing.",

The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was employed to assess patterns of alcohol consumption. A score \u22658 was defined as alcohol misuse, and an answer to question number 3\u00a0>\u00a01 was indicative of heavy episodic drinking (HED). In order to identify factors associated with HED and alcohol misuse, bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with SPSS v20.0.

In this study, we carried out an in\u00a0vivo assessment of the embryonic hair cell changes on the lateral line of zebrafish upon exposure to various ethanol concentrations (0.25%, 0.5%, 0.75%, and 1.0%). A significant decrease in the hair cell count was confirmed as the ethanol concentration increased. Long-term observation (up to 240 hours post-fertilization [hpf]) suggested an irreversible hair cell loss with little chance of a simple delayed development. For an underlying biological process, a significant increase of hair cell apoptosis and a significant decrease of cytoplasmic mitochondria were confirmed as the ethanol concentration increased. Co-treatment with retinoic (0.1\u00a0nM) or folic (0.1\u00a0mM) acid with the same concentrations of ethanol resulted in significant increases in the remaining hair cells, compared to the ethanol-only treatment group, for every ethanol concentration. The retinoic acid provided more effective protection over folic acid, resulting in no significant changes in hair cell counts for every ethanol concentration (except 1.0%), compared with that of the negative control (without chemical treatment). Hair cell counts in every ethanol concentration were significantly lower than those in\u00a0negative controls without chemical treatment after folic acid co-treatment. In conclusion, gestational ethanol exposure causes developmental sensory hair cell loss. Potential underlying mechanisms include retinoic or folic acid deficiency, and mitochondrial damage with subsequent hair cell apoptosis. Hair cell loss could possibly be prevented by administering either retinoic or folic acid, with retinoic acid supplementation as the preferred treatment.",

     "abstract": "Genetically engineered animals are powerful tools that have provided invaluable insights into mechanisms of alcohol action and alcohol-use disorder. Traditionally, production of gene-targeted animals was a tremendously expensive, time consuming, and technically demanding undertaking. However, the recent advent of facile methods for editing the genome at very high efficiency is revolutionizing how these animals are made. While pioneering approaches to create gene-edited animals first used zinc finger nucleases and subsequently used transcription activator-like effector nucleases, these approaches have been largely supplanted in an extremely short period of time with the recent discovery and precocious maturation of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) system. CRISPR uses a short RNA sequence to guide a non-specific CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) to a precise, single location in the genome. Because the CRISPR/Cas system can be cheaply, rapidly, and easily reprogrammed to target nearly any genomic locus of interest simply by recoding the sequence of the guide RNA, this gene-editing system has been rapidly adopted by numerous labs around the world. With CRISPR/Cas, it is now possible to perform gene editing directly in early embryos from every species of animals that is of interest to the alcohol field. Techniques have been developed that enable the rapid production of animals in which a gene has been inactivated (knockout) or modified to harbor specific nucleotide changes (knockins). This system has also been used to insert specific DNA sequences such as reporter or recombinase genes into specific loci of interest. Genetically engineered animals created with the CRISPR/Cas system (CRISPy Critters) are being produced at an astounding pace. Animal production is no longer a significant bottleneck to new discoveries. CRISPy animal studies are just beginning to appear in the alcohol literature, but their use is expected to explode in the near future. CRISPy mice, rats, and other model organisms are sure to facilitate advances in our understanding of alcohol-use disorder.",

Cell-type specific targeting of optogenetic tools to neurons has contributed to a tremendous understanding of the function of neural circuits for future treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

To understand the neural circuit computations that mediate behavior, and how substances of abuse may transform them, we must first be able to observe the activity of circuits. While many techniques have been utilized to measure activity in specific brain regions, these regions are made up of heterogeneous sub-populations, and assessing activity from neuronal populations of interest has been an ongoing challenge. To fully understand how neural circuits mediate addiction-related behavior, we must be able to reveal the cellular granularity within brain regions and circuits by overlaying functional information with the genetic and anatomical identity of the cells involved. The development of genetically encoded calcium indicators, which can be targeted to populations of interest, allows for in\u00a0vivo visualization of calcium dynamics, a proxy for neuronal activity, thus providing an avenue for real-time assessment of activity in genetically and anatomically defined populations during behavior. Here, we highlight recent advances in calcium imaging technology, compare the current technology with other state-of-the-art approaches for in vivo monitoring of neural activity, and discuss the strengths, limitations, and practical concerns for observing neural circuit activity in preclinical addiction models.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders (AUDs), which include alcohol abuse and dependence, are among the most common types of neuropsychiatric disorders in the United States (U.S.). Approximately 14% of the U.S. population is affected in a single year, thus placing a tremendous burden on individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds. Animal models have been pivotal in revealing the basic mechanisms of how alcohol impacts neuronal function, yet there are currently limited effective therapies developed based on these studies. This is mainly due to a limited understanding of the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying AUDs in humans, which leads to a lack of targeted therapeutics. Furthermore, compounding factors including genetic background, gene copy number variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) as well as environmental and social factors that affect and promote the development of AUDs are complex and heterogeneous. Recent developments in stem cell biology, especially the human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell development and differentiation technologies, has provided us a unique opportunity to model neuropsychiatric disorders like AUDs in a manner that is highly complementary to animal studies, but that maintains fidelity with complex human genetic contexts. Patient-specific neuronal cells derived from iPS cells can then be used for drug discovery and precision medicine, e.g. for pathway-directed development in alcoholism. Here, we review recent work employing iPS cell technology to model and elucidate the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms of AUDs in a human neuronal background and provide our perspective on future development in this direction.",

     "abstract": "Chronic alcohol abuse is frequently considered a habitual or inflexible behavior; however, measures of pre-existing cognitive flexibility prior to initiation of alcohol use are usually not available. This study used rhesus monkeys and an attentional set-shifting task to investigate whether pre-existing cognitive flexibility would predict increased risk for heavy alcohol drinking. As previously reported, monkeys were given 30 daily set-shifting sessions prior to alcohol access. These sessions consisted of the same sequence of eight unique visual discriminations (sets) of two objects that varied on two dimensions (shapes and colors). The ratio of errors per trials, session duration, and maximum set reached were primary dependent variables from each session and were used to compose a session performance index (PI) that ranged from a low performance PI of 31 to an optimal performance PI of 247. Here, animals underwent an alcohol induction period followed by 22 weeks of daily (22-h) self-administration sessions with free access to water and alcohol. Based on average daily alcohol intake during 22 weeks of 22-h/day access, the monkeys were categorized as non-heavy (mean\u00a0=\u00a02.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0g/kg/day; n\u00a0=\u00a03) and heavy (mean\u00a0=\u00a03.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0g/kg/day; n\u00a0=\u00a06) drinkers. The two groups diverged in performance on the set-shifting task across the 30 pre-alcohol sessions, and at the end of the pre-alcohol testing, the group average PI was 216\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027 and 137\u00a0\u00b1\u00a071 for the future non-heavy and heavy drinkers, respectively. The data show that low cognitive flexibility assessed with a set-shifting procedure was predictive of future classification as a heavy alcohol drinker.

     "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is the natural habitat for a huge community of microorganisms, comprising bacteria, viruses, fungi and yeast. This microbial ecosystem codevelops with the host throughout life and is subject to a complex interplay that depends on multiple factors including host genetics, nutrition, life-style, stress, diseases and antibiotics use. The gut microbiota, that refers to intestinal bacteria, has profound influence on the host immune system, metabolism and nervous system. Indeed, intestinal bacteria supply the host with essential nutrients such as vitamins, metabolize bile acids and undigested compounds, defend against pathogen invasion, participate to the development of the intestinal architecture and the intestinal immune system and play an important role in the maintenance of the gut barrier function. More recently, the gut microbiota has been shown to influence brain functions, such as myelin synthesis, the blood-brain barrier permeability and neuroinflammatory responses but also mood and behavior. The cross-talk between microbes and the host implicates a vast array of signaling pathways that involve many different classes of molecules like metabolites produced by the bacteria from dietary or endogenous sources of carbohydrates and proteins (i.e. short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), indole), neurotransmitters and inflammatory cytokines. This review will focus on the involvement of the gut microbiota in the pathophysiological aspects of alcohol dependence related to the gut barrier function, liver damage and psychological disturbances. We will also discuss the possibility to create new and realistic humanized animal models of alcohol dependence by the use of fecal transplantation.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) is an alcohol biomarker formed from phosphatidylcholine (PC) by the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) in the presence of ethanol. A drinking study revealed individual differences in maximum PEth levels after drinking to a targeted blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.1%. This seemed to be due to different PLD activities in the tested persons. Furthermore, post-sampling formation of PEth occurred in blood samples, still containing alcohol. Therefore, a standardized in\u00a0vitro test for measuring individual PEth formation rates was developed. Two PLD inhibitors were tested for their potency to inhibit post-sampling PEth formation.PEth-negative blood samples were collected from a volunteer. Ethanol was added in different concentrations (0.01\u20130.3% BAC) directly after blood sampling. The specimens were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Aliquots were taken at the start of the incubation, and every hour until 8\u00a0h after start of incubation, and one sample was taken on subsequent days over 1 week. PEth 16:0/18:1 and PEth 16:0/18:2 were determined by online SPE-LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, this test system was applied to blood samples of 12 volunteers.For the inhibition tests, fresh blood (spiked with 0.1% ethanol) was spiked with 30, 300, 3000, or 30,000\u00a0nM of either halopemide or 5-fluoro-2-indolyl-deschlorohalopemide (FIPI), and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. PEth concentrations were determined hourly over 5\u00a0h on the first day and once on day 2 and day 3.PEth formation was linear in the first 7\u00a0h of incubation and dependent on the alcohol concentration. The formation rates of PEth 16:0/18:1 were 0.002\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.01% BAC), 0.016\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.1% BAC), 0.025\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.2% BAC), and 0.029\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.3% BAC). For PEth 16:0/18:2, the formation rates were 0.002\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.01% BAC), 0.019\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.1% BAC), 0.025\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.2% BAC), and 0.030\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 (0.3% BAC). Maximum concentrations reached 431\u00a0ng/mL (PEth 16:0/18:1) and 496\u00a0ng/mL (PEth 16:0/18:2) at 0.3% BAC after 3 days. Maximum velocity (vmax) was not reached under these conditions. PEth formation in blood of the 12 volunteers ranged between 0.011 and 0.025\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 for PEth 16:0/18:1 and between 0.014 and 0.021\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0L\u22121\u00a0h\u22121 for PEth 16:0/18:2.PEth formation in human blood was inhibited by halopemide in a concentration-dependent manner. However, a complete inhibition was not achieved by the applied maximum concentration of 30,000\u00a0nM. FIPI showed a better inhibition of PEth formation. A complete inhibition could be achieved by a concentration of 30,000\u00a0nM for the first 24\u00a0h (for PEth 16:0/18:1) and for 48\u00a0h (for PEth 16:0/18:2).Formation of PEth was found to be dependent on the BAC. As a consequence, it is essential to inhibit PLD activity after blood collection to avoid post-sampling formation of PEth in blood samples with a positive BAC. Inhibition of PEth formation was more effective using FIPI, compared to halopemide.",

While the strength of the association between ACEs and attempted suicide is weakened following adjustment for AD, no study to date has directly been performed to determine whether AD affects the risk of suicide attributable to ACEs. The study aimed to examine the possible role of alcohol dependence (AD) in the relationship between various ACEs and attempted suicide. This cross-sectional study assessed history of ACEs among 184 AD patients and 205 control participants using the Family Health Questionnaire. Lifetime history of attempted suicide was collected using the Chinese version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. We used the Sobel test to examine the mediating effects of AD on the relationship between ACEs and attempted suicide. Results showed that the suicide attempters were associated with higher rates of AD and ACEs. The regression analysis showed that AD and multiple ACEs exposure are independently associated with attempted suicide. AD appears as a partial mediator in the relationship between attempted suicide and the specific type of ACE (exposure to a battered mother or sexual abuse) or exposure to \u22653 types of ACEs. We conclude that AD might partially mediate the associations detected between attempted suicide and exposure to a battered mother, sexual abuse, and \u22653 types of ACEs. These observations may provide important insight for intervention strategies aimed at reducing the risk of suicide attempts.",

The blood ethanol concentrations 60\u00a0min after injection were similar in SHRs and WKYs. Bilateral microinjection of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors or glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonists into the RVLM 5\u00a0min after administration of ethanol significantly inhibited the ethanol-induced depressor effects in SHRs. The levels of NOx and glutamate release in the RVLM following ethanol administration and the NOx content in the RVLM areas 30\u00a0min after administration were significantly increased in SHRs, but not in WKYs. Our results showed that SHRs were more sensitive to ethanol-induced hypotensive effects than WKYs because of augmentation of ethanol-induced expression of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor/NO\u2022 signal in the RVLM of SHRs.",

Patterns of alcohol consumption among women in Africa remain poorly understood. We aimed to describe alcohol consumption in a representative sample of female heads-of-household in Mozambique. A 2014 population-based cross-sectional study of 3892 heads-of-household was conducted in Zamb\u00e9zia Province. Data on alcohol use were collected using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). Sociodemographic characteristics were summarized by alcohol use. A multivariable proportional odds model adjusted for age, education, Portuguese fluency, marital status, income, social support, depression, food insecurity, currently pregnant, and child mortality was used for the ordinal AUDIT scale as outcomes with robust covariance to account for clustering of respondents. The overall prevalence of current alcohol consumption among female heads-of-household was 15%. The mean PHQ-8 score was 2.7 (SD 4.7). The prevalence of women considered \u201chazardous drinkers\u201d (score >4) was 8%.

Caffeine and ethanol have both been reported to constrict cerebral arteries in several species, including humans. We have recently shown that application of 10-\u03bcM caffeine mixed with 50 mM ethanol to in\u00a0vitro pressurized cerebral arteries of rats reduced ethanol-induced constriction. This effect was dependent on the presence of nitric oxide (NO\u2022) and could be observed in de-endothelialized arteries supplied with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). The molecular target(s) of ethanol-caffeine interaction in cerebral arteries has remained unknown. In the present work, we used rat and mouse middle cerebral arteries (MCA) to identify the extra-endothelial effectors of NO-mediated, caffeine-induced protection against ethanol-evoked arterial constriction. Constriction of intact MCA of rat by either 50 mM ethanol or 10 \u03bcM caffeine was ablated in the presence of a selective TRPV1 pharmacological blocker. TRPV1 pharmacological block, but not block of TRPA1, PKG, or BK channels, removed caffeine-induced protection against ethanol-evoked rat MCA constriction, whether evaluated in arteries with intact endothelium or in SNP-supplemented, de-endothelialized arteries. In mouse arteries, caffeine-induced protection against ethanol-induced MCA constriction was significantly amplified, resulting in actual vasodilation, upon pharmacological block of TRPV1, and in TRPV1 knock-out arteries. Despite some species-specific differences, our study unequivocally demonstrates the presence of functional, extra-endothelial TRPV1 that participates in both endothelium-independent MCA constriction by separate exposure to ethanol or caffeine and caffeine-induced protection against ethanol-evoked MCA constriction.",

Animal models provide the experimental control to investigate the consequences of \u201cbinge\u201d alcohol exposure during this neurodevelopmental epoch. The current study used an animal model that combined an intermittent pattern of alcohol vapor exposure with voluntary drinking of 20% unsweetened alcohol in adolescent male and female Wistar rats (postnatal day [PD] 22\u201362), in order to test for potential differences in behavioral changes, ethanol drinking, and hypocretin/orexin (Hcrt/OX) signaling associated with exposure status. Two weeks after discontinuation of the alcohol vapor exposure and drinking during adolescence, rats were tested in adulthood for anxiety-like behaviors using a modified open-field conflict task, pre-pulse facilitation of startle response, light/dark box, and marble burying test. Adolescent alcohol exposure led to overall decreased startle response and increased behavioral arousal in the light/dark chamber during adulthood. Additionally, male rats demonstrated more disinhibited behavior during the conflict task compared to females, and female rats exhibited more rearing behavior during the light/dark test. Rats were also given a 2-bottle choice test that resulted in adolescent alcohol-exposed rats drinking significantly more alcohol in adulthood. Further, female rats also consumed more alcohol in adulthood compared to males. Estrous cycle phase did not account for any of the sex differences observed in the behavioral measures. Histological results indicated that adolescent alcohol did not alter Hcrt/OX-1 or Hcrt/OX-2 receptor mRNA expression levels in adult rats compared to control adults. However, female rats expressed a higher level of Hcrt/OX-1 and Hcrt/OX-2 receptor mRNA in the frontal cortex compared to males. These data suggest that our current model of intermittent ethanol exposure in adolescence can modestly affect both behavior and future consumption of alcohol and that Hcrt/OX receptor signaling differs between males and females.",

     "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are associated with social interaction behavior and gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities. These abnormal behaviors and GI abnormalities overlap with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We investigated the effect of fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) on social interaction deficits (hallmark of autism) in mice. Evidence indicates that exogenous lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration during gestation induces autism-like behavior in the offspring. LPS regulates the expression of genes underlying differentiation, immune function, myelination, and synaptogenesis in fetal brain by the LPS receptor, TLR-4-dependent mechanism. In this study, we evaluated the role of TLR-4 in FAE-induced social behavior deficit. WT and TLR4\u2212/\u2212 pregnant mice were fed Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with or without ethanol. The control group was pair-fed with an isocaloric diet. Social behavior was tested in the adult offspring at postnatal day 60. Frontal cortex mRNA expression of autistic candidate genes (Ube3a, Gabrb3, Mecp2) and inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) were measured by RT-qPCR. Adult male offspring of ethanol-fed WT dams showed low birth weight compared to offspring of pair-fed WT dams. However, their body weights at adulthood were greater compared to the body weights of offspring of pair-fed WT dams. There were no body weight differences in offspring of TLR4\u2212/\u2212 dams. Social interaction deficit was observed only in male offspring of ethanol-fed WT dams, but it was not observed in both male and female offspring of ethanol-fed TLR4\u2212/\u2212 dams. Expressions of autism candidate genes, Gabrb3 and Ube3a, were elevated, while that of the Mecp2 gene was suppressed in the frontal cortex of male, but not female, offspring of ethanol-fed WT mice. The expressions of inflammatory cytokine genes, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1, were also significantly increased in the frontal cortex of male, but not female, offspring of ethanol-fed dams. The changes in the expression of autistic and cytokine genes were unaffected in the offspring of ethanol-fed TLR4\u2212/\u2212 dams. These data also indicate that TLR4 mediates FAE-induced changes in social interactions and gene expression in brain, suggesting that ethanol-induced LPS absorption from the maternal gut may be involved in gene expression changes in the fetal brain.",

Hence, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of acute ethanol administration on the major signal transduction pathways in the heart that are responsible for regulating the protein synthetic and degradative response to refeeding. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were fasted for 12\u00a0h. Mice were then either refed normal rodent chow for 30\u00a0min or a separate group of mice remained food deprived prior to administration of 3-g/kg ethanol. Cardiac tissue and blood were collected 1\u00a0h thereafter and analyzed. Acute ethanol prevented the nutrient-induced stimulation of S6K1 phosphorylation in heart, but did not alter the phosphorylation of S6, eIF4B, and eEF2, known downstream substrates for this kinase. The refeeding-induced redistribution of eIF4E into the active eIF4F complex was also not changed by acute ethanol. Consistent with the above-mentioned changes in signaling proteins, ethanol did not impair the refeeding-induced increase in cardiac protein synthesis. Proteasome activity was not altered by alcohol and/or refeeding. In contrast, ethanol antagonized the refeeding-induced increase in ULK1 phosphorylation and p62 as well as the reduction in LC3B-II and Atg5/12 complex proteins. These data indicate that acute ethanol prevents the normally observed inhibition of autophagy seen after refeeding, while the mTOR-dependent increase in protein synthesis remains largely unaltered by alcohol.",

Stress and exposure to drugs of abuse, particularly alcohol, can produce similar states of unease and anxiety, implicating the kappa opioid system as a target of stress and alcohol. Numerous behavioral studies have demonstrated reduced sensitivity to manipulations of the kappa opioid system in early life relative to adulthood, and recent reports have shown that the kappa opioid system is functionally different across ontogeny. Given the global rise in early-life stress and alcohol consumption, understanding how the kappa opioid system responds and adapts to stress and/or alcohol exposure differently in early life and adulthood is imperative. Therefore, the objective of this review is to highlight and discuss studies examining the impact of early-life stress and/or alcohol on the kappa opioid system, with focus on the documented neuroadaptations that may contribute to future vulnerability to stress and/or increase the risk of relapse. We first provide a brief summary of the importance of studying the effects of stress and alcohol during early life (prenatal, neonatal/juvenile, and adolescence). We then discuss the literature on the effects of stress or alcohol during early life and adulthood on the kappa opioid system. Finally, we discuss the few studies that have shown interactions between stress and alcohol on the kappa opioid system and provide some discussion about the need for studies investigating the development of the kappa opioid system.",

Psychiatric diseases, including alcohol-use disorders (AUDs), are influenced through complex interactions of genes, neurobiological pathways, and environmental influences. A better understanding of the common neurobiological mechanisms underlying an AUD necessitates an integrative approach, involving a systematic assessment of diverse species and phenotype measures. As part of the World Congress on Stress and Alcoholism, this symposium provided a detailed account of current strategies to identify mechanisms underlying the development and progression of AUDs. Dr. Sean Farris discussed the integration and organization of transcriptome and postmortem human brain data to identify brain regional- and cell type-specific differences related to excessive alcohol consumption that are conserved across species. Dr. Brien Riley presented the results of a genome-wide association study of DSM-IV alcohol dependence; although replication of genetic associations with alcohol phenotypes in humans remains challenging, model organism studies show that COL6A3, KLF12, and RYR3 affect behavioral responses to ethanol, and provide substantial evidence for their role in human alcohol-related traits. Dr. Rob Williams expanded upon the systematic characterization of extensive genetic-genomic resources for quantifying and clarifying phenotypes across species that are relevant to precision medicine in human disease. The symposium concluded with Dr. Robert Hitzemann's description of transcriptome studies in a mouse model selectively bred for high alcohol (\u201cbinge-like\u201d) consumption and a non-human primate model of long-term alcohol consumption. Together, the different components of this session provided an overview of systems-based approaches that are pioneering the experimental prioritization and validation of novel genes and gene networks linked with a range of behavioral phenotypes associated with stress and AUDs.",

     "abstract": "Decades of research have described the importance of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling in alcohol addiction, as well as in commonly co-expressed neuropsychiatric diseases, including anxiety and mood disorders. However, CRF signaling can also acutely regulate binge alcohol consumption, anxiety, and affect in non-dependent animals, possibly via modulation of central monoaminergic signaling. We hypothesize that basal CRF tone is particularly high in animals and humans with an inherent propensity for high anxiety and alcohol consumption, and thus these individuals are at increased risk for the development of alcohol use disorder and comorbid neuropsychiatric diseases. The current review focuses on extrahypothalamic CRF circuits, particularly those stemming from the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), found to play a role in basal phenotypes, and examines whether the intrinsic hyperactivity of these circuits is sufficient to escalate the expression of these behaviors and steepen the trajectory of development of disease states. We focus our efforts on describing CRF modulation of biogenic amine neuron populations that have widespread projections to the forebrain to modulate behaviors, including alcohol and drug intake, stress reactivity, and anxiety. Further, we review the known sex differences and estradiol modulation of these neuron populations and CRF signaling at their synapses to address the question of whether females are more susceptible to the development of comorbid addiction and stress-related neuropsychiatric diseases because of hyperactive extrahypothalamic CRF circuits compared to males.",

This review addresses sex differences in the impact of stressors on alcohol drinking and seeking in rodents and humans.

However, the challenge of current and future studies is to identify the specific dysregulations that occur within distinct amygdala circuits and subpopulations and the commonalities between these alterations in each disorder, with the long-term goal of identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Specific intra-amygdala circuits and cell type-specific subpopulations are emerging as critical targets for stress- and alcohol-induced plasticity, chief among them the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) and CRF receptor 1 (CRF1) system. CRF and CRF1 have been implicated in the effects of alcohol in several amygdala nuclei, including the basolateral (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA); however, the precise circuitry involved in these effects and the role of these circuits in stress and anxiety are only beginning to be understood.",

Chronic alcohol use can result in neuroadaptations in cortico-striatal pathways and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis function that are manifested in altered behavioral and cognitive control functions contributing to alcohol craving, compulsive motivation, consumption, and consequences. This symposium brings together studies utilizing novel approaches to help improve our understanding of stress \u2013 past, acute, and chronic \u2013 on alcohol seeking and consumption and related outcomes using a combination of human laboratory models, neuroimaging, and clinical measures. Examining factors that determine vulnerability as well as resilience to stress are of particular interest in the study of AUD because, in addition to increasing our understanding of the risk factors for AUD, such knowledge can be used to develop more effective treatments.Dr. Stangl presented a novel human experimental model that demonstrates, for the first time, stress-induced increases in alcohol self-administration in binge drinkers using a guided imagery paradigm combined with intravenous alcohol self-administration (IV-ASA). Dr. Blaine presented data demonstrating that glucocorticoid response to stress drives compulsive alcohol motivation and intake in binge/heavy drinkers.

Although several animal studies have demonstrated this correlation with psychostimulants or morphine, studies with alcohol have shown conflicting results. The aim of this work was to investigate alcohol-induced motor effects in Wistar rats with different responses to novelty. Animals were classified as Low- (LR) or High-Responders (HR) to novelty, depending on their horizontal activity in an automated open field. Motor activity was recorded in na\u00efve, saline, and alcohol-administered rats at different doses (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 2.5\u00a0g/kg). Horizontal movements, rearings, and stereotyped behaviors were evaluated. After the behavioral test, animals were sacrificed and blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were measured. Low (0.1 and 0.25\u00a0g/kg) and high (2.5\u00a0g/kg) alcohol doses decreased horizontal movements in LR animals, whereas 1.0\u00a0g/kg increased this parameter in HR rats. Rearings were increased by alcohol 1.0\u00a0g/kg in LR animals. In HR rats, alcohol doses of 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0g/kg also increased this parameter. Stereotyped behaviors were decreased by an alcohol dose of 2.5\u00a0g/kg in LR animals, but were increased by an intermediate dose (1.0\u00a0g/kg) in HR rats. Differences in horizontal movements and rearings were found between LR and HR animals at certain ethanol doses. Horizontal movements (0.25\u00a0g/kg) and rearings (0.5\u00a0g/kg) were lower in LR than HR rats; however, rearings were lower in HR than LR rats at 1.0\u00a0g/kg. BACs were similar between LR and HR rats at all ethanol doses. These findings suggest that HR rats are more responsive to the stimulant effects of intermediate alcohol doses, whereas LR animals are sensitive to low/high doses of the drug. Sensitivity to alcohol motor effects may substantially depend on the initial animal's response to a novel environment. The stimulant effects of alcohol may constitute important behavioral traits significantly associated with the rewarding properties of the drug.",

     "abstract": "Inflammation supports the progression of alcohol-related organ injury. Recent research findings have linked ethanol exposure to changes in histone acetylation and deacetylation in the brain and in peripheral tissues, leading to ethanol-dependence related damage. One of the mechanisms that has been shown to play a major role during inflammation is the cannabinoid system. Previous research has demonstrated that ethanol can modulate cannabinoid receptors' functions. Our lab has shown that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPR55), a novel cannabinoid receptor, is upregulated in binge drinkers and in cells treated acutely with ethanol. Additionally, our group has also uncovered that chronic ethanol exposure leads to an increase in histone modifications, such as acetylation. However, the regulatory mechanism of GPR55 within the immune system under the influence of ethanol is poorly understood. Since changes in histone modifications might lead to changes in gene expression, we hypothesize that the mechanism of ethanol-induced upregulation of GPR55 is linked to epigenetic changes on histone proteins. Taking into account previous findings from our lab, the goal of the present study was to determine whether there is any relevant association between histone hyperacetylation and the regulation of the novel cannabinoid receptor GPR55 in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) of human origin treated acutely with ethanol. Therefore, monocytes were isolated from buffy coats and allowed to differentiate into MDDCs. The cells were treated with ethanol for 24\u00a0h, harvested, fixed, and stained with antibodies against GPR55. As expected, based on previous findings, confocal microscopy showed that ethanol exposure increases GPR55 expression. In order to demonstrate the correlation between histone acetylation and GPR55 expression regulation, the cells were treated with ethanol, harvested, and then the chromatin was extracted and fractionated for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, followed by real-time qPCR for the analysis of DNA fragments. The results showed an enrichment of the histone modification H4K12ac in the GPR55 gene of MDDCs treated with ethanol. Furthermore, siRNA against the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 (responsible for the acetylation of H4K12) resulted in a downregulation of GPR55. In conjunction, these results indicate that in the presence of ethanol, the upregulation of GPR55 expression is accompanied by H4K12 acetylation, which might have a significant effect in the ability of this innate immune system's cells to cope with cellular stress induced by ethanol. However, the causality of ethanol regulation of H4K12ac in GPR55 expression changes still lacks further elucidation; therefore, additional experimental approaches to confirm a significant causality between H4K12 acetylation and ethanol regulation of GPR55 are currently undergoing in our lab.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol-use disorders (AUDs) are characterized by repeated episodes of binge drinking. Based on reports that exposure to predator odor stress (PS) consistently increases ethanol intake, the present studies examined whether prior binge drinking differentially altered responsivity to PS and subsequent ethanol intake in male and female mice, when compared to mice without prior binge exposure. Initial studies in na\u00efve male and female C57BL/6J mice confirmed that 30-min exposure to dirty rat bedding significantly increased plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels and anxiety-related behavior, justifying the use of dirty rat bedding as PS in the subsequent drinking studies. Next, separate groups of male and female C57BL/6J mice received seven binge ethanol sessions (binge) or drank water (controls), followed by a 1-month period of abstinence. Then, 2-bottle choice ethanol intake (10% or 10E vs. water, 23\u00a0h/day) was measured in lickometer chambers for 4 weeks. After baseline intake stabilized, exposure to intermittent PS (2\u00d7/week\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 weeks) significantly enhanced ethanol intake after the 2nd PS in male, but not female, binge mice vs. baseline and vs. the increase in controls. However, in a subgroup of females (with low baselines), PS produced a similar increase in 10E intake in control and binge mice vs. baseline. Analysis of lick behavior determined that the enhanced 10E intake in binge male mice and in the female low baseline subgroup was associated with a significant increase in 10E bout frequency and 10E licks throughout the circadian dark phase. Thus, PS significantly increased 10E intake and had a synergistic interaction with prior binge drinking in males, whereas PS produced a similar significant increase in 10E intake in the low baseline subgroup of binge and control females. Plasma CORT levels were increased significantly in both binge and control animals after PS. CORT levels at 24-h withdrawal from daily 10E intake were highest in the groups with elevated 10E licks (i.e., binge males and control females). At 24-h withdrawal, protein levels of GABAA receptor \u03b11 subunit, corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1, and glucocorticoid receptor in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) were differentially altered in the male and female mice vs. levels in separate groups of age-matched na\u00efve mice, with more changes in HC than in PFC and in females than in males. Importantly, the sexually divergent changes in protein levels in PFC and HC add to evidence for sex differences in the neurochemical systems influenced by stress and binge drinking, and argue for sex-specific pharmacological strategies to treat AUD.",

Nicotine, a drug co-consumed with ethanol, may decrease this aversion by modulating the unconditioned effects of ethanol or by disrupting the association between ethanol and its associated cues. This study analyzed ethanol-induced CTA and conditioned place aversion (CPA) in Long-Evans rats with subchronic exposure to nicotine. The rats were treated with nicotine (0.0 or 0.4\u00a0mg/kg) three times before conditioning (on lickometer training sessions 3, 4, and 5) and across conditioning days. During the conditioning the rats were given ethanol (1.3\u00a0g/kg) preceded and followed by presentation of a taste (NaCl) and tactile (rod or hole floors) conditioned stimulus (CS+), respectively. On CS\u2212 conditioning days, the rats were given vehicle and exposed to alternative stimuli. Three CTA and CPA testing sessions were then conducted. It was found that nicotine reduced ethanol-induced CTA and enhanced locomotor activity, but did not significantly modify the magnitude of ethanol-induced CPA. The effects of nicotine on CTA were observed during both conditioning and testing sessions, and were specific to the NaCl CS+, having no effect on reactivity to water. The dissociation between the effect of nicotine on ethanol-induced CTA and CPA suggests that nicotine does not alter ethanol's motivational properties by generally increasing its positive rewarding effects, nor does it blunt all aversive-like responses to this drug. Instead, nicotine may impede ethanol-induced CTA induced by ethanol by disrupting the neural underpinnings of this specific form of associative learning.",

Their average age was 54 years and 68% were male. Over 5 years, about two-thirds of these adults died (44% in the first year), and fewer than 500 received liver transplants. There were nearly 40,000 re-hospitalizations, with over 50% of the survivors re-hospitalized within a year and nearly 75% through the second year. The total costs were nearly $145,000 per patient, with costs decreasing over time from over $50,000 in the first year (including the index hospitalization) to about $10,000 per year in the later years. Total costs for the cohort over 5 years were $2.2 billion. Patients who received a liver transplant averaged about $300,000 in transplant-related costs and over $1,000,000 in total health care costs over 5 years.

Studies show that alcohol-related injury patients reduce their at-risk alcohol-use behavior with a brief negotiational interview (BNI) in the ED. This project aims to identify potential perceived barriers to implementing a BNI in Tanzania. A knowledge, attitude, and practice questionnaire was piloted and administered to all emergency department health care practitioners, including physicians, advanced medical officers, and nurses. The questionnaire included the Perceived Alcohol Stigma (PAS) Scale. The survey was self-administered in English, the language of health care instruction, with a Swahili translation available if preferred. Data were analyzed with relative and absolute frequencies and Spearman's correlation. Thirty-four (100%) health care practitioners completed the survey. Our results found positive attitudes toward addressing alcohol misuse (88%), but very poor knowledge of recommended alcohol-use limits (24%). Participants were willing to discuss alcohol use (88%) and to screen (71%) for alcohol-use disorders. Most health care practitioners report significant stigma against those with alcohol-use disorders (39% discrimination, 53% devaluation, 71% either). Counseling patients about high-risk alcohol use was directly and positively associated with at-risk alcohol and counseling education and believing it was common to ask patients about tobacco and alcohol use; it was negatively associated with believing it was \u2018not my role\u2019 or that knowing about alcohol use \u2018won't make a difference\u2019. Stigma was negatively and indirectly associated with counseling patients. In conclusion, in an ED in Tanzania, health care practitioners have positive attitudes toward addressing at-risk alcohol use, and endorsed having training in alcohol misuse in school. Unfortunately, participants did not demonstrate knowledge of recommended alcohol limit guidelines. Similarly, among practitioners, there is a significant discrimination and devaluation stigma against those who misuse alcohol. These factors must be addressed prior to a successful implementation of an alcohol harm reduction intervention.",

These ethanol-induced impairments known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are not fully understood, and currently, there is no effective treatment. Further, growing evidence suggests that adult females are more susceptible to ethanol, with the effects of perinatal ethanol exposure also being sexually divergent. Female models have been historically underutilized in neurophysiological investigations, but here, we used a third-trimester binge-ethanol model of FASD to examine changes to basal forebrain (BF) physiology and behavior in female Sprague-Dawley rats. We also tested varenicline as a potential cholinomimetic therapeutic. Rat pups were gavage-treated with binge-like ethanol, varenicline and ethanol, and varenicline alone. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology in BF slices, we observed that binge-ethanol exposure increased spontaneous post-synaptic current (sPSC) frequency. Varenicline exposure alone also enhanced sPSC frequency. Varenicline plus ethanol co-treatment prevented the sPSC frequency increase. Changes in BF synaptic transmission persisted into adolescence after binge-ethanol treatment. Behaviorally, binge-ethanol treated females displayed increased anxiety (thigmotaxis) and demonstrated learning deficits in the water maze. Varenicline/ethanol co-treatment was effective at reducing these behavioral deficits. In the open field, ethanol-treated rats displayed longer distances traveled and spent less time in the center of the open field box. Co-treated rats displayed less anxiety, demonstrating a possible effect of varenicline on this measure. In conclusion, ethanol-induced changes in both BF synaptic transmission and behavior were reduced by varenicline in female rats, supporting a role for cholinergic therapeutics in FASD treatment.",

     "abstract": "The P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) has been particularly useful in alcohol research for identifying endophenotypes of alcohol-use disorder (AUD) risk in sober subjects. However, practice and/or fatigue reduce P3 amplitude, limiting the ability to ascertain acute and adaptive effects of alcohol exposure. Here, we report acute alcohol effects on P3 amplitude and latency using an adaptive stop signal task (aSST).One hundred forty-eight non-dependent moderate to heavy social drinkers, ages 21 to 27, participated in two single-blind, alcohol or placebo, counterbalanced sessions approximately 1 week apart. During each session, subjects performed an adaptive stop signal task (aSST) at 1) baseline, 2) upon reaching the target 60\u00a0mg/dL breath alcohol concentration or at the equivalent time during the placebo session, and 3) approximately 135\u00a0min later while the breath alcohol concentration was clamped. Here, we report on differences between baseline and first subsequent measurements across the experimental sessions. During each aSST run, the stop signal delay (SSD, the time between stop and go signals) adjusted trial-by-trial, based on the subject's performance.The aSST reliably generated a STOP P3 component that did not change significantly with repeated task performance. The pre-infusion SSD distribution was bimodal, with mean values several hundred msec apart (FAST: 153 msec and SLOW: 390\u00a0msec). This suggested different response strategies: FAST SSD favoring \u201cgoing\u201d over \u201cstopping\u201d, and SLOW SSD favoring \u201cstopping\u201d over \u201cgoing\u201d. Exposure to alcohol at 60\u00a0mg/dL differentially affected the amplitude and latency of the STOP P3 according to SSD group. Alcohol significantly reduced P3 amplitude in the SLOW SSD compared to the FAST SSD group, but significantly increased P3 latency in the FAST SSD compared to the SLOW SSD group.The aSST is a robust and sensitive task for detecting alcohol-induced changes in inhibition behavior as measured by the P3 component in a within-subject design. Alcohol was associated with P3 component changes, which varied by SSD group, suggesting a differential effect as a function of task strategy. Overall, the data support the potential utility of the aSST in the detection of alcohol response-related AUD risk.",

     "abstract": "Because the consumption of alcoholic beverages prevails in society, its effects on diabetes risk is a subject of interest. Extant literature on this issue often disagrees. Here, we probed the effects of chronic moderate ethanol consumption on glucose metabolism in rats. The effect of chronic moderate alcohol drinking on depression- and anxiety-like behaviors and memory was also explored. Adolescent male and female Long-Evans rats consumed saccharin-sweetened 5% (1 week) and 10% ethanol (7 weeks) under a 7.5-h/day (Monday\u2013Friday) access schedule. This exposure was followed by sucrose preference and elevated plus maze (EPM) tests during an intervening week, before a 6-week intermittent-access (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) to 20% unsweetened ethanol in a 2-bottle choice drinking paradigm was implemented (EtOH). A free-feeding control group received water (Water). Our prior work revealed that voluntary ethanol consumption decreases food intake in rats. Hence, a second control group that received water was mildly food-restricted (FR), and their average body weight was matched to that of the EtOH group. During the week following week 6 of intermittent-access to 20% ethanol, rats were submitted to sucrose preference, EPM, and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Insulin response to a glucose load was subsequently assessed via an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Rats attained and maintained blood ethanol concentrations of \u223c55\u00a0mg/dL that correlated with the dose of sweetened 10% ethanol ingested. Relative to intake by Water controls, EtOH rats consumed less chow. There was no body weight difference between both groups. Neither sex of EtOH rats showed increased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, as respectively measured by sucrose preference and EPM, nor did they show deficit in object recognition memory during abstinence. Male EtOH rats, however, showed signs of reduced general activity on the EPM. During OGTT, male EtOH rats showed a time-dependent potentiation of insulin release for proper glucose clearance. Such an effect was not observed in females. This landmark study shows that chronic moderate alcohol consumption can have negative metabolic consequences in the absence of overt behavioral deficits, especially in males.",

     "abstract": "Harmful use of alcohol is a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. The role of alcohol as a driver of the unfolding non-communicable disease crisis has led to high-profile calls for better epidemiological data. Despite causing a disproportionate amount of harm in low-income groups, there is a critical dearth of evidence on the intra-national socioeconomic patterning of alcohol use in low- and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs). This review aims to fill the gap, providing evidence on the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and alcohol use in these low-income settings.We conducted a comprehensive literature search for primary research published between January 1, 1990 and June 30, 2015 using 13 electronic databases, including Embase and Medline. We also hand-searched references and reviewed \u2018gray literature\u2019 \u2013 studies that have not been published in peer-reviewed journals. We included studies from LLMICs presenting data on multiple measures of socioeconomic status and alcohol use. No age or language restrictions were applied. Due to high heterogeneity, we used a narrative approach for data synthesis.After reviewing 4242 records and 247 full-text articles, 23 studies met our inclusion criteria, reporting data on 861,295 individuals aged >10 years from 10 countries. Alcohol use was found to be more prevalent in lower socioeconomic groups in the majority of Southeast Asian studies. The association was mixed for African studies, although these tended to have smaller sample sizes and weaker methods. Studies that measured multiple domains of SES found good agreement between different indicators. Definitions of alcohol use and abuse varied widely between studies, as did socioeconomic groupings.The lack of consistency between studies and the abject lack of data from the majority of LLMICs present a major barrier to policymakers tasked with reducing alcohol-related harm in these settings. Adherence to standardized definitions, the publication of WHO survey data on alcohol and SES, and enhanced surveillance is needed to build an accurate picture of the socioeconomic patterning of alcohol use in developing countries.",

Patients with PTSD have been reported to self-medicate with alcohol to ameliorate hyperarousal symptoms associated with the disorder. Research utilizing rodent models of PTSD to emulate this behavioral phenomenon has thus far yielded inconsistent results. In the present study, we examined the effects of a predator-based psychosocial stress model of PTSD on voluntary ethanol consumption. In the first of two experiments, following exposure to a 31-day stress or control paradigm, rats were singly housed during the dark cycle with free access to 1% sucrose solution or 10% ethanol, which was also sweetened with 1% sucrose. Over the course of a 20-day period of ethanol access, stressed rats consumed significantly less ethanol than non-stressed rats. These counterintuitive results prompted the completion of a second experiment which was identical to the first, except rats were also exposed to the two-bottle paradigm for 20 days before the stress or control paradigm. In the second experiment, after the stress manipulation, stressed rats exhibited significantly greater ethanol preference than non-stressed rats. These findings suggest that prior exposure to ethanol influences the subsequent effect of stress on ethanol intake. They also validate the use of the present model of PTSD to examine potential mechanisms underlying stress-related changes in ethanol-seeking behavior.",

The current study used electroencephalography (EEG) to examine spontaneous neural oscillations in young adults as a function of quantity, frequency, and the pattern of their alcohol consumption. Sixty-one young adults (23.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 years of age) were assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups that were equated on gender, race/ethnic identity, age, educational background, and family history of alcoholism. EEG activity was recorded during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting conditions. Each participant's alpha peak frequency (APF) was used to calculate absolute power in individualized theta and alpha frequency bands, with a canonical frequency range used for beta. APF was slower by 0.7\u00a0Hz in BD, especially in individuals engaging in high-intensity drinking, but there were no changes in alpha power. BD also exhibited higher frontal theta and beta power than LD. Alpha slowing and increased theta power in BD remained after accounting for depression, anxiety, and personality characteristics, while elevated beta power covaried with sensation seeking. Furthermore, APF slowing and theta power correlated with various measures of alcohol consumption, including binge episodes and blackouts, but not with measures of working and episodic memory, cognitive flexibility, processing speed, or personality variables, suggesting that these physiological changes may be modulated by high-intensity alcohol intake. These results are consistent with studies of alcohol-use disorder (AUD) and support the hypothesis that binge drinking is a transitional stage toward alcohol dependence. The observed thalamocortical dysrhythmia may be indicative of an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance in BD and may potentially serve as an index of the progressive development of AUD, with a goal of informing possible interventions to minimize alcohol's deleterious effects on the brain.",

Hence, the current study was designed to examine neuropsychological differences among individuals who have committed domestic violence with high (n\u00a0=\u00a028, HA) and low (n\u00a0=\u00a035, LA) levels of alcohol consumption, and non-violent individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a037) to establish differential neuropsychological profiles. An exhaustive neuropsychological assessment battery was employed which combined the computer-based Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery with pencil-and-paper measures. Compared to controls, HA IPV perpetrators had slower processing speed and significantly more impairments in attentional set-shifting or switch attention, working and long-term memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, decision-making, emotion decoding skills, and perspective taking. Furthermore, there were differences between IPV perpetrator subgroups in attentional set-shifting or switch attention and cognitive empathy, with HA IPV perpetrators displaying more severe impairments in both cognitive domains than LA IPV perpetrators. Finally, the LA IPV perpetrators had significantly more impairments in working and long-term memory, executive functioning, and emotion decoding skills than controls, but they did not differ in processing speed, attentional set-shifting or switch attention, decision making, or perspective taking. Thus, the current findings suggest that IPV perpetrators with neuropsychological difficulties, especially those who are heavy drinkers, may have the greatest need for cognitive interventions. These cognitive deficits could be employed as targets for developing specific cognitive rehabilitation programs adjuvant to psychotherapeutic intervention for IPV perpetrators.",

Alcohol administration (intraperitoneally) or drinking (in a 2-bottle free choice paradigm) during the juvenile/adolescent age of rats promotes voluntary alcohol consumption in adulthood.

Since it is unknown what effect is exerted in adulthood by forced oral ethanol intake and/or administration of orexin-A (OX-A) in juvenile rats, the present study aimed to evaluate this question. A group of male Wistar rats was forced to drink ethanol (10% v/v) as the only liquid in the diet from weaning (postnatal day 21) to postnatal day 67 (46 days), followed by a forced withdrawal period. An age-matched group was raised drinking tap water (control). OX-A or its vehicle was microinjected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) (1\u00a0nmol/0.6\u00a0\u03bcL) to explore its effect as well. Locomotor activity and voluntary ethanol consumption were later assessed in all groups. The rats forced to consume ethanol early in life showed an elevated level of ambulation and alcohol ingestion in adulthood. A single injection of OX-A increased locomotor activity and acute ethanol intake in rats with or without prior exposure to alcohol at the juvenile stage. In conclusion, forced ethanol consumption in juvenile rats led to increased voluntary alcohol drinking behavior during adulthood, an effect likely facilitated by OX-A.",

Assessing unconditioned behaviors, such as drug-elicited yawning in models that permit long-term alcohol ingestion, may be a valuable complement to more invasive and costly procedures. The present studies investigated previous unexpected findings of ethanol-induced yawning in nonhuman primates. Subjects were adult male rhesus monkeys (n\u00a0=\u00a08), all of which had experience self-administering intravenous cocaine for several years. Four monkeys also had experience consuming 2.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol over 1\u00a0h per day, 5 days per week, for 6.8\u201312.0 months. All monkeys received saline or ethanol (0.25\u20131.0\u00a0g/kg) infused intravenously (i.v.) over 10\u00a0min, and the number of yawns elicited during the infusion was counted. A second experiment in the ethanol-experienced monkeys examined whether ethanol-induced yawning could be blocked by PG01037 (1.0, 3.0\u00a0mg/kg, i.v.), a selective antagonist at dopamine D3 receptors (D3R). Ethanol significantly and dose-dependently increased yawns in the ethanol-experienced animals, but not the ethanol-na\u00efve animals. In the ethanol-experienced monkeys, this effect of ethanol was blocked by the D3R antagonist. The pharmacology of yawning is complex and a good deal of model development remains to be performed to characterize the potential involvement of other neurotransmitter systems. Nonetheless, drug-elicited yawning may be a useful unconditioned behavioral assay to assess the effects of long-term alcohol consumption in established nonhuman primate models.",

     "abstract": "Dr. Kathleen Sulik (Kathy) has spent 35 years studying fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Beginning with her landmark 1981 Science paper describing the early gestational window when alcohol can cause the craniofacial malformations characteristic of FAS, Kathy has contributed a vast amount of research furthering our knowledge of FASD. After her seminal work that definitively demonstrated that alcohol is the causative factor in FAS, she and her lab went on to explore and define the stage-dependent effects of early gestational alcohol exposure on the face and brain in numerous different ways throughout her career. She explored and discovered numerous mechanisms of alcohol's effects on the embryo, as well as describing several genetic factors that can modify susceptibility to developmental alcohol exposure. She did not restrict her research to the face and brain; her lab described in intricate detail the effects of developmental alcohol exposure on many different organs, including the heart, ears, kidneys, and limbs. In addition to her research, and in conjunction with NIAAA and the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (NOFAS), Kathy developed several FASD prevention curricula that are still in use today. Finally, as part of her drive to eradicate FAS and FASD, Kathy labored tirelessly with public policy makers to change how FASD is viewed by the public, how FASD is identified in affected individuals, and how FASD is studied by researchers. While no article could fully cover Kathy's contributions to FASD research and prevention, or her other contributions to embryology and teratology, this review will attempt to illustrate some of the highlights of Kathy's remarkable career.",

     "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that deficits in social functioning and social anxiety are associated with adolescent alcohol use. Our previous research has shown that acute exposure to a high dose of ethanol on gestational day (G) 12 produces social alterations in adolescent Sprague Dawley rats. The present study assessed whether these social alterations can affect sensitivity to acute ethanol challenge during adolescence. Pregnant females were exposed intraperitoneally (i.p.) to ethanol (2.5\u00a0g/kg followed by 1.25\u00a0g/kg in 2\u00a0h) or saline on G12, and their male and female offspring were tested on postnatal day (P) 42. Rats were challenged i.p. with one of four ethanol doses (0, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0\u00a0g/kg), and their social behavior was assessed in a modified social interaction test. Social alterations associated with prenatal ethanol exposure and indexed via decreases of social investigation, social preference, and play fighting were evident in males and females challenged with the 0\u00a0g/kg ethanol dose. Acute ethanol increased social investigation, social preference, and play fighting in animals prenatally exposed to ethanol. In contrast, rats prenatally exposed to saline, showing no social facilitation, demonstrated significant ethanol-induced (0.75 and 1.0\u00a0g/kg) decreases in social behavior. Given that late adolescents demonstrating social alterations induced by prenatal ethanol exposure become sensitive to the socially anxiolytic as well as socially facilitating effects of acute ethanol, it is possible that the attractiveness of ethanol to these adolescents may be based on its ability to alleviate anxiety under social circumstances and facilitate interactions with peers.",

Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with numerous diseases. Alcohol has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species that can result in DNA damage, leading to genetic and epigenetic changes.A total of 25 subjects (13 male and 12 female) were enrolled. Alcohol intake in the form of vodka (40% ethanol) was adjusted based on 1.275\u00a0g of 100% ethanol/kg body weight for men and 1.020\u00a0g/kg body weight for women, which was consumed with and without the study product. Blood samples were drawn at 2\u00a0h after alcohol consumption, lymphocytes were isolated, and were subjected to DNA comet electrophoresis on a blinded basis.Acute alcohol consumption increased lymphocyte DNA damage by approximately 8.36%. Co-consumption of the glycyrrhizin/D-mannitol study product with alcohol reduced DNA damage to baseline levels. No adverse effects were associated with use of the study product, and no differences were observed in blood alcohol concentrations in the presence or absence of the study product in males and females.Acute alcohol ingestion resulted in measurable increases in DNA damage, which were prevented by the addition of the proprietary glycyrrhizin/D-mannitol (NTX\u00ae) study product to the alcohol, suggesting that the tissue-damaging effects of alcohol consumption can be ameliorated.",

     "abstract": "Implicit learning about antecedent stimuli and the unconditional stimulus (US) properties of alcohol may facilitate the progressive loss of control over drinking. To model this learning, Cofres\u00ed et\u00a0al. (2017) developed a procedure in which a discrete, visual conditional stimulus (houselight illumination; CS) predicted the availability of a retractable sipper that rats could lick to receive unsweetened alcohol [Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 41, 608\u2013617]. Here we investigated the possibility that houselight illumination, sipper presentation, and oral alcohol receipt might each exert control over alcohol seeking and drinking. We also determined the relationship between ingested dose and blood alcohol concentration, in order to validate the idea that the US is a post-ingestive action of alcohol. Finally, we tested a major prediction from the conditioning account of problematic drinking [Tomie, A., & Sharma, N. (2013). Current Drug Abuse Reviews, 6, 201\u2013219], which is that once learned, responses elicited by a CS will promote drinking. We found that despite having constrained opportunities to drink alcohol during the conditioning procedure, ingested doses produced discriminable blood concentrations that supported cue conditioning. Based on our analysis of the dynamics of cue reactivity in well-trained rats, we found that houselight illumination triggered conditioned approach, sipper presentation evoked licking behavior, and alcohol receipt promoted drinking. Reactivity to these cues, which varied in terms of their temporal proximity to the alcohol US, persisted despite progressive intoxication or satiety. Additionally, rats with the greatest conditioned reactivity to the most distal alcohol cue were also the fastest to initiate drinking and drank the most. Our findings indicate that the post-ingestive effects of alcohol may condition multiple cues simultaneously in adult rats, and these multiple cues help to trigger alcohol seeking and drinking. Moreover, identification and characterization of these cues should be helpful for designing interventions that attenuate the power of these cues over behavior.",

On the other hand, exercise training has been shown to improve redox status, thus attenuating oxidative stress-associated disease processes. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an exercise training program that has been previously reported to decrease alcohol consumption on blood redox status in heavy drinkers. In a non-randomized within-subject design, 11 sedentary, heavily drinking men (age: 30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5 years; BMI: 28.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\u00a0kg/m2) participated first in a control condition for 4 weeks, and then in an intervention where they completed an 8-week supervised aerobic training program of moderate intensity (50\u201360% of the heart rate reserve). Blood samples were collected in the control condition (pre-, post-control) as well as before, during (week 4 of the training program), and after intervention (week 8 of the training program). Samples were analyzed for total antioxidant capacity (TAC), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyls (PC), uric acid (UA), bilirubin, reduced glutathione (GSH), and catalase activity. No significant change in indices of redox status in the pre- and post-control was observed. Catalase activity increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after 8 weeks of intervention compared to week 4. GSH increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) after 8 weeks of intervention compared to the control condition and to week 4 of intervention. TAC, UA, bilirubin, TBARS, and PC did not significantly change at any time point. Moreover, concentrations of GSH, TBARS, and catalase activity negatively correlated with alcohol consumption. In conclusion, an 8-week aerobic training program enhanced erythrocyte antioxidant status in heavy drinkers, indicating that aerobic training may attenuate pathological processes caused by alcohol-induced oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide. Mortality in NAFLD is mainly related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. NAFLD and its association with both CVD and liver disease risk have been well evaluated, but the association of NAFLD with alcohol, known as \u201cboth alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis\u201d (BASH), remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the influence of alcohol and obesity in the development of liver and cardiovascular disease risk.This was a case-control study that included patients from a regular check-up. Alcohol consumption was evaluated with MAST, AUDIT, and CAGE. Cardiovascular risk was evaluated using the Framingham score, and liver fibrosis was evaluated with APRI and NAFLD score. Patients were classified in five groups: healthy patients, steatosis with obesity, steatosis with alcoholism, BASH, and idiopathic steatosis.A total of 414 patients were included. The BASH group represented 16% of patients, and showed a greater proportion of patients with high cardiovascular risk with 17% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and liver fibrosis with 9%, according to the APRI score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.10). A multivariate logistic regression showed that alcohol consumption >140\u00a0g/week (OR 2.546, 95% CI 1.11\u20135.81, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and BMI >25\u00a0kg/m2 (OR 12.64, 95% CI 1.66 96.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) were related to high cardiovascular risk.

A South African target population study was performed in a bi-ethnic cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0405).

Fasting blood samples were obtained. A poorer cardio-metabolic profile and mean 24-h hypertensive and ECG-LVH values were evident in high \u03b3-GT groups of both ethnicities, when compared to their low counterparts. The African high \u03b3-GT group reported a higher intake of alcohol and presented significant increases in NT-proBNP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), QTc prolongation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and ischemic events (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). Regression analyses revealed associations between ECG-LVH and NT-proBNP, QTc prolongation, ischemic events, and SBP, in the African high \u03b3-GT group exclusively. High alcohol consumers presented delayed electrical conduction in the heart accompanied by ECG-LVH, ischemic events, and increased vaso-responsiveness, predominantly in Africans.

Although most USV studies focus primarily on USV counts, each USV possesses a number of characteristics shown to reflect activity in the associated neurotransmitter system. In the present study, we recorded spontaneously emitted USVs from alcohol-na\u00efve high alcohol drinking (HAD-1) and low alcohol drinking (LAD-1) rats. Using our recently developed WAAVES algorithm, we quantified four acoustic characteristics (mean frequency, duration, power, and bandwidth) from each 22\u201328\u00a0kHz and 50\u201355\u00a0kHz frequency-modulated (FM) USV. This rich USV representation allowed us to apply advanced statistical techniques to identify the USV acoustic characteristics that distinguished HAD-1 from LAD-1 rats. Linear mixed models (LMM) examined the predictability of each USV characteristic in isolation and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and binomial logistic regression examined the predictability of linear combinations of the USV characteristics as a group. Results revealed significant differences in acoustic characteristics between HAD-1 and LAD-1 rats in both 22\u201328\u00a0kHz and 50\u201355\u00a0kHz FM USVs. In other words, these rats selectively bred for high- and low-alcohol consumption can be identified as HAD-1 or LAD-1 rats with high classification accuracy (approximately 92\u2013100%) exclusively based on their emitted 22\u201328\u00a0kHz and 50\u201355\u00a0kHz FM USV acoustic characteristics.

Our current findings provide novel evidence that USV acoustic characteristics can be used to discriminate between alcohol-na\u00efve HAD-1 and LAD-1 rats, and may serve as biomarkers in rodents with a predisposition for, or against, excessive alcohol intake.",

One aspect of AUD is physical dependence. Alcohol withdrawal is a serious consequence of alcohol dependence with multiple symptoms, many of which are seen in multiple species, and can be experienced over a wide-ranging time course.In the present three studies, we developed a battery of withdrawal tests in mice, examining behavioral symptoms from multiple domains that could be measured over time. To permit eventual use of the battery in different strains of mice, we used male and female mice of a genetically heterogeneous stock developed from intercrossing eight inbred strains.Withdrawal symptoms were assessed using commonly used tests after administration of ethanol in vapor for 72 continuous hours. We found significant effects of ethanol withdrawal versus air-breathing controls on nearly all symptoms, spanning 4 days following ethanol vapor inhalation. Withdrawal produced hypothermia, greater neurohyperexcitability (seizures and tremor), anxiety-like behaviors using an apparatus (such as reduced transitions between light and dark compartments), anhedonia (reduced sucrose preference), Straub tail, backward walking, and reductions in activity; however, there were no changes in thermal pain sensitivity, hyper-reactivity to handling, or anxiety-like emergence behaviors in other apparatus. Using these data, we constructed a refined battery of withdrawal tests. Individual differences in severity of withdrawal among different tests were weakly correlated at best. This battery should be useful for identifying genetic influences on particular withdrawal behaviors, which should reflect the influences of different constellations of genes.",

We used RNA sequencing to assess the effects of adolescent binge drinking on gene expression in these regions. Male adolescent alcohol-preferring (P) rats were exposed to repeated binge drinking (three 1-h sessions/day during the dark/cycle, 5 days/week for 3 weeks starting at 28 days of age; ethanol intakes of 2.5\u20133\u00a0g/kg/session). Ethanol significantly altered the expression of 416 of 11,727 genes expressed in the ventral hippocampus. Genes and pathways involved in neurogenesis, long-term potentiation, and axonal guidance were decreased, which could relate to the impaired memory function found in subjects with adolescent alcohol binge-like exposure. The decreased expression of myelin and cholesterol genes and apparent decrease in oligodendrocytes in P rats could result in decreased myelination. In the medial prefrontal cortex, 638 of 11,579 genes were altered; genes in cellular stress and inflammatory pathways were increased, as were genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. Overall, the results of this study suggest that adolescent binge-like alcohol drinking may alter the development of the ventral hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex and produce long-term consequences on learning and memory, and on control of impulsive behaviors.",

Moderate to heavy alcohol-exposed (AE) (N\u00a0=\u00a0149) and low or no alcohol-exposed (LNA) (N\u00a0=\u00a092) women were recruited into the study during mid pregnancy (mean of 19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8 weeks' gestation) in two regions of Ukraine: Khmelnytsky and Rivne. Maternal blood samples were obtained at enrollment into the study at early to mid-pregnancy and during a third-trimester follow-up visit and analyzed for plasma cytokines. Children were examined at 6 and/or 12 months of age and were classified as having FASD if their mothers reported alcohol use and if they had at least one standardized score (Bayley Scales of Infant Development II Mental Development Index [MDI], or Psychomotor Development Index [PDI]) below 85 with the presence or absence of physical features of FASD. In multivariate analyses of maternal cytokine levels in relation to infant MDI and PDI scores in the entire sample, increases in the ratio of TNF-\u03b1/IL-10 and IL-6/IL-10 were negatively associated with PDI scores at 6 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.020 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.036, respectively) and 12 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, respectively), and with MDI scores at 12 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.050, respectively).

However, women that failed to increase IL-10 levels in the third trimester in order to maintain the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines had an elevated risk of having an FASD child, specifically a significant increase in the odds ratio of FASD with every one-unit log increase in late pregnancy TNF-\u03b1/IL-10 levels (aOR: 1.654, CI: 1.096\u20132.495, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017).

     "abstract": "Purinergic P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) belong to the P2X superfamily of ionotropic receptors that are gated by adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP). Accumulating evidence indicates that P2X4Rs play an important role in regulation of ethanol intake. At the molecular level, ethanol's inhibitory effects on P2X4Rs are antagonized by ivermectin (IVM), in part, via action on P2X4Rs. Behaviorally, male mice deficient in the p2rx4 gene (P2X4R knockout [KO]) have been shown to exhibit a transient increase in ethanol intake over a period of 4 days, as demonstrated by social and binge drinking paradigms. Furthermore, IVM reduced ethanol consumption in male and female rodents, whereas male P2X4R KO mice were less sensitive to the anti-alcohol effects of IVM, compared to wildtype (WT) mice, further supporting a role for P2X4Rs as targets of IVM's action. The current investigation extends testing the hypothesis that P2X4Rs play a role in regulation of ethanol intake. First, we tested the response of P2X4R KO mice to ethanol for a period of 5 weeks. Second, to gain insights into the changes in ethanol intake, we employed a lentivirus-shRNA (LV-shRNA) methodology to selectively knockdown P2X4R expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core in male C57BL/6J mice. In agreement with our previous study, male P2X4R KO mice exhibited higher ethanol intake than WT mice. Additionally, reduced expression of P2X4Rs in the NAc core significantly increased ethanol intake and preference. Collectively, the findings support the hypothesis that P2X4Rs play a role in regulation of ethanol intake and that P2X4Rs represent a novel drug target for treatment of alcohol use disorder.",

Among several stress mediators, nitric oxide (NO) has a role in stress responses. We have demonstrated that adolescent mice are less sensitive to ethanol-induced sensitization than adult mice. The present study investigated whether chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) induces behavioral sensitization to ethanol in adolescent and adult Swiss mice, and investigated the influence of Ca2+-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in the phenomenon. Adolescent and adult mice were exposed to repeated 1.8\u00a0g/kg ethanol or CUS and challenged with saline or ethanol. A neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7NI), was administered along with ethanol and CUS to test its effects on behavioral sensitization. Both adolescent and adult mice displayed cross-sensitization between CUS and ethanol in adult mice, with adolescents showing a lower degree of sensitization than adults. nNOS inhibition by 7NI reduced both ethanol sensitization and cross-sensitization. All age differences in the Ca2+-dependent NOS activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were in the direction of greater activity in adults than in adolescents. Adolescents showed lower sensitivity to cross-sensitization between CUS and ethanol, and the nitric oxide (NO) system seems to have a pivotal role in ethanol-induced behavioral sensitization and cross-sensitization in both adolescent and adult mice.",

Previous work showed that abstinent alcoholics endorsed lifetime and current symptoms of most of the BPD criteria at much higher rates than controls, with much higher symptom counts for short-term abstinent alcoholic (STAA) women than men, which is consistent with such symptoms negatively affecting female alcoholics' ability to maintain abstinence. Because prior work has also shown that treatment-na\u00efve alcoholics (TNA) are not the same as treated alcoholics observed earlier in their alcohol dependence, but rather are a different population with potentially lower psychiatric comorbidity, in this study we compared BPD symptom criteria between TNA samples of comparable age to the control and STAA samples, including both men and women and individuals dependent on alcohol only or with lifetime dependence on both alcohol and drugs. BPD symptoms were obtained using the SCID-II, and endorsed symptoms were classified as current or lifetime. Logistic regression analyses were used to test for effects of group, sex, presence of a lifetime drug dependence diagnosis, and their interactions for lifetime and current symptom endorsement for each BPD criteria. Groups were compared pairwise (TNA vs. NSAC, and STAA vs. TNA). The effect of a lifetime drug dependence diagnosis was not significant for any BPD symptom variable, consistent with the alcohol groups\u2019 BPD symptoms being unaffected by the presence of a comorbid drug dependence. The primary result presented here is that TNA women have borderline symptomatology more similar to that of treated STAA than to NSAC, while TNA men have borderline symptomatology more similar to NSAC than to STAA. A visual examination of co-occurring BPD symptoms showed that while more BPD symptoms are likely to be present in TNA and STAA vs. NSAC, there is no grouping of criteria (i.e., symptom cluster) that is characteristic of TNA or STAA.",

A total of 153 women attending a university hospital in Barcelona (Spain) were selected and interviewed after delivery, on their smoking and drinking habits during pregnancy. A 9-cm hair strand was collected and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for the presence of nicotine (NIC) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) as biomarkers of tobacco and alcohol consumption, respectively. Concentrations of EtG <7\u00a0pg/mg hair and \u226530\u00a0pg/mg hair in the 0\u20133-cm hair segment have been used to assess, respectively, total abstinence and chronic excessive consumption in the previous 3 months, with repetitive moderate drinking lying in the interval 7\u201330\u00a0pg EtG per mg hair. Hair NIC less than 1\u00a0ng/mg hair indicates non-exposure to tobacco smoke while hair NIC indicates daily active smoking. In the interview, 28.1% of women declared to have smoked occasionally during gestation, while only 2.6% stated to have consumed alcohol on more than one occasion during pregnancy. Hair testing of smoking biomarkers disclosed that 7.2% of women remained active smokers during the whole pregnancy (hair NIC: 3.21\u201356.98\u00a0ng/mg hair), 16.3% were passive non-smokers or occasional smokers (hair NIC: 1.04\u20132.99\u00a0ng/mg hair), while 76.5% were not exposed to any cigarette smoke (hair NIC\u00a0<\u00a0limit of quantification \u2013 0.91\u00a0ng/mg hair). Conversely, alcohol hair biomarkers showed that only 35.3% of women were totally abstinent during gestation (hair EtG: 3.89\u20136.73\u00a0pg/mg hair), while 62.7% drank a non-negligible amount of alcohol during pregnancy (hair EtG: 7.06\u201326.57\u00a0pg/mg hair), and 2% were chronic excessive drinkers (hair EtG: 35.33\u201347.52\u00a0pg/mg hair). Maternal hair analysis has shown to be significantly more sensitive than interviews in revealing an alarming misreported prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy. These findings stress the need to use objective measures to assess alcohol exposure and to consider the inclusion of targeted actions to reduce alcohol consumption in maternal-child health policies.",

Direct metabolites of alcohol, phosphatidylethanol (PEth), ethyl sulfate (EtS), and ethyl glucuronide (EtG), are known to improve diagnostic accuracy. In this study, methods were established for the identification of PEth in erythrocytes and EtG and EtS in serum using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The three biomarkers were tested and validated in volunteer teetotalers (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and drinkers (n\u00a0=\u00a010), and applied in patients (n\u00a0=\u00a08) hospitalized with alcohol-related problems. Linearity of each assay was demonstrated from 22.5 to 900\u00a0nM for EtG, 40\u20133175\u00a0nM for EtS, and 21\u2013750\u00a0nM for PEth. The methods were highly selective, precise (<5% coefficient of variation), and had optimal accuracy (within 10% of the nominal value) for all three analytes. Recovery for all three compounds exceeded 90%. A preliminary investigation into the window of detection of these biomarkers after a single occasion of moderate alcohol consumption revealed that EtG and EtS could be detected and quantified over the short term (days) and PEth over the long term (weeks). All three biomarkers showed high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between abstinence and any alcohol use at the cut-off values of 22.5\u00a0nM for EtG, 40\u00a0nM for EtS, and 21\u00a0nM for PEth.

Tolcapone was administered to male and female alcohol-reinforced P and Wistar rats. Additionally, tolcapone was administered to male sucrose-reinforced P and Wistar rats to determine if its effects also extended to a natural reinforcer. Animals were trained to make an operant response that resulted in 20\u00a0min uninterrupted access to the reinforcer solutions. Tolcapone had no effect in female rats on either seeking or consumption of ethanol. However, reductions of both reinforcer seeking and consumption were observed in male P rats, but only of seeking in Wistars. In separate experiments, using reinforcer na\u00efve male and female animals, COMT expression was assessed via Western Blot analysis. Sex differences in COMT expression were also observed, where male P rats exhibited a marked reduction in protein expression relative to females in the PFC. Sex differences were not observed for Wistars or in the striatum and hippocampus. These data complement our previous findings in which tolcapone reduced cue-evoked responses in P rats and further suggest clinical utility of COMT inhibitors in the treatment of addiction disorders, specifically in male high drinkers.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol operant self-administration paradigms are critical tools for studying the neural circuits implicated in both alcohol-seeking and consummatory behaviors and for understanding the neural basis underlying alcohol-use disorders. In this study, we investigate the predictive value of two operant models of oral alcohol self-administration in mice, one in which alcohol is delivered into a cup following nose-poke responses with no accurate measurement of consumed alcohol solution, and another paradigm that provides access to alcohol via a sipper tube following lever presses and where lick rate and consumed alcohol volume can be measured. The goal was to identify a paradigm where operant behaviors such as lever presses and nose pokes, as well as other tracked behavior such as licks and head entries, can be used to reliably predict blood alcohol concentration (BAC). All mice were first exposed to alcohol in the home cage using the \u201cdrinking in the dark\u201d (DID) procedure for 3 weeks and then were trained in alcohol self-administration using either of the operant paradigms for several weeks. Even without sucrose fading or food pre-training, mice acquired alcohol self-administration with both paradigms. However, neither lever press nor nose-poke rates were good predictors of alcohol intake or BAC. Only the lick rate and consumed alcohol were consistently and significantly correlated with BAC. Using this paradigm that accurately measures alcohol intake, unsupervised cluster analysis revealed three groups of mice: high-drinking (43%), low-drinking (37%), and non-drinking mice (20%). High-drinking mice showed faster acquisition of operant responding and achieved higher BACs than low-drinking mice. Lick rate and volume consumed varied with the alcohol concentration made available only for high- and low-drinking mice, but not for non-drinking mice. In addition, high- and low-drinking mice showed similar patterns during extinction and significant cue-induced reinstatement of seeking. Only high-drinking mice showed insensitivity to quinine adulteration, indicating a willingness to drink alcohol despite pairing with aversive stimuli. Thus, this study shows that relying on active presses is not an accurate determination of drinking behavior in mice. Only paradigms that allow for accurate measurements of consumed alcohol and/or lick rate are valid models of operant alcohol self-administration, where compulsive-like drinking could be accurately determined based on changes in alcohol intake when paired with bitter-tasting stimuli.",

Our sample included 681 patients evaluated for FASD, according to the University of Washington 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, at a pediatric specialty clinic. Guardianship status and other patient characteristics were evaluated by multinomial logistic regression as potential predictors of being classified into one of the following FASD groups: 1) full or partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS/pFAS; n\u00a0=\u00a097); 2) Static Encephalopathy/Alcohol-Exposed (SE/AE) or Neurobehavioral Disorder/Alcohol-Exposed (ND/AE) (n\u00a0=\u00a0135); and 3) some features of FASD (equivalent to pFAS, SE/AE or ND/AE phenotypes) but unknown PAE (n\u00a0=\u00a0449). Median age at assessment was 7.0 years, non-Hispanic White constituted the predominant racial/ethnic group (49.5%), and the majority (81.8%) lacked involvement from a biological parent/relative.

The subjects of this study were 21,572 middle-aged Japanese men, and they were divided into three tertile groups for blood HDL cholesterol levels. The relationships between habitual alcohol intake and LDL cholesterol levels were investigated in each tertile for HDL cholesterol. In all of the tertile groups for HDL cholesterol, mean LDL cholesterol levels were significantly lower in the drinking subgroups than in the nondrinking subgroup and tended to be lower with an increase of alcohol intake. In all of the tertile groups for HDL cholesterol, odds ratios for high LDL cholesterol of each drinking subgroup vs. the nondrinking subgroup were significantly lower than the reference level of 1.00, and also tended to be lower with an increase of alcohol intake. The odds ratios of each drinking subgroup tended to be lower in the 1st tertile group for HDL cholesterol than in the 3rd tertile group. Drinkers in the 1st tertile for HDL cholesterol are thought to have relatively low sensitivity of HDL cholesterol to alcohol, but clearly showed lower LDL cholesterol levels than those found in nondrinkers. Therefore, the sensitivity of LDL cholesterol level to alcohol is different from the sensitivity of HDL cholesterol level to alcohol.",

Comparisons were also made between 631 cases who had reportedly been abstinent from alcohol for over 60 days and 364 who had not. ROC curve analysis was used to estimate and compare tests' ability to distinguish patients with and without cirrhosis, and abstinent and drinking cases. The best tests for presence of cirrhosis were INR and bilirubin, with areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 and 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, respectively.

INR and bilirubin show the best separation between patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (with or without ascites) and control patients with similar lifetime alcohol exposure. Although AST and GGT are substantially increased by liver disease, they can give useful information on recent alcohol intake in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis when appropriate cut-off limits are used.",

The current study examined the effects of an attention refocusing manipulation to offset the effects of this WM-load on DD rates in control subjects, those with AUDs without AP, and AUDs with AP (AUD-AP). Results revealed that 1) the AUD-AP group had higher DD rates (i.e., more impulsive decision-making) than the AUD group, followed by controls, and 2) attention refocusing after a load is placed on WM was associated with lower DD rates compared to the load without refocusing in both AUD groups, but not controls.

Here, we probe changes in mRNA and protein expression of the pore-forming CaV2.1-\u03b11 (P/Q-type) subunits in IC neurons during the course of alcohol withdrawal-induced seizures (AWSs). Rats received three daily doses of ethanol or the vehicle every 8\u00a0h for 4 consecutive days. The IC was dissected at various time intervals following alcohol withdrawal, and the mRNA and protein levels of the CaV2.1-\u03b11 subunits were measured. In separate experiments, rats were tested for acoustically evoked seizure susceptibility 3, 24, and 48\u00a0h after alcohol withdrawal. AWSs were observed 24\u00a0h after withdrawal; no seizures were observed at 3 or 48\u00a0h or in the control-treated rats. Compared to control-treated rats, the mRNA levels of the CaV2.1-\u03b11 subunit were increased 1.9-fold and 2.1-fold at 3 and 24\u00a0h, respectively; change in mRNA expression was nonsignificant at 48\u00a0h following alcohol withdrawal. Western blot analyses revealed that protein levels of the CaV2.1-\u03b11 subunits were not altered in IC neurons following alcohol withdrawal. We conclude that expression of the Cacna1a mRNA increased before the onset of AWS susceptibility, suggesting that altered CaV2.1 channel expression may play a role in AWS pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The fetal brain exhibits exquisite alcohol-induced regional neuronal vulnerability. A candidate mechanism for alcohol-mediated brain deficits is disruption of amino acid (AA) bioavailability. AAs are vitally important for proper neurodevelopment, as they comprise the most abundant neurotransmitters in the brain and act as neurotransmitter precursors, nitric oxide donors, antioxidants, and neurotrophic factors, which induce synaptogenesis, neuronal proliferation, and migration. We hypothesized that gestational alcohol alters brain AA concentrations, disrupts AAs associated with neuropathogenesis, and that alterations are region-specific. We assigned pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats to either a pair-fed control or a binge alcohol treatment group on gestational day (GD) 4. Alcohol animals were acclimatized via a once-daily orogastric gavage of a 4.5\u00a0g/kg alcohol dose from GD 5\u201310, and progressed to a 6\u00a0g/kg alcohol dose from GD 11\u201320. Pair-fed animals received isocaloric maltose dextrin (once daily; GD 5\u201320). Fetal cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were collected on GD 21. Following collection, Fluorometric High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) involving pre-column derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde quantified regional content of 22 AAs. Chronic binge alcohol administration to pregnant dams regionally altered AA concentrations in all three structures, with the cerebral cortex exhibiting the least vulnerability and the hippocampus exhibiting maximal vulnerability. We conjecture that the AA imbalances observed in this study are critically implicated in pathological and compensatory processes occurring in the brain in response to gestational alcohol exposure.",

While animal models have been crucial to identifying actions of alcohol on neural cells, human-derived in\u00a0vitro systems that reflect an individual's genetic background hold promise in furthering our understanding of the molecular and functional effects of alcohol exposure and the pathophysiology of AUD. In this report, we utilized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived neural cell cultures obtained from healthy individuals (CTLs) and those with alcohol dependence (ADs) to 1) examine the effect of 21-day alcohol exposure on mRNA expression of three genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits (GABRA1, GABRG2, and GABRD) using quantitative PCR, and 2) examine the effect of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on GABA-evoked currents using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. iPSCs from CTLs and ADs were differentiated into neural cultures enriched for forebrain-type excitatory glutamate neurons. Following 21-day alcohol exposure, significant treatment effects were observed in GABRA1, GABRG2, and GABRD mRNA expression. A modestly significant interaction between treatment and donor phenotype was observed for GABRD, which was increased in cell cultures derived from ADs. No effect of acute or chronic alcohol was observed on GABA-evoked currents in neurons from either CTLs or ADs. This work extends findings examining the effects of alcohol on the GABAA receptor in human cell in\u00a0vitro model systems.",

     "abstract": "Individuals with a low initial response to alcohol (i.e., ethanol) are at greater risk of developing alcohol abuse or dependence later in life. Similar to humans, individual differences in ethanol sensitivity also can be seen in rats, and several laboratories have used these individual differences to generate selectively bred rats that differ in acute ethanol sensitivity. We have worked with two sets of such rats (Inbred High or Low Alcohol Sensitivity strains, IHAS or ILAS, respectively; Inbred Alcohol Tolerant or Non-Tolerant strains, IAT and IANT, respectively) and have confirmed previously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for these acute differences with the use of recombinant congenic lines; however, the relationship between acute sensitivity and ethanol drinking in these rats has yet to be determined. Thus, here we tested the hypothesis that QTLs underlying variation in initial low sensitivity to ethanol also will modulate variation in ethanol drinking behaviors. Separate groups of selectively inbred parent and congenic rats were tested for the loss of righting response (LORR) and also assessed for ethanol consummatory behavior using either operant self-administration or an intermittent-access two-bottle choice procedure. LORR testing confirmed the presence of a LORR duration QTL in all of the congenics; however, the lack of a corresponding difference in blood ethanol concentration at the regaining of the righting response suggests that these QTLs may be mediating a difference in ethanol metabolism rather than in neuronal sensitivity. IHAS/ILAS-derived congenic rats did not differ from parent rats at any point during operant self-administration. IAT/IANT-derived congenic rats showed small, but significant, increases in ethanol consumption relative to the parent strains only during the initial stages of operant self-administration. In contrast to operant testing, IHAS/ILAS-derived congenic rats showed significantly greater ethanol consumption and preference than parent rats during intermittent-access testing. There were not differences, however, between IAT/IANT congenic and parent rats during intermittent access. These data support the hypothesis that there is a genetic relationship between initial ethanol sensitivity and ethanol consumption, at least for the IHAS/ILAS-derived congenic rats. Our current studies, however, cannot eliminate pharmacokinetic or taste preference factors as contributing to the rats' responses, nor can we eliminate the possibility of a linkage effect because of the fairly large size of the QTL intervals; i.e., distinct genes may be mediating the acute sensitivity and drinking responses.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol abuse often co-exists with a major depressive disorder. In order to understand the development of this comorbidity, it is important to concentrate on the preceding process. It has been suggested that the link between alcohol use and depressive symptoms is a result of an interaction with genetic factors. The aim of this study was to longitudinally examine the effect of the 5-HTTLPR genotype on the association between depressive symptoms and alcohol use in a Dutch community sample. Following a stepwise approach, bivariate correlations, longitudinal regression analyses, and latent growth curve analyses were separately conducted for 316 males and 321 females. A positive correlation between depressive symptoms and alcohol use was shown in female carriers of the 5-HTTLPR short allele. In addition, latent growth curve analyses showed a positive association between alcohol use and the intercept of depressive symptoms (but not the slope), but only in female carriers of the 5-HTTLPR short allele. These findings show that alcohol use may be positively related, at least cross-sectionally, to depressive symptoms in female carriers of the 5-HTTLPR S allele, and indicate that moderators such as SLC6A4 genotype and sex need to be taken into account when examining associations between depressive symptoms and drinking behavior. In order to gain insight into the longitudinal association between alcohol use and depressive symptoms, studies should concentrate on earlier stages and focus on more fine-grained research designs that allow day-to-day changes in both alcohol use and depressive symptoms.",

The mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (LY37) and selective mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator biphenyl\u2011indanone A (BINA) were used to investigate the relative contribution of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors on ethanol- and sucrose-seeking and consumption. A microinjection study was then performed to examine the role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) core mGluR2/3 on ethanol-seeking. For the systemic experiments, separate groups of male Wistar rats [LY37 (0\u20132.0 mg/kg); BINA (0\u201320 mg/kg)] were trained to complete a response requirement (RR) resulting in access to 10% ethanol or 2% sucrose (in separate groups) for a 20\u2011min drinking period. Animals then underwent consummatory testing (weekly drug injections with RR1) followed by appetitive testing (weekly drug injections followed by extinction session). A separate group of male Wistar rats was surgically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae directed toward the NAc core and had weekly microinjections followed by an extinction session. Systemic administration of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY37 significantly reduced ethanol- and sucrose-seeking. The same treatment also reduced sucrose consumption and body weight (24\u2011h post injection). Systemic administration of the selective mGluR2 PAM BINA, however, had no effect on either seeking or consumption of ethanol or sucrose. Intra-accumbens core LY37 significantly reduced ethanol-seeking. These findings suggest that systemic mGluR2/3 agonism, but not allosteric modulation of mGluR2, reduces reinforcer-seeking. In particular, NAc core group II mGluR may be involved in regulating ethanol-seeking.",

     "abstract": "Neuroinflammation may play an important role in the development of alcohol addiction. Recent preclinical reports suggest that enhanced innate immune system signaling increases consumption of alcohol. Our aim was to study whether consequences of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sickness reaction increase long-term alcohol intake. Adult male C57BL/6J mice, housed in individually ventilated cages, were injected with LPS intraperitoneally (i.p.) and allowed to recover from an acute sickness reaction for 1 week before analysis of their alcohol intake in two different drinking models. Effects of LPS challenge were tested in a continuous two-bottle free choice test with increasing concentrations of alcohol and in a drinking in the dark (DID) binge model. In addition, the effect of repeatedly administered LPS during abstinence periods between binge drinking was analyzed in the DID model. In addition, the DID model was used to study the effects of the microglia inhibitor minocycline (50\u00a0mg/kg/day, 4 days) and purinergic P2X7 receptor antagonist Brilliant Blue G (75\u00a0mg/kg/day, 7 days) on alcohol intake. In contrast to previous findings, pretreatment with a 1-mg/kg dose of LPS did not significantly increase ethanol consumption in the continuous two-bottle choice test. As a novel finding, we report that increasing the LPS dose to 1.5\u00a0mg/kg reduced consumption of 18 and 21% (v/v) ethanol. In the DID model, pretreatment with LPS (0.2\u20131.5\u00a0mg/kg) did not significantly alter 15% or 20% ethanol consumption. Neither did repeated LPS injections affect binge alcohol drinking. Minocycline reduced alcohol, but also water, intake regardless of LPS pretreatment. No data on effects of P2X7 antagonists on alcohol consumption have been previously published; therefore, we report here that subchronic Brilliant Blue G had no effect on alcohol intake in the DID model. As a conclusion, further studies are needed to validate this LPS model of the interaction between immune system activation and alcohol consumption.",

The method was applied in a drinking study and by analyzing 147 forensic case samples. In the drinking study, contrary to EtG, NAcT proved to be an endogenous substance, which was present at 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0ng/mL (13\u201331\u00a0ng/mL) in the blood after 2 weeks of abstinence. A moderate increase in NAcT to 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0ng/mL (27\u201357\u00a0ng/mL) was observed after drinking. Within 24\u00a0h, the NAcT concentrations declined to starting concentrations in seven out of eight subjects.

While EtG in blood can be used to detect alcohol consumption even if ethanol is already eliminated, some of the maximum NAcT concentrations after a single ethanol dose were in the range of endogenous levels detected prior to the start of drinking in other subjects. In the 147 blood samples, the following concentrations were found: blood alcohol concentration (BAC): 1.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.95\u00a0g/kg (0\u20133.46\u00a0g/kg); NAcT: 37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.4\u00a0ng/mL (12.1\u2013109\u00a0ng/mL); EtG: 1149\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01121\u00a0ng/mL (0\u20135950\u00a0ng/mL). ROC curve analysis for BAC thresholds at 0.8 and 1.6\u00a0g/kg were performed for EtG and NAcT. Due to the presence of endogenous NAcT levels resulting in a lower sensitivity and selectivity when compared to EtG, and due to a minor increase in concentration after alcohol uptake, the usefulness of NAcT as an alcohol biomarker in blood is very limited.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies have reported that light-to-moderate drinkers have a lower risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) than abstainers, and that heavy drinking increases the risk of PAD. However, reports of the effects of severe alcohol drinking on PAD are lacking within a population-based cohort. Alcohol intoxication is typically considered a medical emergency at clinics in Taiwan and is commonly attributed to excessive alcohol use. The present study aimed to investigate the association between alcohol intoxication and PAD risk. We conducted a retrospective, population-based, health insurance cohort study consisting of 56,544 adult patients with alcohol intoxication between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, using claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan. This database included a control cohort of 226,176 residents without alcohol intoxication. The patients were age- and gender-matched. The incidence rate of PAD, after data regarding alcohol intoxication were obtained, was 12.8 per 10,000 person-years, and the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of PAD was 3.80 (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a03.35\u20134.32, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The log-rank test showed that patients with alcohol intoxication had a considerably higher PAD cumulative incidence rate than those without alcohol intoxication. Alcohol intoxication was significantly associated with an increased risk of PAD in men (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a03.77, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.30\u20134.31) and women (HR\u00a0=\u00a04.26, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.60\u20136.97). The aHRs of PAD risk were 7.64 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a04.39\u201313.3), 4.51 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.83\u20135.29), and 2.16 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.69\u20132.77) for patients with alcohol intoxication compared to participants of the control group aged <35 years, 35\u201364 years, and \u226565 years, respectively. The individuals with alcohol intoxication and without any comorbidities had a 3.77-fold increased risk of PAD in comparison to that of the control cohorts (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.77, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.30\u20134.30). The aHR of PAD in patients with alcohol intoxication was 4.53 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.51\u20138.16) in comparison to the control cohort, which consisted of patients with at least one existing comorbidity. Alcohol intoxication, along with the severe complications of excessive alcohol use, should be considered as major risk factors of PAD in the setting of a medical emergency. Further research needs to be performed to evaluate the quantitative effect of alcohol use on PAD.",

In Brazil, there is little information about the occurrence of these SNPs in the AUD population and an absence of studies characterizing the population in the Central-West Region of Brazil. Actually, in Brazil, there are more than 4 million people with AUD. Despite the major health hazards of AUD, information on alcohol consumption and its consequences are not well understood. Therefore, it is extremely important to characterize these SNPs for the better understanding of AUD as a genetic disease in the Brazilian population. The present study, unlike other studies in other countries, is done with a subject population that shows a significant amount of racial homogenization. We evaluated the presence of SNPs in the ADH (ADH1B, ADH1C, and ADH4) and ALDH (ALDH2) genes in alcohol users of Goi\u00e2nia, State of Goi\u00e1s \u2013 Brazil, and then we established a possible relationship with AUD by allelic and genotypic study.

DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples and the genotyping was performed using TaqMan\u00ae SNP genotyping assays. For characterization and evaluation of SNPs in the population, genotype frequency, allele frequency, haplotype frequency, Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium were analyzed. Statistical analyses were calculated by GENEPOP 4.5 and Haploview software. The allele 1 was considered as \u201cwild\u201d (or *1) and allele 2 as mutant (or *2). Significant differences were found for ADH1B*, ADH4*2, and ALDH2*2 SNPs when the genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed. In addition, four haplotypes were observed between ADH1B*2 and ADH1C*2 through linkage disequilibrium analysis. The genetic variants may be associated with protection against AUD in the population studied.",

Manual 3D-CT volumetry of the urinary bladder was performed and the mechanism of injury, patient demographics, BAC, serum creatinine, and hematocrit were retrospectively analyzed. Semi-automated calculation of UBV was performed in 30 patients. Statistical analysis included ROC analysis to calculate cut-off values, sensitivity, and specificity. The Mann-Whitney test and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to detect significant correlations between UBV and BAC.Manual 3D-CT volumetry showed maximum sensitivity and specificity with a cut-off value for urinary bladder volume of 416.3\u00a0mL (sensitivity 50.9%; specificity 76.3%; AUC 0.678). With a cut-off value of 4.2\u00a0mL/\u03bcmol for the creatinine quotient (quotient of serum creatinine and UBV), the sensitivity was 64.2% (specificity 67.0%; AUC 0.681). Semi-automated 3D-CT volumetry resulted in lower UBV values compared to those obtained with manual 3D-CT volumetry.Semi-automated 3D-CT volumetry is a reliable method to quantify UBV. UBV correlates with positive BAC results. A UBV above 416\u00a0mL seen on an initial whole-body CT must raise suspicion of alcohol intoxication. The creatinine quotient is an even more sensitive and specific parameter for the detection of alcohol intoxication.",

During the last 2 weeks of feeding, the ethanol groups were binged with 2\u00a0g/kg of ethanol by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; controls were treated with i.p. saline. For recovery effects, at the 6-week time point, ethanol exposures were tapered over 2 days, and then discontinued, rendering the rats ethanol-free for 12 days. Anterior corpus callosum WM lipid ion profiles were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) and correlated with histopathology. Ethanol exposures caused progressive atrophy and reductions in myelin staining intensity within the corpus callosum, whereas short-term recovery partially reversed those effects. MALDI-IMS demonstrated striking ethanol-associated alterations in WM lipid profiles characterized by reduced levels of phosphatidylinositols, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sulfatides, and partial \u201cnormalization\u201d of lipid expression with recovery. Ethanol exposure duration and recovery responses were further distinguished by heatmap hierarchical dendrogram and PCA plots. In conclusion, chronic+binge ethanol exposures caused progressive, partially reversible WM atrophy with myelin loss associated with reduced expression of WM phospholipids and sulfatides. The extent of WM lipid abnormalities suggests that ethanol broadly impairs molecular and biochemical functions regulating myelin synthesis, degradation, and maintenance in oligodendrocytes.",

Patients were assessed for hazardous alcohol use using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Information on sociodemographic correlates, clinical history, severity of symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as quality of life (QOL) was collected.The overall prevalence of hazardous alcohol use among the sample was 12.6%. The prevalence of hazardous alcohol use among patients with depression and schizophrenia was 18.8% and 6.4%, respectively. Compared to those who were students, patients who were gainfully employed or unemployed were more likely to engage in hazardous alcohol use (Odds Ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a05.5 and 7.7, respectively). Patients with depression compared to those with schizophrenia (OR\u00a0=\u00a011.1) and those who were current smokers compared to those who had never smoked (OR\u00a0=\u00a014.5) were more likely to engage in hazardous alcohol use. Hazardous alcohol use was associated with lower QOL in the physical health domain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).Given the significant prevalence of hazardous alcohol use in this population, routine screening for hazardous alcohol use and brief interventions could be an effective way of managing this comorbidity. There is a need to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate brief interventions based on patient preference in this setting.",

Our primary aim was to determine if an alcohol- and drug-use BI reduced alcohol use and increased alcohol treatment services utilization among adult emergency department (ED) patients who drink alcohol and require an intervention for their drug use. Our secondary aims were to assess when the greatest relative reductions in alcohol use occurred, and which patients (stratified by need for an alcohol use intervention) reduced their alcohol use the most. In this secondary analysis, we studied a sub-sample of participants from the Brief Intervention for Drug Misuse in the Emergency Department (BIDMED) randomized, controlled trial of a BI vs. no BI, whose responses to the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) indicated a need for a BI for any drug use, and who also reported alcohol use. Participants were stratified by their ASSIST alcohol subscore: 1) no BI needed, 2) a BI needed, or 3) an intensive intervention needed for alcohol use. Alcohol use and alcohol treatment services utilization were measured every 3 months for 12 months post-enrollment. Of these 833 participants, median age was 29 years-old, 46% were female; 55% were white/non-Hispanic, 27% black/non-Hispanic, and 15% Hispanic. Although any alcohol use, alcohol use frequency, days of alcohol use, typical drinks consumed/day, and most drinks consumed/day decreased in both the BI and no BI arms, there were no differences between study arms. Few patients sought alcohol use treatment services in follow-up, and utilization also did not differ by study arm. Compared to baseline, alcohol use reduced the most during the first 3 months after enrollment, yet reduced little afterward. Participants whose ASSIST alcohol subscores indicated a need for an intensive intervention generally had the greatest relative decreases in alcohol use. These results indicate that the BI was not efficacious in reducing alcohol use among alcohol- and drug-using adult ED patients than the self-assessments alone, but suggest that self-assessments with or without a BI may confer reductions in alcohol use.",

     "publication date": "11-2017",
     "abstract": "Acute ethanol intoxication impairs immunological reactions and increases the risk of sepsis; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Pentraxin (PTX) 3 is a humoral pattern recognition receptor whose levels rapidly increase in response to inflammation. PTX3 production is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and is mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). As PTX3 exerts protective effects against sepsis as well as acute lung injury, we investigated whether acute ethanol exposure exacerbates sepsis by altering PTX3 expression. Sepsis was induced in C57/BL6 mice by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) after ethanol/saline administration. Survival rates were significantly lower in ethanol-treated than in saline-treated mice. Increased vascular permeability and attenuation of PTX3 expression were observed in the lungs of ethanol-treated mice 4\u00a0h after CLP. Concomitant with a delayed increase of plasma TNF-\u03b1 in ethanol-treated mice, plasma PTX3 was also suppressed in the early phase of sepsis. Although TNF-\u03b1 level in ethanol-treated mice exceeded that in saline-treated mice 16\u00a0h after CLP, PTX3 levels were still suppressed in the former group. JNK phosphorylation in lung tissue was suppressed in both groups 4 and 16\u00a0h after CLP. Furthermore, JNK phosphorylation in ethanol-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells was suppressed even in the presence of exogenous TNF-\u03b1, resulting in inhibition of PTX3 mRNA and protein expression. Our results suggest that ethanol suppresses de novo PTX3 synthesis via two mechanisms \u2013 i.e., suppression of TNF-\u03b1 production and inhibition of JNK phosphorylation. PTX3 suppression may therefore contribute to exacerbation of sepsis in acute ethanol intoxication.",

Children ages 10 to 16 with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE group; n\u00a0=\u00a018) and controls (CON group; n\u00a0=\u00a019) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a SWM task. Whole brain task-related functional connectivity of bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) seed regions were estimated for each participant using a psychophysiological interaction approach. Children in the AE group were less accurate than children in the CON group when performing the SWM task (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Positive coupling between bilateral DLPFC seeds and regions within the fronto-parietal network was observed in the CON group, whereas the AE group showed negative connectivity. In contrast to the CON group, the AE group showed positive connectivity between PPC seeds and frontal lobe regions. Across seeds, decreased negative coupling with regions outside the fronto-parietal network (e.g., left middle occipital gyrus) were observed in the AE group relative to the CON group. Functional data clusters were considered significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Overall findings suggest that localized alterations in neural activity, aberrant fronto-parietal network synchrony, and poor coordination of neural responses with regions outside of this network may help explain SWM deficits in individuals with a history of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.",

Initial information was gathered from coroners\u2019 offices. Potential informants were approached and semi-structured interviews were conducted. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were applied.People with AUD who died by suicide were significantly more likely to have another substance-use disorder, history of suicide attempt, recent serious arguments with spouse/partner and other family members, been unfaithful to partner/spouse, be victims of a crime, and were less likely to be from a non-English speaking background. They were also younger and had higher levels of aggression compared to non-AUD suicides. AUD suicides were more likely to have mood disorders, previous suicide attempt, expressing hopelessness, higher scores in aggression towards self, romantic relationship breakup, and serious arguments with other family members than AUD sudden deaths. Aggressive behavior, having another substance-use disorder, and history of serious arguments with family members remained significant in the final model comparing suicides with and without AUD.Our findings support that aggressive behavior, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders as predisposing factors, and recent interpersonal conflicts such as breakup and family conflicts can trigger suicide in people with AUD.

Although activation of protein kinases (e.g., cyclic AMP [cAMP]-dependent protein kinase) is implicated in the synaptic trafficking of these receptors following CIE exposure, the functional consequences of these effects are yet to be fully understood. The present study sought to delineate the influence of protein kinase in regulating cytotoxicity following CIE exposure, as well as to examine the relative roles of ethanol exposure and ethanol withdrawal (EWD) in promoting these effects. Rat hippocampal explants were exposed to a developmental model of CIE with or without co-application of broad-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor KT-5720 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) either during ethanol exposure or EWD. Hippocampal cytotoxicity was assessed via immunofluorescence (IF) of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) with thionine staining of Nissl bodies to confirm IF findings. Concomitant application of ethanol and KT-5720 restored the loss of NeuN/Fox-3 IF in pyramidal CA1 and granule DG cell layers produced by CIE, but there was no restoration in CA3. Application of KT-5720 during EWD failed to significantly alter levels of NeuN IF, implying that ethanol exposure activates protein kinases that, in part, mediate the effects of EWD. KT-5720 application during EWD also restored thionine staining in CA1, suggesting kinase regulation of both neurons and non-neuronal cells. These data demonstrate that CIE exposure alters protein kinase activity to promote ethanol withdrawal-associated loss of NeuN/Fox-3 and highlight the influence of kinase signaling on distinct cell types in the developing hippocampus.",

Therefore, the current study explored the influence of KSO on acute ethanol- and morphine-induced hyperactivity, and on the development and expression of locomotor sensitization induced by these drugs. In the present study, sensitization to locomotor effects was induced by repeated exposure to ethanol (2.4\u00a0g/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.], 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 days) or morphine (10\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.], 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07 days). We found that KSO (1\u201310\u00a0nmol/300\u00a0\u03bcL, intravenously [i.v.]) did not have an impact on locomotor activity of na\u00efve mice.

Pretreatment of animals with KSO (10\u00a0nmol/300\u00a0\u03bcL), before every ethanol or morphine injection during development of sensitization or before the ethanol or morphine challenge, attenuated the development, as well as the expression of locomotor sensitization to both substances. Moreover, prior administration of the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9 (10\u00a0nmol/300\u00a0\u03bcL, i.v.) inhibited the ability of KSO (10\u00a0nmol/300\u00a0\u03bcL) to reduce the expression of ethanol and morphine sensitization. KSO given alone, at all used doses, did not influence the motor coordination measured via the rotarod test. The results from this study show that KSO effectively attenuated acute and repeated effects of ethanol and morphine. Thus, KSO possesses NPFF-like anti-opioid activity in these behavioral studies.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol consumption has diverse and well-documented effects on the human immune system and its ability to defend against infective agents. One example is melioidosis, a disease caused by infection with Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is of public health importance in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, with an expanding global distribution. While B.\u00a0pseudomallei infections can occur in healthy humans, binge alcohol use is progressively being recognized as a major risk factor. Although binge alcohol consumption has been considered as a risk factor for the development of melioidosis, no experimental studies have investigated the outcomes of alcohol exposure on Burkholderia spp. infection. Therefore, we proposed the use of non-pathogenic B.\u00a0thailandensis E264 as a useful BSL-1 model system to study the effects of binge alcohol exposure on bacteria and alveolar macrophage interactions. The MH-S alveolar macrophage (AMs) cell line was used to characterize innate immune responses to infection in\u00a0vitro. Our results showed that alcohol exposure significantly suppressed the uptake and killing of B.\u00a0thailandensis by AMs. Alveolar macrophages incubated in alcohol (0.08%) for 3\u00a0h prior to infection showed significantly lower bacterial uptake at 2 and 8\u00a0h post infection. Activated AMs with IFN-\u03b3 and pre and post-incubation in alcohol when exposed to B.\u00a0thailandensis released lower nitric oxide (NO) concentrations, compared to activated AMs with IFN-\u03b3 from non-alcoholic controls. As a result, B.\u00a0thailandensis survival and replication increased \u223c2.5-fold compared to controls. The presence of alcohol (1%) also increased bacterial survival within AMs. Alcohol significantly decreased bacterial motility compared to non-alcoholic controls. Increased biofilm formation was observed at 3 and 6\u00a0h when bacteria were pre-incubated in (0.08%) alcohol. These results provide insights into binge alcohol consumption, a culturally prevalent risk factor, as a predisposing factor for melioidosis.",

The present study investigated the possible interactive effects of ethanol consumption on ulcerative colitis and its associated testicular dysfunction using six groups of 12 pubertal mice each. Group I (Control) mice received drinking water alone. Group II mice received ethanol alone at 5\u00a0g/kg body weight. Group III mice received 2.5% dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) in drinking water followed by normal drinking water. Groups IV, V, and VI mice received DSS followed by ethanol at 1.25, 2.5, and 5\u00a0g/kg, respectively. Administration of ethanol to mice with ulcerative colitis intensified the disease-activity index with marked reduction in colon length, colon mass index, body weight gain, and organo-somatic indices of testes and epididymis when compared with the DSS-alone group. Moreover, ethanol exacerbated colitis-mediated decrease in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants but increased the oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers in the testes and epididymis. The diminution in luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and testosterone levels was intensified following administration of ethanol to mice with ulcerative colitis that were administered 5\u00a0g/kg ethanol alone. The decrease in sperm functional parameters and testicular spermatogenic indices as well as histopathological damage in colon, testes, and epididymis was aggravated following administration of ethanol to mice with ulcerative colitis. In conclusion, the exacerbating effects of ethanol on ulcerative colitis-induced testicular dysfunction are related to increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the treated mice.",

A SNP variant of rs279871, in the chromosome 4 gene encoding gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABRA2), was selected due to its associations with alcoholism in young adults and with behaviors that increased risk for early drinking.A subsample of 674 adolescents (ages 14\u201317) participating in the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) was examined using a previously derived Cox proportional hazards model containing: 1) number of non-drinking related conduct disorder (CD) symptoms, 2) membership in a high-risk alcohol-dependent (AD) family, 3) most best friends drank (MBFD), 4) Achenbach Youth Self Report (YSR) externalizing score, and 5) YSR social problems score. The above covariates along with the SNP variant of GABRA2, rs279871, were added to this model. Five new prototype models were examined. The most parsimonious model was chosen based on likelihood ratio tests and model fit statistics.The final model contained four of the five original predictors (YSR social problems score was no longer significant and hence dropped from subsequent models), the three covariates, and a recessive GABRA2 rs279871 TT genotype (two copies of the high-risk allele containing thymine). The model indicated that adolescents with the high-risk TT genotype were more likely to begin drinking than those without this genotype.The joint effect of the gene (rs279871 TT genotype) and environment (MBFD) on adolescent alcohol initiation is additive, but not interactive, after controlling for behavior problems (CD and YSR externalizing score). This suggests that the impact of the high-risk TT genotype on the onset of drinking is affected by controlling for peer drinking and does not include genotype-by-environment interactions.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol abuse increases vulnerability to infections and infection-related mortality. In previous studies, we found that acute alcohol abuse in a binge-drinking model in mice decreased resistance to bacterial sepsis when alcohol was administered near the time of bacterial challenge. In the present study, we investigated the effects of alcohol administered later in the course of sepsis (18\u00a0h after injection of Escherichia coli). Our working hypothesis was that decreased production of cytokines caused by alcohol at this time would actually improve survival, because overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators is thought to be the proximate cause of mortality in sepsis. Unexpectedly, administration of alcohol late in the course of sepsis led to a rapid increase in the number of viable bacteria in the peritoneal cavity. Significant increases in the concentrations of several cytokines and chemokines coincided with the increased number of bacteria in alcohol-treated mice and decreased survival time. These results demonstrated our working hypothesis to be incorrect, and reiterated the complexity of sepsis. Hypothermia is a consistent feature in this model of sepsis. In control mice (E.\u00a0coli only), body temperature was near normal by 18\u00a0h or 21\u00a0h after administration of E.\u00a0coli, but in mice treated with alcohol 18\u00a0h after E.\u00a0coli, hypothermia was significant 3\u00a0h later and ultimately mortality was significantly increased. However, counteracting the hypothermic effect of alcohol by external warming of mice led to earlier mortality, demonstrating that hypothermia was not the major cause of mortality. These results, along with previous results from studies in which alcohol was given before initiation of sepsis, suggest that decreased cytokine and chemokine production may not be the key effect of alcohol that decreases resistance to sepsis. It seems more likely that suppression of mechanisms by which macrophages and neutrophils kill bacteria is critical, and this can occur even in the presence of high levels of cytokines and chemokines.",

It is unclear, however, whether the cognitive problems are a consequence of alcohol exposure or a contributing factor to alcohol-use disorders. Here, we examined the relationship between performance on a novel object recognition (NOR) task and total alcohol consumption (TAC) in adult male rhesus macaques (n\u00a0=\u00a012; ETH\u00a0group; trained to self-administer alcohol). NOR performance in this group was assessed prior to induction of alcohol drinking (\u201cpre\u201d) and, again, after a 1-year abstinence period (\u201cpost\u201d) and was compared to the performance of a second group (n\u00a0=\u00a06; Control group), which was alcohol-na\u00efve. In the NOR task, difficulty was manipulated across three phases by varying specific object features and/or by varying duration of access to objects. For each monkey, we measured aspects of novelty-related behavior including novelty detection, novelty reactivity, and perseverative behavior. TAC during induction and a \u201cfree\u201d access period in which the monkey could choose between water and a 4% w/v ethanol solution also was determined. We found that performance deficits in the NOR task were a consequence of high total alcohol intake instead of a predictor of subsequent high intake. Poor NOR performance in drinkers with the highest intakes was characterized by increased perseverative behavior rather than an inability to detect or react to novelty. Finally, the observed deficits are long-lasting \u2013 persisting even after a year of abstinence. Given the prevalent and persistent nature of alcohol-induced cognitive deficits in patients in treatment settings, understanding the nature of the deficit and its neural basis could ultimately offer novel treatment approaches based on the reversal of alcohol-induced impairment.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies suggested that exposure of Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats to daily drinking sessions of 1\u00a0h, during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, with multiple alcohol concentrations, and unpredictable access to alcohol, resulted in exceptionally high intakes of alcohol when the drinking session occurred over the last hours of the dark phase. Additionally, higher levels of anxiety-related behaviors were observed at the 12th, rather than 1st, hour of the dark phase, suggesting that uncertainty of time of alcohol access and expectation of alcohol availability produced an emotional \u201cdistress\u201d. The present study was designed to provide pharmacological support to the hypothesis that high alcohol intake under this drinking procedure is secondary to exacerbation of the anxiety-like state of sP rats. To this end, sP rats were initially exposed to daily 1-h drinking sessions during the dark phase and with multiple alcohol concentrations (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%; v/v); time of alcohol exposure was changed each day and was unpredictable to rats. Rats were then treated acutely with non-sedative doses of diazepam (0, 1, 2, and 3\u00a0mg/kg; intraperitoneally [i.p.]) before two drinking sessions occurring at the 1st and 12th hour of the dark phase, respectively. Treatment with diazepam was ineffective at the 1st hour; conversely, it selectively reduced alcohol intake (up to 50% at the dose of 3\u00a0mg/kg) at the 12th hour. The preferential effectiveness of diazepam in reducing alcohol intake when the drinking session occurred at the 12th hour of the dark phase is consistent with the hypothesis that uncertainty of time of alcohol access and expectation of alcohol availability generated an emotional \u201cdistress\u201d that rats counterbalanced with high alcohol drinking; the results of the present study are interpreted as the anxiolytic effects of diazepam substituting for those of alcohol, resulting in the observed reduction in alcohol intake.",

     "abstract": "In two studies of long-term abstinent alcoholics (LTAAs), we found that about 17% had a current major depressive disorder (MDD). We tested the hypothesis that LTAAs with a current MDD diagnosis do not exhibit the reduced P3b event-related potential amplitude endophenotype for alcoholism. This is consistent with the majority of LTAAs with a current MDD having developed alcohol dependence via self-medication of their MDD rather than their alcohol dependence arising from the alcoholism endophenotype.We revisited the P3b data from the two LTAAs studies, comparing LTAAs with a current MDD vs. LTAAs without a current MDD to each other and to non-substance abusing controls (NSACs). In northern California, 48 LTAAs and 48 non-substance abusing controls were studied, while in Honolulu, 105 LTAAs and 77 NSACs were studied. A total of 26 LTAAs had a current MDD (10 in California and 16 in Honolulu). The difference in P3b amplitude and latency (measured in targets-standards) in a 3-condition visual oddball paradigm was compared to MDD diagnoses gathered using the computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Across both study sites, LTAAs without a current MDD (either with no lifetime MDD or a lifetime, but not current MDD) had lower P3b amplitudes than NSACs. In contrast, P3b amplitudes in LTAAs with a current MDD did not differ from controls. We conclude that alcohol dependence in LTAAs with a current MDD did not derive from the alcoholism endophenotype. This group may not exhibit the externalizing diathesis characterized by impulsive, disinhibited behavior and may have developed alcohol dependence via excessive drinking in an attempt to self-medicate their MDD. These results have major implications for targeted treatments of alcoholism and comorbid MDD.",

     "abstract": "Stress can be experienced with or without adverse effects, of which anxiety and depression are two of the most important due to the frequent comorbidity with alcohol abuse in humans. Historically, stress has been considered a cause of drug use, particularly alcohol abuse due to its anxiolytic effects. In the present work we exposed male Wistar rats to two different stress conditions: single housing (social isolation, SI), and chronic mild stress (CMS). We compared both stressed groups to group-housed rats and rats without CMS (GH) to allow the determination of a clear behavioral response profile related to their respective endocrine stress response and alcohol intake pattern. We found that SI and CMS, to a greater extent, induced short-lasting increased sucrose consumption, a transient increase in serum corticosterone level, high latency/immobility, and low burying behavior in the defensive burying behavior (DBB) test, and a transient increase in alcohol intake. Thus, the main conclusion was that stress caused by both SI and CMS induced immobility in the DBB test and, subsequently, induced a transient increased voluntary ethanol intake in Wistar rats with a free-choice home-cage drinking paradigm.",

Excessive alcohol consumption is known to relate to a variety of disorders in the digestive system, including the exocrine pancreas. In this study, we have investigated the role and mechanism of ethanol on carbamylcholine (CCh)-induced intracellular calcium oscillation in murine pancreatic acinar cells. Ethanol at concentrations of 30 and 100\u00a0mM reversibly suppressed CCh-induced Ca2+ oscillation in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of ethanol has no effect\u00a0on the store-operated calcium entry induced by 10\u00a0\u03bcM of CCh. Ethanol significantly reduced the initial calcium peak induced by low concentrations of CCh and therefore, the CCh-induced dose-response curve of the initial calcium peak was shifted to the right by ethanol pretreatment. Furthermore, ethanol significantly dose-dependently reduced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release from the internal stores in permeabilized acinar cells. These results provide evidence that excessive alcohol intake could impair cytosolic calcium oscillation through inhibiting calcium release from intracellular stores in mouse pancreatic acinar cells.",

     "abstract": "The oxidative metabolism of ethanol into acetaldehyde involves several enzymes, including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and catalase-hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this regard, while it is well known that 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) acts by inhibiting ADH in the liver, little attention has been placed on its ability to interfere with fatty acid oxidation-mediated generation of H2O2, a mechanism that may indirectly affect catalase whose enzymatic activity requires H2O2. The aim of our investigation was twofold: 1) to evaluate the effect of systemic (i.p. [intraperitoneal]) and local (into the posterior ventral tegmental area, pVTA) administration of 4-MP on oral ethanol self-administration, and 2) to assess ex\u00a0vivo whether or not systemic 4-MP affects liver and brain H2O2 availability. The results show that systemic 4-MP reduced ethanol but not acetaldehyde or saccharin self-administration, and decreased the ethanol deprivation effect. Moreover, local intra-pVTA administration of 4-MP reduced ethanol but not saccharin self-administration. In addition, although unable to affect basal catalase activity, systemic administration of 4-MP decreased H2O2 availability both in liver and in brain. Overall, these results indicate that 4-MP interferes with ethanol self-administration and suggest that its behavioral effects could be due to a decline in catalase-H2O2 system activity as a result of a reduction of H2O2 availability, thus highlighting the role of central catalase-mediated metabolism of ethanol and further supporting the key role of acetaldehyde in the reinforcing properties of ethanol.",

     "abstract": "Microglia activation and neuroinflammation are common features of neurodegenerative conditions, including alcohol use disorders (AUDs). When activated, microglia span a continuum of diverse phenotypes ranging from classically activated, pro-inflammatory (M1) microglia/macrophages to alternatively activated, growth-promoting (M2) microglia/macrophages. Identifying microglia phenotypes is critical for understanding the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AUDs. Therefore, male rats were gavaged with 25% (w/v) ethanol or isocaloric control diet every 8\u00a0h for 4 days and sacrificed at 0, 2, 4, and 7 days after alcohol exposure (e.g., T0, T2, etc.). Microglia were isolated from hippocampus and entorhinal cortices by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Cells were labeled with microglia surface antigens and analyzed by flow cytometry. Consistent with prior studies, isolated cells yielded a highly enriched population of brain macrophages/microglia (>95% pure), evidenced by staining for the macrophage/microglia antigen CD11b. Polarization states of CD11b+CD45low microglia were evaluated by expression of M1 surface markers, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, CD32, CD86, and M2 surface marker, CD206 (mannose receptor). Ethanol-treated animals begin to show increased expression of M1 and M2 markers at T0 (p\u00a0=\u00a0n.s.), with significant changes at the T2 time point. At T2, expression of M1 markers, MHC-II, CD86, and CD32 were increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in hippocampus and entorhinal cortices, while M2 marker, CD206, was increased significantly only in entorhinal cortices (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All effects resolved to control levels by T4. In summary, four-day binge alcohol exposure produces a transient increase in both M1 (MHC-II, CD32, and CD86) and M2 (CD206) populations of microglia isolated from the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. Thus, these findings that both pro-inflammatory and potentially beneficial, recovery-promoting microglia phenotypes can be observed after a damaging exposure of alcohol are critically important to our understanding of the role of microglia in the pathogenesis of AUDs.",

The Safe Passage Study was designed to investigate the role of PAE in a continuum of poor peri- and postnatal outcomes.The objective of this manuscript is to describe the rationale for, and feasibility of, modifications to the traditional Timeline Followback (TLFB) for collecting PAE information in a large cohort of pregnant women. Participants from the Northern Plains region (in the United States) and Cape Town, South Africa, were followed prospectively using a modified 30-day TLFB interview, administered up to five times, to obtain detailed PAE information. Required modifications for our population included capturing information regarding sharing, type/brand, container size, and duration, in order to accurately record the amount of alcohol consumed. PAE status was defined for 99.9% of the 11,892 enrolled pregnancies at least once during pregnancy and for 92% across all trimesters. Of 53,823 drinks reported, 98% had all items necessary for standard drink computation. Sharing was reported for 74% of drinks in Cape Town, South Africa and for 10% in the Northern Plains. Compared to referent values from the traditional TLFB, 74% and 67% of drinks had different alcohol-by-volume and container size, respectively. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was found between the number of containers reported and the number of standard drinks computed, using information from the modified TLFB. This is the first study of this size to wholly encompass all of these changes into a single measure in order to more accurately calculate daily consumption and assess patterns over time. The methods used to collect PAE information and create alcohol exposure measures likely increased the accuracy of standard drinks reported and could be generalized to other populations.",

The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the methodological approach used to define prenatal drinking and smoking trajectories from a large prospective pregnancy cohort, and to describe maternal characteristics associated with different exposure patterns. In the Safe Passage Study, detailed information regarding quantity, frequency, and timing of exposure was self-reported up to four times during pregnancy and at 1 month post-delivery. Exposure trajectories were developed using data from 11,692 pregnancies (9912 women) where pregnancy outcome was known. Women were from three diverse populations: white (23%) and American Indian (17%) in the Northern Plains, US, and mixed ancestry (59%) in South Africa (other/not specified [1%]). Group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify 5 unique drinking trajectories (1 none/minimal, 2 quitting groups, 2 continuous groups) and 7 smoking trajectories (1 none/minimal, 2 quitting groups, 4 continuous groups). Women with pregnancies assigned to the low- or high-continuous drinking groups were less likely to have completed high school and were more likely to have enrolled in the study in the third trimester, be of mixed ancestry, or be depressed than those assigned to the none/minimal or quit-drinking groups. Results were similar when comparing continuous smokers to none/minimal and quit-smoking groups. Further, women classified as high- or low-continuous drinkers were more likely to smoke at moderate-, high-, and very high-continuous levels, as compared to women classified as non-drinkers and quitters. This is the first study of this size to utilize group-based trajectory modeling to identify unique prenatal drinking and smoking trajectories. These trajectories will be used in future analyses to determine which specific exposure patterns subsequently manifest as poor peri- and postnatal outcomes.",

The most important among these risk relationships is the dose-response relationship with different levels of average alcohol consumption. To establish risk relationships, we systematically searched for all studies on dose-response relationships, directly and indirectly, via reviews. The results did not permit computation of pooled estimates through meta-analyses. There were clear indications that heavy drinking (\u226580\u00a0g per day) over several years was linked to high risk of cardiomyopathy, with greater lifetime exposure of alcohol linked to higher risks.

     "abstract": "Adolescence and early adulthood are periods of particular vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. Young people with alcohol-use disorders display deficits in working memory (WM). This function is supported by the prefrontal cortex, a late-maturing brain region. However, little is known about the progression of cognitive dysfunctions associated with a binge-drinking (BD) pattern of alcohol consumption among non-clinical adolescents. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between BD trajectory and WM in university students. An initial sample of 155 male and female first-year university students was followed prospectively over 6 years. The participants were classified as stable non-BDs, stable BDs, and ex-BDs, according to the third item of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). WM was assessed using the Self-Ordered Pointing Task. Generalized linear mixed models were applied. The results showed that stable BDs committed more total perseverative errors and showed a lower WM span in the difficult blocks than stable non-BDs. Difficulties in WM span showed some improvement, whereas perseveration errors remained constant throughout the follow-ups in the stable BDs. There were no significant differences between ex-BDs and non-BDs. In conclusion, stable BD is associated with WM deficits, particularly perseverations and low WM span in demanding trials, when compensatory mechanisms may no longer be successful. The partial improvement in WM span may support the notion of a neuromaturational delay, whereas the temporal stability of perseveration deficits may reflect either neurotoxic effects of alcohol or premorbid characteristics. Abandoning the BD pattern of alcohol consumption may lead to partial recovery.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of moderate voluntary alcohol (20% ethanol) intake on alternate days for 3 months in outbred Wistar rats on risk factors associated with colorectal cancer development. Colonic gene expression of cyclooxygenase-2, RelA, 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione-S-transferase M1, and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 were determined. Blood alcohol content, liver function enzyme activities, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine DNA adducts were also assessed. Alcohol-treated rats were found to have significantly lower 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine levels in blood, a marker of DNA damage. Alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase were both significantly lower in the alcohol group. Moderate alcohol significantly decreased cyclooxygenase-2 gene expression, an inflammatory marker associated with colorectal cancer risk. The alcohol group had significantly increased glutathione-S-transferase M1 expression, an antioxidant enzyme that helps detoxify carcinogens, such as acetaldehyde, and significantly increased aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 expression, which allows for greater acetaldehyde clearance. Increased expression of glutathione-S-transferase M1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 likely contributed to reduce mucosal damage that is caused by acetaldehyde accumulation. These results indicate that moderate alcohol may reduce the risk for colorectal cancer development, which was evidenced by reduced inflammation activity and lower DNA damage after alcohol exposure.",

The recently described \u03b16\u03b22 antagonist, N,N-decane-1,10-diyl-bis-3-picolinium diiodide (bPiDI), now makes it possible to test for the involvement of these receptors using a pharmacological approach. The aim of this study was to examine the role of \u03b16\u03b22 nAChRs in ethanol behaviors using a pharmacological approach. Adolescent C57BL/6J mice were treated with bPiDI 30\u00a0min prior to testing the mice for binge-like ethanol consumption in the drinking-in-the-dark (DID) test, ethanol-induced motor incoordination using the balance beam, and ethanol-induced sedation using the Loss of Righting Reflex (LORR) paradigm. Adolescent animals were chosen because they express a high amount of \u03b16 mRNA relative to adult animals. Control studies were also performed to determine the effect of bPiDI on locomotor activity and ethanol metabolism. Female mice treated with 20 mg/kg bPiDI had reduced locomotor activity compared to saline-treated animals during the first 30\u00a0min following an acute injection.

     "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure often results in fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Mechanisms of fetal brain damage by alcohol remain unclear. We used baboons (Papio spp.) to study alcohol-driven changes in the fetal cerebral artery endocannabinoid system. Pregnant baboons were subjected to binge alcohol exposure via gastric infusion three times during a period equivalent to the second trimester of human pregnancy. A control group was infused with orange-flavored drink that was isocaloric to the alcohol-containing solution. Cesarean sections were performed at a time equivalent to the end of the second trimester of human pregnancy. Fetal cerebral arteries were harvested and subjected to in\u00a0vitro pressurization followed by pharmacological profiling. During each alcohol-infusion episode, maternal blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) reached 80\u00a0mg/dL, that is, equivalent to the BAC considered legal intoxication in humans. Circulating anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) remained unchanged. Ultrasound studies on pregnant mothers revealed that fetal alcohol exposure decreased peak systolic blood velocity in middle cerebral arteries when compared to pre-alcohol levels. Moreover, ethanol-induced dilation was observed in fetal cerebral arteries pressurized in\u00a0vitro. This dilation was abolished by the mixture of AM251 and AM630, which block cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, respectively. In the presence of AM251, the cannabinoid receptor agonist AEA evoked a higher, concentration-dependent dilation of cerebral arteries from alcohol-exposed fetuses. The difference in AEA-induced cerebral artery dilation vanished in the presence of AM630. CB1 and CB2 receptor mRNA and protein levels were similar in cerebral arteries from alcohol-exposed and control-exposed fetuses. In summary, alcohol exposure dilates fetal cerebral arteries via endocannabinoid receptors and results in an increased function of CB2.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of lobeline on ethanol abstinence-induced depression-like behavior and associated neuroadaptive changes in mice. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were allowed to drink 10% ethanol for 4 weeks using a two-bottle choice procedure. Mice were tested after 24\u00a0h and 14 days of ethanol abstinence in a forced swim test (FST), a measure for depression-like behavior. Acute lobeline treatment (1\u00a0mg/kg) significantly reduced immobility time compared to controls after 24\u00a0h and 14 days of abstinence. In addition, abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure reduced serotonin levels in the hippocampus, which was reversed by acute lobeline treatment. Repeated lobeline treatment (1\u00a0mg/kg, once daily) for 14 days during ethanol abstinence also significantly reduced FST immobility in mice exposed to ethanol. Chronic ethanol exposure significantly reduced the number of 5-bromo 2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, indicating decreased hippocampal cell proliferation. Abstinence from chronic ethanol exposure also decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the hippocampus. In contrast, repeated lobeline treatment significantly increased both BrdU- and BDNF-positive cells. Taken together, our results indicate that lobeline produced antidepressant-like effects, likely by targeting brain \u03b22-containing nAChRs, serotonergic neurotransmission, and/or hippocampal cell proliferation. Therefore, lobeline may have therapeutic utility to treat alcohol abstinence-induced depression.",

Several molecules involved in signaling pathways may contribute to the neuroadaptation induced during alcohol dependence and stress disorders, and among these, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and opioid peptides (i.e., nociceptin and dynorphin) are involved in the interaction of stress and alcohol. In fact, alterations in the expression and function of these molecules have been associated with the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders and alcoholism. In recent years, various studies have focused on the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate chromatin architecture, thereby modifying gene expression. Interestingly, epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions have been shown to be associated with the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders, including alcoholism and stress. In particular, the enzymes responsible for chromatin remodeling (i.e., histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, DNA methyltransferases) have been identified as common molecular mechanisms for the interaction of stress and alcohol and have become promising therapeutic targets to treat or prevent alcoholism and associated emotional disorders.",

DNA modifications in particular are seeing increasing research in the context of alcohol use and abuse. To date, studies of DNA modifications in AUD have primarily looked at global methylation profiles in human brain and blood, gene-specific methylation profiles in animal models, methylation changes associated with prenatal ethanol exposure, and the potential therapeutic abilities of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors. Future studies may be aimed at identifying changes to more recently discovered DNA modifications, utilizing new methods to discriminate methylation profiles between cell types, thus clarifying how alcohol influences the methylomes of cell-type populations and how this may affect downstream processes.

Extensive research into the role of DNA methylation and miRNAs in animal models has illuminated the complex role of these mechanisms in FASD. In contrast, histone modifications have not been as well researched, due in part to being less stable than DNA methylation and less well-characterized in disease. It is now apparent that even changes in transient marks can have profound effects if they alter developmental trajectories. In addition, many histone methylations are now known to be relatively stable and can propagate themselves. As technologies and knowledge have advanced, a small group has investigated the role of histone modifications in FASD. Here, we synthesize the data on the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on histone modifications. Several key points are evident. AS with most alcohol-induced outcomes, timing and dosage differences yield variable effects. Nevertheless, these studies consistently find enrichment of H3K9ac, H3K27me2,3, and H3K9me2, and increased expression of histone acetyltransferases and methyltransferases. The consistency of these alterations may implicate them as key mechanisms underlying FASD. Histone modification changes do not often correlate with gene expression changes, though some important examples exist. Encouragingly, attempts to reproduce specific histone modification changes are very often successful. We comment on possible directions for future studies, focusing on further exploration of current trends, expansion of time-point and dosage regimes, and evaluation of biomarker potential.",

It is also well known that alcohol-related health problems are passed down across generations in human populations, but the complete mechanisms for this phenomenon are currently unknown. Recent studies in animal models have suggested that epigenetic factors are also responsible for the transmission of alcohol-related pathologies across generations. Alcohol exposure has been shown to induce changes in the epigenome of sperm of exposed male animals, and these epimutations are inherited in the offspring. This paper reviews evidence for multigenerational and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of alcohol-related pathology through the germline. We also review the literature on the epigenetic effects of alcohol exposure on somatic cells in brain, and its contribution to AUDs and FASDs. We note gaps in knowledge in this field, such as the lack of clinical studies in human populations and the lack of data on epigenetic inheritance via the female germline, and we suggest future research directions.",

The resulting genome-wide methylation changes are enriched in genes with neurodevelopmental functions. The profile of differential methylation is dynamic and present in some form for life. The methylation changes are transmitted across subsequent mitotic divisions, where they are maintained and further modified over time. More recent follow up has identified a profile of the differential methylation in the buccal swabs of young children born with FASD. While distinct from the profile observed in brain tissue from rodent models, there are similarities. These include changes in genes belonging to a number of neurodevelopmental and behavioral pathways. Specifically, there is increased methylation at the clustered protocadherin genes and deregulation of genomically imprinted genes, even though no single gene is affected in all patients studied to date. These novel results suggest further development of a methylation based strategy could enable early and accurate diagnostics and therapeutics, which have remained a challenge in FASD research. There are two aspects of this challenge that must be addressed in the immediate future: First, the long-term differential methylomics observed in rodent models must be functionally confirmed. Second, the similarities in differential methylation must be further established in humans at a methylomic level and overcome a number of technical limitations. While a cure for FASD is challenging, there is an opportunity for the development of early diagnostics and attenuations towards a higher quality of life.",

A naturally occurring genetic variant of PNPLA3 in humans has been linked to increased susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease.

ChIP assay using H3AcK9 antibody showed increased association with the promoter of PNPLA3 in hepatocytes and in mouse liver. This was less evident in rat livers in\u00a0vivo except under chronic treatment.

Recent studies support the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the development of AUD. Studies carried out so far have focused on a few specific epigenetic modifications. The goal of this project was to investigate gene expression changes of epigenetic regulators that mediate a broad array of chromatin modifications after chronic alcohol exposure, chronic alcohol exposure followed by 8\u00a0h withdrawal, and chronic alcohol exposure followed by 21 days of abstinence in Withdrawal-Resistant (WSR) and Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) selected mouse lines.We found that chronic vapor exposure to highly intoxicating levels of ethanol alters the expression of several chromatin remodeling genes measured by quantitative PCR array analyses. The identified effects were independent of selected lines, which, however, displayed baseline differences in epigenetic gene expression.We reported dysregulation in the expression of genes involved in histone acetylation, deacetylation, lysine and arginine methylation and ubiquitinationhylation during chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal, but not after 21 days of abstinence. Ethanol-induced changes are consistent with decreased histone acetylation and with decreased deposition of the permissive ubiquitination mark H2BK120ub, associated with reduced transcription. On the other hand, ethanol-induced changes in the expression of genes involved in histone lysine methylation are consistent with increased transcription. The net result of these modifications on gene expression is likely to depend on the combination of the specific histone tail modifications present at a given time on a given promoter.Since alcohol does not modulate gene expression unidirectionally, it is not surprising that alcohol does not unidirectionally alter chromatin structure toward a closed or open state, as suggested by the results of this study.",

We used C57BL/6J male mice to investigate the effects of two FDA-approved drugs, decitabine (a DNMT inhibitor) and SAHA (an HDAC inhibitor), on ethanol consumption using two tests: binge-like drinking in the dark (DID) and chronic intermittent every other day (EOD) drinking. Decitabine but not SAHA reduced ethanol consumption in both tests. We further investigated decitabine's effects on the brain's reward pathway by gene expression profiling in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), using RNA sequencing and electrophysiological recordings from VTA dopaminergic neurons. Decitabine-induced decreases in EOD drinking were associated with global changes in gene expression, implicating regulation of cerebral blood flow, extracellular matrix organization, and neuroimmune functions in decitabine actions. In addition, an in\u00a0vivo administration of decitabine shortened ethanol-induced excitation of VTA dopaminergic neurons in\u00a0vitro, suggesting that decitabine reduces ethanol drinking via changes in the reward pathway. Taken together, our data suggest a contribution of both neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms in the VTA in the regulation of ethanol consumption. Decitabine and other epigenetic compounds have been approved for cancer treatment, and understanding their mechanisms of actions in the brain may assist in repurposing these drugs and developing novel therapies for central disorders, including drug addiction.",

In this regard, investigating the neural state of individuals who chronically self-administer lower doses of alcohol may provide insight into mechanisms that prevent the escalation of alcohol use. DNA methylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that stabilizes adaptations in gene expression and has been associated with alcohol use. Thus, we investigated DNA methylation, gene expression, and the predicted neural effects in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcc) of male rhesus macaques categorized as \u201clow\u201d or \u201cbinge\u201d drinkers, compared to \u201calcohol-na\u00efve\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d drinkers based on drinking patterns during a 12-month alcohol self-administration protocol. Using genome-wide CpG-rich region enrichment and bisulfite sequencing, the methylation levels of 2.6 million CpGs were compared between alcohol-na\u00efve (AN), low/binge (L/BD), and heavy/very heavy (H/VHD) drinking subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a024). Through regional clustering analysis, we identified nine significant differential methylation regions (DMRs) that specifically distinguished ANs and L/BDs, and then compared those DMRs among H/VHDs. The DMRs mapped to genes encoding ion channels, receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and cAMP, NF-\u03ba\u03b2 and Wnt signaling pathway proteins. Two of the DMRs, linked to PDE10A and PKD2L2, were also differentially methylated in H/VHDs, suggesting an alcohol-dose independent effect. However, two other DMRs, linked to the CCBE1 and FZD5 genes, had L/BD methylation levels that significantly differed from both ANs and H/VHDs. The remaining five DMRs also differentiated L/BDs and ANs. However, H/VHDs methylation levels were not distinguishable from either of the two groups. Functional validation of two DMRs, linked to FZD5 and PDE10A, support their role in regulating gene expression and exon usage, respectively. In summary, the findings demonstrate that L/BD is associated with unique DNA methylation signatures in the primate NAcc, and that the methylation signatures identify synaptic genes that may play a role in preventing the escalation of alcohol use.",

However, a growing body of work examining the epigenetic impact that alcohol and other drugs of abuse exert consistently notes a disconnection between induced changes in chromatin structure and patterns of gene transcription. Thus, an important question is whether perturbations in the \u2018histone code\u2019 induced by prenatal exposures to alcohol implicitly subvert gene expression, or whether the hierarchy of cellular signaling networks driving development is such that they retain control over the transcriptional program. To address this question, we examined the impact of ethanol exposure in mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under 2i conditions, where the transcriptional program is rigidly enforced through the use of small molecule inhibitors. We find that ethanol-induced changes in post-translational histone modifications are dose-dependent, unique to the chromatin modification under investigation, and that the extent and direction of the change differ between the period of exposure and the recovery phase. Similar to in\u00a0vivo models, we find post-translational modifications affecting histone 3 lysine 9 are the most profoundly impacted, with the signature of exposure persisting long after alcohol has been removed. These changes in chromatin structure associate with dose-dependent alterations in the levels of transcripts encoding Dnmt1, Uhrf1, Tet1, Tet2, Tet3, and Polycomb complex members Eed and Ezh2. However, in this model, ethanol-induced changes to the chromatin template do not consistently associate with changes in gene transcription, impede the process of differentiation, or affect the acquisition of monoallelic patterns of expression for the imprinted gene Igf2R. These findings question the inferred universal relevance of epigenetic changes induced by drugs of abuse and suggest that changes in chromatin structure cannot unequivocally explain dysgenesis in isolation.",

C57BL/6 (B6) mice were administered a 4% alcohol (v/v) liquid diet from embryonic (E) days 7\u201316, and their embryos were harvested at E17, along with isocaloric liquid diet and lab chow controls. Cortical neuroanatomy, neural phenotypes, and epigenetic markers of methylation were assessed using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and methyl-DNA assays. We report that cortical thickness, neuroepithelial proliferation, and neuronal migration and maturity were found to be deterred by alcohol at E17. Simultaneously, DNA methylation, including 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxcylmethylcytosine (5hmC), which progresses as an intrinsic program guiding normal embryonic cortical development, was severely affected by in utero alcohol exposure. The intricate relationship between cortical thinning and this DNA methylation program disruption is detailed and illustrated. DNA methylation, dynamic across the multiple cortical layers during the late embryonic stage, is highly disrupted by fetal alcohol exposure; this disruption occurs in tandem with characteristic developmental abnormalities, ranging from structural to molecular. Finally, our findings point to a significant question for future exploration: whether epigenetics guides neurodevelopment or whether developmental conditions dictate epigenetic dynamics in the context of alcohol-induced cortical teratogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a leading cause of intellectual disability worldwide. Previous studies have shown that developmental ethanol exposure results in loss of microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-9, and loss of these miRNAs, in turn, mediates some of ethanol's teratogenic effects in the developing brain. We previously found that ethanol increased methylation at the miR-9-2 encoding gene locus in mouse fetal neural stem cells (NSC), advancing a mechanism for epigenetic silencing of this locus and consequently, miR-9 loss in NSCs. Therefore, we assessed the role of the BAF (BRG1/BRM-Associated Factor) complex, which disassembles nucleosomes to facilitate access to chromatin, as an epigenetic mediator of ethanol's effects on miR-9. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNAse I-hypersensitivity analyses showed that the BAF complex was associated with both transcriptionally accessible and heterochromatic regions of the miR-9-2 locus, and that disintegration of the BAF complex by combined knockdown of BAF170 and BAF155 resulted in a significant decrease in miR-9. We hypothesized that ethanol exposure would result in loss of BAF-complex function at the miR-9-2 locus. However, ethanol exposure significantly increased mRNA transcripts for maturation-associated BAF-complex members BAF170, SS18, ARID2, BAF60a, BRM/BAF190b, and BAF53b. Ethanol also significantly increased BAF-complex binding within an intron containing a CpG island and in the terminal exon encoding precursor (pre)-miR-9-2. These data suggest that the BAF complex may adaptively respond to ethanol exposure to protect against a complete loss of miR-9-2 in fetal NSCs.

     "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure can result in a range of physical, neuropathological, and behavioral alterations, collectively termed fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We have shown that supplementation with the nutrient choline reduces the severity of developmental alcohol-associated deficits in hippocampal-dependent behaviors and normalizes some aspects of hippocampal cholinergic development and DNA methylation patterns. Alcohol's developmental effects may also be mediated, in part, by altering microRNAs (miRNAs) that serve as negative regulators of gene translation. To determine whether choline supplementation alters ethanol's long-lasting effects on miRNAs, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 5.25\u00a0g/kg/day ethanol from postnatal days (PD) 4\u20139 via intubation; controls received sham intubations. Subjects were treated with choline chloride (100\u00a0mg/kg/day) or saline vehicle subcutaneously (s.c.) from PD 4-21. On PD 22, subjects were sacrificed, and RNA was isolated from the hippocampus. MiRNA expression was assessed with TaqMan Human MicroRNA Panel Low-Density Arrays. Ethanol significantly increased miRNA expression variance, an effect that was attenuated with choline supplementation. Cluster analysis of stably expressed miRNAs that exceeded an ANOVA p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 criterion indicated that for both male and female offspring, control and ethanol-exposed groups were most dissimilar from each other, with choline-supplemented groups in between. MiRNAs that expressed an average 2-fold change due to ethanol exposure were further analyzed to identify which ethanol-sensitive miRNAs were protected by choline supplementation. We found that at a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted criterion of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, miR-200c was induced by ethanol exposure and that choline prevented this effect. Collectively, our data show that choline supplementation can normalize disturbances in miRNA expression following developmental alcohol exposure and can protect specific miRNAs from induction by ethanol. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms by which choline may serve as a potential treatment for FASD.",

Emerging evidence suggests that parental experience prior to conception can affect inheritance of complex behaviors in offspring via non-genomic (epigenetic) mechanisms. For instance, male C57BL/6J (B6) mice exposed to chronic intermittent vapor ethanol (CIE) prior to mating with Strain 129S1/SvImJ ethanol-na\u00efve females produce male offspring with reduced ethanol-drinking preference, increased ethanol sensitivity, and increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that these intergenerational effects of paternal CIE are reproducible in male offspring on an inbred B6 background. To this end, B6 males were exposed to 6 weeks of CIE (or room air as a control) before mating with ethanol-na\u00efve B6 females to produce ethanol (E)-sired and control (C)-sired male and female offspring. We observed a sex-specific effect, as E-sired males exhibited decreased two-bottle free-choice ethanol-drinking preference, increased sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol, and increased VTA BDNF expression; no differences were observed in female offspring. These findings confirm and extend our previous results by demonstrating that the effects of paternal preconception ethanol are reproducible using genetically identical, inbred B6 animals.",

Recently, our lab showed that alcohol-na\u00efve offspring of rats exposed to alcohol during adolescence exhibited altered gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in stress regulation. We employed Enhanced Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing as an unbiased approach to test the hypothesis that parental exposure to binge-pattern alcohol during adolescence alters DNA methylation profiles in their alcohol-na\u00efve offspring. Wistar rats were administered a repeated binge-ethanol exposure paradigm during early (postnatal day (PND) 37\u201344) and late (PND 67\u201374) adolescent development. Animals were mated 24\u00a0h after the last ethanol dose and subsequent offspring were produced. Analysis of male PND7 offspring revealed that offspring of alcohol-exposed parents exhibited differential DNA methylation patterns in the hypothalamus. The differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) were distinct between offspring depending on which parent was exposed to ethanol. Moreover, novel DMCs were observed when both parents were exposed to ethanol and many DMCs from single parent ethanol exposure were not recapitulated with dual parent exposure. We also measured mRNA expression of several differentially methylated genes and some, but not all, showed correlative changes in expression. Importantly, methylation was not a direct predictor of expression levels, underscoring the complexity of transcriptional regulation. Overall, we demonstrate that adolescent binge ethanol exposure causes altered genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the hypothalamus of alcohol-na\u00efve offspring.",

This study investigated the intergenerational consequences of prenatal exposure to a low ethanol dose (1\u00a0g/kg) during gestational days 17\u201320, on ethanol-induced hypnosis in adolescent male F1 and F2 generations, in two strains of rats. Adolescent Long-Evans and Sprague-Dawley male rats were tested for sensitivity to ethanol-induced hypnosis at a 3.5-g/kg or 4.5-g/kg ethanol dose using the loss of righting reflex (LORR) paradigm. We hypothesized that PAE would attenuate sensitivity to ethanol-induced hypnosis in the ethanol-exposed animals in these two strains and in both generations. Interestingly, we only found this effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. Lastly, we investigated PAE related changes in expression of GABAA receptor \u03b11, \u03b14, and \u03b4 subunits in the cerebral cortex of the PAE sensitive Sprague-Dawley strain. We hypothesized a reduction in the cerebral cortex GABAA receptor subunits' expression in the F1 and F2 PAE groups compared to control animals. GABAA receptor \u03b11, \u03b14, and \u03b4 subunits protein expressions were quantified in the cerebral cortex of F1 and F2 male adolescents by western blotting. PAE did not alter cerebral cortical GABAA receptor subunit expressions in the F1 generation, but it decreased GABAA receptor \u03b14 and \u03b4 subunits' expressions in the F2 generation, and had a tendency to decrease \u03b11 subunit expression. We also found correlations between some of the subunits in both generations. These strain-dependent vulnerabilities to ethanol sensitivity, and intergenerational PAE-mediated changes in sensitivity to alcohol indicate that genetic and epigenetic factors interact to determine the outcomes of PAE animals and their offspring.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate: 1) the prevalence of mental health-care seeking in individuals with alcohol abuse/dependence in France, 2) which category of medical practitioner was consulted, and 3) psychological and socio-environmental factors associated with mental health-care seeking.A total sample of 22,138 individuals was interviewed in a telephone survey. Individual data on alcohol dependence/abuse and other mental health disorders were collected using the Composite International Diagnosis Interview \u2013 short form. Mental health-care seeking was assessed, together with data on living conditions, deprivation, and self-reported drinking problems. Only respondents meeting criteria for alcohol dependence/abuse were included in analyses.Less than half of the 722 respondents with alcohol abuse/dependence had sought mental health care in the preceding 12 months, of whom 90.5% consulted their general practitioner (GP) (56.1%), or both a general practitioner and a psychiatrist (34.4%). Mental health-care seeking was associated with female sex, previous alcohol discussion with a doctor, and the presence of psychiatric comorbidities arising in the preceding 12 months. Living environment, socio-economic status, or self-reported drinking problems had no influence.A minority of people with alcohol abuse/dependence sought mental health care, mainly in relation to psychiatric comorbidities. In addition, most people consulting a GP were not referred to a psychiatrist. However, social deprivation and living in rural areas did not hinder mental health-care seeking among respondents. Adequate protocols to treat alcohol disorders could be implemented among private health-care providers to improve management of alcohol problems in France.",

Most findings point to short (S) allele carriers being at increased risk for negative alcohol outcomes relative to long allele homozygotes, although some work indicates a more complex relationship. The current prospective study aimed to clarify how and under what circumstances variations in 5-HTTLPR transmit risk for various alcohol-related outcomes. Participants were 218 adolescents and young adults (29% female) enrolled in the Michigan Longitudinal Study. We tested a moderated mediation model with 5-HTTLPR as the predictor, Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol (SRE) score as the mediator, alcohol-related outcomes as the dependent variables, parental monitoring as the moderator of the SRE to alcohol outcomes path, and prior drinks, sex, age, and body mass index as covariates. Four alcohol-related outcomes were tested. The S allele was associated with higher SRE scores (i.e., lower response to alcohol). Parental monitoring was a significant moderator: At low levels of parental monitoring, higher SRE scores predicted more drinks consumed and binge drinking episodes. At high levels of monitoring, higher SRE scores were significantly related to fewer alcohol-related problems. Findings suggest that one mechanism by which 5-HTTLPR variation transmits alcohol-related risk is through level of response to alcohol. Furthermore, the strength and direction of this effect varied by level of parental monitoring, indicating that even in the presence of genetic and physiological vulnerability, parents can influence the likelihood of offspring developing problematic alcohol-related behaviors.",

Our hypothesis is that LTAA (Long-Term Abstinent Alcoholics) with a current major depressive disorder (MDD) drank primarily to deal with the negative affect associated with their MDD and not because of a heightened externalizing diathesis (including heightened appetitive drive), and consequently, in achieving and maintaining abstinence, such individuals would not exhibit the RSS adaptations characteristic of pure alcoholics. We studied 69 NSAC (Non Substance Abusing Controls) and 40 LTAA (8 with current MDD, 32 without a current MDD) using resting-state fMRI and seed based connectivity analyses. In the inhibitory executive control network (nucleus accumbens vs. left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), LTAA with a current MDD showed increased synchrony compared to NSAC. In the emotion regulation executive control network (subgenual anterior cingulate cortex vs. right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), LTAA with current MDD did not show increased RSS. In the appetitive drive networks (nucleus accumbens vs, aspects of the caudate nucleus and thalamus), LTAA with a current MDD did not show a reduction of RSS compared to NSAC, but LTAA without a current MDD did. These results suggest different pathways to their alcohol dependence in LTAA with vs. without a current MDD, and different patterns of brain activity in long-term abstinence, suggesting different treatment needs.",

A sample of 50 patients (METH; age 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 years), 3\u20138 months after methanol poisoning, and 57 control subjects (CS; age 49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 years) were administered a neuropsychological battery. Forty-six patients were followed in 2 years' perspective. Patients additionally underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Three biochemical and toxicological metabolic markers and a questionnaire regarding alcohol abuse facilitated the classification of 24 patients with methanol poisoning without alcohol abuse (METHna) and 22 patients with methanol poisoning and alcohol abuse (METHa). All groups were compared to a control group of similar size, and matched for age, education, premorbid intelligence level, global cognitive performance, and level of depressive symptoms. Using hierarchical multiple regression we found significant differences between METH and CS, especially in executive and memory domains. METHa showed a similar pattern of cognitive impairment with generally more severe executive dysfunction. Moreover, all METH patients with extensive involvement on brain MRI (lesions in \u22652 anatomical regions) had a more severe cognitive impairment. From a longitudinal perspective, we did not find any changes in their cognitive functioning after 2 years' follow-up. Our findings suggest that methanol poisoning is associated with executive dysfunction and explicit memory impairment, supposedly due to basal ganglia dysfunction and disruption of frontostriatal circuitry proportional to the number of brain lesions, and that these changes are persistent after 2 years' follow-up.",

     "abstract": "Binge drinking and the onset of alcohol-use disorders usually peak during the transition between late adolescence and early adulthood, and early adolescent onset of alcohol consumption has been demonstrated to increase the risk for alcohol dependence in adulthood. In the present study, we describe an animal model of early adolescent alcohol consumption where animals drink unsweetened and unflavored ethanol in high concentrations (20%). Using this model, we investigated the influence of drinking on alcohol-related appetitive behavior and alcohol consumption levels in early adulthood. Further, we also sought to investigate whether differences in alcohol-related drinking behaviors were specific to exposure in adolescence versus exposure in adulthood. Male Wistar rats were given a 2-bottle choice between 20% ethanol and water in one group and between two water bottles in another group during their adolescence (Postnatal Day [PD] 26\u201359) to model voluntary drinking in adolescent humans. As young adults (PD85), rats were trained in a paradigm that provided free access to 20% alcohol for 25\u00a0min after completing up to a fixed-ratio (FR) 16 lever press response. A set of young adult male Wistar rats was exposed to the same paradigm using the same time course, beginning at PD92. The results indicate that adolescent exposure to alcohol increased consumption of alcohol in adulthood. Furthermore, when investigating differences between adolescent high and low drinkers in adulthood, high consumers continued to drink more alcohol, had fewer FR failures, and faster completion of FR schedules in adulthood, whereas the low consumers were no different from controls. Rats exposed to ethanol in young adulthood also increased future intake, but there were no differences in any other components of drinking behavior. Both adolescent- and adult-exposed rats did not exhibit an increase in lever pressing during the appetitive challenge session. These data indicate that adolescent and early adult alcohol exposure can increase consumptive aspects of drinking but that adolescent exposure may preferentially influence the motivation to drink.",

Predicted values for the inverse mills ratio are generated, which are then included in the health and health-care utilization equations. Differences in health status for each category of drinker are examined, and the relationship between both alcohol consumption and health with a host of other personal and socio-economic variables is also identified. Given that the measure of health status available is self-assessed, the effect of alcohol consumption on health-care utilization is also analyzed as an alternative measure of health. Findings show that in Ireland, moderate drinkers enjoy the best health status. More moderate drinkers report having very good or excellent health compared with heavy drinkers, non-drinkers, or those who never drank.

The present study sought to interfere with ethanol metabolism by inhibiting ALDH2 (mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase) activity in both liver and brain from control and Pb-exposed rats as a strategy to accumulate ACD, a substance that plays a major role in the drug's reinforcing and/or aversive effects.To evaluate the impact on a 2-h chronic voluntary ethanol intake test, developmentally Pb-exposed and control rats were administered with cyanamide (CY, an ALDH inhibitor) either systemically or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) on the last 4 sessions of the experiment.

In preclinical literature, the use of inbred mouse lines has allowed for the examination of ethanol effects across vulnerable and resistant phenotypes. C57BL/6J mice consistently show higher rates of ethanol drinking compared to most mouse strains. Conversely, DBA/2J mice display low rates of ethanol consumption. Given that the reinforcing and rewarding effects of ethanol are thought to be in part mediated by its actions on dopamine neurotransmission, we hypothesized that alcohol-preferring C57BL/6J and alcohol-avoiding DBA/2J mice would display basal differences in dopamine system function. By administering an L-aromatic acid decarboxylase inhibitor and measuring L-Dopa accumulation via high-performance liquid chromatography as a measure of tyrosine hydroxylase activity, we found no difference in dopamine synthesis between mouse strains in the midbrain, dorsal striatum, or ventral striatum. However, we did find that quinpirole-induced inhibition of dopamine synthesis was greater in the ventral striatum of C57BL/6J mice, suggesting increased presynaptic D2-type dopamine autoreceptor sensitivity. To determine whether dopamine synthesis or autoreceptor sensitivity was altered by a history of ethanol, we exposed C57BL/6J mice to one or two weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure and withdrawal. We found that there was an attenuation of baseline dopamine synthesis in the ventral striatum after two cycles of CIE. Finally, we examined tissue content of dopamine and dopamine metabolites across recombinant inbred mice bred from a C57BL/6J\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0DBA/2J cross (BXD). We found that low dopaminergic activity, as indicated by high dopamine/metabolite ratios, was positively correlated with drinking. Together, these findings show differential autoreceptor effects on dopamine synthesis between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, and suggest that decreased dopaminergic activity is associated with excessive drinking.",

Using a pharmacological approach to validate the genetic findings, C57BL/6J mice were allowed intermittent access to ethanol to establish baseline consumption before they were treated with retigabine, an FDA-approved KV7 channel positive modulator. Systemic administration significantly reduced drinking, and consistent with previous evidence, retigabine was more effective at reducing voluntary consumption in high-drinking than low-drinking subjects. We evaluated the specific K+ channel genes that were most sensitive to CIE exposure and identified a gene subset in the NAc and PFC that were dysregulated in the alcohol-dependent BXD cohort. CIE-induced modulation of nine genes in the NAc and six genes in the PFC covaried well with the changes in drinking induced by ethanol dependence. Here we identified novel candidate genes in the NAc and PFC that are regulated by ethanol dependence and correlate with voluntary drinking in non-dependent and dependent BXD mice. The findings that Kcnq expression correlates with drinking and that retigabine reduces consumption suggest that KV7 channels could be pharmacogenetic targets to treat individuals with alcohol addiction.",

Consumption of escalating concentrations of ethanol was measured in mice with GluN2B gene deletion in either cortical principal neurons (GluN2BCxNULL) or interneurons (GluN2BInterNULL), using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Results showed that GluN2BInterNULL, but not GluN2BCxNULL, mice consumed significantly less ethanol, at relatively high concentrations, than non-mutant controls. In a second paradigm in which mice were offered a 15% ethanol concentration, without escalation, GluN2BCxNULL mice were again no different from controls.

In parallel to observations in humans, prior studies in rodents have described male/female differences across a range of ethanol-related behaviors, including ethanol drinking. Nonetheless, there remain gaps in our knowledge of the role of sex in moderating the effects of ethanol, particularly in models of chronic ethanol exposure. The goal of the current study was to assess various behavioral sequelae of exposing female C57BL/6J mice to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) via ethanol vapors. Following four weeks of CIE exposure, adult male and female mice were compared for ethanol drinking in a two-bottle paradigm, for sensitivity to acute ethanol intoxication (via loss of righting reflex [LORR]) and for anxiety-like behaviors in the novelty-suppressed feeding and marble burying assays. Next, adult and adolescent females were tested on two different two-bottle drinking preparations (fixed or escalating ethanol concentration) after CIE. Results showed that males and females exhibited significantly blunted ethanol-induced LORR following CIE, whereas only males showed increased anxiety-like behavior after CIE. Increased ethanol drinking after CIE was also specific to males, but high baseline drinking in females may have occluded detection of a CIE-induced effect. The failure to observe elevated drinking in females in response to CIE was also seen in females exposed to CIE during adolescence, regardless of whether a fixed or escalating ethanol-concentration two-bottle procedure was employed. Collectively, these data add to the literature on sex differences in ethanol-related behaviors and provide a foundation for future studies examining how the neural consequences of CIE might differ between males and females.",

Recent studies have leveraged chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigms to measure changes in brain gene expression in a single strain at 0, 8, 72\u00a0h, and even 7 days following CIE. We extend these findings using LCM RNA-seq to profile expression in 11 brain regions in two inbred strains \u2013 C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) \u2013 72\u00a0h following multiple cycles of ethanol self-administration and CIE. Linear models identified differential expression based on treatment, region, strain, or interactions with treatment. Nearly 40% of genes showed a robust effect (FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of region, and hippocampus CA1, cortex, bed nucleus stria terminalis, and nucleus accumbens core had the highest number of differentially expressed genes after treatment. Another 8% of differentially expressed genes demonstrated a robust effect of strain. As expected, based on similar studies in B6, treatment had a much smaller impact on expression; only 72 genes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) are modulated by treatment (independent of region or strain). Strikingly, many more genes (415) show a strain-specific and largely opposite response to treatment and are enriched in processes related to RNA metabolism, transcription factor activity, and mitochondrial function. Over 3 times as many changes in gene expression were detected in D2 compared to B6, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) module comparison identified more modules enriched for treatment effects in D2. Substantial strain differences exist in the temporal pattern of transcriptional neuroadaptation to CIE, and these may drive individual differences in risk of addiction following excessive alcohol consumption.",

A total of 119 BXDs (85 males, 34 females) (n\u00a0\u223c\u00a04 per genotype; 1/genotype/sex/group) were evaluated along with males from both progenitor strains (n\u00a0=\u00a014\u201315/genotype). Mice were evaluated for intake using limited access (2\u00a0h/day) 2-bottle (15% v/v ethanol vs. water) model for 6 weeks (baseline intake). Each animal received 4 weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure (CIE group) or air control exposure (CTL group) (16\u00a0h/day\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04 days) interleaved by 5-day drinking test cycles.

Comparison of phenotypic differences across genetically distinct mouse strains provides one approach to identify molecular and genetic factors contributing to compulsive-like behaviors. Here we examine a rodent assay for punished ethanol self-administration in four widely used inbred strains known to differ on ethanol-related behaviors: C57BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), 129S1/SvImJ (S1), and BALB/cJ (BALB). Mice were trained in an operant task (FR1) to reliably lever-press for 10% ethanol using a sucrose-fading procedure. Once trained, mice received a punishment session in which lever pressing resulted in alternating ethanol reward and footshock, followed by tests to probe the effects of punishment on ethanol self-administration. Results indicated significant strain differences in training performance and punished attenuation of ethanol self-administration. S1 and BALB showed robust attenuation of ethanol self-administration after punishment, whereas behavior in B6 was attenuated only when the punishment and probe tests were conducted in the same contexts. By contrast, D2 were insensitive to punishment regardless of context, despite receiving more shocks during punishment and exhibiting normal footshock reactivity. Additionally, B6, but not D2, reduced operant self-administration when ethanol was devalued with a bitter tastant. B6 and D2 showed devaluation of sucrose self-administration, and punished suppression of sucrose seeking was context dependent in both the strains. While previous studies have demonstrated avoidance of ethanol in D2, particularly when ethanol is orally available from a bottle, current findings suggest this strain may exhibit heightened compulsive-like self-administration of ethanol, although there are credible alternative explanations for the phenotype of this strain. In sum, these findings offer a foundation for future studies examining the neural and genetic factors underlying AUDs.",

     "abstract": "The transition from acute to chronic ethanol exposure leads to lasting behavioral and physiological changes such as increased consumption, dependence, and withdrawal. Changes in brain gene expression are hypothesized to underlie these adaptive responses to ethanol. Previous studies on acute ethanol identified genetic variation in brain gene expression networks and behavioral responses to ethanol across the BXD panel of recombinant inbred mice. In this work, we have performed the first joint genetic and genomic analysis of transcriptome shifts in response to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) by vapor chamber exposure in a BXD cohort. CIE treatment is known to produce significant and sustained changes in ethanol consumption with repeated cycles of ethanol vapor. Using Affymetrix microarray analysis of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAC) RNA, we compared CIE expression responses to those seen following acute ethanol treatment, and to voluntary ethanol consumption. Gene expression changes in PFC and NAC after CIE overlapped significantly across brain regions and with previously published expression following acute ethanol. Genes highly modulated by CIE were enriched for specific biological processes including synaptic transmission, neuron ensheathment, intracellular signaling, and neuronal projection development. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identified genomic loci associated with ethanol-induced transcriptional changes with largely distinct loci identified between brain regions. Correlating CIE-regulated genes to ethanol consumption data identified specific genes highly associated with variation in the increase in drinking seen with repeated cycles of CIE. In particular, multiple myelin-related genes were identified. Furthermore, genetic variance in or near dynamin3 (Dnm3) on Chr1 at \u223c164\u00a0Mb may have a major regulatory role in CIE-responsive gene expression. Dnm3 expression correlates significantly with ethanol consumption, is contained in a highly ranked functional group of CIE-regulated genes in the NAC, and has a cis-eQTL within a genomic region linked with multiple CIE-responsive genes.",

Neuroactive steroids were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in serum following five cycles of CIE or air exposure (CTL). Pregnenolone levels in CTLs range from 272 to 578\u00a0pg/mL (strain variation of 2.1 fold with p\u00a0=\u00a00.049 for strain main effect), with heritability of 0.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006 (SEM), whereas in CIE cases values range from 304 to 919\u00a0pg/mL (3.0-fold variation, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), with heritability of 0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005. 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THP levels in CTLs range from 375 to 1055\u00a0pg/mL (2.8-fold variation, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0007), with heritability of 0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01; in CIE cases they range from 460 to 1022\u00a0pg/mL (2.2-fold variation, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), with heritability of 0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005. 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THDOC levels in CTLs range from 94 to 448\u00a0pg/mL (4.8-fold variation, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), with heritability of 0.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, whereas levels in CIE cases do not differ significantly.

Suggestive quantitative trait loci are identified for pregnenolone and 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THP levels.

However, individual variation in 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-THP correlated negatively with ethanol consumption in both groups. Moreover, strain variation in neuroactive steroid levels correlated with numerous behavioral phenotypes of anxiety sensitivity accessed in GeneNetwork, consistent with evidence that neuroactive steroids modulate anxiety-like behavior.",

     "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol-use disorders have a high rate of co-occurrence, possibly because they are regulated by common genes. In support of this idea, mice selectively bred for high (HAP) alcohol preference show greater fear potentiated startle (FPS), a model for fear-related disorders such as PTSD, compared to mice selectively bred for low (LAP) alcohol preference. This positive genetic correlation between alcohol preference and FPS behavior suggests that the two traits may be functionally related. This study examined the effects of fear conditioning on alcohol consumption and the effects of alcohol consumption on the expression of FPS in male and female HAP2 and LAP2 mice. In experiment 1, alcohol consumption (g/kg) under continuous-access conditions was monitored daily for 4 weeks following a single fear-conditioning or control treatment (foot shock and no shock). FPS was assessed three times (once at the end of the 4-week alcohol access period, once at 24\u00a0h after removal of alcohol, and once at 6\u20138 days after removal of alcohol), followed by two more weeks of alcohol access. Results showed no change in alcohol consumption, but alcohol-consuming, fear-conditioned, HAP2 males showed increased FPS at 24\u00a0h during the alcohol abstinence period compared to control groups. In experiment 2, alcohol consumption under limited-access conditions was monitored daily for 4 weeks. Fear-conditioning or control treatments occurred four times during the first 12 days and FPS testing occurred four times during the second 12 days of the 4-week alcohol consumption period. Results showed that fear conditioning increased alcohol intake in both HAP2 and LAP2 mice immediately following the first conditioning session. Fear-conditioned HAP2 but not LAP2 mice showed greater alcohol intake compared to control groups on drinking days that occurred between fear conditioning and FPS test sessions. FPS did not change as a function of alcohol consumption in either line. These results in mice help shed light on how a genetic propensity toward high alcohol consumption may be related to the risk for developing PTSD and co-morbid alcohol-use disorders in humans.",

In the present study, we examined gene expression in the hippocampus of BXD recombinant inbred mice after exposure to ethanol (NOE), stress (RSS), and the combination of both (RSE). Mice were given an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 1.8\u00a0g/kg ethanol or saline, and subsets of both groups were exposed to acute restraint stress for 15\u00a0min or controls. Gene expression in the hippocampus was examined using microarray analysis. Genes that were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, q\u00a0<\u00a00.1) differentially expressed were further evaluated. Bioinformatic analyses were predominantly performed using tools available at GeneNetwork.org, and included gene ontology, presence of cis-regulation or polymorphisms, phenotype correlations, and principal component analyses. Comparisons of differential gene expression between groups showed little overlap. Gene Ontology demonstrated distinct biological processes in each group with the combined exposure (RSE) being unique from either the ethanol (NOE) or stress (RSS) group, suggesting that the interaction between these variables is mediated through diverse molecular pathways. This supports the hypothesis that exposure to stress alters ethanol-induced gene expression changes and that exposure to alcohol alters stress-induced gene expression changes. Behavior was profiled in all groups following treatment, and many of the differentially expressed genes are correlated with behavioral variation within experimental groups. Interestingly, in each group several genes were correlated with the same phenotype, suggesting that these genes are the potential origins of significant genetic networks. The distinct sets of differentially expressed genes within each group provide the basis for identifying molecular networks that may aid in understanding the complex interactions between stress and ethanol, and potentially provide relevant therapeutic targets. Using Ptp4a1, a candidate gene underlying the quantitative trait locus for several of these phenotypes, and network analyses, we show that a large group of differentially expressed genes in the NOE group are highly interrelated, some of which have previously been linked to alcohol addiction or alcohol-related phenotypes.",

We previously identified highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with large effects on predisposition to withdrawal after chronic and acute alcohol exposure in mice and mapped these loci to the same region of chromosome 1 (Alcdp1 and Alcw1, respectively). The present studies utilize a novel Alcdp1/Alcw1 congenic model (in which an interval spanning Alcdp1 and Alcw1 from the C57BL/6J donor strain [build GRCm38 150.3\u2013174.6\u00a0Mb] has been introgressed onto a uniform inbred DBA/2J genetic background) known to demonstrate significantly less severe chronic and acute withdrawal compared to appropriate background strain animals. Here, using c-Fos induction as a high-resolution marker of neuronal activation, we report that male Alcdp1/Alcw1 congenic animals demonstrate significantly less alcohol withdrawal-associated neural activation compared to appropriate background strain animals in the prelimbic and cingulate cortices of the prefrontal cortex as well as discrete regions of the extended amygdala (i.e., basolateral) and extended basal ganglia (i.e., dorsolateral striatum, and caudal substantia nigra pars reticulata). These studies are the first to begin to elucidate circuitry by which this confirmed addiction-relevant QTL could influence behavior. This circuitry overlaps limbic circuitry involved in stress, providing additional mechanistic information. Alcdp1/Alcw1 maps to a region syntenic with human chromosome 1q, where multiple studies find significant associations with risk for alcoholism.",

Alcohol was previously shown to reduce DC ability to present foreign Ag and promote pro-inflammatory responses in situations of infection and trauma. However the impact of alcohol exposure on generation of an anti-tumor response, especially in the context of generation of an immune vaccine has not been examined. In the clinic, DC vaccines are typically generated from autologous blood, therefore prior exposure to substances such as alcohol may be a critical factor to consider regarding the effectiveness in generating an immune response. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that ethanol differentially affects DC and tumor Ag-specific T cell responses depending on sex. Signaling pathways were found to be differentially regulated in DC in females compared to males and these differences were exacerbated by ethanol treatment. DC from female mice treated with ethanol were unable to activate Ag-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) as shown by reduced expression of CD44, CD69, and decreased production of granzyme B and IFN\u03b3. Furthermore, although FOXO3, an immune suppressive mediator of DC function, was found to be upregulated in DC from female mice, ethanol related suppression was independent of FOXO3. These findings demonstrate for the first time differential impacts of alcohol on the immune system of females compared to males and may be a critical consideration for determining the effectiveness of an immune based therapy for cancer in patients that consume alcohol.",

Therefore, here we report on NCD burden and specifically ARDs, in hospitalized patients at a regional hospital in Nepal. We conducted a retrospective chart-review that included detailed information on all discharged patients during a four month period. A local database that included sociodemographic information and diagnoses at discharge was established. All doctor-assigned discharge diagnoses were retrospectively assigned ICD-10 codes. A total of 1,139 hospitalized adult patients were included in the study and one third of these were NCDs (n\u00a0=\u00a0332). The main NCDs were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n\u00a0=\u00a0148, 45%) and ARDs (n\u00a0=\u00a057, 17%). Patients with ARD often presented with signs of liver cirrhosis and were typically younger men, with a median age at 43 years, from specific ethnic groups. These data demonstrate that severe alcohol-related organ failure in relatively young men contributed to a high proportion of NCDs in a regional hospital in Nepal. These findings are novel and alarming and warrant further studies that can establish the burden of ARDs and alcohol use in Nepal and other similar low-income countries.",

However, few studies isolate a stimulus's function as a CS from its other potential functions. Pavlovian-Instrumental-Transfer (PIT) procedures isolate a stimulus's function as a CS from its other functions. Though there are several relevant studies using PIT, knowledge gaps exist. Particularly, it is not clear that an alcohol-paired CS will increase alcohol seeking compared to the same stimulus in a Truly-Random-Control group, nor whether such increases are specific to alcohol seeking. To address these knowledge gaps in Experiment 1, rats responded for ethanol (0.1\u00a0ml 8% w/v) under an RI 30-sec schedule, then the lever was removed and half the rats had ethanol delivered during occasional 120-sec light presentations, while the remainder had ethanol and the light presented under independent RT schedules. Later the lever was returned and the light was presented during responding in extinction (PIT test). Following this test, levers were again removed and the light was presented without ethanol (light extinction), following again by a PIT test. Responding in the two groups during light presentations did not differ in either PIT test. Experiment 2 repeated Experiment 1 using food instead of ethanol. In Experiment 2, responding during light presentations increased in the paired group. In Experiment 3, rats were trained on a concurrent FR schedule of food and ethanol delivery. Ethanol was delivered following 5 responses and the response requirement for food adjusted so that similar numbers of food and ethanol deliveries were obtained. Subsequently, rats underwent conditioning, control and testing procedures identical to those in Experiment 1. In Experiment 3, the ethanol-paired CS increased ethanol-responding, but not food-responding. These results are most easily interpreted as changes in responding resulting from CS-elicited behavior rather than motivational changes. This interpretation is more compatible with some descriptions of the role of an alcohol-paired CS in alcoholism than others.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol is often consumed to reduce tension and improve mood when exposed to stressful situations. Previous studies showed that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce stress when alcohol is consumed prior to a stressor, but data on the effect of alcohol consumption after a mental stressor is limited. Therefore, our objective was to study whether moderate alcohol consumption immediately after a mental stressor attenuates the stress response. Twenty-four healthy men (age 21\u201340\u00a0y, BMI 18\u201327\u00a0kg/m2) participated in a placebo-controlled trial. They randomly consumed 2 cans (660\u00a0mL, \u223c26\u00a0g alcohol) of beer or alcohol-free beer immediately after a mental stressor (Stroop task and Trier Social Stress Test). Physiological and immunological stress response was measured by monitoring heart rate and repeated measures of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis), white blood cells and a set of cytokines. After a mental stressor, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were 100% and 176% more reduced at 60\u00a0min (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001, respectively) and 92% and 60% more reduced at 90\u00a0min (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.056, respectively) after beer consumption as compared to alcohol-free beer consumption. Heart rate and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were not influenced by alcohol consumption. Plasma IL-8 concentrations remained lower during the stress recovery period after beer consumption than after alcohol-free beer consumption (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, consumption of a moderate dose of alcohol after a mental stressor may facilitate recovery of the endocrine stress response as reflected by decreasing plasma ACTH and cortisol.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage caused by the accumulation of bio-products generated in the biotransformation of ethanol to acetaldehyde mediated by the CYP2E1 enzyme has been studied. To evaluate DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the possible association with polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CYP2E1 gene, we performed a case-control study including 75 alcoholics and 59 individuals who consume alcohol socially. Alcoholics were previously diagnosed by the Psychosocial Care Center \u2013 Alcohol and Drugs (CAPS A/D) in the city of Goiania, Goias state, Central Brazil. DNA damage was evaluated by comet assay. The analysis of the rs3813867, rs2031920, and rs2031921 polymorphisms in the promoter region of CYP2E1 gene was performed by Sanger sequencing. Men older than 35 years old were the most common alcoholics. We found increased DNA damage in the case group, compared to the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Alcoholics who were heterozygous in the rs3813867, rs2031920, and rs2031921 polymorphisms showed higher DNA damage (tail length and olive tail moment), compared to individuals with the homozygous non-mutated allele. Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms in the promoter region of the CYP2E1 gene could cause higher CYP2E1 transcriptional activity, increasing enzyme activity compared with nondrinkers, indicating that the presence of the mutated allele (heterozygous or homozygous) may be associated with higher alcohol metabolic rates and therefore show increased acetaldehyde levels after alcohol consumption, which then can exert its carcinogenic effect.",

Although previous studies have found positive association between regular alcohol use and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HsCRP), whether this association is modified by alcohol sensitivity has not been clarified. We therefore sought to examined this potential effect modification in a cross-sectional community sample with high prevalence of alcohol sensitivity, using data from 2903 men aged \u226550years recruited during phase 1 of the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Information on alcohol consumption and sensitivity (facial flushing, palpitation or dizziness after drinking) was obtained by questionnaire and HsCRP was measured by an immunoturbidometric assay. Elevated HsCRP was defined as HsCRP level equal to or higher than 2.81\u00a0mg/L(median). Excessive alcohol use was defined as use of \u2265210\u00a0g ethanol per week. After adjustment for age, educational level, occupation, smoking status, physical activity and history of cardiovascular disease, alcohol use was associated with HsCRP in a dose-response pattern. The risks of elevated HsCRP were higher in those who drank daily (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.38 (1.10, 1.72)) or drank excessively (1.57 (1.22, 2.02)), and were even higher in alcohol users with alcohol sensitivity (1.82 (1.24, 2.65) for daily users and 2.34 (1.48, 3.71) for excessive users). Results of this study have showed an important role of alcohol sensitivity in modifying the association between alcohol use and HsCRP level. Reduction of alcohol use should be an important public heath target, particularly among populations with high prevalence of alcohol sensitivity.",

Since sodium is one of the main bioelements, which is responsible for proper neuromuscular excitability maintenance and contributes in nerve impulses conduction, sodium balance disorders may be related to a risk to basic life functions. The tested group included 100 alcohol dependent patients (M\u00a0=\u00a090, F\u00a0=\u00a010). Sodium was determined using biochemical Indiko Plus analyzer. Analysis of sodium concentration demonstrated that 64% of people with alcohol dependence had low (<135\u00a0mmol/L) plasma sodium level, of which: 7% had severe hyponatremia (<120\u00a0mmol/L), 13% had moderate hyponatremia (120\u2013130\u00a0mmol/L) and 44% had mild hyponatremia (130\u2013135\u00a0mmol/L).

This study explores the persistent cognitive consequences of ethanol administration in rat pups over postnatal days (PD) 4\u20139, modeling human third trimester consumption. Between PD65-70, ethanol-exposed (5E) and control rats were evaluated in two variants of recognition memory, the spontaneous novel object recognition (NOR) task, using 20 and 240\u00a0min sample-to-test delays, and the associative object-in-context (OIC) task, using a 20\u00a0min delay. No treatment group differences were observed in object exploration during the sample session for any task. In the 20\u00a0min NOR test session the 5E rats explored the novel object significantly less than controls, relative to the total time exploring both objects. Postnatal ethanol exposure is hypothesized to impede object memory consolidation in the perirhinal cortex of 5E rats, hindering their ability to discriminate between familiar and novel objects at short delays. The 5E rats performed as well or better than control rats in the 240\u00a0min NOR and the 20\u00a0min OIC tasks, indicating developmental ethanol exposure selectively impairs the retention and expression of recognition memories in young adult rats.",

     "abstract": "The prevalent co-abuse of nicotine and alcohol suggests a common neural mechanism underlying the actions of the two drugs. Nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco, activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) containing the \u03b16 subunit (\u03b16* nAChRs) in dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region known to be crucial for drug reward. Recent evidence suggests that ethanol may potentiate ACh activation of these receptors as well, although whether \u03b16* nAChR expression is necessary for behavioral effects of acute ethanol exposure is unknown. We compared binge-like ethanol consumption and ethanol reward sensitivity between knockout (KO) mice that do not express chrna6 (the gene encoding the \u03b16 nAChR subunit, the \u03b16 KO line) and wild-type (WT) littermates using the Drinking-in-the-Dark (DID) and Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) assay, respectively. In the DID assay, \u03b16 KO female and male mice consumed ethanol similarly to WT mice at all concentrations tested. In the CPP assay, 2.0-g/kg and 3.0-g/kg, but not 0.5-mg/kg, ethanol conditioned a place preference in WT female and male mice, whereas only 2.0-g/kg ethanol conditioned a place preference in \u03b16 KO mice. Acute challenge with ethanol reduced locomotor activity, an effect that developed tolerance with repeated injections, similarly between genotypes in both female and male mice. Together, these data indicate that expression of \u03b16* nAChRs is not required for binge-like ethanol consumption and reward, but modulate sensitivity to the rewarding properties of the drug.",

     "abstract": "Novokinin (Arg-Pro-Leu-Lys-Pro-Trp), a potent vasorelaxing and hypotensive peptide modified from ovokinin, exhibits highly selective affinity for the AT2 receptor. However, its role in gastrointestinal functions is still not fully understood. In this study, we found that novokinin inhibited basal gastric acid secretion and protected gastric mucosa from alcohol-induced injury in a dose-related manner in rats after intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration. Novokinin significantly decreased basal gastric acid output at the dose of 50 and 100\u00a0nmol/rat. The effect of novokinin on gastric acid secretion was reversed by central injection of PD 123319 (10\u00a0nmol/rat), an AT2 receptor antagonist, and peripheral injection of indomethacin (10\u00a0mg/kg), an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Meanwhile, pre-treatment with novokinin at doses of 10, 50, and 100\u00a0nmol/rat significantly reduced the alcohol-induced gastric mucosal injury compared to the ulcer-control group, which was inhibited by indomethacin (10\u00a0mg/kg). The result showed a remarkable increase in the level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), glutathione (GSH), and a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA) after i.c.v. administration of novokinin. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of novokinin on gastric acid secretion is probably mediated via an AT2 receptor-prostaglandins (PGs) pathway. The gastroprotective effect of novokinin might be attributed to the inhibition of acid secretion, the cytoprotection of PGs, and the antioxidant property.",

The endpoints for development of hyperuricemia were defined as a uric acid \u22657\u00a0mg/dL or taking any anti-hyperuricemic medication. The dose\u2013response relationship of alcohol consumption was investigated using multivariate-pooled logistic regression analyses adjusted for other potential covariates.

     "abstract": "The voluntary use and abuse of alcohol and inhalants is a recognized health problem throughout the world. Previous studies have shown that these agents affect brain function in a variety of ways including direct inhibition of key ion channels that regulate neuronal excitability. Among these, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is particularly important given its key role in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, neuronal plasticity and learning and memory. Previous studies from this laboratory and others have identified key residues within transmembrane (TM) domains of the NMDA receptor that appear to regulate its sensitivity to alcohol and anesthetics. In this study, we extend these findings and examine the role of a TM4 residue in modulating sensitivity of recombinant NMDA receptors to ethanol and toluene. HEK293 cells were transfected with GluN1-1a and either wild-type or tryptophan-substituted GluN2(A-D) subunits and whole-cell currents were recorded using patch-clamp electrophysiology in the absence or presence of ethanol or toluene. Both ethanol (100\u00a0mM) and toluene (1 or 3\u00a0mM) reversibly inhibited glutamate-activated currents from wild-type NMDARs with GluN2B containing receptors showing heightened sensitivity to either agent. Substitution of tryptophan (W) at positions 825, 826, 823 or 850 in the TM4 domain of GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C or GluN2D subunits; respectively, significantly reduced the degree of inhibition by ethanol. In contrast, toluene inhibition of glutamate-activated currents in cells expressing the TM4-W mutants was not different from that of the wild-type controls. These data suggest that despite similarities in their action on NMDARs, ethanol and toluene may act at different sites to reduce ion flux through NMDA receptors.",

     "abstract": "Numerous studies demonstrate that reactive aldehydes are highly toxic and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2)-mediated detoxification of reactive aldehydes is thought as an endogenous protective mechanism against reactive aldehydes-induced cell injury. This study aims to explore whether lipoic acid, a potential ALDH2 activator, is able to protect gastric mucosa from ethanol-induced injury through a mechanism involving clearance of reactive aldehydes. The rats received 60% of acidified ethanol through intragastric administration and held for 1\u00a0h to establish a mucosal injury model. Lipoic acid (10 or 30\u00a0mg/kg) or Alda-1 (a positive control, 10\u00a0mg/kg) was given 45\u00a0min before the ethanol treatment. The gastric tissues were collected for analysis of gastric ulcer index, cellular apoptosis, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and ALDH2 activity. The results showed that acute administration of ethanol led to an increase in gastric ulcer index, cellular apoptosis, 4-HNE and MDA contents concomitant with a decrease in ALDH2 activity; these phenomena were reversed by lipoic acid or Alda-1. The gastric protection of lipoic acid was attenuated in the presence of ALDH2 inhibitor. Based on these observations, we conclude that lipoic acid exerts the beneficial effects on ethanol-induced injury through a mechanism involving, at least in part, ALDH2 activation. As a dietary supplement or a medicine already in some countries, lipoic acid can be used to treat the ethanol - induced gastric mucosal injury.",

Since Atp1a2 has been shown to be involved in anxiety and this behavior is a known risk factor for developing alcoholism, we have been investigating Atp1a2 for its potential role in responses to alcohol. This study utilized Atp1a2 knockout mice; Atp1a2 heterozygous mice, with half the amount of protein compared to wild-type mice, were used because Atp1a2 homozygous null mice die shortly after birth. The alcohol-related behavioral experiments performed were loss of righting reflex (LORR), acute alcohol withdrawal measured by handling-induced convulsions (HIC), drinking in the dark (DID), open-field activity (OFA), and elevated plus-maze (EPM). LORR was a 2-day test that measures acute alcohol sensitivity, and rapid and acute functional tolerance (AFT). HIC was a 3-day test to measure alcohol withdrawal, DID was a 4-day test which measures voluntary alcohol consumption, and OFA and EPM measured anxiety with alcohol exposure. The effect of genotype on alcohol metabolism was also examined. There was a genotype effect on rate of alcohol metabolism, but only in males. There was no effect on alcohol withdrawal severity. The Atp1a2 heterozygous mice consumed more alcohol than wild-type mice in the DID test, although only in males. In addition, only males were observed to show rapid tolerance in the LORR test while only female heterozygous mice showed a pretreatment effect on AFT. Alcohol exposure had a greater anxiolytic effect in the heterozygous mice compared to wild-type mice, although, again, there were sex effects with only males showing the effect in OFA and only females in the EPM. Although the behavioral results were mixed, there does appear to be a connection between anxiety and alcohol. Overall, the results suggest that Atp1a2 does contribute to alcohol-related behaviors, although the effect is modest with a clear dependence on sex.",

Drinkers are categorised into one of four categories based on the recommended weekly drinking levels by the Irish Health Promotion Unit; those who never drank, non-drinkers, moderate and heavy drinkers. A multinomial logit OLS Two Step Estimate is used to explain individual's choice of drinking status and to correct for selection bias which would result in the selection into a particular category of drinking being endogenous. Endogeneity which may arise through the simultaneity of drinking status and income either due to the reverse causation between the two variables, income affecting alcohol consumption or alcohol consumption affecting income, or due to unobserved heterogeneity, is addressed. This paper finds that the household income of drinkers is higher than that of non-drinkers and of those who never drank. There is very little difference between the household income of moderate and heavy drinkers, with heavy drinkers earning slightly more. Weekly household income for those who never drank is \u20ac454.20, non-drinkers is \u20ac506.26, compared with \u20ac683.36 per week for moderate drinkers and \u20ac694.18 for heavy drinkers.",

On P15 and P25, PTZ (45\u00a0mg/kg) was injected into the rest of the pups and seizure behaviors were then recorded. COS levels increased in pups of the RS group but not in pups of the RA group. Both focal and tonic-clonic seizures were prevalent and severe in pups of the RS group, whereas only focal seizures were prominent in pups of the CA group. However, pups prenatally exposed to co-administration of alcohol and stress, unexpectedly, did not show additive epileptic effects. The failure of pups prenatally exposed to alcohol to show progressive or facilitatory epileptic responses to stressors, indicates decreased plasticity and adaptability, which may negatively affect HPA-axis performance or hippocampal structure/function.",

Compulsive alcohol drinking, where intake continues despite negative consequences, is considered a particular obstacle during treatment of AUDs. Aversion-resistant drives for alcohol have been modeled in rodents, where animals continue to consume even when alcohol is adulterated with the bitter tastant quinine, or is paired with another aversive consequence. Here, we describe a two-bottle choice paradigm where C57BL/6 mice first had 24-h access to 15% alcohol or water. Afterward, they drank quinine-free alcohol (alcohol-only) or alcohol with quinine (100\u00a0\u03bcM), in a limited daily access (LDA) two-bottle-choice paradigm (2\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week, starting 3\u00a0h into the dark cycle), and achieved nearly binge-level blood alcohol concentrations. Interestingly, a single, initial 24-h experience with alcohol-only enhanced subsequent quinine-resistant drinking. In contrast, mice that drank alcohol\u2013quinine in the 24-h session showed significantly reduced alcohol\u2013quinine intake and preference during the subsequent LDA sessions, relative to mice that drank alcohol-only in the initial 24-h session and alcohol\u2013quinine in LDA sessions. Thus, mice could find the concentration of quinine we used aversive, but were able to disregard the quinine after a single alcohol-only drinking session. Finally, mice had low intake and preference for quinine in water, both before and after weeks of alcohol-drinking sessions, suggesting that quinine resistance was not a consequence of increased quinine preference after weeks of drinking of alcohol\u2013quinine. Together, we demonstrate that a single alcohol-only session was sufficient to enable subsequent aversion-resistant consumption in C57BL/6 mice, which did not reflect changes in quinine taste palatability. Given the rapid development of quinine-resistant alcohol drinking patterns, this model provides a simple, quick, and robust method for uncovering the mechanisms that promote aversion-resistant consumption.",

However, the association between alcohol consumption and ED among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unclear. The aim of the present multicenter cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between drinking frequency, weekly alcohol consumption, daily alcohol consumption, and ED among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study subjects were 340 male Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 19\u201370 years, who had undergone blood tests at our institutions. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on the variables under study.ED was defined as present when a subject had a Sexual Health Inventory for Men score <8. Adjustment was made for age, body mass index, duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus, current smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, glycated hemoglobin, stroke, coronary artery disease, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic neuropathy. The prevalence of ED was 43.2% (147/340). The frequency of alcohol consumption and weekly alcohol consumption were independently inversely associated with ED (p for trend p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 0.004, respectively). The relationship between daily alcohol consumption and ED was an inverted J-shaped curve: alcohol consumption of less than 60\u00a0g, but not 60\u00a0g or more, per day was independently related to a lower prevalence of ED (p for quadratic trend\u00a0=\u00a00.003). In Japanese men with type 2 diabetes mellitus, an inverted J-shaped relationship between daily alcohol consumption and ED was observed, while frequency of alcohol consumption and weekly alcohol consumption were significantly inversely associated with ED.",

     "abstract": "Ethanol at low concentrations (<4%) can serve as a food source for fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, whereas at higher concentrations it may be toxic. In this work, protective effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) against ethanol toxicity were studied. Food supplementation with 10-mM AKG alleviated toxic effects of 8% ethanol added to food, and improved fly development. Two-day-old adult flies, reared on diet containing both AKG and ethanol, possessed higher alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity as compared with those reared on control diet or diet with ethanol only. Native gel electrophoresis data suggested that this combination diet might promote post-translational modifications of ADH protein with the formation of a highly active ADH form. The ethanol-containing diet led to significantly higher levels of triacylglycerides stored in adult flies, and this parameter was not altered by AKG supplement. The influence of diet on antioxidant defenses was also assessed. In ethanol-fed flies, catalase activity was higher in males and the levels of low molecular mass thiols were unchanged in both sexes compared to control values. Feeding on a mixture of AKG and ethanol did not affect catalase activity but caused a higher level of low molecular mass thiols compared to ethanol-fed flies. It can be concluded that both a stimulation of some components of antioxidant defense and the increase in ADH activity may be responsible for the protective effects of AKG diet supplementation in combination with ethanol. The results suggest that AKG might be useful as a treatment option to neutralize toxic effects of excessive ethanol intake and to improve the physiological state of D.\u00a0melanogaster and other animals, potentially including humans.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol-use disorders (AUD) persist in the United States and are heavily associated with an increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in particular has received attention as a viral pathogen commonly detected in children and immune-compromised populations (elderly, asthmatics), yet more recently was recognized as an important viral pathogen in young adults. Our study evaluated the exacerbation of RSV-associated illness in mice that chronically consumed alcohol for 6 weeks prior to infection. Prior studies showed that lung viral titers remained elevated in these animals, leading to a hypothesis that T-cell activation and immune specificity were deficient in controlling viral spread and replication in the lungs. Herein, we confirm a reduction in RSV-specific IFN\u03b3 production by CD8 T cells and a depolarization of Th1 (CD4+IFN\u03b3+) and Th2 (CD4+IL-4+) T cells at day 5 after RSV infection. Furthermore, over the course of viral infection (day 1 to day 7 after RSV infection), we detected a delayed influx of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes into the lungs. Taken together, the data show that both the early and late adaptive immunity to RSV infection are altered by chronic ethanol consumption. Future studies will determine the interactions between the innate and adaptive immune systems to delineate therapeutic targets for individuals with AUD often hospitalized by respiratory infection.",

     "abstract": "Recent work using a mouse model has identified the glutamate metabotropic receptor 7 (Grm7) gene as a strong candidate gene for alcohol consumption. Although there has been some work examining the effect of human glutamate metabotropic receptor 7 (GRM7) polymorphisms on human substance use disorders, the majority of the work has focused on other psychiatric disorders such as ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, panic disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. The current study aimed to evaluate evidence for association between GRM7 and alcohol behaviors in humans using a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) approach, as well as a gene-based approach. Using 1803 non-Hispanic European Americans (EAs) (source: the Colorado Center on Antisocial Drug Dependence [CADD]) and 1049\u00a0EA subjects from an independent replication sample (source: the Genetics of Antisocial Drug Dependence [GADD]), two SNPs in GRM7 were examined for possible association with alcohol consumption using two family-based association tests implemented in FBAT and QTDT. Rs3749380 was suggestively associated with alcohol consumption in the CADD sample (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) with the minor T allele conferring risk. There was no evidence for association in the GADD sample. A gene-based test using four Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) revealed no association between variation in GRM7 and alcohol consumption. This study had several limitations: the SNPs chosen likely do not tag expression quantitative trait loci; a human alcohol consumption phenotype was used, complicating the interpretation with respect to rodent studies that found evidence for a cis-regulatory link between alcohol preference and Grm7; and only common SNPs imputed in all four datasets were included in the gene-based test. These limitations highlight the fact that rare variants, some potentially important common signals in the gene, and regions farther upstream were not examined.",

     "abstract": "Annually, excessive alcohol use accounts for more than $220 billion in economic costs and 80,000 deaths, making excessive alcohol use the third leading lifestyle-related cause of death in the US. Patients with an alcohol-use disorder (AUD) also have an increased susceptibility to respiratory pathogens and lung injury, including a 2\u20134-fold increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This review investigates some of the potential mechanisms by which alcohol causes lung injury and impairs lung immunity. In intoxicated individuals with burn injuries, activation of the gut-liver axis drives pulmonary inflammation, thereby negatively impacting morbidity and mortality. In the lung, the upper airway is the first checkpoint to fail in microbe clearance during alcohol-induced lung immune dysfunction. Brief and prolonged alcohol exposure drive different post-translational modifications of novel proteins that control cilia function. Proteomic approaches are needed to identify novel alcohol targets and post-translational modifications in airway cilia that are involved in alcohol-dependent signal transduction pathways. When the upper airway fails to clear inhaled pathogens, they enter the alveolar space where they are primarily cleared by alveolar macrophages (AM). With chronic alcohol ingestion, oxidative stress pathways in the AMs are stimulated, thereby impairing AM immune capacity and pathogen clearance. The epidemiology of pneumococcal pneumonia and AUDs is well established, as both increased predisposition and illness severity have been reported. AUD subjects have increased susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia infections, which may be due to the pro-inflammatory response of AMs, leading to increased oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Adolescence is a sensitive period of brain development when changes in hormone levels may have long-lasting effects on synaptic connections and behavior. In humans, alcohol consumption frequently begins during this critical period, although the impact of early exposure has not been fully examined. The current study was designed to investigate short- and long-term effects of repeated forced ethanol consumption during adolescence on emerging reproductive behaviors. Twenty-six young male Long-Evans rats were assigned to ethanol (Young EtOH, n\u00a0=\u00a012) or water (Young Control, n\u00a0=\u00a014) groups at postnatal day (P) 32, receiving a modified binge protocol of 3\u00a0g/kg of solution via gavage twice per week from P32 to P80. For comparison, another cohort of rats received a similar treatment paradigm in adulthood from P75\u2013P133 (Adult EtOH, n\u00a0=\u00a08; Adult Control, n\u00a0=\u00a010). Reproductive behavior was assessed with tests for copulation, partner preference, and 50-kHz vocalizations during forced consumption (intoxication) and again after a 4\u20135 week period of abstinence. During forced consumption, the Young EtOH group showed significantly longer latencies on copulation tests than Young Controls, but these differences did not persist after abstinence. Different patterns were observed in Adult animals, who only showed significant, delayed impairments in the post-ejaculatory interval. Preference for sexually receptive females increased with sexual experience in both adolescent and adult rats, regardless of treatment during the forced consumption phase. However, after abstinence, the Young EtOH group showed a significantly reduced partner preference compared to the Young Control group, which may indicate long-term effects on sexual motivation. Additionally, during forced consumption the Young EtOH group tended to emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations, perhaps reflecting impairments in sexual communication. Adult groups showed no differences in partner preference or vocalization tests at any time. Taken together, these findings indicate that repeated, intermittent ethanol exposure may have moderate effects on reproductive behavior that vary as a function of age. After abstinence, differences were only observed in the younger group, suggesting that the adolescent brain and behavior are more sensitive to ethanol exposure than the adult brain for sexual motivation and performance.",

Yet, with increasing reports of acute health issues present in young adults who ingest large quantities of energy drinks alone or in combination with alcohol, the need to elucidate these potential risks is pressing. Energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine and sucrose; therefore, exposure to energy drinks may lead to changes in drug-related behaviors since caffeine and sucrose consumption activates similar brain pathways engaged by substances of abuse. With a recent study observing that adolescent caffeine consumption increased cocaine sensitivity, we sought to investigate how prolonged energy drink exposure in adolescence alters alcohol use and preference in adulthood. To do so, we utilized three different energy drink exposure paradigms and two strains of male mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) to monitor the effect of caffeine exposure via energy drinks in adolescence on adult alcohol intake. These paradigms included two models of volitional consumption of energy drinks or energy drink-like substances and one model of forced consumption of sucrose solutions with different caffeine concentrations. Following adolescent exposure to these solutions, alcohol intake was monitored in a limited-access, two-bottle choice between water and increasing concentrations of alcohol during adulthood. In none of the three models or two strains of mice did we observe that adolescent \u2018energy drink\u2019 consumption or exposure was correlated with changes in adult alcohol intake or preference. While our current preclinical results suggest that exposure to large amounts of caffeine does not alter future alcohol intake, differences in caffeine metabolism between mice and humans need to be considered before translating these results to humans.",

The experimental rats were fed low-dose ethanol (0.5\u00a0g/kg/day), high-dose ethanol (5\u00a0g/kg/day), and high-dose ethanol with rosuvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day) during the entire experiment.

We assessed the capillary density in the myocardium via immunohistochemistry and quantified the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and endostatin via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits on the 4th day after myocardial infarction. The results revealed that low ethanol consumption promoted angiogenesis in association with higher VEGF and lower endostatin. High ethanol intake suppressed angiogenesis with unchanged VEGF and elevated endostatin. Treatment with rosuvastatin preserved angiogenesis following high ethanol intake, with an upregulation of VEGF. This study highlights that low ethanol consumption obviously promotes angiogenesis in myocardial-infarction rats while increasing the expression of VEGF, whereas high ethanol consumption inhibits ischemia-induced angiogenesis. This study also provides evidence that rosuvastatin alleviates the inhibitory effects of heavy drinking on angiogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Consuming alcohol during pregnancy is one of the most verified prenatal risk factors for impaired child development. Information about the amount of alcohol consumed prenatally is needed to anticipate negative effects and to offer timely support. Women's self-reports are not reliable, often influenced by social stigmas and retrospective recall bias, causing biomarkers of intrauterine ethanol exposure to become more and more relevant. The present study compares both women's gestational and retrospective self-reports of prenatal alcohol consumption with levels of ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in meconium. Women (n\u00a0=\u00a0180) gave self-reports of prenatal alcohol consumption both during their 3rd trimester (gestational self-report) and when their children were 6\u20138 years old (retrospective self-report). Child meconium was collected after birth and analyzed for EtG. No individual feedback of children's EtG level was given to the women. All analyses were run separately for two cut-offs: 10\u00a0ng/g (limit of detection) and 120\u00a0ng/g (established by Goecke et\u00a0al., 2014). Mothers of children with EtG values above 10\u00a0ng/g (n\u00a0=\u00a042) tended to report prenatal alcohol consumption more frequently. There was no trend or significance for the EtG cut-off of 120\u00a0ng/g (n\u00a0=\u00a026) or for retrospective self-report. When focusing on women who retrospectively reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy, a claim to five or more consumed glasses per month made an EtG over the 10\u00a0ng/g and the 120\u00a0ng/g cut-off more probable. Women whose children were over the 10\u00a0ng/g EtG cut-off were the most inconsistent in their self-report behavior, whereas the consistency in the above 120\u00a0ng/g EtG group was higher than in any other group. The next step to establish EtG as a biomarker for intrauterine alcohol exposure is to correlate EtG values in meconium with child developmental impairments.",

However, the roles of DNA double-strand break (DSB) and its repair pathways, homologous recombination (HR), and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in alcohol-induced hippocampal injury remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this first study was to assess alcohol-induced DNA DSB and the mechanism by which alcohol affects DSB repair pathways in rat hippocampus. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (8\u201310 weeks old) were put on a 4-day binge ethanol treatment regimen. Control animals were maintained under similar conditions but were given the vehicle without ethanol. All animals were humanely euthanized 24\u00a0h after the last dose of ethanol administration and the hippocampi were dissected for immunoblot and immunohistochemistry analysis. Ethanol exposure caused increased 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) staining as well as elevated \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci in hippocampal cells. Immunoblot analysis showed decreased Mre11, Rad51, Rad50, and Ku86 as well as increased Bax and p21 in samples from ethanol-treated rats. Additionally, we also observed increased activated caspase3 staining in hippocampal cells 24\u00a0h after ethanol withdrawal. Taken together, our data demonstrated that ethanol concurrently induced DNA DSB, downregulated DSB repair pathway proteins, and increased apoptotic factors in hippocampal cells. We believe these findings will provide the impetus for further research on DNA DSB and its repair pathways in relation to alcohol toxicity in brain.",

We therefore investigated the inhibitory potential of ethanol and disulfiram and their metabolites on recombinant human DAO (rhDAO) in three different assay systems. Relevant concentrations of ethanol, acetaldehyde, and acetate did not inhibit rhDAO activity in an in\u00a0vitro assay system using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -mediated luminol oxidation. The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; EC 1.2.1.3) inhibitors cyanamide and its dimer dicyanamide also had no effect on DAO activity. In one assay system, the irreversible ALDH inhibitor disulfiram and its main metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate seemed to inhibit DAO activity. However, the decreased product formation was not due to a direct block of DAO activity but resulted from inhibition of peroxidase employed in the coupled system. Our in\u00a0vitro data do not support a direct blocking effect of ethanol, disulfiram, and their metabolites on DAO activity in\u00a0vivo.",

With recent changes in the economy and increases in average incomes in China during the same period, there has been a rapid rise in per capita alcohol consumption and an epidemic of obesity. We hypothesized that the burden of liver diseases in China has shifted from infectious to non-infectious etiologies. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 20,378 patients who were hospitalized in Beijing 302 hospital between 2002 and 2013. We found that the total admission rate secondary to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic liver disease (NAFLD), autoimmune liver disease (AILD), and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) was 10.7%. ALD was the leading cause of inpatient hospitalization (3.9% of total admissions). The rate of inpatient admission for ALD, AILD, and DILI increased by 170%, 111%, and 107%, respectively during the study period. Chinese herbal medicine was the primary cause of DILI in our subjects. The burden of non-infectious liver diseases has increased over the last decade among hospitalized patients in a large tertiary hospital in China. The increase in the rate of admission for ALD and DILI from Chinese herbal medicine suggests that strategies to reduce harmful use of alcohol and increase awareness and education on the use of herbal medicine are needed.",

BDNF and testosterone have been independently reported to influence alcohol consumption. Therefore, we aimed to investigate a possible interplay of testosterone and BDNF contributing to alcohol dependence. Regarding possible interplay of testosterone and BDNF and the activity of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA), we included cortisol serum levels in our research. We investigated testosterone and BDNF serum levels in a sample of 99 male alcohol-dependent patients during alcohol withdrawal (day 1, 7, and 14) and compared them to a healthy male control group (n = 17). The testosterone serum levels were significantly (p < 0.001) higher in the patients' group than in the control group and decreased significantly during alcohol withdrawal (p < 0.001). The decrease of testosterone serum levels during alcohol withdrawal (days 1\u20137) was significantly associated with the BDNF serum levels (day 1: p = 0.008). In a subgroup of patients showing high cortisol serum levels (putatively mirroring high HPA activity), we found a significant association of BDNF and testosterone as well as with alcohol craving measured by the Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). Our data suggest a possible association of BDNF and testosterone serum levels, which may be relevant for the symptomatology of alcohol dependence. Further studies are needed to clarify our results.",

Divided into two plenary sessions, AIRIG opened with the topic of pulmonary inflammation as a result of alcohol consumption, which was followed by alcohol's effect on multiple organs, including the brain and liver. With presentations showing the diverse range of underlying pathology and mechanisms associated with multiple organs as a result of alcohol consumption, AIRIG emphasized the importance of continued alcohol research, as its detrimental consequences are not limited to one or even two organs, but rather extend to the entire host as a whole.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use is a risk factor for severe injury in pedestrians struck by motor vehicles. Our objective was to investigate alcohol use by bicyclists and its effects on riding behaviors, medical management, injury severity, and mortality within a congested urban setting. A hospital-based, observational study of injured bicyclists presenting to a Level I regional trauma center in New York City was conducted. Data were collected prospectively from 2012 to 2014 by interviewing all bicyclists presenting within 24 h of injury and supplemented with medical record review. Variables included demographic characteristics, scene-related data, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), computed tomography (CT) scans, and clinical outcomes. Alcohol use at the time of injury was determined by history or blood alcohol level (BAL) >0.01 g/dL. Of 689 bicyclists, 585 (84.9%) were male with a mean age of 35.2. One hundred four (15.1%) bicyclists had consumed alcohol prior to injury. Alcohol use was inversely associated with helmet use (16.5% [9.9\u201325.1] vs. 43.2% [39.1\u201347.3]). Alcohol-consuming bicyclists were more likely to fall from their bicycles (42.0% [32.2\u201352.3] vs. 24.2% [20.8\u201327.9]) and less likely to be injured by collision with a motor vehicle (52.0% [41.7\u201362.1] vs. 67.5% [63.5\u201371.3]). 80% of alcohol-consuming bicyclists underwent CT imaging at presentation compared with 51.5% of non-users. Mortality was higher among injured bicyclists who had used alcohol (2.9% [0.6\u20138.2] vs. 0.0% [0.0\u20130.6]). Adjusted multivariable analysis revealed that alcohol use was independently associated with more severe injury (Adjusted Odds Ratio 2.27, p = 0.001, 95% Confidence Interval 1.40\u20133.68). Within a dense urban environment, alcohol use by bicyclists was associated with more severe injury, greater hospital resource use, and higher mortality. As bicycling continues to increase in popularity internationally, it is important to heighten awareness about the risks and consequences of bicycling while under the influence of alcohol.",

     "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is impacted by a multitude of pre- and postnatal factors. Developmental programming of HPA axis function by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been demonstrated in animal models and in human infants, but remains understudied in older children and adolescents. Moreover, early life adversity (ELA), which occurs at higher rates in children with PAE than in non-exposed children, may also play a role in programming the stress response system. In a cohort of children and adolescents with PAE and ELA (PAE\u00a0+\u00a0ELA), we evaluated HPA function through assessment of diurnal cortisol activity compared to that in typically developing controls, as well as the associations among specific ELAs, adverse outcomes, protective factors, and diurnal cortisol. Morning and evening saliva samples were taken under basal conditions from 42 children and adolescents (5\u201318 years) with PAE\u00a0+\u00a0ELA and 43 typically developing controls. High rates of ELA were shown among children with PAE, and significantly higher evening cortisol levels and a flatter diurnal slope were observed in children with PAE\u00a0+\u00a0ELA, compared to controls. Medication use in the PAE\u00a0+\u00a0ELA group was associated with lower morning cortisol levels, which were comparable to controls. Complex associations were found among diurnal cortisol patterns in the PAE\u00a0+\u00a0ELA group and a number of ELAs and later adverse outcomes, whereas protective factors were associated with more typical diurnal rhythms. These results complement findings from research on human infants and animal models showing dysregulated HPA function following PAE, lending weight to the suggestion that PAE and ELA may interact to sensitize the developing HPA axis. The presence of protective factors may buffer altered cortisol regulation, underscoring the importance of early assessment and interventions for children with FASD, and in particular, for the many children with FASD who also have ELA.",

For instance, paternal preconception exposures to ethanol or stress have independently been shown to exert such intergenerational effects. Since ethanol exposure is a physiological stressor that activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, we hypothesized that paternal ethanol exposure would impact stress responsivity of offspring. Adult male mice were exposed to chronic intermittent vapor ethanol or control conditions for 5 weeks before being mated with ethanol-na\u00efve females to produce ethanol (E)- and control (C)-sired offspring. Adult male and female offspring were tested for plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels following acute restraint stress and the male offspring were further examined for stress-evoked 2-bottle choice ethanol-drinking. Paternal ethanol exposure blunted plasma CORT levels following acute restraint stress selectively in male offspring; females were unaffected. In a stress-evoked ethanol-drinking assay, there was no effect of stress on ethanol consumption. However, C-sired males exhibited increased total fluid intake (polydipsia) in response to stress while E-sired males were resistant to this stress-induced phenotype. Taken together, these data suggest that paternal ethanol exposure imparts stress hyporesponsivity to male offspring.",

     "abstract": "The abuse liability of alcohol (ethanol) is believed to result in part from its actions on neurobiological substrates that underlie the motivation toward food and other natural reinforcers, and a growing body of evidence indicates that these substrates are broadly conserved among animal phyla. Understanding the extent to which the substrates regulating ethanol and food intake overlap is an important step toward developing therapeutics that selectively reduce ethanol intake. In the current experiments, we measured food and ethanol intake in Recombinant Inbred (RI) lines of Drosophila melanogaster using several assays, and then calculated genetic correlations to estimate the degree to which common genes might underlie behavior in these assays. We found that food intake and ethanol intake as measured in the capillary assay are genetically correlated traits in D.\u00a0melanogaster, as well as in a panel of 11 Drosophila species that we tested subsequently. RI line differences in food intake in a dyed food assay were genetically unrelated to ethanol intake in the capillary assay or to ethanol preference measured using an olfactory trap apparatus. Using publicly available gene expression data, we found that expression profiles across the RI lines of a number of genes (including the D2-like dopamine receptor, DOPA decarboxylase, and fruitless) correlated with the RI line differences in food and ethanol intake we measured, while the expression profiles of other genes, including NPF, and the NPF and 5-HT2 receptors, correlated only with ethanol intake or preference. Our results suggest that food and ethanol intake are regulated by some common genes in Drosophila, but that other genes regulate ethanol intake independently of food intake. These results have implications toward the development of therapeutics that preferentially reduce ethanol intake.",

     "abstract": "Both pathological and neuroimaging studies demonstrate that chronic alcohol abuse causes brain atrophy with widespread white matter loss limited gray matter loss. Recent neuroimaging studies suggest that tobacco smoking also causes brain atrophy in both alcoholics and neurologically normal individuals; however, this has not been confirmed pathologically. In this study, the effects of smoking and the potential additive effects of concomitant alcohol and tobacco consumption were investigated in autopsied human brains. A total of 44 cases and controls were divided into four groups: 16 non-smoking controls, nine smoking controls, eight non-smoking alcoholics, and 11 smoking alcoholics. The volumes of 26 gray and white matter regions were measured using an established point-counting technique. The results showed trends for widespread white matter loss in alcoholics (p\u00a0<\u00a00.007) but no effect on gray matter regions. In contrast, smoking alone had no effect on brain atrophy and the combination of smoking and alcohol showed no additional effect. Neuronal density was analyzed as a more sensitive assay of gray matter integrity. Similar to the volumetric analysis, there was a reduction in neurons (29%) in the prefrontal cortex of alcoholics, albeit this was only a trend when adjusted for potential confounders (p\u00a0<\u00a00.06). There were no smoking or combinatorial effects on neuronal density in any of the three regions examined. These results do not support the hypothesis that smoking exacerbates alcohol-related brain damage. The trends here support previous studies that alcohol-related brain damage is characterized by focal neuronal loss and generalized white matter atrophy. These disparate effects suggest that two different pathogenic mechanisms may be operating in the alcoholic brain. Future studies using ultrastructural or molecular techniques will be required to determine if smoking has more subtle effects on the brain and how chronic alcohol consumption leads to widespread white matter loss.",

Twenty very heavy drinkers with alcohol dependence entered a trial of 8 weeks of treatment with quetiapine followed by 8 weeks of treatment with a combination of quetiapine plus mirtazapine. Alcohol use was assessed weekly with a Timeline Follow-Back interview and craving with the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale.

The present study investigates the role of \u03b2-endorphin in moderating free-choice consumption of ethanol in response to a blocked activity wheel. Female, transgenic mice with varying levels of the opioid peptide were given daily 2-h access to 20% ethanol with rotations on a running wheel blocked on alternate days. Subjects with low \u03b2-endorphin exhibited enhanced stress sensitivity by self-administering larger quantities of ethanol on days when wheel running was prevented. \u03b2-endorphin levels did not influence voluntary activity on the running wheel. There were genotypic differences in plasma corticosterone levels as well as corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA content in multiple brain regions associated with the stress response in these free drinking and running subjects. Susceptibility to stress is enhanced in female mice with low levels of \u03b2-endorphin, and better understanding of the role for this opioid in mitigating the response to stressors may aid in the development of interventions and treatments for excessive use of alcohol in women.",

The finding that a CRF1-receptor antagonist (CRF1RA) minimized CIA withdrawal-induced negative affect supported an association of alcohol withdrawal with a stress mechanism. The finding that repeated stresses or multiple CRF injections into selected brain sites prior to a single 5-day chronic alcohol (CA) exposure induced anxiety during withdrawal provided critical support for a linkage of CIA withdrawal with stress. The determination that CRF1RA injection into positive CRF-sensitive brain sites prevented CIA withdrawal-induced anxiety provided support that neural path integration maintains the persistent CIA adaptation. Based upon reports that stress increases neuroimmune function, an effort was undertaken to test whether cytokines would support the adaptation induced by stress/CA exposure. Twenty-four hours after withdrawal from CIA, cytokine mRNAs were found to be increased in cortex as well as other sites in brain. Further, repeated cytokine injections into previously identified brain sites substituted for stress and CRF induction of anxiety during CA withdrawal. Discovery that a CRF1RA prevented the brain cytokine mRNA increase induced by CA withdrawal provided critical evidence for CRF involvement in this neuroimmune induction after CA withdrawal. However, the CRF1RA did not block the stress increase in cytokine mRNA increases in controls. The latter data supported the hypothesis that distinct mechanisms linked to stress and CA withdrawal can support common neuroimmune functions within a brain site. As evidence evolves concerning neural involvement in brain neuroimmune function, a better understanding of the progressive adaptation associated with CIA exposure will advance new knowledge that could possibly lead to strategies to combat alcohol abuse.",

Binge-like intoxication is thought to be a crucial stage in the development of the chronic relapsing nature of the addictions, and self-medication through binge-like drinking is commonly seen in PTSD patients. We have selectively bred two separate High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1 and HDID-2) mouse lines to reach high blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) after a 4-h period of access to 20% ethanol starting shortly after the onset of circadian dark. As an initial step toward the eventual goal of employing binge-prone HDID mice to study PTSD-like behavior including alcohol binge drinking, we sought first to determine their ability to acquire conditioned fear. We asked whether these mice acquired, generalized, or extinguished conditioned freezing to a greater or lesser extent than unselected control HS/Npt mice. In two experiments, we trained groups of 16 adult male mice in a standard conditioned fear protocol. Mice were tested for context-elicited freezing, and then, in a novel context, for cue-induced freezing. After extinction tests, renewal of conditioned fear was tested in the original context. Mice of all three genotypes showed typical fear responding. Context paired with shock elicited freezing behavior in a control experiment, but cue unpaired with shock did not. These studies indicate that fear learning per se does not appear to be influenced by genes causing predisposition to binge drinking, suggesting distinct neural mechanisms. However, HDID mice are shown to be a suitable model for studying the role of conditioned fear specifically in binge-like drinking.",

Recent epidemiological studies suggest that possessing ALDH2*2 is a protective factor for liver tissue in healthy individuals, although these studies lack a mechanistic explanation. Our animal studies have shown the same trend: levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA), and hepatic tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were lower in Aldh2 knockout (Aldh2\u2212/\u2212) mice than in wild-type (Aldh2+/+) mice after ethanol administration. To propose a mechanistic hypothesis, residual liver specimens from the previous experiment were analyzed. An anti-oxidative protein, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and an oxidative stress-producing protein, cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), were detected at higher levels in Aldh2\u2212/\u2212 mice than in Aldh2+/+ mice, regardless of ethanol treatment. Other oxidative stress-related proteins and inflammatory cytokines did not show such a significant difference. To conclude, we propose a protective role of HO-1 in individuals with A LDH2*2. Our continued studies support the epidemiological finding that possession of ALDH2*2 is a protective factor in the liver of the healthy individual.",

Our aim was to compare levels of these steroid hormones between the post-mortem brain samples of alcoholics and non-alcoholic controls. We studied steroid levels with quantitative liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in post-mortem brain samples of alcoholics (N\u00a0=\u00a014) and non-alcoholic controls (N\u00a0=\u00a010). Significant differences were observed between study groups in DHEA and PREGN levels (p values 0.0056 and 0.019, respectively), but not in T levels. Differences between the study groups were most prominent in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and anterior insula (AINS). DHEA levels were increased in most alcoholic subjects compared to controls. However, only a subgroup of alcoholics showed increased PREGN levels. Negative Spearman correlations between tissue levels of PREGN and previous reports of [3H]naloxone binding to \u03bc-opioid receptors were observed in the AINS, ACC, NAC, and frontal cortex (R values between\u00a0\u22120.6 and\u00a0\u22120.8; p values\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002), suggesting an association between the opioid system and brain PREGN levels.

These amides have been reported in plasma and in other organs of the body, while their detection or presence in the urine is still unknown. Therefore, the focus of the current study was to detect and analyze FAAs qualitatively in urine samples of alcoholics. Furthermore, the effects of Tinospora cordifolia (hepatoprotective medicinal plant) intervention on FAA levels in moderate alcoholics were also analyzed. In the study, asymptomatic chronic alcoholics (n = 22) without chronic liver disease and nonalcoholic healthy volunteers (n = 24) with a mean age of 39 \u00b1 2.0 years were selected. The first-pass urine and fasting blood samples were collected in the morning on day 0 and day 14 after T. cordifolia water extract (TCE) treatment and analyzed using automated biochemistry analyzer and HPLC-QTOF-MS. Results indicated the increased levels of serum triglycerides, cholesterol, and liver function enzymes in alcoholic subjects, which were significantly down-regulated by TCE intervention. Multivariate discrimination analysis of QTOF-MS data showed increased urinary levels of oleoamide (2.55-fold), palmitamide (5.6-fold), and erucamide (1.6-fold) in alcoholics as compared to control subjects. Levels of oleamide (1.8-fold), palmitamide (1.7-fold), and linoleamide (1.5-fold) were found to be increased in plasma. Treatment with TCE in alcoholics (3.0 g lyophilized water extract/day) significantly decreased the plasma and urinary levels of all FAAs except linoleamide. The HPLC-QTOF-MS approach for FAAs analysis in both urinary and plasma samples of alcoholics worked very well. Moreover, findings (i.e., increased levels of FAAs in urine and in plasma) further support other findings that these amides play a very important role in alcoholism. Further, like our previous findings, TCE proved its hepatoprotective effect against alcoholism not only by lowering the levels of these detected FAAs, but also by decreasing the level of liver-specific enzymes and lipids.",

However, the combination and severity of impairments are highly dependent upon maternal ethanol consumption patterns, which creates a complex variety of manifestations. Rodent models have been essential in identifying behavioral endpoints of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). However, experimental model outcomes are extremely diverse based on level, pattern, timing, and method of ethanol exposure, as well as the behavioral domain assayed and paradigm used. Therefore, comparisons across studies are difficult and there is currently no clear comprehensive behavioral phenotype of PAE. This lack of defined cognitive and behavioral phenotype is a contributing factor to the difficulty in identifying FASD individuals. The current review aims to critically examine preclinical behavioral outcomes in the social, cognitive, and affective domains in terms of the PAE paradigm, with a special emphasis on dose, timing, and delivery, to establish a working model of behavioral impairment. In addition, this review identifies gaps in our current knowledge and proposes future areas of research that will advance knowledge in the field of PAE outcomes. Understanding the complex behavioral phenotype, which results from diverse ethanol consumption will allow for development of better diagnostic tools and more critical evaluation of potential treatments for FASD.",

     "abstract": "Several animal models have evaluated the effect of stress on voluntary ethanol intake with mixed results. The experiments reported here examined the effects of different stressors on voluntary ethanol consumption in dependent and nondependent adult male C57BL/6J mice. In Experiment 1, restraint, forced swim, and social defeat stress procedures all tended to reduce ethanol intake in nondependent mice regardless of whether the stress experience occurred 1\u00a0h or 4\u00a0h prior to ethanol access. The reduction in ethanol consumption was most robust following restraint stress. Experiment 2 examined the effects of forced swim stress and social defeat stress on drinking in a dependence model that involved repeated cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. Repeated exposure to forced swim stress prior to intervening test drinking periods that followed repeated cycles of CIE exposure further increased ethanol consumption in CIE-exposed mice while not altering intake in nondependent mice. In contrast, repeated exposure to the social defeat stressor in a similar manner reduced ethanol consumption in CIE-exposed mice while not altering drinking in nondependent mice. Results from Experiment 3 confirmed this selective effect of forced swim stress increasing ethanol consumption in mice with a history of CIE exposure, and also demonstrated that enhanced drinking is only observed when the forced swim stressor is administered during each test drinking week, but not if it is applied only during the final test week. Collectively, these studies point to a unique interaction between repeated stress experience and CIE exposure, and also suggest that such an effect depends on the nature of the stressor. Future studies will need to further explore the generalizability of these results, as well as mechanisms underlying the ability of forced swim stress to selectively further enhance ethanol consumption in dependent (CIE-exposed) mice but not alter intake in nondependent animals.",

Mice lacking AC1/8 (DKO) have a basal reduction in the dendritic complexity of medium spiny neurons in the caudate putamen and demonstrate increased neurotoxicity in the striatum following acute neonatal ethanol exposure compared to wild type (WT) controls, suggesting a compromise in BDNF regulation under varying conditions. Although neonatal ethanol exposure can negatively impact BDNF expression, little is known about the effect on BDNF receptor activation and its downstream signaling, including Akt activation, an established neuroprotective pathway. Therefore, here we determined the effects of AC1/8 deletion and neonatal ethanol administration on BDNF and proBDNF protein expression, and activation of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), Akt, ERK1/2, and PLC\u03b3. WT and DKO mice were treated with a single dose of 2.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol or saline at postnatal days 5-7 to model late-gestational alcohol exposure. Striatal and cortical tissues were analyzed using a BDNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoblotting for proBDNF, phosphorylated and total TrkB, Akt, ERK1/2, and PLC\u02631. Neither postnatal ethanol exposure nor AC1/8 deletion affected total BDNF protein expression at any time point in either region examined. Neonatal ethanol increased the expression of proBDNF protein in the striatum of WT mice 6, 24, and 48\u00a0h after exposure, with DKO mice demonstrating a reduction in proBDNF expression 6\u00a0h after exposure. Six and 24\u00a0h after ethanol administration, phosphorylation of full-length TrkB in the striatum was significantly reduced in WT mice, but was significantly increased in DKO mice only at 24\u00a0h. Interestingly, 48\u00a0h after ethanol, both WT and DKO mice demonstrated a reduction in phosphorylated full-length TrkB. In addition, Akt and PLC\u02631 phosphorylation was also decreased in ethanol-treated DKO mice 48\u00a0h after injection. These data demonstrate dysregulation of a potential survival pathway in the AC1/8 knockout mice following early-life ethanol exposure.",

     "abstract": "In Drosophila, the slo gene encodes BK-type Ca2+-activated K+ channels and is involved in producing rapid functional tolerance to sedation with ethanol. Drosophila are ideal for the study of functional ethanol tolerance because the adult does not acquire metabolic ethanol tolerance (Scholz, Ramond, Singh, & Heberlein, 2000). It has been shown that mutations in slo block the capacity to acquire tolerance, that sedation with ethanol vapor induces slo gene expression in the nervous system, and that transgenic induction of slo can phenocopy tolerance (Cowmeadow, Krishnan, & Atkinson, 2005; Cowmeadow et\u00a0al., 2006). Here we use ethanol-induced histone acetylation to map a DNA regulatory element in the slo transcriptional control region and functionally test the element for a role in producing ethanol tolerance. Histone acetylation is commonly associated with activating transcription factors. We used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to map histone acetylation changes following ethanol sedation to identify an ethanol-responsive DNA element. Ethanol sedation induced an increase in histone acetylation over a 60 n DNA element called 6b, which is situated between the two ethanol-responsive neural promoters of the slo gene. Removal of the 6b element from the endogenous slo gene affected the production of functional ethanol tolerance as assayed in an ethanol-vapor recovery from sedation assay. Removal of element 6b extended the period of functional ethanol tolerance from \u223c10 days to more than 21 days after a single ethanol-vapor sedation. This study demonstrates that mapping the position of ethanol-induced histone acetylation is an effective way to identify DNA regulatory elements that help to mediate the response of a gene to ethanol. Using this approach, we identified a DNA element, which is conserved among Drosophila species, and which is important for producing a\u00a0behaviorally relevant ethanol response.",

     "abstract": "We have shown that dysregulation of the dynorphin/kappa-opioid receptor (DYN/KOR) system contributes to escalated alcohol self-administration in alcohol dependence and that KOR antagonists with extended durations of action selectively reduce escalated alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent animals. As KOR antagonism has gained widespread attention as a potential therapeutic target to treat alcoholism and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, we tested the effect of zyklophin (a short-acting KOR antagonist) on escalated alcohol self-administration in rats made alcohol-dependent using intermittent alcohol vapor exposure. Following dependence induction, zyklophin was infused centrally prior to alcohol self-administration sessions and locomotor activity tests during acute withdrawal. Zyklophin did not impact alcohol self-administration or locomotor activity in either exposure condition. To investigate the neurobiological basis of this atypical effect for a KOR antagonist, we utilized a \u03ba-, \u03bc-, and \u03b4-opioid receptor agonist-stimulated GTPyS coupling assay to examine the opioid receptor specificity of zyklophin in the rat brain and mouse brain. In rats, zyklophin did not affect U50488-, DAMGO-, or DADLE-stimulated GTPyS coupling, whereas the prototypical KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (norBNI) attenuated U50488-induced stimulation in the rat brain tissue at concentrations that did not impact \u03bc- and \u03b4-receptor function. To reconcile the discrepancy between the present rat data and published mouse data, comparable GTPyS assays were conducted using mouse brain tissue; zyklophin effects were consistent with KOR antagonism in mice. Moreover, at higher concentrations, zyklophin exhibited agonist properties in rat and mouse brains. These results identify species differences in zyklophin efficacy that, given the rising interest in the development of short-duration KOR antagonists, should provide valuable information for therapeutic development efforts.",

Alcohol abuse has severe effects on neurodevelopmental outcome, such as learning disabilities, memory deficits, and decreased cognitive performance. Additionally, chronic alcohol intake is associated with chronic liver disease. However, the effects of acute alcohol intoxication on liver function in children and adolescents are not well characterized. The aim of this study was to determine if a single event of acute alcohol intoxication has short-term effects on liver function and metabolism. All children and adolescents admitted to the Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine between 2004 and 2011 with the diagnosis \u201cacute alcohol intoxication\u201d were included in this retrospective analysis. Clinical records were evaluated for age, gender, alcohol consumption, blood alcohol concentration, symptoms, and therapy. Blood values of the liver parameters, CK, creatinine, LDH, AP, and the values of the blood gas analysis were analyzed. During the 8-year study period, 249 children and adolescents with the diagnosis \u201cacute alcohol intoxication\u201d were admitted, 132 (53%) girls and 117 (47%) boys. The mean age was 15.3 \u00b1 1.2 years and the mean blood alcohol concentration was 0.201 \u00b1 0.049%.

The mean values of liver parameters were in normal ranges, but AST was increased in 9.1%, ALT in 3.9%, and \u03b3GT in 1.4%. In contrast, the mean value of AST/ALT ratio was increased and the ratio was elevated in 92.6% of all patients. Data of the present study showed significant differences in the AST/ALT ratio (p < 0.01) in comparison to a control group. Data of the present study indicate that there might be an effect of acute alcohol intoxication on transaminase levels. The AST/ALT ratio seems to reflect the damage in hepatocytes after intensive alcohol consumption. The present study indicates a sex-specific difference in alcohol metabolism and effects between girls and boys: girls need less alcohol than boys to achieve the same blood alcohol levels than boys, and are more prone to loss of consciousness.",

Next, this drinking was paired with the injection of ethanol (0, 0.5, 1.0\u00a0g/kg), intraperitoneally [i.p.] immediately after removal of the saccharin bottle (conditioning phase). Afterward, the choice between the saccharin solution and water was extended for 18 subsequent days for 20-min daily sessions (post-conditioning phase). Both doses of ethanol did not produce an aversion to saccharin in WLP and WHP rats in the conditioning phase. However, injection of the 1.0\u00a0g/kg dose of ethanol produced an aversion in WLP rats that was detected by a decrease in saccharin intake at days 1, 3, 7, and 10 of the post-conditioning phase, with a decrease in saccharin preference for 16 days of the post-conditioning phase. Conditioned taste aversion, measured as a decrease in saccharin intake and saccharin preference, was only visible in WHP rats at day 1 and day 3 of the post-conditioning phase. This difference between WLP and WHP rats was apparent despite similar blood ethanol levels in both rat lines following injection of 0.5 and 1.0\u00a0g/kg of ethanol. These results may suggest differing levels of aversion to the post-ingestional effects of ethanol between WLP and WHP rats.

The results showed that the students who drank alcohol exhibited a more pronounced dysexecutive symptomatology (disinhibition, executive dysfunction, intentionality, executive memory), but they obtained better results than controls on some of the neuropsychological tests such as Spatial Location, Five Digit Tests, or Stroop Test. According to the results, we can deduce that heavy alcohol drinking in adolescents brings a certain dysfunction of prefrontal circuits. This prefrontal dysfunction is not so clearly demonstrated in the neuropsychological tests used, but it was observed in the performance of daily activities. In the Discussion section we raise issues about sociodemographic features of the sample and ecological validity of the traditional neuropsychological tests. The neurotoxic effects of BD on prefrontal cortex can be less evident throughout adolescence, but if alcohol consumption persists, the executive dysfunction would be exacerbated.",

Relatively little is known, however, about age-related differences in stress modulation of ethanol drinking or stress modulation of ethanol-induced sedation and hypnosis. We observed that chronic restraint stress transiently exacerbated free-choice ethanol drinking in adolescent, but not in adult, rats. Restraint stress altered exploration patterns of a light\u2013dark box apparatus in adolescents and adults. Stressed animals spent significantly more time in the white area of the maze and made significantly more transfers between compartments than their non-stressed peers. Behavioral response to acute stress, on the other hand, was modulated by prior restraint stress only in adults. Adolescents, unlike adults, exhibited ethanol-induced motor stimulation in an open field. Stress increased the duration of loss of the righting reflex after a high ethanol dose, yet this effect was similar at both ages. Ethanol-induced sleep time was much higher in adult than in adolescent rats, yet stress diminished ethanol-induced sleep time only in adults. The study indicates age-related differences that may increase the risk for initiation and escalation in alcohol drinking.",

Heavy alcohol drinking in the past 12 months was defined as an AUDIT-C score \u22654. Blood was collected from each potential participant to test for HIV and syphilis status. Twenty three percent of MSM had consumed a drink containing alcohol in the previous year. 7.2% had an AUDIT-C score \u22654, defined as heavy alcohol drinkers. 23.5% were unmarried, but planning to marry, who were more likely to report any alcohol drinking (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.40\u20134.06) and to have AUDIT-C scores \u22654 (AOR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.60\u20138.00). MSM who had used any alcohol in the previous year, and MSM who were heavy alcohol drinkers, were more likely to have had anal sex with male casual partners in the previous 6 months, to have been tested for HIV, and to have decreased scores on the scales of general self-efficacy, increased scores on the scales of stigma and discrimination. Our findings provided further evidence of the associations of any alcohol use and heavy alcohol consumption with HIV-risky behaviors, lowered sense of general self-efficacy, and higher sense of HIV/AIDS-related stigma and discrimination among MSM in the city with the highest HIV epidemic among MSM in China.",

     "abstract": "Withdrawal from long-term ethanol consumption results in overexcitation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala, which induces an anxiety-like syndrome. Most alcoholics that suffer from such symptoms frequently depend on habitual drinking as self-medication to alleviate their symptoms. Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5) and protein kinase C (PKC) epsilon have been reported to mediate acute and chronic effects of ethanol. This study explores the changes in mGlu5 and PKC epsilon in the amygdala following acute administration of ethanol during ethanol withdrawal (EW) induced anxiety. Male Wistar rats were fed a modified liquid diet containing low-fat cow milk, sucrose, and maltodextrin, with a gradual introduction of 2.4%, 4.8% and 7.2% ethanol for 20 days. Six hours into EW, the rats were intraperitoneally injected with normal saline and ethanol (2.5\u00a0g/kg, 20% v/v), and exposed to open-field and elevated plus maze tests. Then, amygdala tissue was dissected from the rat brain for Western blot and gene expression studies. EW-induced anxiety was accompanied by a significant increase in mGlu5, total PKC epsilon, and phosphorylated PKC epsilon protein levels, and also of mRNA of mGlu5 (GRM5) in the amygdala. Acute administration of ethanol significantly attenuated EW-induced anxiety as well as an EW-induced increase in GRM5. The acute challenge of ethanol to EW rats had little effect on the phosphorylated and total protein levels of PKC epsilon in the amygdala. Our results demonstrate that amygdala PKC epsilon may not be directly involved in the development of anxiety following EW.",

     "abstract": "High rates of comorbidity for anxiety and alcohol-use disorders suggest a causal relationship between these conditions. Previous work demonstrates basal anxiety levels in outbred Long-Evans rats correlate with differences in voluntary ethanol consumption and that amygdalar Neuropeptide Y (NPY) systems may play a role in this relationship. The present work explores the possibility that differences in sensitivity to ethanol's anxiolytic effects contribute to differential ethanol self-administration in these animals and examines the potential role of central and peripheral NPY in mediating this relationship. Animals were first exposed to the elevated plus maze (EPM) to assess individual differences in anxiety-like behaviors and levels of circulating NPY and corticosterone (CORT). Rats were then tested for anxiety-like behavior in the light\u2013dark box (LD box) following acute ethanol treatment (1\u00a0g/kg; intraperitoneally [i.p.]), and neuronal activation in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was assessed using Fos immunohistochemistry. EPM exposure increased plasma CORT levels without altering plasma NPY levels. Acute ethanol treatment significantly increased light\u2013dark transitions and latency to re-enter the light arena, but no differences were seen between high- and low-anxiety groups and no correlations were found between anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM and LD box. Acute ethanol treatment significantly increased Fos immunoreactivity in the BNST and the central amygdala. Although NPY neurons were not significantly activated following ethanol exposure, in saline-treated animals lower levels of anxiety-like behavior in the LD box (more time in the light arena and more transitions) were correlated with higher NPY-positive cell density in the central amygdala. Our results suggest that activation of the CeA and BNST are involved in the behavioral expression of ethanol-induced anxiolysis, and that differences in basal anxiety state may be correlated with NPY systems in the extended amygdala.",

In the present study we tested the hypothesis that E2 signaling via the estrogen receptor (ER), ER\u03b1, mediates this myocardial detrimental effect of alcohol.

ER\u03b1 blockade virtually abrogated ethanol-evoked myocardial dysfunction and hypotension, while ER\u03b2 blockade had little effect on the hypotensive response, but caused delayed attenuation of the ethanol-evoked reductions in left ventricular developed pressure and the rate of left ventricle pressure rise. GPER blockade caused delayed attenuation of all cardiovascular effects of ethanol. All three antagonists attenuated the ethanol-evoked increases in myocardial catalase and ALDH2 activities, Akt, ERK1/2, p38, eNOS, and nNOS phosphorylation, except for a lack of effect of PHTPP on p38. Finally, all three ER antagonists attenuated ethanol-evoked elevation in myocardial ROS, but this effect was most notable with ER\u03b1 blockade. In conclusion, ER\u03b1 plays a greater role in, and might serve as a molecular target for ameliorating, the E2-dependent myocardial oxidative stress and dysfunction caused by ethanol.",

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a vital role in the clearance of pathogens and regulation of inflammation, but these functions may be impaired in the setting of alcohol exposure. We examined the effect of AUDs on profiles of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in human AMs isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 19 AUD subjects and 20 age-, sex-, and smoking-matched control subjects. By multiplex bead array, the lysates of AMs from subjects with AUDs had significant elevation in the cytokine tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), as well as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), CXCL10, and chemokine (C\u2013C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, a 1.8-fold increase in IL-1\u03b2, 2.0-fold increase in IL-6, 2.3-fold increase in interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), 1.4-fold increase in CCL3, and a 2.3-fold increase in CCL4 was observed in the AUD group as compared to the control group. We also observed compensatory increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). AUD subjects had 5-fold higher levels of CXCL11 mRNA expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and a 2.4-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA expression by RT-PCR as well. In these investigations, alcohol use disorders were associated with functional changes in human AMs, suggesting that chronic alcohol exposure portends a chronically pro-inflammatory profile in these cells.",

     "abstract": "The acute effects of alcohol administration are age-, dose-, time- and task-dependent. Although generally considered to be a sedative drug, alcohol has both stimulatory and depressant effects on behavior, depending on dose and time. Alcohol-induced motor activating effects are consistently shown in mice but rarely demonstrated in adult, outbred rats using conventional behavioral tests. The aim of the present experiment was to study acute alcohol-induced effects on behavioral profiles in a more complex environment using the novel multivariate concentric square field\u2122 (MCSF) test, designed for assessing different behaviors in the same trial including locomotor activity. Adult male Wistar rats (Sca:WI) were administered one intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of alcohol (0.0\u00a0g/kg, 0.5\u00a0g/kg, 1.0\u00a0g/kg, or 1.5\u00a0g/kg) 5\u00a0min prior to the 30-min MCSF test. The two highest doses induced marked motor-suppressing effects. A significant interaction between group and time was found in general activity when comparing rats exposed to alcohol at 0.0\u00a0g/kg and 0.5\u00a0g/kg. In contrast to the 0.0\u00a0g/kg dose that increased the activity over time, animals administered the low dose (0.5\u00a0g/kg) demonstrated an initial high activity followed by a decline over time. No indications for acute alcohol-induced anxiolytic-like effects were found. The multivariate setting in the MCSF test appears to be sensitive for detecting motor-activating effects of low doses of alcohol as well as reduced locomotion at doses lower than in other behavioral tasks. The detection of subtle changes in behavior across time and dose is important for understanding alcohol-induced effects. This approach may be useful in evaluating alcohol doses that correspond to different degrees of intoxication in humans.",

This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that blood oxidoreductive balance can also affect demand for energy substances, such as alcoholic beverages in alcohol-dependent individuals, as well as the severity of their alcohol dependence and risk of drinking relapse. The following values were determined in the blood of 54 alcohol-dependent male patients after alcohol withdrawal, again after 4 weeks and after 6 months: the aldehyde products of lipid peroxidation (malonyl dialdehyde [MDA] and 4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE]), nitric oxide (NO) metabolites, total antioxidant status (TAS), the blood activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GSHred), blood glucose, and lipids. Alcoholics who relapsed during 6 months of observation (n\u00a0=\u00a031, 57%) compared with patients who maintained alcohol abstinence for 6 months (n\u00a0=\u00a023, 43%) differed only in relation to initial and final NO metabolite serum concentrations. The risk of alcohol drinking relapse was lower in patients with an above-median initial blood concentration of NO metabolites and TAS. The oxidative stress parameters correlated with alcohol-dependence severity markers. No significant correlations between the studied antioxidant balance parameters and markers of nutritional status, including blood glucose and lipids, were found. Although the results of our study have some limitations and require further investigation, they suggest the role of oxidoreductive balance in the pathomechanisms of alcohol dependence and drinking relapse. In addition, due to a lack of association found between blood oxidative stress parameters and BMI, blood glucose, and lipid concentrations, they show the presence of disturbances in systemic ROS signaling in response to energy availability in alcoholics after alcohol withdrawal.",

Research shows that DRSE buffers against drinking (Young, Hasking, Oei, & Loveday, 2007) and interacts with AE to predict alcohol consumption (Oei & Burrow, 2000). Studies further show that DI is predicted by DRSE (Norman, 2011) and AE (Fleming, Thorson, & Atkin, 2004). However, additional research is needed to understand DI's influence on both DRSE and AE among heavy college drinkers. This research included 344 heavy drinking college students (mean age = 23.06 years, SD = 5.61, 74.71% female) from a large southern university who completed study material as part of a larger intervention. Findings showed that DI, DRSE, and AE interacted with respect to heavy drinking such that DRSE was negatively associated with alcohol consumption, particularly among those low in positive AE and high in negative AE. This relationship was stronger among individuals low in DI relative to those high in DI. DI seems to be an important factor influencing heavy drinking among undergraduate students. Present findings further support DI's associations with heavy drinking, regardless of an individual's DRSE or AE. Implications of this research suggest that it may be beneficial for interventions to target specific aspects of AE, including anxious drinking.",

Results showed that alcohol intake did not alter behavioral measurements in the plus-maze, but increased the number of crossings in the open field, an index of locomotor activity.

Alcohol consumption by pregnant women is reported to cause adverse effects on the physical and psychological growth of the fetus. However, the direct effect of chronic alcohol consumption on reproductive fitness has not been tested. In recent years, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has emerged as a versatile model system to study the effects of alcohol on behavior and embryonic development. We utilized the zebrafish model system to address the effect of chronic alcohol exposure (0.5% alcohol in the holding tank for 9 weeks) on reproductive capacity. We found a dramatic decrease in fecundity, measured by counting the number of eggs laid, when at least one of the parents is subject to chronic alcohol exposure. Interestingly, a 9-week alcohol withdrawal program completely restored the reproductive capacity of the treated subjects. In agreement with observations on fecundity, the chronic alcohol exposure leads to increased anxiety, as measured by the novel-tank diving assay. Conversely, the withdrawal program diminished heightened anxiety in alcohol-exposed subjects. Our results highlight the adverse effects of chronic alcohol exposure on the reproductive capacity of both males and females, and underscore the utility of the zebrafish model system to understand the biology of chronic alcoholism.",

     "abstract": "Sprague\u2013Dawley rats selectively-bred for susceptibility to stress in our laboratory (Susceptible, or SUS rats) voluntarily consume large amounts of alcohol, and amounts that have, as shown here, pharmacological effects, which normal rats will not do. In this paper, we explore neural events in the brain that underlie this propensity to readily consume alcohol. Activity of locus coeruleus neurons (LC), the major noradrenergic cell body concentration in the brain, influences firing of ventral tegmentum dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic system (VTA-DA neurons), which mediate rewarding aspects of alcohol. We tested the hypothesis that in SUS rats alcohol potently suppresses LC activity to markedly diminish LC-mediated inhibition of VTA-DA neurons, which permits alcohol to greatly increase VTA-DA activity and rewarding aspects of alcohol. Electrophysiological single-unit recording of LC and VTA-DA activity showed that in SUS rats alcohol decreased LC burst firing much more than in normal rats and as a result markedly increased VTA-DA activity in SUS rats while having no such effect in normal rats. Consistent with this, in a behavioral test for reward using conditioned place preference (CPP), SUS rats showed alcohol, given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to be rewarding. Next, manipulation of LC activity by microinfusion of drugs into the LC region of SUS rats showed that (a) decreasing LC activity increased alcohol intake and increasing LC activity decreased alcohol intake in accord with the formulation described above, and (b) increasing LC activity blocked both the rewarding effect of alcohol in the CPP test and the usual alcohol-induced increase in VTA-DA single-unit activity seen in SUS rats. An important ancillary finding in the CPP test was that an increase in LC activity was rewarding by itself, while a decrease in LC activity was aversive; consequently, effects of LC manipulations on alcohol-related reward in the CPP test were perhaps even larger than evident in the test. Finally, when increased LC activity was associated with (i.e., conditioned to) i.p. alcohol, subsequent alcohol consumption by SUS rats was markedly reduced, indicating that SUS rats consume large amounts of alcohol because of rewarding physiological consequences requiring increased VTA-DA activity. The findings reported here are consistent with the view that the influence of alcohol on LC activity leading to changes in VTA-DA activity strongly affects alcohol-mediated reward, and may well be the basis of the proclivity of SUS rats to avidly consume alcohol.",

Immune activation and immunosenescence were examined in CD8+ T lymphocytes (CD3+CD4\u2212CD8+) isolated from intestinal biopsies, axillary lymph nodes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of chronic binge alcohol (CBA)-consuming simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected male rhesus macaques with and without antiretroviral therapy (ART; CBA/ART+, CBA/ART\u2212) and in PBMCs isolated from a cohort of PLWHA. Polychromatic flow cytometry was used to phenotype cells isolated from intestinal biopsies, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood from rhesus macaques and PLWHA. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) identified hazardous alcohol drinking in PLWHA. Viral load was determined by RT-qPCR and telomere length was measured using qPCR.

The meeting focused broadly on inflammatory cell signaling responses in the context of alcohol and alcohol-use disorders, and was divided into four plenary sessions focusing on the gut and liver, lung infections, general systemic effects of alcohol, and neuro-inflammation. One common theme among many talks was the differential roles of macrophages following both chronic and acute alcohol intoxication. Macrophages were shown to play significant roles in regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and viral infection following alcohol exposure in the liver, lungs, adipose tissue, and brain. Other work examined the role of alcohol on disease progression in a variety of pathologies including psoriasis, advanced stage lung disease, and cancer.",

Impairments caused by these changes can persist well into abstinence and have a negative impact on quality of life and job performance, and can increase the probability of relapse. Many of the changes that affect cognitive function appear to involve dysregulation of the mesocortical dopamine system. This includes changes in dopamine release and alterations in dopamine receptor expression and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC). This review summarizes the cellular effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on dopamine release and dopamine receptor function in the PFC with the goal of providing greater understanding of the effects of alcohol-use disorders on the dopamine system and how this relates to deficits in the executive function of the PFC.",

     "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BLA) plays crucial roles in stimulus value coding, as well as drug and alcohol dependence. Ethanol alters synaptic transmission in the BLA, while endocannabinoids (eCBs) produce presynaptic depression at BLA synapses. Recent studies suggest interactions between ethanol and eCBs that have important consequences for alcohol drinking behavior. To determine how ethanol and eCBs interact in the BLA, we examined the physiology and pharmacology of GABAergic synapses onto BLA pyramidal neurons in neurons from young rats. Application of ethanol at concentrations relevant to intoxication increased, in both young and adult animals, the frequency of spontaneous and miniature GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents, indicating a presynaptic site of ethanol action. Ethanol did not potentiate sIPSCs during inhibition of adenylyl cyclase while still exerting its effect during inhibition of protein kinase A. Activation of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1) in the BLA inhibited GABAergic transmission via an apparent presynaptic mechanism, and prevented ethanol potentiation. Surprisingly, ethanol potentiation was also prevented by CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists. Brief depolarization of BLA pyramidal neurons suppressed GABAergic transmission (depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition [DSI]), an effect previously shown to be mediated by postsynaptic eCB release and presynaptic CB1 activation. A CB1-mediated suppression of GABAergic transmission was also produced by combined afferent stimulation at 0.1\u00a0Hz (LFS), and postsynaptic loading with the eCB arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA). Both DSI and LFS-induced synaptic depression were prevented by ethanol. Our findings indicate antagonistic interactions between ethanol and eCB/CB1 modulation at GABAergic BLA synapses that may contribute to eCB roles in ethanol seeking and drinking.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders are chronically relapsing conditions characterized by persistent drinking despite the negative impact on one's life. The difficulty of achieving and maintaining sobriety suggests that current treatments fail to fully address the underlying causes of alcohol use disorders. Identifying additional pathways controlling alcohol consumption may uncover novel targets for medication development to improve treatment options. One family of proteins recently implicated in the regulation of alcohol consumption is the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). As an integral component in the regulation of the second messengers cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, and thus their cognate signaling pathways, PDEs present intriguing targets for pharmacotherapies to combat alcohol use disorders. As activation of cAMP/cGMP-dependent signaling cascades can dampen alcohol intake, PDE inhibitors may provide a novel target for reducing excessive alcohol consumption, as has been proposed for PDE4 and PDE10A. This review highlights preclinical literature demonstrating the involvement of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling in neuronal and behavioral responses to alcohol, as well as detailing the capacity of various PDE inhibitors to modulate alcohol intake. Together these data provide a framework for evaluating the potential utility of PDE inhibitors as novel treatments for alcohol use disorders.",

     "abstract": "Addiction, or substance use disorder (SUD), is a devastating psychiatric disease composed of multiple elemental features. As a biobehavioral disorder, escalation of drug and/or alcohol intake is both a cause and consequence of molecular neuroadaptations in central brain reinforcement circuitry. Multiple mesolimbic areas mediate a host of negative affective and motivational symptoms that appear to be central to the addiction process. Brain stress- and reinforcement-related regions such as the central amygdala (CeA), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and nucleus accumbens (NAc) also serve as central processors of ascending nociceptive input. We hypothesize that a sensitization of brain mechanisms underlying the processing of persistent and maladaptive pain contributes to a composite negative affective state to drive the enduring, relapsing nature of addiction, particularly in the case of alcohol and opioid use disorder. At the neurochemical level, pain activates central stress-related neuropeptide signaling, including the dynorphin and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and by this process may facilitate negative affect and escalated drug and alcohol use over time. Importantly, the widespread prevalence of unresolved pain and associated affective dysregulation in clinical populations highlights the need for more effective analgesic medications with reduced potential for tolerance and dependence. The burgeoning epidemic of prescription opioid abuse also demands a closer investigation into the neurobiological mechanisms of how pain treatment could potentially represent a significant risk factor for addiction in vulnerable populations. Finally, the continuing convergence of sensory and affective neuroscience fields is expected to generate insight into the critical balance between pain relief and addiction liability, as well as provide more effective therapeutic strategies for chronic pain and addiction.",

Altered glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in these areas following excessive alcohol exposure is postulated to mediate the transition from recreational drinking to dependence, as well as the manifestation of a host of cognitive and neurological deficits. Specifically, a bidirectional regulation of stress systems by glucocorticoids leads to the development of an HPA axis tolerance and a concomitant sensitization of cortical and subcortical circuitries. A greater understanding of how hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic glucocorticoid systems interact to mediate excessive drinking and related pathologies will lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and closely related comorbidities.",

     "abstract": "The onset of puberty is the result of the increased secretion of hypothalamic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The pubertal process can be altered by substances that can affect the prepubertal secretion of this peptide. Alcohol is one such substance known to diminish LHRH secretion and delay the initiation of puberty. The increased secretion of LHRH that normally occurs at the time of puberty is due to a decrease of inhibitory tone that prevails prior to the onset of puberty, as well as an enhanced development of excitatory inputs to the LHRH secretory system. Additionally, it has become increasingly clear that glial-neuronal communications are important for pubertal development because they play an integral role in facilitating the pubertal rise in LHRH secretion. Thus, in recent years attempts have been made to identify specific glial-derived components that contribute to the development of coordinated communication networks between glia and LHRH cell bodies, as well as their nerve terminals. Transforming growth factor-\u03b1 and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 are two such glial substances that have received attention in this regard. This review summarizes the use of multiple neuroendocrine research techniques employed to assess these glial-neuronal communication pathways involved in regulating prepubertal LHRH secretion and the effects that alcohol can have on their respective functions.",

The present study aimed at exploring these neuropsychological deficits in alcohol-use disorders (AUD) in an Indian population using the Postgraduate Institute Battery of Brain Dysfunction (PGIBBD) and their possible correlation with alterations in T2 relaxation times (T2-RT), using whole-brain voxel-based relaxometry (VBR) and conventional region of interest (ROI) approach. Multi-echo T2 mapping sequence was performed on 25 subjects with AUD and 25 healthy controls matched for age, education, and socioeconomic status. Whole-brain T2-RT measurements were conducted using VBR and conventional ROI approach. The study was carried out on a 3T whole-body MR scanner. Post processing for VBR and ROI analysis was performed using SPM 8 software and vendor-provided software, respectively. A PGIBBD test battery was conducted on all subjects to assess their cognitive abilities, and the results were reported as raw scores. VBR and ROI results revealed that AUD subjects showed prolonged T2-RTs in cerebellum bilaterally, parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally, right anterior cingulate cortex, left superior temporal gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, and left calcarine gyrus. A significant correlation was also observed between the neuropsychological test raw scores and alterations in T2-RT in AUD subjects. Our results are consistent with previous studies suggesting tissue disruption or gliosis or demyelination as a possible reason for prolonged T2-RTs. This damage to brain tissue, which is evident as prolonged T2-RT, could possibly be associated with impaired cognitive abilities noticeable in AUD subjects.",

Cardiac orienting responses (ORs) during a habituation/dishabituation learning paradigm were obtained from 6 to 12 month-olds to assess neurophysiological encoding and memory. Women who differed in prenatal alcohol use were recruited during pregnancy and assigned to a group (No study-provided supplements, multivitamin/mineral supplement, or multivitamin/mineral supplement plus choline supplement). Heart rate was collected for 30 s prior to stimulus onset and 12 s post-stimulus onset. Difference values (\u2206HR) for the first 3 trials of each condition were aggregated for analysis. Gestational blood samples were collected to assess maternal nutritional status and changes as a function of the intervention. Choline supplementation resulted in a greater \u2206HR on the visual habituation trials for all infants and for the infants with no PAE on the dishabituation trials. The latency of the response was reduced in both conditions for all infants whose mothers received choline supplementation. Change in gestational choline level was positively related to \u2206HR during habituation trials and levels of one choline metabolite, dimethylglycine (DMG), predicted \u2206HR during habituation trials and latency of responses. A trend was found between DMG and \u2206HR on the dishabituation trials and latency of the response. Supplementation did not affect ORs to auditory stimuli. Choline supplementation when administered together with routinely recommended multivitamin/mineral prenatal supplements during pregnancy may provide a beneficial impact to basic learning mechanisms involved in encoding and memory of environmental events in alcohol-exposed pregnancies as well as non- or low alcohol-exposed pregnancies. Changes in maternal nutrient status suggested that one mechanism by which choline supplementation may positively impact brain development is through prevention of fetal alcohol-related depletion of DMG, a metabolic nutrient that can protect against overproduction of glycine, during critical periods of neurogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Losing a job or significant other are examples of incentive loss that result in negative emotional reactions. The occurrence of negative life events is associated with increased drinking (Keyes, Hatzenbuehler, & Hasin, 2011). Further, certain genotypes are more likely to drink alcohol in response to stressful negative life events (Blomeyer et\u00a0al., 2008; Covault et\u00a0al., 2007). Shared genetic factors may contribute to alcohol drinking and emotional reactivity, but this relationship is not currently well understood. We used an incentive downshift paradigm to address whether emotional reactivity is elevated in mice predisposed to drink alcohol. We also investigated if ethanol drinking is influenced in High Alcohol Preferring mice that had been exposed to an incentive downshift. Incentive downshift procedures have been widely utilized to model emotional reactivity, and involve shifting a high reward group to a low reward and comparing the shifted group to a consistently rewarded control group. Here, we show that replicate lines of selectively bred High Alcohol Preferring mice exhibited larger successive negative contrast effects than their corresponding replicate Low Alcohol Preferring lines, providing strong evidence for a genetic association between alcohol drinking and susceptibility to the emotional effects of negative contrast. These mice can be used to study the shared neurological and genetic underpinnings of emotional reactivity and alcohol preference. Unexpectedly, an incentive downshift suppressed ethanol drinking immediately following an incentive downshift. This could be due to a specific effect of negative contrast on ethanol consumption or a suppressive effect on consummatory behavior in general. These data suggest that either alcohol intake does not provide the anticipated negative reinforcement, or that a single test was insufficient for animals to learn to drink following incentive downshift. However, the emotional intensity following incentive downshift provides initial evidence that this type of emotional reactivity may be a predisposing factor in alcoholism.",

In the present work, we have studied the effect of chronic ethanol exposure during pregnancy and lactation on the phosphorylating system associated with the astrocytic and neuronal intermediate filament (IF) proteins: glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament (NF) subunits of low, medium, and high molecular weight (NFL, NFM, and NFH, respectively) in 9- and 21-day-old pups. Female rats were fed with 20% ethanol in their drinking water during pregnancy and lactation. The homeostasis of the IF phosphorylation was not altered in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus of 9-day-old pups. However, GFAP, NFL, and NFM were hyperphosphorylated in the hippocampus of 21-day-old pups. PKA had been activated in the hippocampus, and Ser55 in the N-terminal region of NFL was hyperphosphorylated. In addition, JNK/MAPK was activated and KSP repeats in the C-terminal region of NFM were hyperphosphorylated in the hippocampus of 21-day-old pups. Decreased NFH immunocontent but an unaltered total NFH/phosphoNFH ratio suggested altered stoichiometry of NFs in the hippocampus of ethanol-exposed 21-day-old pups. In contrast to the high susceptibility of hippocampal cytoskeleton in developing rats, the homeostasis of the cytoskeleton of ethanol-fed adult females was not altered. Disruption of the cytoskeletal homeostasis in neural cells supports the view that regions of the brain are differentially vulnerable to alcohol insult during pregnancy and lactation, suggesting that modulation of JNK/MAPK and PKA signaling cascades target the hippocampal cytoskeleton in a window of vulnerability in 21-day-old pups. Our findings are relevant, since disruption of the cytoskeleton in immature hippocampus could contribute to later hippocampal damage associated with ethanol toxicity.",

Additional objective indicators are needed to help identify the broader spectrum of children affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Computed tomography (CT) was used in a sheep model of prenatal binge alcohol exposure to test the hypothesis that quantitative measures of craniofacial bone volumes and linear distances could identify alcohol-exposed lambs. Pregnant sheep were randomly assigned to four groups: heavy binge alcohol, 2.5\u00a0g/kg/day (HBA); binge alcohol, 1.75\u00a0g/kg/day (BA); saline control (SC); and normal control (NC). Intravenous alcohol (BA; HBA) or saline (SC) infusions were given three consecutive days per week from gestation day 4\u201341, and a CT scan was performed on postnatal day 182. The volumes of eight skull bones, cranial circumference, and 19 linear measures of the face and skull were compared among treatment groups. Lambs from both alcohol groups showed significant reduction in seven of the eight skull bones and total skull bone volume, as well as cranial circumference. Alcohol exposure also decreased four of the 19 craniofacial measures. Discriminant analysis showed that alcohol-exposed and control lambs could be classified with high accuracy based on total skull bone volume, frontal, parietal, or mandibular bone volumes, cranial circumference, or interorbital distance. Total skull volume was significantly more sensitive than cranial circumference in identifying the alcohol-exposed lambs when alcohol-exposed lambs were classified using the typical FAS diagnostic cutoff of \u226410th percentile. This first demonstration of the usefulness of CT-derived craniofacial measures in a sheep model of FASD following binge-like alcohol exposure during the first trimester suggests that volumetric measurement of cranial bones may be a novel biomarker for binge alcohol exposure during the first trimester to help identify non-dysmorphic children with FASD.",

     "abstract": "Sprague\u2013Dawley rats selectively-bred for susceptibility to stress in our laboratory (Susceptible, or SUS rats) voluntarily consume large amounts of alcohol, and amounts that have, as shown here, pharmacological effects, which normal rats will not do. In this paper, we explore neural events in the brain that underlie this propensity to readily consume alcohol. Activity of locus coeruleus neurons (LC), the major noradrenergic cell body concentration in the brain, influences firing of ventral tegmentum dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic system (VTA-DA neurons), which mediate rewarding aspects of alcohol. We tested the hypothesis that in SUS rats alcohol potently suppresses LC activity to markedly diminish LC-mediated inhibition of VTA-DA neurons, which permits alcohol to greatly increase VTA-DA activity and rewarding aspects of alcohol. Electrophysiological single-unit recording of LC and VTA-DA activity showed that in SUS rats alcohol decreased LC burst firing much more than in normal rats and as a result markedly increased VTA-DA activity in SUS rats while having no such effect in normal rats. Consistent with this, in a behavioral test for reward using conditioned place preference (CPP), SUS rats showed alcohol, given by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, to be rewarding. Next, manipulation of LC activity by microinfusion of drugs into the LC region of SUS rats showed that (a) decreasing LC activity increased alcohol intake and increasing LC activity decreased alcohol intake in accord with the formulation described above, and (b) increasing LC activity blocked both the rewarding effect of alcohol in the CPP test and the usual alcohol-induced increase in VTA-DA single-unit activity seen in SUS rats. An important ancillary finding in the CPP test was that an increase in LC activity was rewarding by itself, while a decrease in LC activity was aversive; consequently, effects of LC manipulations on alcohol-related reward in the CPP test were perhaps even larger than evident in the test. Finally, when increased LC activity was associated with (i.e., conditioned to) i.p. alcohol, subsequent alcohol consumption by SUS rats was markedly reduced, indicating that SUS rats consume large amounts of alcohol because of rewarding physiological consequences requiring increased VTA-DA activity. The findings reported here are consistent with the view that the influence of alcohol on LC activity leading to changes in VTA-DA activity strongly affects alcohol-mediated reward, and may well be the basis of the proclivity of SUS rats to avidly consume alcohol.",

The most common drinking pattern in the United States is binge drinking, where an individual rapidly consumes alcoholic beverages (4 for women, 5 for men) in 2\u00a0h. An estimated 38 million Americans binge drink, often several times per month. Experimental data demonstrate that a single binge-ethanol exposure, prior to scald injury, impairs innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby enhancing infection susceptibility and amplifying pulmonary inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and edema, and is associated with increased mortality. Since these characteristics are similar to those observed in ARDS burn patients, our study objective was to determine whether ethanol intoxication and burn injury and the subsequent pulmonary congestion affect physiological parameters of lung function, using non-invasive and unrestrained plethysmography in a murine model system. Furthermore, to mirror young adult binge-drinking patterns, and to determine the effect of multiple ethanol exposures on pulmonary inflammation, we utilized an episodic binge-ethanol exposure regimen, where mice were exposed to ethanol for a total of 6 days (3 days ethanol, 4 days rest, 3 days ethanol) prior to burn injury. Our analyses demonstrate mice exposed to episodic binge ethanol and burn injury have higher mortality, increased pulmonary congestion and neutrophil infiltration, elevated neutrophil chemoattractants, and respiratory dysfunction, compared to burn or ethanol intoxication alone. Overall, our study identifies plethysmography as a useful tool for characterizing respiratory function in a murine burn model and for future identification of therapeutic compounds capable of restoring pulmonary functionality.",

In these efforts, the activity of adult zebrafish is typically quantified using indirect activity measures that are either scored manually or identified automatically from the fish trajectory. The analysis of such activity measures has produced important insight into the effect of acute ethanol exposure on individual and social behavior of this vertebrate species. Here, we leverage a recently developed tracking algorithm that reconstructs fish body shape to investigate the effect of acute ethanol administration on zebrafish tail-beat motion in terms of amplitude and frequency. Our results demonstrate a significant effect of ethanol on the tail-beat amplitude as well as the tail-beat frequency, both of which were found to robustly decrease for high ethanol concentrations. Such a direct measurement of zebrafish motor functions is in agreement with evidence based on indirect activity measures, offering a complementary perspective in behavioral screening.",

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the locomotor activities of AB strain zebrafish larvae at 5 and 7 days post-fertilization (dpf) in response to light changes under the influence of ethanol, and to explore potential neurological mechanisms that are involved in ethanol intoxication. AB strain zebrafish larvae at both 5 and 7 dpf were treated with ethanol at 0% (control), 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2% (v/v%). The locomotor activities of the larvae during alternating light\u2013dark challenges, as well as the locomotor responses immediately following the light transitions, were investigated. The levels of various neurotransmitters were also measured in selected ethanol-treated groups. The larvae at 5 and 7 dpf demonstrated similar patterns of locomotor responses to ethanol treatment. Ethanol treatment at 1% increased the swimming distances of the zebrafish larvae in the dark periods, but had no effect on the swimming distances in the light periods. In contrast, ethanol treatment at 2% increased the swimming distances in the light periods, but did not potentiate the swimming activity in the dark periods, compared to controls. Differences in the levels of neurotransmitters that are involved in norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin pathways were also observed in groups with different ethanol treatments. These results indicated the behavioral studies concerning the ethanol effects on locomotor activities of zebrafish larvae could be carried out as early as 5 dpf. The 1% and 2% ethanol-treated zebrafish larvae modeled ethanol effects at different intoxication states, and the differences in neurotransmitter levels suggested the involvement of various neurotransmitter pathways in different ethanol intoxication states.",

Sprague\u2013Dawley rats pretreated with thymol (10\u00a0mg/kg body weight) or normal saline were subjected to intragastric administration of 95% ethanol (5\u00a0mL/kg body weight).

Gelatinase zymography of tissue extract and in situ zymography were performed to demonstrate MMP-9 activity. Results of macroscopic examination suggested that thymol significantly protected gastric mucosa from damage induced by alcohol, which was severe in the case of alcohol-only treatment. H&E data demonstrated necrosis of the corpus region in alcohol-treated rats, which was abrogated in rats pretreated with thymol. Further, thymol protected against the constriction of small arteries and neutrophil infiltration in lymphatic vessels. Expression of antioxidant enzymes increased in the thymol-pretreated group, and downregulation of MMP-9 protein expression was observed by gelatin zymography as well as in situ zymography. The results of this study suggest that thymol protects against gastric mucosa injury induced by ethanol consumption by upregulating the secretion of antioxidant enzymes and downregulating the expression of the MMP-9 protein.",

     "abstract": "Sensitivity to the interoceptive effects of alcohol is blunted following a period of exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT), an effect that is suggested to be related, in part, to glutamatergic neuroadaptations. Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (subtypes 2 and 3; mGluR2/3) modulate several drug- and alcohol-related behaviors, including the interoceptive (discriminative stimulus) effects of alcohol. Therefore, we sought to determine if manipulation of mGluR2/3 would restore sensitivity to the interoceptive effects of alcohol following CORT exposure. Using a two-lever drug discrimination task, male Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate alcohol (1\u00a0g/kg, intragastric [IG]) vs. water. First, the effect of mGluR2/3 antagonism on the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol was determined using LY341495 (0.3\u20133.0\u00a0mg/kg; intraperitoneal [IP]). Next, the effects of mGluR2/3 antagonism and activation were assessed in discrimination-trained animals exposed to CORT (300\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in the home cage drinking water or water only, for 7 days. Following CORT exposure, decreased sensitivity to alcohol (1\u00a0g/kg) was observed. Pretreatment with the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (1.0\u20133.0\u00a0mg/kg; IP), but not the mGluR2/3 antagonist (0.3\u20131.0\u00a0mg/kg; IP), restored sensitivity to alcohol. Additionally, in water controls, mGluR2/3 antagonism and mGluR2/3 activation disrupted expression of the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol. Together, these findings suggest that blunted sensitivity to the interoceptive effects of alcohol following an episode of heightened stress hormone levels may be due to adaptations in mGluR2/3-related systems. The ability of mGluR2/3 activation to restore sensitivity to alcohol under these conditions lends further support for the importance of these receptors under stress-related conditions.",

     "abstract": "In murine models of alcoholism, the glutamate receptor scaffolding protein Homer2 bidirectionally regulates alcohol intake. Although chronic alcohol drinking increases Homer2 expression within the core subregion of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of alcohol-preferring P rats, the relevance of this neuroadaptation for alcohol intake has yet to be determined in rats. Thus, the present study employed an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) strategy to over-express and knock down the major rodent isoform Homer2b within the NAc of both P and outbred Wistar rats to examine for changes in alcohol preference and intake (0\u201330% v/v) under continuous-access procedures. The generalization of AAV effects to non-drug, palatable, sweet solutions was also determined in tests of sucrose (0\u20135% w/v) and saccharin (0\u20130.125% w/v) intake/preference. No net-flux in\u00a0vivo microdialysis was conducted for glutamate in the NAc to relate Homer2-dependent changes in alcohol intake to extracellular levels of glutamate. Line differences were noted for sweet solution preference and intake, but these variables were not affected by intra-NAc AAV infusion in either line. In contrast, Homer2b over-expression elevated, while Homer2b knock-down reduced, alcohol intake in both lines, and this effect was greatest at the highest concentration. Strikingly, in P rats there was a direct association between changes in Homer2b expression and NAc extracellular glutamate levels, but this effect was not seen in Wistar rats. These data indicate that NAc Homer2b expression actively regulates alcohol consumption by rats, paralleling this previous observation in mice. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of mesocorticolimbic glutamate activity in alcohol abuse/dependence and suggest that Homer2b and/or its constituents may serve as molecular targets for the treatment of these disorders.",

     "publication date": "09-2015",
     "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying ethanol self-administration are not fully understood; however, it is clear that ethanol self-administration stimulates nucleus accumbens dopamine release in well-trained animals. During operant sweetened ethanol self-administration behavior, an adaptation in the nucleus accumbens dopamine system occurs between the first and second exposure, paralleling a dramatic increase in sweetened ethanol intake, which suggests a single exposure to sweetened ethanol may be sufficient to learn the association between sweetened ethanol cues and its reinforcing properties. In the present experiment, we test the effects of blockade of nucleus accumbens dopamine D1 receptors on operant sweetened ethanol self-administration behavior during the first 2 days of exposure. Adult male Long-Evans rats were first trained to self-administer 10% sucrose (10S) across 6 days in an appetitive and consummatory operant model (appetitive interval: 10-min pre-drinking wait period and a lever response requirement of 4; consummatory interval: 20-min access to the drinking solution). After training on 10S, the drinking solution was switched to 10% sucrose plus 10% ethanol (10S10E); control rats continued drinking 10S throughout the experiment. Bilateral nucleus accumbens microinjections of the dopamine D1 antagonist, SCH-23390 (0, 1.0, or 3.0\u00a0\u03bcg/side), immediately preceded the first two sessions of drinking 10S10E. Results show that blocking nucleus accumbens dopamine D1 receptors has little or no influence on consumption during the first 2 days of exposure to the sweetened ethanol solution or maintenance of sucrose-only drinking. Furthermore, the high dose of SCH-23390, 3.0\u00a0\u03bcg/side, reduced open-field locomotor activity. In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest that nucleus accumbens D1 receptor activation is involved in consumption of a sweetened ethanol solution during the first 2 days of exposure or maintenance of sucrose drinking, but rather D1 receptors seem necessary for general locomotor activity that contributes to initiation of appetitive behavior.",

     "abstract": "Individuals suffering from an alcohol-use disorder (AUD) constitute a major health concern. Preclinical studies in our laboratory show that acute and chronic intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of ivermectin (IVM) reduces alcohol intake and preference in mice. To enable clinical investigation to use IVM for the treatment of an AUD, development of an oral formulation that can be used in animals as well as long-term preclinical toxicology studies are required. The present work explores the use of a promising alternative dosage form of IVM, fast-dissolving oral films (Cure Pharmaceutical\u00ae), to test the efficacy and safety of oral IVM in conjunction with alcohol exposure. We tested the effect of IVM (0.21\u00a0mg) using a fast-dissolving oral film delivery method on reducing 10% v/v alcohol (10E) intake in female C57BL/6 mice using a 24-h access two-bottle choice paradigm for 6 weeks (5 days per week). Differences in ethanol intake, preference for ethanol, water intake, fluid intake, food intake, changes in mouse and organ weights, as well as histological changes to kidney, liver, and brain were analyzed. The IVM group drank significantly less ethanol over the 30-day period compared to the placebo (blank strip) and the no-treatment groups. Organ weights did not differ between the groups. Histological evaluation showed no differences in the brain and kidney between groups. In the liver, there was a slight increase in the incidence of microvesicular fatty and degenerative changes of the animals receiving the thin strips. No overt hepatocellular necrosis or perivascular inflammation was noted. Overall, these data support the use of this novel method of oral drug delivery for longer-term studies and should facilitate FDA required preclinical testing that is necessary to repurpose IVM for treatment of an AUD.",

     "abstract": "Long Fixed-Interval (FI) schedules, particularly second-order schedules, can engender substantial responding before drug or ethanol delivery that is uninfluenced by the direct effects of the drug or ethanol. Thus, these schedules can be used to study the effects of medications upon drug- or ethanol-seeking, uninfluenced by the direct effects of the self-administered drug or ethanol. Long FI second-order schedules are frequently used in primates and occasionally in rats. Under second-order schedules, completion of one response requirement, e.g., a Fixed Ratio 10 (FR10:S), produces a brief stimulus presentation, e.g., a 1-s 80-dB 4-kHZ tone, and this FR10:S serves as the response unit under another schedule, e.g., an FI 1800-s. Thus, the first FR10 completed after 1800\u00a0s would result in delivery both of the tone and of reinforcement, e.g., 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a00.01\u00a0mL 16% (w/v) ethanol. To examine if such schedules could be effectively used in mice, which have advantages in neurobiological and genetic studies, we trained eight C57BL/6J mice to respond under the schedule just described. This schedule maintained substantial responding. The temporal pattern of behavior was typical of an FI schedule with responding accelerating across the interval. We also examined the effects of acute and chronic administration of fluvoxamine on this responding, and these were modest. Finally, we examined responding when alcohol and/or tone deliveries were withheld, and found that extinction occurred most rapidly when both were withheld. This work demonstrates that long FI schedules of ethanol delivery may be useful in studying ethanol seeking in mice.",

Rodent models have shown that early postnatal treatments, which mimic ethanol toxicity in the third trimester of human pregnancy, acutely induce widespread apoptotic neuronal degeneration and permanent behavioral deficits. However, the lasting cellular and anatomical effects of early ethanol treatments are still incompletely understood. This study examined changes in neocortex volume, thickness, and cellular organization that persist in adult mice after postnatal day 7 (P7) ethanol treatment. Post mortem brain volumes, measured by both MRI within the skull and by fluid displacement of isolated brains, were reduced 10\u201313% by ethanol treatment. The cerebral cortex showed a similar reduction (12%) caused mainly by lower surface area (9%). In spite of these large changes, several features of cortical organization showed little evidence of change, including cortical thickness, overall neuron size, and laminar organization. Estimates of total neuron number showed a trend level reduction of about 8%, due mainly to reduced cortical volume but unchanged neuron density. However, counts of calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV) subtypes of GABAergic neurons showed a striking >30% reduction of neuron number. Similar ethanol effects were found in male and female mice, and in C57BL/6By and BALB/cJ mouse strains. Our findings indicate that the cortex has substantial capacity to develop normal cytoarchitectonic organization after early postnatal ethanol toxicity, but there is a selective and persistent reduction of GABA cells that may contribute to the lasting cognitive and behavioral deficits in FASD.",

The current research extends previous research on the role of interpersonal perception by examining how partner drinking and perceiving one's partner's drinking as problematic are associated with subsequent marital outcomes. Specifically, we evaluated how perceiving one's partner to have a drinking problem was associated with marital functioning, and whether that association differed based on the partner's actual drinking. Married couples (N\u00a0=\u00a0123 dyads) with at least one spouse who consumed alcohol regularly completed measures of alcohol use and consequences, the perception that their spouse's drinking was problematic, and marital adjustment (i.e., relationship satisfaction, commitment, and trust). Results from actor-partner interdependence models using structural equations modeling indicated that for husbands, partner heavy drinking was associated with lower adjustment. Additionally, for husbands, perceiving their spouse had a drinking problem was associated with lower adjustment for both themselves and their wives. Moreover, significant interactions between partner drinking and the perception of partner drinking problem on marital adjustment emerged. Specifically, perceiving one's partner's drinking as a problem was only negatively associated with relationship adjustment if the partner reported higher levels of heavy drinking. This pattern was stronger for husbands. Results illustrate the importance of interpersonal perception, gender differences, and the use of dyadic data to model the complex dynamic between spouses with regard to alcohol use and how it affects relationship outcomes.",

Fasted male Wistar rats received a single force-feeding of glucose plus ethanol or isocaloric glucose. At different times after force-feeding (0\u201310\u00a0h), glycogen repletion and ATP characteristics (content, apparent catalytic time constant, mitochondrial turnover) were monitored by 13C- or 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in perfused and isolated liver. In\u00a0vivo glycogen repletion after force-feeding was slower after glucose plus ethanol vs. glucose (12.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.68 and 8.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86\u00a0\u03bcmol/h/g liver wet weight [ww], respectively), reaching a maximum at the 6th hour.

The sensitivities of other biomarkers were comparable (5\u201320%) to hEtG but specificities were higher (98\u2013100%). Hair EtG sensitivity improved when combined with other biomarkers, especially with GGT (32.5%) and PEth (27.5%). In addition, validity of hEtG improved in patients with less frequent shampooing and those who did not use hair dyes/chemical treatments. These data suggest that hEtG alone is not a sufficiently sensitive or specific biomarker to be used separately for the identification of PAE, but might be useful in a battery along with other maternal biomarkers.",

The meeting theme was titled \u201cLow drinking versus no drinking: Matching science with policy and public perception.\u201d Despite decades of basic science and clinical evidence that has documented the risks associated with prenatal alcohol exposure, there still exists confusion and uncertainty on the part of health professionals and the public regarding the question of whether or not there is a \u201csafe\u201d level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The first keynote presentation reviewed the data obtained from large-scale epidemiological studies that have attempted to address the question of relative risk associated with low to moderate alcohol exposure during pregnancy. This presentation was followed by an expert panel discussion of the state of scientific evidence obtained from clinical and basic science investigations concerning this question, and strategies for moving research evidence into policy and practice. The second keynote presentation presented a framework for knowledge translation and mobilization to move research discoveries toward implementation. The conference also featured updates by government agencies, FASt data talks that highlighted new and innovative findings in FASD research, and award presentations, including a lifetime achievement award presented to Dr. Kenneth Warren to acknowledge his longstanding support for FASD research. A highlight of the meeting was the presentation of the 2014 Henry Rosett award to Dr. Philip May in recognition of his substantial contributions to epidemiological studies on FASD.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol-use disorder (AUD) is prevalent and associated with substantial socioeconomic costs. While heritability estimates of AUD are \u223c50%, identifying specific gene variants associated with risk for AUD has proven challenging despite considerable investment. Emerging research into heritability of complex diseases has implicated transmission of epigenetic variants in the development of behavioral phenotypes, including drug preference and drug-induced behavior. Several recent rodent studies have specifically focused on paternal transmission of epigenetic variants, which is especially relevant because sires are not present for offspring rearing and changes to offspring phenotype are assumed to result from modifications to the sperm epigenome. While considerable interest in paternal transmission of epigenetic variants has emerged recently, paternal alcohol exposures have been studied for 30+ years with interesting behavioral and physiologic effects noted on offspring. However, only recently, with improvements in technology to identify epigenetic modifications in germ cells, has it been possible to identify mechanisms by which paternal ethanol exposure alters offspring behavior. This review presents an overview of epigenetic inheritance in the context of paternal ethanol exposure and suggests future studies to identify specific effects of paternal ethanol exposure on offspring behavior and response to ethanol.",

Little is known about the nature of this relationship in the context of comorbid AUD and depression disorders. In this study, we determined brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum levels in patients with AUD and tested whether BDNF levels were related to history of major depression, recent depressive symptoms, AUD severity, and TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 levels. Nepalese male AUD inpatients (N\u00a0=\u00a0152) abstinent from alcohol for an average of 34 days were administered structured interviews to assess depression symptoms and pattern and extent of alcohol use, and to generate research diagnoses for AUD and MD. AUD severity was assessed by scores on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. Serum BDNF and cytokines were measured using ELISA and multiplex technology, respectively. Although serum BDNF levels were unrelated to MD history, patients with recent depressive symptoms (n\u00a0=\u00a042) had lower (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) BDNF serum levels compared to those without (n\u00a0=\u00a0110) (21.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1\u00a0ng/mL vs. 26.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6\u00a0ng/mL; p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), and patients with higher AUD severity and binge-drinking patterns had higher mean serum BDNF levels compared to lower AUD severity and non-binging (25.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7\u00a0ng/mL vs. 22.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7\u00a0ng/mL; p\u00a0=\u00a00.022 and 25.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.3 vs. 21.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7\u00a0ng/mL; p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, respectively).

     "abstract": "Clinical studies demonstrate frequent co-existence of nicotine and alcohol abuse and suggest that this may result, in part, from the ready access to and intake of fat-rich diets. Whereas animal studies show that high-fat diet intake in adults can enhance the consumption of either nicotine or ethanol and that maternal consumption of a fat-rich diet during pregnancy increases operant responding for nicotine in offspring, little is known about the impact of dietary fat on the co-abuse of these two drugs. The goal of this study was to test in Long-Evans rats the effects of perinatal exposure to fat on the co-use of nicotine and ethanol, using a novel paradigm that involves simultaneous intravenous (IV) self-administration of these two drugs. Fat- vs. chow-exposed offspring were characterized and compared, first in terms of their nicotine self-administration behavior, then in terms of their nicotine/ethanol self-administration behavior, and lastly in terms of their self-administration of ethanol in the absence of nicotine. The results demonstrate that maternal consumption of fat compared to low-fat chow during gestation and lactation significantly stimulates nicotine self-administration during fixed-ratio testing. It also increases nicotine/ethanol self-administration during fixed-ratio and dose-response testing, with BEC elevated to 120\u00a0mg/dL, and causes an increase in breakpoint during progressive ratio testing. Of particular note is the finding that rats perinatally exposed to fat self-administer significantly more of the nicotine/ethanol mixture as compared to nicotine alone, an effect not evident in the chow-control rats. After removal of nicotine from the nicotine/ethanol mixture, this difference between the fat- and chow-exposed rats was lost, with both groups failing to acquire the self-administration of ethanol alone. Together, these findings suggest that perinatal exposure to a fat-rich diet, in addition to stimulating self-administration of nicotine, causes an even greater vulnerability to the excessive co-use of nicotine and ethanol.",

College students (N\u00a0=\u00a0429) completed a baseline survey and were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Negative (write about a heavy drinking event that was negative); Positive (write about a heavy drinking event that was positive); or Neutral (write about their first day of college). After writing, readiness to change and future drinking intentions were assessed. Results revealed intervention effects on intended drinks per week and intended number of drinks during peak and typical drinking occasions. Participants in the negative condition also displayed higher levels of event-related guilt and shame. Results showed that guilt mediated intervention effects on readiness to change, which also mediated the association between guilt-reparative behavior and drinking intentions. Results provide initial support for an expressive writing intervention on alcohol use and underscore the importance of eliciting emotions associated with reparative behavior when considering negative past experiences and future behavior change.",

We investigated the effect of ethanol (1\u00a0g/kg) on BP and heart rate (HR) responses elicited by systemic bolus (125\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, intra-venous [i.v.]) or infused (180\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/min) NMDA in conscious male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats.

Ethanol attenuated the peripheral NMDAR-mediated pressor and bradycardic responses caused by NMDA infusion, and ex\u00a0vivo studies revealed parallel ethanol attenuation of peripheral NMDAR-mediated increases in vascular ROS. While ethanol (1 or 1.5\u00a0g/kg) alone had no effect on BP, the higher dose caused a hypotensive response in the presence of NMDAR blockade (AP-5). Blood ethanol concentrations were not statistically different in the groups that received ethanol alone or along with NMDA or AP-5. These findings are the first to demonstrate ethanol attenuation of peripheral NMDAR-mediated pressor response, and the uncovering of ethanol-evoked hypotension in the presence of peripheral NMDAR blockade.",

Past research in our laboratory has indicated that peri-adolescent ethanol consumption can enhance the acquisition and reduce the rate of extinction of ethanol self-administration in adulthood. Caveats of the past research include reinforcer specificity, increased oral consumption during peri-adolescence, and a lack of quantitative assessment of the reinforcing properties of ethanol. The current experiments were designed to determine the effects of peri-adolescent ethanol or saccharin drinking on acquisition and extinction of oral ethanol self-administration and ethanol seeking, and to quantitatively assess the reinforcing properties of ethanol (progressive ratio). Ethanol or saccharin access by alcohol-preferring (P) rats occurred during postnatal day (PND) 30\u201360. Animals began operant self-administration of ethanol or saccharin after PND 85. After 10 weeks of daily operant self-administration, rats were tested in a progressive ratio paradigm. Two weeks later, self-administration was extinguished in all rats. Peri-adolescent ethanol consumption specifically enhanced the acquisition of ethanol self-administration, reduced the rate of extinction for ethanol self-administration, and quantitatively increased the reinforcing properties of ethanol during adulthood. Peri-adolescent saccharin consumption was without effect. The data indicate that ethanol consumption during peri-adolescence results in neuroadaptations that may specifically enhance the reinforcing properties of ethanol during adulthood. This increase in the reinforcing properties of ethanol could be a part of biological sequelae that are the basis for the effects of adolescent alcohol consumption on the increase in the rate of alcoholism during adulthood.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol is a potent somnogen and one of the most commonly used \u201cover the counter\u201d sleep aids. In healthy non-alcoholics, acute alcohol decreases sleep latency, consolidates and increases the quality (delta power) and quantity of NREM sleep during the first half of the night. However, sleep is disrupted during the second half. Alcoholics, both during drinking periods and during abstinences, suffer from a multitude of sleep disruptions manifested by profound insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and altered sleep architecture. Furthermore, subjective and objective indicators of sleep disturbances are predictors of relapse. Finally, within the USA, it is estimated that societal costs of alcohol-related sleep disorders exceeds $18 billion. Thus, although alcohol-associated sleep problems have significant economic and clinical consequences, very little is known about how and where alcohol acts to affect sleep. In this review, we have described our attempts to unravel the mechanism of alcohol-induced sleep disruptions. We have conducted a series of experiments using two different species, rats and mice, as animal models. We performed microdialysis, immunohistochemical, pharmacological, sleep deprivation and lesion studies which suggest that the sleep-promoting effects of alcohol may be mediated via alcohol's action on the mediators of sleep homeostasis: adenosine (AD) and the wake-promoting cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BF). Alcohol, via its action on AD uptake, increases extracellular AD resulting in the inhibition of BF wake-promoting neurons. Since binge alcohol consumption is a highly prevalent pattern of alcohol consumption and disrupts sleep, we examined the effects of binge drinking on sleep-wakefulness. Our results suggest that disrupted sleep homeostasis may be the primary cause of sleep disruption observed following binge drinking. Finally, we have also shown that sleep disruptions observed during acute withdrawal, are caused due to impaired sleep homeostasis. In conclusion, we suggest that alcohol may disrupt sleep homeostasis to cause sleep disruptions.",

This review summarizes the experimental findings indicating bidirectional interactions between alcohol (ethanol) consumption and the circadian timing system, emphasizing behavioral studies conducted in the author's laboratory. Together with convergent evidence from multiple laboratories, the work summarized here establishes that ethanol intake (or administration) alters fundamental properties of the underlying circadian pacemaker. In turn, circadian disruption induced by either environmental or genetic manipulations can alter voluntary ethanol intake. These reciprocal interactions may create a vicious cycle that contributes to the downward spiral of alcohol and drug addiction. In the future, such studies may lead to the development of chronobiologically based interventions to prevent relapse and effectively mitigate some of the societal burden associated with such disorders.",

As such, there may be many individuals that are prescribed lithium to alleviate the manic symptoms of bipolar disorder, but also drink alcohol concurrently. In addition, both alcoholics and individuals with bipolar disorder often exhibit disruptions to their sleep-wake cycles and other circadian rhythms. Interestingly, both ethanol and lithium are known to alter both the period and the phase of free-running rhythms in mammals. While lithium is known to lengthen the period, ethanol seems to shorten the period and attenuate the responses to acute light pulses. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether ethanol and lithium have opposing effects on the circadian pacemaker when administered together. C57BL/6J mice were provided drinking solutions containing lithium, alcohol, or both, and their free-running rhythms along with their response to photic phase shifts were investigated. Mice treated with lithium displayed period lengthening, which was almost completely negated when ethanol was added. Moreover, ethanol significantly attenuated light-induced phase delays while the addition of lithium partially restored this response. These results indicate that alcohol and lithium have opposing effects on behavioral circadian rhythms. Individuals with bipolar disorder who are prescribed lithium and who drink alcohol might be inadvertently altering their sleep and circadian cycles, which may exacerbate their symptoms.",

In parallel to developmental changes in sleep, adolescent brains are undergoing structural and functional changes in the circuits subserving the pursuit and processing of rewards. These developmental changes in reward processing likely contribute to the initiation of alcohol use during adolescence. Abundant evidence indicates that sleep and circadian rhythms modulate reward function, suggesting that adolescent sleep and circadian disturbance may contribute to altered reward function, and in turn, alcohol involvement. In this review, we summarize the relevant evidence and propose that these parallel developmental changes in sleep, circadian rhythms, and neural processing of reward interact to increase risk for alcohol use disorder (AUD).",

     "abstract": "The circadian clock establishes rhythms throughout the body with an approximately 24 hour period that affect expression of hundreds of genes. Epidemiological data reveal chronic circadian misalignment, common in our society, significantly increases the risk for a myriad of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, infertility and gastrointestinal disease. Disruption of intestinal barrier function, also known as gut leakiness, is especially important in alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Several studies have shown that alcohol causes ALD in only a 20\u201330% subset of alcoholics. Thus, a better understanding is needed of why only a subset of alcoholics develops ALD. Compelling evidence shows that increased gut leakiness to microbial products and especially LPS play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALD. Clock and other circadian clock genes have been shown to regulate lipid transport, motility and other gut functions. We hypothesized that one possible mechanism for alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability is through disruption of central or peripheral (intestinal) circadian regulation. In support of this hypothesis, our recent data shows that disruption of circadian rhythms makes the gut more susceptible to injury. Our in vitro data show that alcohol stimulates increased Clock and Per2 circadian clock proteins and that siRNA knockdown of these proteins prevents alcohol-induced permeability. We also show that intestinal Cyp2e1-mediated oxidative stress is required for alcohol-induced upregulation of Clock and Per2 and intestinal hyperpermeability. Our mouse model of chronic alcohol feeding shows that circadian disruption through genetics (in Clock\u25b519 mice) or environmental disruption by weekly 12h phase shifting results in gut leakiness alone and exacerbates alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver pathology. Our data in human alcoholics show they exhibit abnormal melatonin profiles characteristic of circadian disruption. Taken together our data support circadian mechanisms for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new therapeutic targets for ALD.",

     "abstract": "Chronic alcohol consumption contributes to fatty liver disease. Our studies revealed that the hepatic circadian clock is disturbed in alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis, and effects of chronic alcohol administration upon the clock itself may contribute to steatosis. We extended these findings to explore the effects of chronic alcohol treatment on daily feeding and locomotor activity patterns. Mice were chronically pair-fed ad libitum for 4 weeks using the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet, with calorie-controlled liquid and standard chow diets as control groups. Locomotor activity, feeding activity, and real-time bioluminescence recording of PERIOD2::LUCIFERASE expression in tissue explants were measured. Mice on liquid control and chow diets exhibited normal profiles of locomotor activity, with a ratio of 22:78% day/night activity and a peak during early night. This pattern was dramatically altered in alcohol-fed mice, marked by a 49:51% ratio and the absence of a distinct peak. While chow-diet fed mice had a normal 24:76% ratio of feeding activity, with a peak in the early night, this pattern was dramatically altered in both liquid-diet groups: mice had a 43:57% ratio, and an absence of a distinct peak. Temporal differences were also observed between the two liquid-diet groups during late day. Cosinor analysis revealed a \u223c4\u2013h and \u223c6\u2013h shift in the alcohol-fed group feeding and locomotor activity rhythms, respectively. Analysis of hepatic PER2 expression revealed that the molecular clock in alcohol-fed and control liquid-diet mice was shifted by \u223c11\u00a0h and \u223c6\u00a0h, respectively. No differences were observed in suprachiasmatic nucleus explants, suggesting that changes in circadian phase in the liver were generated independently from the central clock. These results suggest that chronic alcohol consumption and a liquid diet can differentially modulate the daily rhythmicity of locomotor and feeding behaviors, aspects that might contribute to disturbances in the circadian timing system and development of hepatic steatosis.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the extent to which recovery in ANS function could be demonstrated over the first 4 months of abstinence. Fifteen alcoholics (7 women) were studied on three occasions: within a month of detoxification, at approximately 2 months post-detox, and at 4 months post-detox. Thirteen control subjects (6 women) were also studied on three occasions with inter-study intervals matching those of the alcoholics. Six alcoholics relapsed, 48.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027.9 days following the initial PSG session. ANS function was assessed in the first part of stable non-rapid eye movement sleep. Frequency-domain power spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) produced variables including: heart rate (HR), total power (TP; an index representing total HR variability), High Frequency power (HFa; an index reflecting cardiac vagal modulation), HF proportion of total power (HFprop sympathovagal balance), and HF peak frequency (HFpf; an index reflecting respiration rate). Overall, high total and high frequency variability and low sympathovagal balance and myocardial contractility are considered as desired conditions to promote cardiovascular health. At initial assessment, alcoholics had a higher HR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and respiratory rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and lower vagal activity (HFa; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) than controls. Alcoholics showed evidence of recovery in HR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) and HFa (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031) with 4 months of abstinence. Alcoholics with higher TP at the initial visit showed a greater improvement in TP from the initial to the 4 month follow-up session (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Alcoholics showed substantial recovery in HR and vagal modulation of HRV with 4 months of abstinence, with evidence that the extent of recovery in HRV may be partially determined by the extent of alcohol dependence-related insult to the cardiac ANS system. These data support other studies showing recovery in a number of ANS, central nervous system, and behavioral domains with abstinence, even in those with long-term dependence.",

     "abstract": "Insomnia in patients with alcohol dependence has increasingly become a target of treatment due to its prevalence, persistence, and associations with relapse and suicidal thoughts, as well as randomized controlled studies demonstrating efficacy with behavior therapies and non-addictive medications. This article focuses on assessing and treating insomnia that persists despite 4 or more weeks of sobriety in alcohol-dependent adults. Selecting among the various options for treatment follows a comprehensive assessment of insomnia and its multifactorial causes. In addition to chronic, heavy alcohol consumption and its effects on sleep regulatory systems, contributing factors include premorbid insomnia; co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and other sleep disorders; use of other substances and medications; stress; environmental factors; and inadequate sleep hygiene. The assessment makes use of history, rating scales, and sleep diaries as well as physical, mental status, and laboratory examinations to rule out these factors. Polysomnography is indicated when another sleep disorder is suspected, such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder, or when insomnia is resistant to treatment. Sobriety remains a necessary, first-line treatment for insomnia, and most patients will have some improvement. If insomnia-specific treatment is needed, then brief behavioral therapies are the treatment of choice, because they have shown long-lasting benefit without worsening of drinking outcomes. Medications work faster, but they generally work only as long as they are taken. Melatonin agonists; sedating antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics; and benzodiazepine receptor agonists each have their benefits and risks, which must be weighed and monitored to optimize outcomes. Some relapse prevention medications may also have sleep-promoting activity. Although it is assumed that treatment for insomnia will help prevent relapse, this has not been firmly established. Therefore, insomnia and alcohol dependence might be best thought of as co-occurring disorders, each of which requires its own treatment.",

Much of the work examining the mechanisms by which the central amygdala mediates the development of alcohol dependence has focused on the interaction of acute and chronic ethanol with central amygdala corticotropin releasing factor signaling. This work has led to a great deal of success in furthering the general understanding of central amygdala neurocircuitry and its role in alcohol dependence. Much of this work has primarily focused on the hypothesis that ethanol utilizes endogenous corticotropin releasing factor signaling to upregulate inhibitory GABAergic transmission in the central amygdala. Work that is more recent suggests that corticotropin releasing factor also plays an important role in mediating anxiety-like behaviors via the enhancement of central amygdala glutamatergic transmission, implying that ethanol/corticotropin releasing factor interactions may modulate excitatory neurotransmission in this brain region. In addition, a number of studies utilizing optogenetic strategies or transgenic mouse lines have begun to examine specific central amygdala neurocircuit dynamics and neuronal subpopulations to better understand overall central amygdala neurocircuitry and the role of neuronal subtypes in mediating anxiety-like behaviors. This review will provide a brief update on this literature and describe some potential future directions that may be important for the development of better treatments for alcohol addiction.",

Among these, only a few have investigated sex differences within this population. The current project examined the behavioral effects of acute low- and moderate-dose alcohol on 62 older (ages 55\u201370) male and female, healthy, light to moderate drinkers. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three dose conditions: placebo (peak breath alcohol concentration [BrAC] of 0\u00a0mg/dL), low (peak BrAC of 40\u00a0mg/dL), and moderate (peak BrAC of 65\u00a0mg/dL). Tasks assessed psychomotor, set-shifting, and working memory performance. Better set-shifting abilities were observed among women, whereas men demonstrated more efficient working memory, regardless of dose. The moderate-dose group did not significantly differ from the placebo group on any task. However, the low-dose group performed better than the moderate-dose group across measures of set shifting and working memory. Relative to the placebo group, the low-dose group exhibited better working memory, specifically for faces. Interestingly, there were no sex by dose interactions. These data suggest that, at least for our study's task demands, low and moderate doses of alcohol do not significantly hinder psychomotor, set-shifting, or working memory performance among older adults. In fact, low-dose alcohol may facilitate certain cognitive abilities. Furthermore, although sex differences in cognitive abilities were observed, these alcohol doses did not differentially affect men and women. Further investigation is necessary to better characterize the effects of sex and alcohol dose on cognition in older adults.",

The acetylcholine neurotransmitter system provides major input to the hippocampus and is a possible target of developmental alcohol exposure. Alcohol (3.0 g/kg/day) was administered via intubation to male rat pups (postnatal day [PD] 2\u201310; ethanol-treated [ET]). Controls received a sham intubation (IC) or no treatment (NC). Acetylcholine efflux was measured using in vivo microdialysis (PD 32\u201335). ET animals were not different at baseline, but had decreased K+/Ca2+-induced acetylcholine efflux compared to NC animals and an enhanced acetylcholine response to galantamine (acetylcholinesterase inhibitor; 2.0 mg/kg) compared to both control groups. A separate cohort of animals was tested in the context pre-exposure facilitation effect task (CPFE; PD 30-32) following postnatal alcohol exposure and administration of galantamine (2.0 mg/kg; PD 11-30). Neither chronic galantamine nor postnatal alcohol exposure influenced performance in the CPFE task. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that neither alcohol exposure nor behavioral testing significantly altered the density of vesicular acetylcholine transporter or alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the ventral hippocampus (CA1). In the medial septum, the average number of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT+) cells was increased in ET animals that displayed the context-shock association; there were no changes in IC and NC animals that learned the context-shock association or in any animals that were in the control task that entailed no learning. Taken together, these results indicate that the hippocampal acetylcholine system is significantly disrupted under conditions of pharmacological manipulations (e.g., galantamine) in alcohol-exposed animals. Furthermore, ChAT was up\u2011regulated in ET animals that learned the CPFE, which may account for their ability to perform this task. In sum, developmental alcohol exposure may disrupt learning and memory in adolescence via a cholinergic mechanism.",

     "abstract": "The range of defects that fall within fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) includes persistent behavioral problems, with anxiety and depression being two of the more commonly reported issues. Previous studies of rodent FASD models suggest that interference with hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis structure and/or function may be the basis for some of the prenatal alcohol (ethanol) exposure (PAE)-induced behavioral abnormalities. Included among the previous investigations are those illustrating that maternal alcohol treatment limited to very early stages of pregnancy (i.e., gestational day [GD]7 in mice; equivalent to the third week post-fertilization in humans) can cause structural abnormalities in areas such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and other forebrain regions integral to controlling stress and behavioral responses. The current investigation was designed to further examine the sequelae of prenatal alcohol insult at this early time period, with particular attention to HPA axis-associated functional changes in adult mice. The results of this study reveal that GD7 PAE in mice causes HPA axis dysfunction, with males and females showing elevated corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, respectively, following a 15-min restraint stress exposure. Males also showed elevated CORT levels following an acute alcohol injection of 2.0\u00a0g/kg, while females displayed blunted ACTH levels. Furthermore, analysis showed that anxiety-like behavior was decreased after GD7 PAE in female mice, but was increased in male mice. Collectively, the results of this study show that early gestational alcohol exposure in mice alters long-term HPA axis activity and behavior in a sexually dimorphic manner.",

While previous work suggests a role for neuroadaptations in the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in the development of ethanol dependence and manifestation of withdrawal, the relative roles of ethanol exposure and ethanol withdrawal in producing these effects have not been fully characterized. To examine underlying cytotoxic mechanisms associated with chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, organotypic hippocampal slices were exposed to 1\u20133 cycles of ethanol (50\u00a0mM) in cell culture medium for 5 days, followed by 24\u00a0h of ethanol withdrawal, in which a portion of slices were exposed to competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV; 40\u00a0\u03bcM). Cytotoxicity was assessed using immunohistochemical labeling of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN; Fox-3), a marker of mature neurons, and thionine (2%) staining of Nissl bodies. Multiple cycles of CIE produced neurotoxicity, as reflected in persisting losses of neuron NeuN immunoreactivity and thionine staining in each of the primary cell layers of the hippocampal formation. Hippocampi aged in\u00a0vitro were significantly more sensitive to the toxic effects of multiple cycles of CIE than were non-aged hippocampi. This effect was not demonstrated in slices exposed to continuous ethanol, in the absence of withdrawal, or to a single exposure/withdrawal regimen. Exposure to APV significantly attenuated the cytotoxicity observed in the primary cell layers of the hippocampus. The present findings suggest that ethanol withdrawal is required to produce NMDA receptor-dependent hippocampal cytotoxicity, particularly in the aging hippocampus in\u00a0vitro.",

The aim of the present study was to determine whether cUENK6 could affect ethanol withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze (EPM) test in rats. An anxiety-like effect of withdrawal was predicted to occur in the EPM test 24\u00a0h after the last ethanol administration (2\u00a0g/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]; 15% w/v once daily for 9 days). Ethanol withdrawal decreased the percent of time spent by rats in the open arms and the percent of open-arms entries. cUENK6 (0.25\u00a0nmol), given by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection, significantly reversed these anxiety-like effects of ethanol withdrawal and elevated the percent of time spent by rats in the open arms and the percent of open-arms entries. These effects of cUENK6 were significantly inhibited by the DOPr antagonist naltrindole (NTI) (5\u00a0nmol, i.c.v.), but not by the MOPr antagonist \u03b2-funaltrexamine (\u03b2-FNA) (5\u00a0nmol, i.c.v.).

However, similarly to LeuEnk, cUENK6 induced the anxiolytic-like effects in na\u00efve rats.

The goal of this study was to compare withdrawal-associated behaviors in mice chronically treated with a liquid ethanol diet vs. mice treated with a short-term ethanol treatment that consisted of daily ethanol injections containing the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, 4-methylpyrazole. Twenty-four hours after ethanol treatment, mice were tested in the open field arena, the elevated plus maze, the marble burying test, or for changes in somatic signs during spontaneous ethanol withdrawal. Anxiety-like and compulsive-like behaviors, as well as physical signs, were all significantly elevated in mice undergoing withdrawal, regardless of the route of ethanol administration.

We administered 15\u00a0\u03bcL of ethanol at varying doses (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, or 20%) according to group assignment. Ethanol was either administered 5\u00a0min before original discrimination training or 5\u00a0min before the stimuli reversal. We analyzed the effects of these three manipulations via a recently developed individual analysis that eschews aggregate assessments in favor of a model that conceptualizes learning as occurring in individual organisms. We measured responding in the presence of conditioned stimuli associated with a sucrose feeding, responding in the presence of conditioned stimuli associated with distilled water, and responding in the presence of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose). Our analyses revealed the ethanol dose manipulation lowered responding for all three measures at increasingly higher doses, which suggests ethanol served as a general behavioral suppressor. Consistent with previous ethanol reversal literature, we found administering ethanol before the original discrimination phase or before the reversal produced inconsistent patterns of responding at varying ethanol doses.",

The aggravation of alcohol withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, has been associated with increased levels of serum corticosterone and leptin. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of NAC on anxiety, as well as corticosterone and leptin serum levels, after cessation of chronic alcohol treatment in rats. Male Wistar rats were treated with 2\u00a0g/kg ethanol, twice daily, by gavage for 30 days; control animals received an appropriate dose of glucose to balance caloric intake. Rats were treated for 4 days with NAC (60 and 90\u00a0mg/kg, intra-peritoneally [i.p.]) or saline after alcohol cessation. Twenty-four hours after the last treatment, rats were exposed to a 5-min session in the open-field test (OF). Corticosterone and leptin serum levels were determined by ELISA in samples collected within 30\u00a0min after the OF. Results showed that rats were hypoactive (decreased rearing, peripheral, and total crossings), and that corticosterone and leptin levels were increased 5 days after alcohol cessation. Four days of NAC prevented the behavioral and biochemical changes brought about by alcohol cessation. We suggest that, in addition to the anti-addictive properties reported for other drugs of abuse, NAC is potentially useful in the management of alcohol withdrawal.",

Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that acute and chronic exposure of liver cells to ethanol results in a major loss of cellular Mg2+ as a result of alcohol oxidation. We investigated whether exposure to ethanol induces a similar Mg2+ loss in cardiac cells. The results indicate that chronic exposure to a 6% ethanol-containing diet depleted cardiac myocytes of >25% of their cellular Mg2+ content. Acute ethanol exposure, instead, induced a time- and dose-dependent manner of Mg2+ extrusion from perfused hearts and collagenase-dispersed cardiac ventricular myocytes. Pretreatment with chlormethiazole prevented ethanol-induced Mg2+ loss to a large extent, suggesting a role of ethanol oxidation via cyP4502E1 in the process. Magnesium extrusion across the sarcolemma occurred via the amiloride-inhibited Na+/Mg2+ exchanger. Taken together, our data indicate that Mg2+ extrusion also occurs in cardiac cells exposed to ethanol as a result of alcohol metabolism by cyP4502E1.

     "abstract": "We examined the association between alcohol-drinking pattern and diabetes mellitus (DM) in Korean adults. This cross-sectional study included 12,486 participants (5551 men and 6935 women) who participated in the 2010\u20132012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We categorized alcohol-drinking pattern into three groups based on the alcohol-use disorders identification test (AUDIT): low-risk (score: 0\u20137), intermediate-risk (score: 8\u201314), and high-risk (score: \u226515). DM was defined as having fasting plasma glucose \u2265126\u00a0mg/dL or taking glucose-lowering medication, including insulin therapy. In the study population, 25.2% of men and 4.7% of women were high-risk drinkers. DM prevalence was 9.2% in men and 5.4% in women. DM prevalence was 9.0% and 5.7% in the low-risk drinking group, 7.6% and 4.1% in the intermediate-risk drinking group, and 11.2% and 3.5% in the high-risk drinking group in men and women, respectively. Compared to the low-risk drinking group, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of men and women in the intermediate-risk drinking group for DM were 1.043 (0.779\u20131.396) and 1.139 (0.712\u20131.824), respectively, and 1.480 (1.133\u20131.933) and 0.827 (0.296\u20132.311) in the high-risk drinking group, after adjusting for age and other confounding factors. In conclusion, high-risk drinking appears to be associated with a higher risk of DM in men, but not in women.",

Serial sAPC measurements were determined by gas chromatography on spontaneous saliva samples of 30 male alcoholics on days 2, 4, 11, and 18 during a 21-day in-patient treatment program. Craving was measured simultaneously with the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale. Outcome over 12 weeks was assessed by telephone interviews. There was no significant change in sAPC values from day 2 to day 18, while craving scores decreased markedly between day 2 to day 4. Sixteen participants remained abstinent for the full 12 weeks. Statistically significant differences were found between the sAPC values of the group that remained abstinent and the group that resumed drinking within 12 weeks. The highest sAPC value measured on day 2 had a strong predictive value for maintained abstinence at 12 weeks for beer-only drinkers or drinkers consuming less than 320\u00a0g of alcohol per week. The study is the first investigation into a potential relationship between the acetaldehyde production capacity of salivary microflora and early resumption of drinking in recovering alcoholics. The findings suggest that such a relationship indeed exists for beer-only drinkers, possibly linked to lower alcohol intake, and that it is unrelated to withdrawal craving. sAPC is proposed as a candidate biomarker with diagnostic and/or prognostic potential.",

Genomic DNA was used for genotyping the following seven genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism: cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) c.844_855ins68, dihydrofolate-reductase (DHFR) c.594\u00a0+\u00a059del19bp, methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) c.677C\u00a0>\u00a0T and c.1298A\u00a0>\u00a0C, methyltetrahydrofolate-transferase (MTR) c.2756A\u00a0>\u00a0G, reduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1) c.80G\u00a0>\u00a0A, and transcobalamin 2 c.776C\u00a0>\u00a0G. Multivariate linear regression showed a positive correlation of global DNA methylation with alcohol consumption and smoking on day 1 of hospitalization. DNA methylation was not correlated with homocysteine or vitamin plasma levels, nor with the tested genetic variants of homocysteine metabolism. This suggests a direct effect of alcohol consumption and smoking on DNA methylation, which is not mediated by effects of alcohol on homocysteine metabolism.",

The nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene (rs6265/Val66Met) modulates the central nervous system activity of neurotransmitters involved in reward processing such as serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. It was identified as crucial for alcohol consumption in healthy adults and, in rats, specifically related to the function in the striatum, a region that is commonly involved in reward processing. However, studies in humans on the association of BDNF Val66Met and reward-related brain functions and its role for alcohol consumption, a significant predictor of later alcohol addiction, are missing. Based on an intermediate phenotype approach, we assessed the early orientation toward alcohol and alcohol consumption in 530 healthy adolescents that underwent a monetary incentive delay task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found a significantly lower response in the putamen to reward anticipation in adolescent Met carriers with high versus low levels of alcohol consumption. During reward feedback, Met carriers with low putamen reactivity were significantly more likely to orient toward alcohol and to drink alcohol 2 years later. This study indicates a possible effect of BDNF Val66Met on alcohol addiction-related phenotypes in adolescence.",

     "abstract": "Inbred mouse strains provide significant opportunities to understand the genetic mechanisms controlling ethanol-directed behaviors and neurobiology. They have been specifically employed to understand cellular mechanisms contributing to ethanol consumption, acute intoxication, and sensitivities to chronic effects. However, limited ethanol consumption by some strains has restricted our understanding of clinically relevant endpoints such as dependence-related ethanol intake. Previous work with a novel tastant-substitution procedure using monosodium glutamate (MSG or umami flavor) has shown that the procedure greatly enhances ethanol consumption by mouse strains that express limited drinking phenotypes using other methods. In the current study, we employ this MSG-substitution procedure to examine how ethanol dependence, induced with passive vapor inhalation, modifies ethanol drinking in C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice. These strains represent \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018low\u2019 drinking phenotypes, respectively. We found that the MSG substitution greatly facilitates ethanol drinking in both strains, and likewise, ethanol dependence increased ethanol consumption regardless of strain. However, DBA/2J mice exhibited greater sensitivity dependence-enhanced drinking, as represented by consumption behaviors directed at lower ethanol concentrations and relative to baseline intake levels. DBA/2J mice also exhibited significant withdrawal-associated anxiety-like behavior while C57BL/6J mice did not. These findings suggest that the MSG-substitution procedure can be employed to examine dependence-enhanced ethanol consumption across a range of drinking phenotypes, and that C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice may represent unique neurobehavioral pathways for developing dependence-enhanced ethanol consumption.",

However, the effects of acute alcohol exposure among adolescent, adult, and aged rats have yet to be systematically investigated within the same project using a dose-dependent analysis. We sought to determine the age- and dose-dependent effects of acute alcohol exposure on gross and coordinated motor performance across the rodent lifespan. Adolescent (PD 30), adult (PD 70), and aged (approximately 18 months) male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were tested on 3 separate motor tasks: aerial righting reflex (ARR), accelerating rotarod (RR), and loss of righting reflex (LORR). In a separate group of animals, blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) were determined at multiple time points following a 3.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol injection. Behavioral tests were conducted with a Latin square repeated-measures design in which all animals received the following doses: 1.0\u00a0g/kg or 2.0\u00a0g/kg alcohol or saline over 3 separate sessions via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. During testing, motor impairments were assessed on the RR 10\u00a0min post-injection and on ARR 20\u00a0min post-injection. Aged animals spent significantly less time on the RR when administered 1.0\u00a0g/kg alcohol compared to adult rats. In addition, motor performance impairments significantly increased with age after 2.0\u00a0g/kg alcohol administration. On the ARR test, aged rats were more sensitive to the effects of 1.0\u00a0g/kg and 2.0\u00a0g/kg alcohol compared to adolescents and adults. Seven days after the last testing session, animals were given 3.0\u00a0g/kg alcohol and LORR was examined. During LORR, aged animals slept longer compared to adult and adolescent rats. This effect cannot be explained solely by BEC levels in aged rats. The present study suggests that acute alcohol exposure produces greater motor impairments in older rats when compared to adolescent and adult rats and begins to establish a procedure to determine motor effects by alcohol across the lifespan.",

Experiment 1 assessed the effects of different doses of DHEA, pregnanolone, naltrexone, and acamprosate on both ethanol- and food-maintained responding under a multiple fixed-ratio (FR)-10 FR-20 schedule, respectively. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of different mean intervals of food presentation on responding for ethanol under a FR-10 variable-interval (VI) schedule, whereas Experiment 3 assessed the effects of a single dose of each drug under a FR-10 VI-80 schedule. In Experiment 1, all four drugs dose-dependently decreased response rate for both food and ethanol, although differences in the rate-decreasing effects were apparent among the drugs. DHEA and pregnanolone decreased ethanol-maintained responding more potently than food-maintained responding, whereas the reverse was true for naltrexone. Acamprosate decreased responding for both reinforcers with equal potency. In Experiment 2, different mean intervals of food presentation significantly affected the number of food reinforcers obtained per session; however, changes in the number of food reinforcements did not significantly affect responding for ethanol. Under the FR-10 VI-80 schedule in Experiment 3, only naltrexone significantly decreased both the dose of alcohol presented and blood ethanol concentration (BEC). Acamprosate and pregnanolone had no significant effects on any of the dependent measures, whereas DHEA significantly decreased BEC, but did not significantly decrease response rate or the dose presented. In summary, DHEA and pregnanolone decreased ethanol-maintained responding more potently than food-maintained responding under a multiple FR-10 FR-20 schedule, and were more selective for decreasing ethanol self-administration than either naltrexone or acamprosate under that schedule. Experiment 2 showed that ethanol intake was relatively independent of the interval of reinforcement in the food-maintained component, and Experiment 3 showed that naltrexone was the most effective drug at the doses tested when the interval for food reinforcement was low and maintained under a variable-interval schedule.",

     "abstract": "Acetaldehyde, the first alcohol metabolite, is responsible for many pharmacological effects that are not clearly distinguishable from those exerted by its parent compound. It alters motor performance, induces reinforced learning and motivated behavior, and produces different reactions according to the route of administration and the relative accumulation in the brain or in the periphery. The effective activity of oral acetaldehyde represents an unresolved field of inquiry that deserves further investigation. Thus, this study explores the acquisition and maintenance of acetaldehyde drinking behavior in adult male rats, employing a two-bottle choice paradigm for water and acetaldehyde solution (from 0.9% to 3.2% v/v), over 8 weeks. The behavioral consequences exerted by chronic acetaldehyde intake are assessed by a set of different tests: trials in an open-field arena and elevated-plus maze provided information on both general motor and explorative activity, and anxiety-driven behavioral responses. The Morris water maze allowed the exploration of cognitive processes such as spatial learning and memory. Determination of acetaldehyde levels in the brain was carried out at the end of the drinking paradigm. Our results indicate that rats exposed for the first time to acetaldehyde at 0.9% displayed a regular and stable daily drinking pattern that reached higher values and a \u201cpeaks and drops\u201d shaped-trend when acetaldehyde concentration was increased to 3.2%. Accordingly, an increase in acetaldehyde levels in the brain was determined compared to non-acetaldehyde drinking rats. Acetaldehyde intake during the free-choice paradigm exerted an anxiogenic response in the open-field arena and elevated-plus maze, which in turn correlates with an enhancement in cognitive flexibility and spatial orientation skills, when an adaptive response to a stressful environmental challenge was required. These findings further support the idea that acetaldehyde is indeed a centrally active and behaviorally relevant metabolite of alcohol.",

FASD is highly prevalent in low socioeconomic populations, which are frequently accompanied by malnutrition. FASD-associated ocular pathologies include microphthalmia, optic nerve hypoplasia, and cataracts. The present study characterizes specific retinal tissue defects, identifies ethanol-sensitive stages during retinal development, and dissects the effect of nutrient supplements, such as retinoic acid (RA) and folic acid (FA) on ethanol-induced retinal defects. Exposure to pathophysiological concentrations of ethanol (during midblastula transition through somitogenesis; 2\u201324\u00a0h post fertilization [hpf]) altered critical transcription factor expression involved in retinal cell differentiation, and produced severe retinal ganglion cell, photoreceptor, and M\u00fcller glial differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure did not alter retinal cell differentiation induction, but increased retinal cell death and proliferation. RA and FA nutrient co-supplementation rescued retinal photoreceptor and ganglion cell differentiation defects. Ethanol exposure during retinal morphogenesis stages (16\u201324 hpf) produced retinal defects like those seen with ethanol exposure between 2 and 24 hpf. Significantly, during an ethanol-sensitive time window (16\u201324 hpf), RA co-supplementation moderately rescued these defects, whereas FA co-supplementation showed significant rescue of optic nerve and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Interestingly, RA, but not FA, supplementation after ethanol exposure could reverse ethanol-induced optic nerve and photoreceptor differentiation defects. Our results indicate that various ethanol-sensitive events underlie FASD-associated retinal defects. Nutrient supplements like retinoids and folate were effective in alleviating ethanol-induced retinal defects.",

In the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology study (North West Province, South Africa, N\u00a0=\u00a02021, collected in 2005) we selected 338 participants, namely: 1) alcohol users (N\u00a0=\u00a0143) reporting \u2018yes\u2019 to alcohol intake, with high gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) \u226580 U/L and a percentage carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) \u22652%; 2) non-alcohol users (N\u00a0=\u00a0127) self-reporting \u2018no\u2019 to alcohol intake with GGT \u226430 U/L and %CDT \u22642%; and 3) NAFLD group (N\u00a0=\u00a068) who were non-drinkers with GGT levels\u00a0\u226560\u00a0U/L and %CDT\u00a0\u2264\u00a02%. The demographics indicated that the alcohol users were mostly men (73%) with a body mass index (BMI) of 19.8 (15.2\u201327.3) kg/m2, 90% of which were smokers. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) of alcohol users significantly correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.24; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and waist circumference (WC) (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.22; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Non-alcohol users were mostly women (84%) with a BMI of 26.0 (18.0\u201339.2) kg/m2 and blood pressure in this group related positively with triglycerides. The NAFLD group were also mostly women (72%) with a comparatively larger WC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and an adverse metabolic profile (total cholesterol: 5.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.69\u00a0mmol/L; glycosylated hemoglobin: 6.03 (4.70\u20139.40) %). Diastolic blood pressure in the NAFLD group associated positively with WC (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.27; p\u00a0=\u00a00.018).

The present study investigated the neural activity of 29 young adults from the OPPS using fMRI. The main objective was to discover the impact of regular low-level alcohol consumption on the cognitive interference of these participants, as they performed a Counting Stroop task. Results indicated that, despite a lack of performance differences, young adults who use alcohol on a regular basis differ significantly from non-users with respect to their neural activity as they perform this task. Areas that were significantly more activated in users compared to non-users included the cerebellum, thalamus, fusiform gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and precuneus. The observed activity suggests a significant impact of early alcohol use on neurocognitive functioning despite relatively low levels of alcohol consumption.",

This study evaluated dexmedetomidine (DEX) on NGF, BDNF, GDNF, and EPI in severe alcohol withdrawal and related their plasma concentrations to DEX concentrations. Twenty-four subjects were randomized to DEX 1.2\u00a0mcg/kg/hour (high dose [HD]), 0.4\u00a0mcg/kg/hour (low dose [LD]), or placebo. Blood was collected at 0 (T0), 48 (T48), and 96\u2013120 (T96) hours after starting the study drug, and concentrations of these transmitters and DEX were determined. Similar NGF suppression occurred at T48 and T96 across all groups. BDNF and GDNF levels increased insignificantly at T48 in the placebo group but steadily declined in both DEX groups, with a trend toward significance in the HD group at T48. EPI concentrations declined significantly in the HD group at T48, only to increase at T96. Median DEX concentrations during the study were insignificantly higher in HD than LD. T0 values of BDNF (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and GDNF (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.37, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) were inversely associated with the need for mechanical ventilation before study enrollment.

Clinical and preclinical evidence indicates that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for controlling impulsive behaviors, representing the value of a predicted outcome, and reversing learned associations. Individuals with AUDs often demonstrate deficits in OFC-dependent tasks, and rodent models of alcohol exposure show that OFC-dependent behaviors are impaired by chronic alcohol exposure. To explore the mechanisms that underlie these impairments, we examined dendritic spine density and morphology, and NMDA-type glutamate receptor expression in the lateral OFC of C57BL/6J mice following chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure. Western blot analysis demonstrated that NMDA receptors were not altered immediately following CIE exposure or after 7 days of withdrawal. Morphological analysis of basal dendrites of layer II/III pyramidal neurons revealed that dendritic spine density was also not affected immediately after CIE exposure. However, the total density of dendritic spines was significantly increased after a 7-day withdrawal from CIE exposure. The effect of withdrawal on spine density was mediated by an increase in the density of long, thin spines with no change in either stubby or mushroom spines. These data suggest that morphological neuroadaptations in lateral OFC neurons develop during alcohol withdrawal and occur in the absence of changes in the expression of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. The enhanced spine density that follows alcohol withdrawal may contribute to the impairments in OFC-dependent behaviors observed in CIE-treated mice.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid in humans. In rodent lines selected for alcohol drinking, differences in anxiety-like behavior are also seen. The High Drinking in the Dark (HDID) lines of mice are selectively bred for drinking to intoxication during limited access to alcohol, and these mice represent a genetic model of risk for binge-like drinking. The present studies investigated whether these selected lines differ from control (HS) mice in basal anxiety behavior or in anxiolytic response to alcohol. We also assessed the genetic correlation between alcohol drinking in the dark (DID) and basal anxiety-like behavior using existing inbred strain data. Mice of both sexes and HDID replicates (HDID-1 and HDID-2) were tested on an elevated zero maze immediately following a DID test. In general, HDID mice showed more time spent in the open arms after drinking alcohol than HS mice, and open-arm time was significantly correlated with blood alcohol concentration. HDID-1 male mice also showed less anxiety-like behavior at baseline (water-drinking controls). In a separate experiment, HDID-1 and HS mice were tested for anxiolytic dose-response to acute alcohol injections. Both genotypes showed increasing time spent in the open arms with increasing alcohol doses, and HDID-1 and female mice had greater open-arm time across all doses. HDID-1 control males showed lower anxiety-like behavior than the HS control males. Inbred strain data analysis also showed no significant genetic relationship between alcohol DID and anxiety. These findings suggest that HDID selection has not produced systematic changes in anxiety-like behavior or sensitivity to alcohol-induced anxiolysis, though there is a tendency in the male mice of the first replicate toward reduced basal anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, anxiety state and sensitivity to alcohol's anxiolytic effects do not appear to contribute significantly to the high drinking behavior of the HDID mice.",

     "abstract": "The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen has been studied extensively in preclinical models of alcohol-use disorders, yet results on its efficacy have been uncertain. Racemic baclofen, which is used clinically, can be broken down into separate enantiomers of the drug. Baclofen has been shown to produce enantioselective effects in behavioral assays, including those modeling reflexive and sexual behavior. The current studies sought to characterize the enantioselective effects of baclofen in two separate models of ethanol consumption. The first was a Drinking-in-the-Dark procedure that provides \u201cbinge-like\u201d ethanol access to mice by restricting access to a 2-h period, 3\u00a0h into the dark cycle. The second was a two-bottle choice procedure that utilized selectively bred High Alcohol Preferring 1 (HAP1) mice to model chronic ethanol access. HAP1 mice are selectively bred to consume pharmacologically relevant amounts of ethanol in a 24-h two-bottle choice paradigm. The results showed that baclofen yields enantioselective effects on ethanol intake in both models, and that these effects are bidirectional. Total ethanol intake was decreased by R(+)-baclofen, while total intake was increased by S(\u2212)-baclofen in the binge-like and chronic drinking models. Whereas overall binge-like saccharin intake was significantly reduced by R(+)-baclofen, chronic intake was not significantly altered. S(\u2212)-baclofen did not significantly alter saccharin intake. Neither enantiomer significantly affected locomotion during binge-like reinforcer consumption. Collectively, these results demonstrate that baclofen produces enantioselective effects on ethanol consumption. More importantly, the modulation of consumption is bidirectional. The opposing enantioselective effects may explain some of the variance seen in published baclofen literature.",

Male Wistar rats were treated with ethanol 3\u20139% (v/v) for a period of 21 days. Ethanol withdrawal was induced by abrupt discontinuation of the treatment. Experiments were performed 48\u00a0h after ethanol discontinuation. Rats from the ethanol withdrawal group showed decreased exploration of the open arms of the elevated-plus maze (EPM) and increased plasma corticosterone levels. Ethanol withdrawal significantly increased systolic blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II (ANG II) levels without an effect on plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, or plasma angiotensin I (ANG I) levels. No differences in vascular ANG I, ANG II levels, and ACE activity/expression and AT1 and AT2 receptor expression were detected among the experimental groups. Plasma osmolality, as well as plasma sodium, potassium, and glucose levels were not affected by ethanol withdrawal. Ethanol withdrawal induced systemic and vascular oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased plasma thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) levels and the vascular generation of superoxide anion. Ethanol withdrawal significantly decreased plasma and vascular nitrate/nitrite levels. Major new findings of the present study are that ethanol withdrawal induces vascular oxidative stress and reduces nitric oxide (NO) levels in the vasculature. Additionally, our study provides novel evidence that ethanol withdrawal does not affect the vascular ANG II generating system while stimulating systemic RAS. These responses could predispose individuals to the development of cardiovascular diseases.",

Chronic alcohol consumption has been known to induce a decrease in gut wall integrity in actively drinking alcoholics and patients with alcohol-induced liver disease. Data on the extent of the damage induced by acute alcohol consumption in healthy human beings is scarce. Studies show that heavy incidental alcohol consumption is a growing problem in modern society. Data on this matter may provide insights into the consequences of this behavior for healthy individuals. In a randomized clinical trial in crossover design, 15 healthy volunteers consumed water one day and alcohol the other. One blood sample was collected pre-consumption, five every hour post-consumption, and one after 24\u00a0h. Intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP) was used as a marker for enterocyte damage. Liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were used as markers for hepatocyte damage. Lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and soluble CD14 (sCD14) were used as a measure of translocation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was used to assess the acute inflammatory response to endotoxemia. Alcohol consumption caused a significant increase in serum I- and L-FABP levels, compared to water consumption. Levels increased directly post-consumption and decreased to normal levels within 4\u00a0h. LBP, sCD14, and IL-6 levels were not significantly higher in the alcohol group. Moderate acute alcohol consumption immediately damages the enterocyte but does not seem to cause endotoxemia.",

Infants prenatally exposed to alcohol show altered basal and post-stress cortisol levels, but it is unknown if this persists beyond 2 years of age. It is also unknown if cortisol levels can be normalized through intervention programs. In this study, we investigated the effects of a physical activity program for children with FASD to determine: 1) if HPA dysregulation persists in school-age children with FASD, and 2) the effect of our program on cortisol levels. Twenty six children (ages 6\u201314 years) with FASD participated in an 8 week motor skill development program. Salivary cortisol levels were measured in 24 children and compared at 4 time points: before, immediately after, 3 months, and 1 year after program completion. Cortisol levels were also compared to 32 control children to evaluate the long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on HPA regulation. For each time point, saliva was collected on each of 2 days at 3 times in the diurnal cycle: awakening, after school, and just before bedtime. Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the afternoon and at bedtime in children with FASD with confirmed prenatal exposure to high levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 4), compared with Control children or children with FASD with exposure to low or unknown levels of alcohol (alcohol exposure rank 3). The program did not significantly affect cortisol levels in children with FASD as a group. These results provide support for long-term effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the HPA system in humans, which could increase vulnerability to mental health issues and diseases later in life.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to stress contributes to ethanol consumption in humans, but it produces inconsistent effects on ethanol drinking in rodent models. Therefore, the present study examined the influence of different stressors (restraint, tail suspension, predator odor, foot shock, and tail pinch) on 2-h access to water and 10% ethanol by male and female C57BL/6J mice and determined whether there were sex-dependent differences in response to stress. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) and allopregnanolone (ALLO) were assessed as indexes of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and of endogenous neurosteroid levels, respectively, following restraint, tail suspension, and predator odor. These stressors increased plasma CORT and ALLO levels, and produced a greater increase in CORT and ALLO levels in females versus males. Ethanol intake was decreased following restraint, tail suspension, foot shock, and tail pinch in both sexes, with stressor-related differences in the duration of the suppression. Predator odor significantly increased ethanol intake on the following two days in females and on the second day after stress in males. Notably, there was a significant positive correlation between CORT levels immediately after predator odor stress and ethanol intake on the following day. In summary, the type of stressor influenced ethanol consumption, with subtle sex differences in the magnitude and persistence of the effect. These findings are the first to demonstrate that a single, acute exposure to restraint, tail suspension, and predator odor stress increased plasma CORT and ALLO levels in animals with a history of ethanol consumption and that female mice were more responsive than males to the ability of stress to increase CORT and ALLO levels as well as to increase ethanol intake following predator odor stress. Because predator odor stress is a model of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the present sex differences have important implications for preclinical studies modeling the comorbidity of PTSD and alcohol use disorders.",

     "abstract": "Human studies have shown that adolescents who repeatedly use alcohol are more likely to be dependent on alcohol and are more likely to suffer from psychological problems later in life. There has been limited research examining how ethanol exposure in adolescence might contribute to later abuse or addiction in adulthood. The present experiment examined effects of intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence on sign-tracking behavior in adulthood, indexed by a Pavlovian conditioned approach (PCA) task wherein an 8s lever presentation served as a cue predicting subsequent delivery of a flavored food pellet. Although no response was required for food delivery, after multiple pairings, 1 of 2 different responses often emerged during the lever presentation: goal tracking (head entries into the food trough) or sign tracking (engagement with the lever when presented). Sign tracking is thought to reflect the attribution of incentive salience to reward-paired cues and has been previously correlated with addiction-like behaviors. Following the last PCA session, blood samples were collected for analysis of post-session corticosterone levels. Sixty-two rats (n\u00a0=\u00a010\u201312/group) were pseudo-randomly assigned to 1 of 2 intragastric (i.g.) exposure groups (water or 4\u00a0g/kg ethanol) or a non-manipulated (NM) control group. Animals were intubated with ethanol or water every other session from postnatal session (PND) 28\u201348 or PND 70\u201390. Rats were then tested in adulthood (PND 71\u201379 or PND 113\u2013122) on the PCA task. Animals exposed chronically to ethanol during adolescence exhibited significantly higher levels of sign-tracking behavior in adulthood than NM and water-treated animals, and showed higher corticosterone than NM control animals. These effects were not seen after comparable ethanol exposure in adulthood. These results suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure has long-term consequences on the expression of potential addiction-relevant behaviors in adulthood.",

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of prior alcohol self-administration on these responses in HAP mice. Na\u00efve male and female adult HAP mice from the second replicate of selection (HAP2) underwent 18 days of 24-h, 2-bottle choice drinking for 10% ethanol vs. water, or water only. After 18 days of fluid access, mice were tested for ataxic sensitivity and rapid AFT following a 1.75\u00a0g/kg injection of ethanol on a static dowel apparatus in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, a separate group of mice was tested for more protracted AFT development using a dual-injection approach where a second, larger (2.0\u00a0g/kg) injection of ethanol was given following the initial recovery of performance on the task. HAP2 mice that had prior access to alcohol exhibited a blunted ataxic response to the acute alcohol challenge, but this pre-exposure did not alter rapid within-session AFT capacity in Experiment 1 or more protracted AFT capacity in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that the typically observed increase in alcohol consumption in these mice may be influenced by ataxic functional tolerance development, but is not mediated by a greater capacity for ethanol exposure to positively influence within-session ataxic tolerance.",

Alcohol exposure during this period can activate the neuroimmune system, an effect that may contribute to the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Here, we investigated whether repeated alcohol exposure during the third trimester-equivalent in rats has a priming effect on the neuroimmune response to injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pups were exposed to alcohol in vapor chambers for 4\u00a0h daily from postnatal day (PD)2 to PD16 (peak blood alcohol concentrations \u223c150\u00a0mg/dL). On PD17, rats were injected with either saline or LPS (50\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) and the frontal cortex, cerebellar vermis, and dentate gyrus were collected 2\u00a0h later. Messenger RNA (mRNA) levels for the pro-inflammatory agents interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and chemokine (C\u2013C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), as well as levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10), were measured using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. LPS consistently increased IL-1\u03b2 and CCL2 mRNA levels in the dentate gyrus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of both male and female rats. Furthermore, the LPS-induced increase of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA levels was significantly blunted in the frontal cortex of alcohol-exposed female rats. Conversely, LPS only minimally affected IL-10 mRNA expression and there were no significant differences between air- and alcohol-exposed rats. Taken together with the literature regarding the effect of third-trimester alcohol exposure on the neuroimmune system, our findings suggest that chronic exposure to lower levels is less disruptive to the neuroimmune system than binge-like exposure to high doses of alcohol.",

The indicators of intestinal barrier dysfunction, d-lactic acid and lipopolysaccharide, were significantly higher in alcohol-fed mice than in control mice. Alcohol exposure obviously caused high permeability in the ileum to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FD-4; molecular weight 4000). Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that tight junctions and adherens junctions expanded noticeably in alcohol-fed mice.

One hundred forty-eight subjects were prospectively recruited. The Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) questionnaire was used to quantify the amount of alcohol consumed over the 30-day period before their enrollment. Anthropometric measurements were performed to calculate %BF. Serum Pref-1 and FFA were measured. Fifty-one subjects (mean age 32 \u00b1 9 years, 88% men) were non-excessive drinkers whereas 97 were excessive drinkers (mean age 41 \u00b1 18 years, 69% men). Compared to non-excessive drinkers, individuals with excessive drinking had significantly higher levels of Pref-1 (p<0.01), FFA (p < 0.001), and lower %BF (p = 0.03). Serum levels of Pref-1 were associated with the amount of alcohol consumed during the previous 30 days. Serum Pref-1 was negatively correlated with %BF, but positively associated with serum FFA. Our data suggest that elevated Pref-1 levels in excessive drinkers might inhibit the expansion of adipose tissue, decreasing %BF in alcoholics. Further work is needed to validate these findings and to better understand the role of Pref-1 and its clinical significance in subjects with heavy alcohol use.",

We aimed to characterize the effects of select comorbid (i.e., cigarette smoking) and premorbid factors (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype [Val66Met rs6265]) on hippocampal volume in an ALC cohort followed longitudinally into extended abstinence. One hundred twenty-one adult ALC in treatment (76 smokers, 45 non-smokers) and 35 non-smoking light-drinking controls underwent quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, BDNF genotyping, and neurocognitive assessments. Representative subgroups were studied at 1 week, 1 month, and at an average of 7 months of abstinence. ALC had smaller hippocampi than healthy controls at all time points. Hippocampal volume at 1 month of abstinence correlated with lower visuospatial function. Smoking status did not influence hippocampal volume or hippocampal volume recovery during abstinence. However, only BDNF Val homozygotes tended to have hippocampal volume increases over 7 months of abstinence, and Val homozygotes had significantly larger hippocampi than Met carriers at 7 months of abstinence. These findings suggest that BDNF genotype, but not smoking status or measures of drinking severity, regulate functionally relevant hippocampal volume recovery in abstinent ALC. Future studies aimed at exploring genetic determinants of brain morphometry in ALC may need to evaluate individuals during extended abstinence after the acute environmental effects of chronic alcohol consumption have waned.",

Using a lithium chloride-ethanol pairing procedure to devalue the reinforcing properties of ethanol, the present study determined whether multiple cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure by vapor inhalation also alters the sensitivity of drinking behavior to the devaluation of ethanol's reinforcing effects. The effect of devaluation on operant ethanol self-administration and extinction was examined in mice prior to initiation of CIE (short drinking history) and after repeated cycles of CIE or air control exposure (long drinking history). Devaluation significantly attenuated the recovery of baseline ethanol self-administration when tested either prior to CIE or in the air-exposed controls that had experienced repeated bouts of drinking but no CIE. In contrast, in mice that had undergone repeated cycles of CIE exposure that promoted escalation of ethanol drinking, self-administration was completely resistant to the effect of devaluation. Devaluation had no effect on the time course of extinction training in either pre-CIE or post-CIE mice. Taken together, these results are consistent with the suggestion that repeated cycles of ethanol dependence and withdrawal produce escalation of ethanol self-administration that is associated with a change in sensitivity to devaluation of the reinforcing properties of ethanol.",

     "abstract": "Chronic alcohol (ethanol) intake alters fundamental properties of the circadian clock. While previous studies have reported significant alterations in free-running circadian period during chronic ethanol access, these effects are typically subtle and appear to require high levels of intake. In the present study we examined the effects of long-term voluntary ethanol intake on ethanol consumption and free-running circadian period in male and female, selectively bred ethanol-preferring P and HAD2 rats. In light of previous reports that intermittent access can result in escalated ethanol intake, an initial 2-week water-only baseline was followed by either continuous or intermittent ethanol access (i.e., alternating 15-day epochs of ethanol access and ethanol deprivation) in separate groups of rats. Thus, animals were exposed to either 135 days of continuous ethanol access or to five 15-day access periods alternating with four 15-day periods of ethanol deprivation. Animals were maintained individually in running-wheel cages under continuous darkness throughout the experiment to allow monitoring of free-running activity and drinking rhythms, and 10% (v/v) ethanol and plain water were available continuously via separate drinking tubes during ethanol access. While there were no initial sex differences in ethanol drinking, ethanol preference increased progressively in male P and HAD2 rats under both continuous and intermittent-access conditions, and eventually exceeded that seen in females. Free-running period shortened during the initial ethanol-access epoch in all groups, but the persistence of this effect showed complex dependence on sex, breeding line, and ethanol-access schedule. Finally, while females of both breeding lines displayed higher levels of locomotor activity than males, there was little evidence for modulation of activity level by ethanol access. These results are consistent with previous findings that chronic ethanol intake alters free-running circadian period, and show further that the development of chronobiological tolerance to ethanol may vary by sex and genotype.",

     "abstract": "Different alcohol drinking patterns, involving either small and frequent drinking bouts or large and long-lasting bouts, are found to differentially affect the risk for developing alcohol-related diseases, suggesting that they have different underlying mechanisms. Such mechanisms may involve orexigenic peptides known to stimulate alcohol intake through their actions in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). These include orexin (OX), which is expressed in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus, and galanin (GAL) and enkephalin (ENK), which are expressed within as well as outside the PVN. To investigate the possibility that these peptides affect different aspects of consumption, a microstructural analysis of ethanol drinking behavior was performed in male, Sprague\u2013Dawley rats trained to drink 7% ethanol and implanted with guide shafts aimed at the PVN. While housed in specialized cages containing computerized intake monitors (BioDAQ Laboratory Intake Monitoring System, Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) that measure bouts of ethanol drinking, these rats were given PVN injections of OX (0.9\u00a0nmol), GAL (1.0\u00a0nmol), or the ENK analog D-Ala2-met-enkephalinamide (DALA) (14.2\u00a0nmol), as compared to saline vehicle. Results revealed clear differences between the effects of these peptides. While all 3 stimulated ethanol intake, they had distinct effects on patterns of drinking, with OX increasing the number of drinking bouts, GAL increasing the size of the drinking bouts, and DALA increasing both the size and duration of the bouts. In contrast, these peptides had little impact on water or food intake. These results support the idea that different peptides can increase ethanol consumption by promoting distinct aspects of the ethanol drinking response. The stimulatory effect of OX on drinking frequency may be related to its neuronally stimulatory properties, while the stimulatory effect of GAL and ENK on bout size and duration may reflect a suppressive effect of these neuronally inhibitory peptides on the satiety-controlling PVN.",

     "abstract": "The administration of disulfiram raises blood acetaldehyde levels when ethanol is ingested, leading to an aversion to alcohol. This study was aimed at assessing the effect of fenofibrate on voluntary ethanol ingestion in rats. Fenofibrate reduces blood triglyceride levels by increasing fatty acid oxidation by liver peroxisomes, along with an increase in the activity of catalase, which can oxidize ethanol to acetaldehyde. UChB drinker rats were allowed to consume alcohol 10% v/v freely for 60 days, until consumption stabilized at around 7\u00a0g ethanol/kg/24\u00a0h. About 1\u20131.2\u00a0g ethanol/kg of this intake is consumed in the first 2\u00a0h of darkness of the circadian cycle. Fenofibrate subsequently administered (50\u00a0mg/kg/day by mouth [p.o.]) for 14 days led to a 60\u201370% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) reduction of 24-h ethanol consumption. When ethanol intake was determined within the first 2\u00a0h of darkness, the reduction was 85\u201390% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We determined whether animals chronically allowed access to ethanol and subsequently treated with fenofibrate, would a) increase liver catalase activity, and b) increase blood acetaldehyde levels after a 24-h ethanol deprivation and the subsequent administration of 1\u00a0g ethanol/kg. The oral administration of 1\u00a0g ethanol/kg produced a rapid increase in blood (arterial) acetaldehyde in fenofibrate-treated animals versus controls also administered 1\u00a0g/kg ethanol (70\u00a0\u03bcM vs. 7\u00a0\u03bcM; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Liver catalase activity following fenofibrate treatment was increased 3-fold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Other hepatic enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethanol (alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) remained unchanged. No liver damage was induced, as measured by serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activity. The effect of fenofibrate in reducing alcohol intake was fully reversible. Overall, in rats allowed chronic ethanol intake, by mouth (p.o.), fenofibrate administration increased liver catalase activity and reduced voluntary ethanol intake. The administration of 1\u00a0g ethanol/kg (p.o.) to these animals increased blood acetaldehyde levels in fenofibrate-treated animals, suggesting the possible basis for the reduction in ethanol intake.",

     "abstract": "Recently, PPAR-\u03b3 activation has emerged as a potential treatment for alcoholism. However, the adverse effects of synthetic PPAR-\u03b3 activators, despite being effective drugs, prompted the need for novel PPAR-\u03b3 agonists that retain efficacy and potency with a lower potential of side effects. Hence, naringin, a bioflavonoid isolated from citrus fruits and recently identified as a natural ligand of PPAR-\u03b3, has begun to be evaluated for treatment of alcoholism. It is well known to possess several therapeutic benefits in addition to its anti-anxiety and antidepressant properties. In the present study, we assessed whether naringin treatment possesses anti-ethanol reward properties in C57BL/6 mice. We used the two-bottle choice drinking paradigm and ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) to examine the effect of naringin treatment on ethanol drinking. Results have shown that, compared with vehicle, naringin (10\u2013100\u00a0mg/kg) significantly and dose-dependently decreased voluntary ethanol intake and preference in a two-bottle choice drinking paradigm [3\u201315% (v/v) escalating over 2 weeks], with no significant effect observed on saccharin [0.02\u20130.08% (w/v)] or on quinine [15\u201360\u00a0\u03bcM (w/v)] intake. In addition, there was no significant difference in blood ethanol concentration (BEC) between groups following naringin administration of 3\u00a0g of ethanol/kg body weight. Interestingly, when mice were treated with vehicle or naringin (30\u00a0mg/kg) before injection of ethanol (1.5\u00a0g/kg) during conditioning days, naringin inhibited the acquisition of ethanol-CPP. More importantly, these effects were significantly attenuated when mice were pre-injected with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) antagonist, GW9662. Taken together, the present findings are the first to implicate naringin and PPAR-\u03b3 receptors in the behavioral and reward-related effects of ethanol and raise the question of whether specific drugs that target PPAR-\u03b3 receptors could potentially reduce excessive ethanol consumption and preference.",

     "abstract": "Maternal ethanol consumption during pregnancy can produce a range of teratogenic outcomes in offspring. The mechanism of ethanol teratogenicity is multi-faceted, but may involve alterations in insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathways. These pathways are not only important for metabolism, but are also critically involved in neuronal survival and plasticity, and they can be altered by chronic prenatal ethanol exposure (CPEE). The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that CPEE alters expression of insulin and IGF signaling molecules in the prefrontal cortex and liver of adult guinea pig offspring. Pregnant Dunkin-Hartley-strain guinea pigs received ethanol (4\u00a0g/kg maternal body weight/day) or isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding (nutritional control) throughout gestation. Fasting blood glucose concentration was measured in male and female offspring at postnatal day 150\u2013200, followed by euthanasia, collection of prefrontal cortex and liver, and RNA extraction. IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), IGF-2, IGF-2 receptor (IGF-2R), insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1, IRS-2, and insulin receptor (INSR) mRNA expression levels were measured in tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. The mean maternal blood ethanol concentration was 281\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0mg/dL at 1\u00a0h after the second divided dose of ethanol on GD 57. CPEE resulted in increased liver weight in adult offspring, but produced no difference in fasting blood glucose concentration compared with nutritional control. In the liver, CPEE decreased mRNA expression of IGF-1, IGF-1R, and IGF-2, and increased IRS-2 mRNA expression in male offspring only compared with nutritional control. Female CPEE offspring had decreased INSR hepatic mRNA expression compared with male CPEE offspring. In the prefrontal cortex, IRS-2 mRNA expression was increased in CPEE offspring compared with nutritional control. The data demonstrate that CPEE alters both central and peripheral expression of insulin and IGF signaling molecules at the mRNA level, which may be related to metabolic dysregulation in adult offspring. Furthermore, altered insulin and IGF signaling may be a mechanism of ethanol neurobehavioral teratogenicity.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol consumption at moderate levels has been associated with decreased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the cardio-protective effect of alcohol may be restricted to subjects with a particular genotype of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) polymorphism. There is evidence for this from one study in men, but the finding has not been confirmed since. The present study specifically re-examines the potential modification of the association between alcohol consumption and CHD by the CETP TaqIB (rs708272) polymorphism in a sample including both men and women. The INTERGENE case-control study consists of 618 patients with CHD and 2921 control subjects, of whom 19% were homozygous for the CETP TaqIB B2 allele. Alcohol consumption was categorized into sex-specific tertiles of ethanol intake, with non-drinkers constituting a separate category. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between CHD with genotype, ethanol intake, and their interaction. Participants with intermediate ethanol intake (2nd tertile) had lower risk of CHD than those with low ethanol intake (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a00.65; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.50\u20130.85). The strongest protective association was seen in the CETP TaqIB B2 homozygotes for intermediate vs. low ethanol intake (odds ratio OR\u00a0=\u00a00.21; 95% CI 0.10\u20130.44). The interaction between ethanol intake and genotype was statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and of similar size in men and women though significant only in men (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The effect modification could not be explained by differences in lifestyle, socioeconomics, or alcohol-related biological variables such as HDL\u2013cholesterol. Our study is the first to replicate previous findings of an effect modification in men. It gives only suggestive results for women, possibly due to the small number of female cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0165). The prevented fraction for the favorable combination of genotype and alcohol consumption is about 6%, a value suggesting that the cardio-protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption applies only to a small segment of the general population.",

UF significantly reduced the severity of alcohol-induced body weight loss, hepatic lipid accumulation and droplet formation, and dyslipidemia. UF decreased plasma AST, ALT, and \u03b3GTP activity. UF significantly reduced hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 activities and increased alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 activities compared to the alcohol control group, which resulted in a lower plasma acetaldehyde level in the rats that received UF. Chronic alcohol exposure inhibited hepatic AMPK activation compared to the pair-fed rats, which was reversed by UF supplementation. UF also significantly suppressed the lipogenic gene expression (SREBP-1c, SREBP-2, FAS, CIDEA, and PPAR\u03b3) and elevated the fatty acid oxidation gene expression (PPAR\u03b1, Acsl1, CPT, Acox, and Acaa1a) compared to the alcohol control group, which could lead to inhibition of FAS activity and stimulation of CPT and fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation activities in the liver of chronic alcohol-fed rats. These results indicated that UF attenuated alcoholic steatosis through down-regulation of SREBP-1c-mediated lipogenesis and up-regulation of PPAR\u03b1-mediated fatty acid oxidation.

Expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II and sequestosome1/p62 significantly increased in the ED group. Moreover, accumulation of autophagosomes was observed by transmission electron microscopy in chronic ethanol-treated mice. Chronic ethanol consumption decreased protein expression of LC3 lipidation-related proteins Atg3 and Atg7, and the lysosomal proteins lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 and Rab7, and increased the protein expression of calpain 1 and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin.

     "abstract": "The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the interaction of 5-HTTLPR and DRD4 exon III polymorphisms with gender in non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals while alternately taking ondansetron and sertraline. Evidence suggests that alcohol dependence may be influenced by a genetic interaction that may be gender-specific with temporal changes making pharmacological treatment with serotonergic drugs complex. The main trial was a within-subject double-blind placebo-controlled human laboratory study with 77 non-treatment-seeking AD individuals randomized (55 completed, 49 complete data) to receive 200\u00a0mg/day of sertraline or 0.5\u00a0mg/day of ondansetron for 3 weeks followed by an alcohol self-administration experiment (ASAE), then placebo for 3 weeks followed by a second ASAE, then receive the alternate drug, in a counterbalanced order, for 3 weeks followed by a third ASAE. Results for men were not significant. Women with the LL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving ondansetron and SS/SL 5-HTTLPR genotype receiving sertraline (matched), drank significantly fewer drinks per drinking day (DDD) during the 7 days prior to the first and third ASAEs than women receiving the mismatched medication (i.e., sertraline to LL and ondansetron to SS/SL). In a 3-way interaction, 5-HTTLPR alleles by DRD4 alleles by medications, women with the LL genotype who received ondansetron and had DRD4 \u22657 exon III repeats drank significantly fewer DDD as did SS/SL women who received sertraline but conversely had DRD4 <7 repeats in the 7-day period leading up to the first and third ASAEs. Consistent with these data was a significant reduction of milliliters consumed ad libitum during these same ASAEs. These exploratory findings add possible support to gender and genetic differences among AD individuals in response to serotonergic pharmacotherapies. Future trials should be powerful enough to take into account that endophenotypes and a targeting of serotonergic interactions may be essential to successfully treat alcohol dependence.",

     "abstract": "Prenatal ethanol exposure and prenatal stress can each cause long-lasting deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and disrupt learning and memory processes. However, the mechanisms underlying these perturbations following a learning event are still poorly understood. We examined the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure and prenatal stress exposure, either alone or in combination, on the cytosolic expression of activity-regulated cytoskeletal (ARC) protein and the synaptosomal expression of AMPA-glutamate receptor subunits (GluA1 and GluA2) in dentate gyrus of female adult offspring under baseline conditions and after 2-trial trace conditioning (TTTC). Surprisingly, baseline cytoplasmic ARC expression was significantly elevated in both prenatal treatment groups. In contrast, synaptosomal GluA1 receptor subunit expression was decreased in both prenatal treatment groups. GluA2 subunit expression was elevated in the prenatal stress group. TTTC did not alter ARC levels compared to an unpaired behavioral control (UPC) group in any of the 4 prenatal treatment groups. In contrast, TTTC significantly elevated both synaptosomal GluA1 and GluA2 subunit expression relative to the UPC group in control offspring, an effect that was not observed in any of the other 3 prenatal treatment groups. Given ARC's role in regulating synaptosomal AMPA receptors, these results suggest that prenatal ethanol-induced or prenatal stress exposure-induced increases in baseline ARC levels could contribute to reductions in both baseline and activity-dependent changes in AMPA receptors in a manner that diminishes the role of AMPA receptors in dentate gyrus synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-sensitive learning.",

For the second experiment, the videos were analyzed for wrestling, mounting, boxing, grooming, sniffing, and crawling over/under. AE animals were found to be less active and exploratory and engaged in fewer mounting behaviors compared to control animals.

We have investigated this possibility by administering clonidine to alcohol-drinking rats selectively bred for alcohol preference (P line). Clonidine is an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist which, at low doses, inhibits noradrenergic signaling by decreasing norepinephrine release from presynaptic noradrenergic neurons. Adult male P rats were given 24\u00a0h access to food and water and scheduled access to a 15% (v/v) alcohol solution for 2\u00a0h daily. Rats received intra-peritoneal (IP) injections with clonidine (0, 10, 20, 40, or 80\u00a0\u03bcg/kg body weight [BW], 10\u201311 rats/treatment group) once/day at 30\u00a0min prior to onset of the daily 2\u00a0h alcohol access period for 2 consecutive days. Clonidine, in doses of 40 or 80\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW, significantly reduced alcohol intake on both days of treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Two weeks later, rats were treated with clonidine for 5 consecutive days and clonidine, in doses of 40 or 80\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW, reduced alcohol intake on all 5 treatment days (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Clonidine did not alter water consumption during the daily 2\u00a0h free-choice between alcohol and water. In a separate group of male P rats, clonidine (40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg BW) suppressed intake of a saccharin solution (0.04\u00a0g/L). These results are consistent with and complement our previous findings that the \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist, prazosin, decreases voluntary alcohol drinking in alcohol-preferring rats, but suggests that effects of clonidine may not be specific for alcohol. The results suggest that although activation of the noradrenergic system plays an important role in mediating voluntary alcohol drinking, care is needed in selecting which drugs to use to suppress central noradrenergic signaling in order to maximize the selectivity of the drugs for treating alcohol-use disorders.",

     "abstract": "Salsolinol is formed non-enzymatically when ethanol-derived acetaldehyde binds to dopamine, yielding 2 distinct products, i.e., salsolinol and isosalsolinol. Early animal studies, revealing that salsolinol promotes alcohol consumption and recent evidence that animals will readily self-administer salsolinol into the posterior ventral tegmental area (p-VTA) together with the finding that salsolinol is able to induce conditioned place preference and to increase locomotor activity, have outlined a role of salsolinol in the behavioral and neurobiological actions of ethanol. Until recently, the only commercially available salsolinol was a mixture containing 85% salsolinol and 10\u201315% isosalsolinol. The possibility thus exists that either salsolinol or isosalsolinol explains the reinforcing properties of ethanol. We report here that a newly available salsolinol is free of isosalsolinol. Thus, salsolinol, free of isosalsolinol, was injected intracerebrally (30 pmol/0.2\u00a0\u03bcL, into the ventral tegmental area [VTA]) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (10\u00a0mg/kg) to na\u00efve rats bred as alcohol drinkers to study salsolinol's motivational effects and its role on voluntary ethanol intake. Salsolinol produced conditioned place preference and increased locomotor activity, whether injected intra-VTA or intraperitoneally. Following systemic (i.p.) administration of 10\u00a0mg/kg salsolinol, this molecule was detected in\u00a0vivo by microdialysis of neostriatum, reaching an estimated concentration of 100\u00a0nM in the dialyzate. These results indicate that systemically administered salsolinol is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Repeated administration of salsolinol sensitized rats to the locomotor activity and led to increases in voluntary ethanol consumption, which was prevented by intra-VTA pretreatment with naltrexone.",

While inhalants are often the initial \u201cdrug\u201d experienced during this period, alcohol is another substance readily abused by adolescent populations. Although both substances are thought to have similar actions within the brain, our understanding of the implications of adolescent inhalant abuse upon subsequent exposure to alcohol remains to be investigated. Thus, this study aimed to assess locomotor responses to acute ethanol and voluntary ethanol consumption following a period of toluene inhalation throughout adolescence/early adulthood. Adolescent male Wistar rats (postnatal day [PN] 27) inhaled air or toluene (3000\u00a0ppm) for 1\u00a0h/day, 3 days/week for 4 (PN 27\u201352) or 8 weeks (PN 27\u201380) to mimic the patterns observed in human inhalant abusers. Following the exposure period, cross-sensitization to acute ethanol challenge (0.5\u00a0g/kg, intra-peritoneally [i.p.]), and voluntary consumption of 20% ethanol in a chronic intermittent 2-bottle choice paradigm, were assessed. Hepatic ethanol and acetaldehyde metabolism and liver histopathology were also investigated. Chronic intermittent toluene (CIT) exposure throughout adolescence for up to 8 weeks did not alter the behavioral response to acute ethanol or voluntary consumption of ethanol in adulthood, although an age-dependent effect on ethanol consumption was observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Both liver function and pathology did not differ between treatment groups. Thus, in the paradigm employed, CIT exposure throughout adolescence and early adulthood did not predispose rats to subsequent locomotor sensitivity or voluntary consumption of ethanol in adulthood.",

The hypothalamus is a key brain region for food and water intake regulation as well as weight control, and is one of the alcohol-sensitive brain regions. However, it is not known what the alcohol effect is on the hypothalamus following adolescent alcohol intake, chronically over adolescent development, at moderate levels. We employed a model of chronic moderate alcohol intake from adolescence to adulthood in mice, and analyzed the effect of alcohol on growth and weight gain, as well as hypothalamic gene expression patterns. The results indicated that chronic alcohol consumption during adolescence, even at moderate levels, led to both a reduction in weight gain in mice, and considerable gene expression changes in the hypothalamus. Pathway analysis and real-time PCR identified the type II diabetes mellitus and the insulin-signaling pathways as being the hypothalamic pathways affected by chronic alcohol. Our findings from the mouse alcohol consumption study therefore serve as a potential warning against alcohol consumption during adolescence, such as in teens and college students.",

Planaria, a type of flatworm often considered to have the simplest \u2018brain,\u2019 is an invertebrate species especially amenable to the quantification of drug-induced behavioral responses and identification of conserved responses. Here, we investigated stereotypical and environmental place conditioning (EPC) effects of ethanol administered alone and in combination with cocaine. Planarians displayed concentration-related increases in C-shaped movements following exposure to ethanol (0.01\u20131%) (maximal effect: 9.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0C-shapes/5\u00a0min at 0.5%) or cocaine (0.1\u20135\u00a0mM) (maximal effect: 42.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0C-shapes/5\u00a0min at 5\u00a0mM). For combined administration, cocaine (0.1\u20135\u00a0mM) was tested with submaximal ethanol concentrations (0.01, 0.1%); the observed effect for the combination was enhanced compared to its predicted effect, indicating synergism for the interaction. The synergy with ethanol was specific for cocaine, as related experiments revealed that combinations of ethanol and nicotine did not result in synergy. For EPC experiments, ethanol (0.0001\u20131%) concentration-dependently increased EPC, with significant environmental shifts detected at 0.01 and 1%. Cocaine (0.001\u20131\u00a0\u03bcM) produced an inverted U-shaped concentration\u2013effect curve, with a significant environmental shift observed at 0.01\u00a0\u03bcM. For combined exposure, variable cocaine concentrations (0.001\u20131\u00a0\u03bcM) were administered with a statistically ineffective concentration of ethanol (0.0001%). For each concentration of cocaine, the environmental shift was enhanced by ethanol, with significance detected at 1\u00a0\u03bcM. Cocaethylene, a metabolite of cocaine and ethanol, also produced C-shapes and EPC. Lidocaine (0.001\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM), an anesthetic and analog of cocaine, did not produce EPC or C-shaped movements. Evidence from planarians that ethanol produces place-conditioning effects and motor dysfunction, and interacts synergistically with cocaine, suggests that aspects of ethanol neuropharmacology are conserved across species.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that administration of standardized extracts of S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza selectively reduced excessive alcohol drinking and relapse-like drinking in selectively bred Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) rats. The present study was designed to extend these findings on the \u201canti-alcohol\u201d properties of S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza extracts to operant procedures of oral alcohol self-administration. Two independent groups of sP rats were trained to lever-respond on an FR4 schedule of reinforcement for alcohol (15%, v/v) or sucrose (1\u20133%, w/v) in daily 30 min sessions. Once responding had stabilized, rats were tested under the fixed ratio 4 (FR4) schedule of reinforcement (index of alcohol reinforcing properties) and the progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement (index of alcohol motivational properties). Treatment with S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza extract (0, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg, intragastrically [i.g.]) markedly reduced lever responding for alcohol, amount of self-administered alcohol, and breakpoint for alcohol (defined as the lowest response requirement not achieved in the PR experiment). No dose of S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza extract altered any parameter of sucrose self-administration. These results a) demonstrate that treatment with S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza extract selectively reduced the reinforcing and motivational properties of alcohol in sP rats and b) extend to operant procedures of alcohol self-administration previous data on the \u201canti-alcohol\u201d effects of S.\u00a0miltiorrhiza extracts.

     "abstract": "Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) describes a wide range of phenotypic defects affecting facial and neurological development associated with ethanol teratogenicity. It affects approximately 1 in 100 children born in the United States each year. Genetic predisposition along with timing and dosage of ethanol exposure are critical in understanding the prevalence and variability of FASD. The zebrafish attributes of external fertilization, genetic tractability, and high fecundity make it a powerful tool for FASD studies. However, a lack of consensus of ethanol treatment paradigms has limited the interpretation of these various studies. Here we address this concern by examining ethanol tissue concentrations across timing and genetic background. We utilize headspace gas chromatography to determine ethanol concentration in the AB, fli1:EGFP, and Tu backgrounds. In addition, we treated these embryos with ethanol over two different developmental time windows, 6\u201324\u00a0h post fertilization (hpf) and 24\u201348 hpf. Our analysis demonstrates that embryos rapidly equilibrate to a sub-media level of ethanol. Embryos then maintain this level of ethanol for the duration of exposure. The ethanol tissue concentration level is independent of genetic background, but is timing-dependent. Embryos exposed from 6 to 24 hpf were 2.7\u20134.2-fold lower than media levels, while embryos were 5.7\u20136.2-fold lower at 48 hpf. This suggests that embryos strengthen one or more barriers to ethanol as they develop. In addition, both the embryo and, to a lesser extent, the chorion, surrounding the embryo are barriers to ethanol. Overall, this work will help tighten ethanol treatment regimens and strengthen zebrafish as a model of FASD.",

The activity of salivary alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) comes from oral microbiota, mucosa, and salivary glands. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of ADH in the oral health pathology of smoking (AS) and non-smoking (ANS) alcohol-dependent males. The results indicated that the AS group had a more significant and longer duration (until the 30th day of alcohol abstinence) decrease in ADH activity and output than the ANS group (until the 15th day of alcohol abstinence) compared to controls (social drinkers; C). The decreased salivary flow (SF) in alcoholics was observed longer in the ANS group (until the 30th day of alcohol abstinence), whereas in the AS group SF normalized at the 15th day, probably due to the irritating effect of tobacco smoke on the oral mucosa. Because saliva was centrifuged to remove cells and debris (including microbial cells), the detected salivary ADH activity was derived from salivary glands and/or oral mucosa. A more profound and longer decrease in ADH activity/output in smoking than non-smoking alcoholics was likely due to the damaged salivary glands and/or oral mucosa, caused by the synergistic effect of alcohol drinking and smoking. The lower values of salivary ADH in smoking than non-smoking alcoholics might also be partly due to the reversed/inhibited ADH reaction by high levels of accumulated acetaldehyde.",

In recent years, growing evidence has shown the negative consequences of alcohol binge drinking on the adolescent and young human brain. However, the effects of cessation of binge drinking on brain function remain unexplored. The objective of the present study was to examine brain activity during response execution and inhibition in young binge drinkers in relation to the progression of their drinking habits over time. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by a Go/NoGo task were recorded twice within a 2-year interval in 57 undergraduate students (25 controls, 22 binge drinkers, and 10 ex-binge drinkers) with no personal or family history of alcoholism or psychopathological disorders. The results showed that the amplitude of NoGo-P3 over the frontal region correlated with an earlier age of onset of regular drinking as well as with greater quantity and speed of alcohol consumption. Regression analysis showed that NoGo-P3 amplitude was significantly predicted by the speed of alcohol intake and the age of onset of regular drinking. The group comparisons showed that, after maintaining a binge drinking pattern for at least 2 years, binge drinkers displayed significantly larger NoGo-P3 amplitudes than controls, whereas ex-binge drinkers were in an intermediate position between the two other groups (with no significant differences with respect to controls or binge drinkers). These findings suggest that binge drinking in young people may impair the neural functioning related to inhibitory processes, and that the cessation of binge drinking may act as a brake on the neurophysiological impairments related to response inhibition.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol consumption produces a complex array of effects that can be divided into two types: the explicit pharmacological effects of ethanol (which can be temporally separate from time of intake) and the more temporally \u201crelevant\u201d effects (primarily olfactory and taste) that bridge the time from intake to onset of the pharmacological effects. Intravenous (IV) self-administration of ethanol limits the confounding \u201cnon-pharmacological\u201d effects associated with oral consumption, allows for controlled and precise dosing, and bypasses first order absorption kinetics, allowing for more direct and better-controlled assessment of alcohol's effect on the brain. IV ethanol self-administration has been reliably demonstrated in mouse and human experimental models; however, models of IV self-administration have been historically problematic in the rat. An operant multiple-schedule study design was used to elucidate the role of each component of a compound IV-ethanol plus oral-sucrose reinforcer. Male alcohol-preferring P rats had free access to both food and water during all IV self-administration sessions. Animals were trained to press a lever for orally delivered 1% sucrose (1S) on a fixed ratio 4 schedule, and then surgically implanted with an indwelling jugular catheter. Animals were then trained to respond on a multiple FR4-FR4 schedule composed of alternating 2.5-min components across 30-min sessions. For the multiple schedule, two components were used: an oral 1S only and an oral 1S plus IV 20% ethanol (25\u00a0mg/kg/injection). Average total ethanol intake was 0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0g/kg. We found significantly higher earning of sucrose-only reinforcers and greater sucrose-lever error responding relative to the compound oral-sucrose plus IV-ethanol reinforcer. These response patterns suggest that sucrose, not ethanol, was responsible for driving overall responding. The work with a compound IV ethanol-oral sucrose reinforcer presented here suggests that the existing intravenous ethanol self-administration methodology cannot overcome the aversive properties of ethanol via this route in the rat.",

Therefore, the present study examined CB1 antagonism in DBA/2J mice using an unbiased ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure, a paradigm that does not require ethanol ingestion. To evaluate the role of CB1 receptors in primary ethanol reward, the highly potent and selective novel CB1 antagonist 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoropropyl)-6,7-dihydro-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-f][1,4]oxazepin-8(5H)-one (PF 514273) was administered 30\u00a0min before place preference conditioning with a fixed dose of ethanol (acquisition).

Adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were tested 25 days after repeated exposure to ethanol (3.5\u00a0g/kg intragastrically [i.g.], every other day for a total of 11 exposures) in a modified social interaction test. Early-mid adolescent intermittent exposure (e-AIE) occurred between postnatal days (P) 25 and 45, whereas late adolescent intermittent exposure (l-AIE) was conducted between P45 and P65. Significant decreases in social investigation and social preference were evident in adult male rats, but not their female counterparts following e-AIE, whereas neither males nor females demonstrated these alterations following l-AIE. In contrast, both e-AIE and l-AIE produced alterations in sensitivity to acute ethanol challenge in males tested 25 days after adolescent exposure. Ethanol-induced facilitation of social investigation and play fighting, reminiscent of that normally seen during adolescence, was evident in adult males after e-AIE, whereas control males showed an age-typical inhibition of social behavior. Males after l-AIE were found to be insensitive to the socially suppressing effects of acute ethanol challenge, suggesting the development of chronic tolerance in these animals. In contrast, females showed little evidence for alterations in sensitivity to acute ethanol challenge following either early or late AIE. The results of the present study demonstrate a particular vulnerability of young adolescent males to long-lasting detrimental effects of repeated ethanol. Retention of adolescent-typical sensitivity to the socially facilitating effects of ethanol could potentially make ethanol especially appealing to these males, therefore promoting relatively high levels of ethanol intake later in life.",

Withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, may drive individuals to relapse, thus representing a significant barrier to recovery. Our lab previously identified an upregulation of the thalamic T-type calcium (T channel) isoform CaV3.2 as a potential contributor to the generation and propagation of seizures in a model of withdrawal. In the present study, we examined whether ethosuximide (ETX), a T-channel antagonist, could decrease the severity of ethanol withdrawal seizures by evaluating electrographical and behavioral correlates of seizure activity. DBA/2J mice were exposed to an intermittent ethanol exposure paradigm. Mice were treated with saline or ETX in each withdrawal period, and cortical EEG activity was recorded to determine seizure severity. We observed a progression in seizure activity with each successive withdrawal period. Treatment with ETX reduced ethanol withdrawal-induced spike and wave discharges (SWDs), in terms of absolute number, duration of events, and contribution to EEG power in the 6\u201310\u00a0Hz frequency range. We also evaluated the effects of ETX on handling-induced convulsions. Overall, we observed a decrease in handling-induced convulsion severity in mice treated with ETX. Our findings suggest that ETX may be a useful pharmacological agent for studies of alcohol withdrawal and treatment of resulting seizures.",

Basal activity of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is under the influence of GABAergic neurotransmission, and the aim of this study was to characterize the involvement of nAChRs in mediating acute ethanol effects on GABAergic activity in subregions of the brain reward system. Multi-electrode in\u00a0vivo recordings were made in the VTA and nAc of awake and behaving C57BL6/J mice receiving intraperitoneal injections of saline or ethanol (2.0\u00a0g/kg), combined with, or without, pre-injection of the non-competitive nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (1.0\u00a0mg/kg). Ethanol significantly decreased the activity of quinpirole-insensitive slow-spiking and fast-spiking units in both the VTA and the nAc as compared to saline injection. Pre-treatment with mecamylamine inhibited the rate-inhibiting properties of ethanol in the VTA, but not in the nAc. The data presented here show that ethanol depresses the activity of quinpirole-insensitive, putative GABAergic neurons, in the mesolimbic dopamine system of mice, and that nAChRs contribute to this modulation. This finding, taken together with previous microdialysis studies, supports an involvement of GABAergic neurons and nAChRs in ethanol's interaction with the mesolimbic dopamine system.",

The cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, particularly the type II regulatory subunit (RII), has been implicated in ethanol-induced molecular and behavioral responses in adults. Therefore, the current study examined cerebral cortical PKA in adolescent and adult ethanol responses. With the exception of early adolescence, PKA RII\u03b1 and RII\u03b2 subunit levels largely did not differ from adult levels in either whole cell lysate or P2 synaptosomal expression. However, following acute ethanol exposure, PKA RII\u03b2 P2 synaptosomal expression and activity were increased in adults, but not in adolescents. Behaviorally, intracerebroventricular administration of the PKA activator Sp-cAMP and inhibitor Rp-cAMP prior to ethanol administration increased adolescent sensitivity to the sedative-hypnotic effects of ethanol compared to controls. Sp-cAMP was ineffective in adults whereas Rp-cAMP suggestively reduced loss of righting reflex (LORR) with paralleled increases in blood ethanol concentrations. Overall, these data suggest that PKA activity modulates the sedative/hypnotic effects of ethanol and may potentially play a wider role in the differential ethanol responses observed between adolescents and adults.",

To this end, the effects of ethanol (0, 0.5, 1, and 2\u00a0g/kg, administered intra-gastrically [i.g.]) on ERK phosphorylation were assessed by pERK immunohistochemistry in the shell (AcbSh) and core (AcbC) of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) as well as in the prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex (PFCx), in the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BSTL) and in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA). Ethanol (1\u00a0g/kg) significantly increased pERK immunoreactivity in AcbSh and AcbC of sP but not sNP rats. Conversely, ethanol failed to affect pERK expression in PrL and IL PFCx as well as in BSTL and CeA of both sP and sNP rats.

Chronic ethanol exposure alters programming of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in a myriad of neurochemical and behavioral alterations in postnatal life. Based on a recent study which showed that human intra-partum fetal stress increased fetal secretion of corticosterone, the non-dominant glucocorticoid, this investigation tested the hypothesis that an established model of HPA axis programming, chronic maternal ethanol administration to the pregnant guinea pig, would result in preferential elevation of corticosterone, which is also the non-dominant glucocorticoid. Starting on gestational day (GD) 2, guinea pigs received oral administration of ethanol (4\u00a0g/kg maternal body weight/day) or isocaloric-sucrose/pair-feeding. Each treatment was administered daily and continued until GD 45, 55, or 65 (approximately 3 days pre-term), when pregnant animals were euthanized and fetuses delivered by Caesarean section. Maternal and fetal plasma samples were collected. After sample preparation (protein precipitation and C-18 solid phase extraction), plasma cortisol and corticosterone concentrations were determined simultaneously by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. As predicted, chronic ethanol exposure increased both fetal and maternal plasma corticosterone concentration in late gestation. In contrast, plasma cortisol did not differ across maternal treatments in maternal or fetal samples. The plasma concentration of both maternal glucocorticoids increased with gestational age. Thus, corticosterone, the non-dominant glucocorticoid, but not cortisol, was elevated by chronic ethanol exposure, which may have effects on HPA function in later life.",

Aberrant fetal programming during gestational alcohol exposure is a possible mechanism by which alcohol imparts teratogenic effects on the brain; however, current methods used to investigate the effects of alcohol on development often rely on either direct application of alcohol in\u00a0vitro or acute high doses in\u00a0vivo. In this study, we used our established moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) model, resulting in maternal blood alcohol content of approximately 20\u00a0mM, and subsequent ex\u00a0vivo cell culture to assess expression of genes related to neurogenesis. Proliferating and differentiating neural progenitor cell culture conditions were established from telencephalic tissue derived from embryonic day (E) 15\u201317 tissue exposed to alcohol via maternal drinking throughout pregnancy. Gene expression analysis on mRNA derived in\u00a0vitro was performed using a microarray, and quantitative PCR was conducted for genes to validate the microarray. Student's t tests were performed for statistical comparison of each exposure under each culture condition using a 95% confidence interval. Eleven percent of genes on the array had significantly altered mRNA expression in the prenatal alcohol-exposed neural progenitor culture under proliferating conditions. These include reduced expression of Adora2a, Cxcl1, Dlg4, Hes1, Nptx1, and Vegfa and increased expression of Fgf13, Ndn, and Sox3; bioinformatics analysis indicated that these genes are involved in cell growth and proliferation. Decreased levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a were also found under proliferating conditions. Under differentiating conditions, 7.3% of genes had decreased mRNA expression; these include Cdk5rap3, Gdnf, Hey2, Heyl, Pard6b, and Ptn, which are associated with survival and differentiation as indicated by bioinformatics analysis. This study is the first to use chronic low to moderate PAE, to more accurately reflect maternal alcohol consumption, and subsequent neural progenitor cell culture to demonstrate that PAE throughout gestation alters expression of genes involved in neural development and embryonic neurogenesis.",

We have previously shown that exposure of bronchial epithelial cells to malondialdehyde-acetaldehyde (MAA) adducted protein increases protein kinase C (PKC) activity and proinflammatory cytokine release. A specific ligand to scavenger receptor A (SRA), fucoidan, blocks this effect. We hypothesized that MAA-adducted protein binds to bronchial epithelial cells via SRA. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were exposed to MAA-adducted protein (either bovine serum albumin [BSA-MAA] or surfactant protein D [SPD-MAA]) and SRA examined using confocal microscopy, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS), and immunoprecipitation. Differentiated mouse tracheal epithelial cells (MTEC) cultured by air-liquid interface were assayed for MAA-stimulated PKC activity and keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) release. Specific cell surface membrane dye co-localized with upregulated SRA after exposure to MAA for 3\u20137\u00a0min and subsided by 20\u00a0min. Likewise, MAA-adducted protein co-localized to SRA from 3 to 7\u00a0min with a subsequent internalization of MAA by 10\u00a0min. These results were confirmed using FACS analysis and revealed a reduced mean fluorescence of SRA after 3\u00a0min. Furthermore, increased amounts of MAA-adducted protein could be detected by Western blot in immunoprecipitated SRA samples after 3\u00a0min treatment with MAA. MAA stimulated PKC\u03b5-mediated KC release in wild type, but not SRA knockout mice. These data demonstrate that aldehyde-adducted proteins in the lungs rapidly bind to SRA and internalize this receptor prior to the MAA-adducted protein stimulation of PKC-dependent inflammatory cytokine release in airway epithelium.",

BALB/c mice were administered approximately 1\u00a0g/kg body weight of ethanol by gavage, and contact hypersensitivity (CHS) or active cutaneous anaphylaxis (ACA) was induced. Spleens were collected 24\u00a0h after the elicitation of CHS and mRNA expressions of interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. Alcohol-containing diet exaggerated spontaneous dermatitis in conventional NC/Nga mice and contact hypersensitivity in BALB/c mice. Ethanol administered by gavage for 5 days enhanced contact hypersensitivity in BALB/c mice. Ethanol administration with gavage also enhanced ACA of BALB/c mice. Ethanol did not affect mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4, but did enhance IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 mRNA expression. Histological evaluation revealed an absence of hepatic steatosis in mice administered ethanol by gavage for 5 days. In ethanol-administered mice, inflamed areas presented as lesions or a local extreme accumulation of mononuclear cells in the epidermis. These findings suggest that ethanol enhances the expression of inflammatory cytokines independently from T helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokine phenotypes, causing abnormalities in the epidermis resulting in exacerbated allergic reactivity.",

     "abstract": "Characteristics of individuals with severe alcohol use disorders include heightened cue sensitivity, compulsive seeking, craving, and continued alcohol use in the face of negative consequences. Animal models are useful for understanding behavioral and neurological mechanisms underlying problematic alcohol use. Seeking of operant reinforcers including alcohol is processed by two mechanisms, commonly referred to as \u201cgoal-directed\u201d (action-outcome) and \u201chabitual\u201d (stimulus-response). As substance use disorders are characterized by continued use regardless of unfavorable outcomes, it is plausible that drug use causes an unnatural disruption of these mechanisms. We present a critical analysis of literature pertaining to behavioral neuroscience alcoholism research involving habit formation.Traditionally, when operant behavior is unaffected by a loss of subjective value of a reinforcer (devaluation), the behavior is considered habitual. Acquisition of instrumental behavior requires corticostriatal mechanisms that depend heavily on the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, whereas practiced behavior is more predominantly controlled by the dorsal striatum. Dopaminergic signaling is necessary for the neurological adaptations involved in stimulus-response action, and drugs of abuse appear to facilitate habitual behavior through high levels of dopamine release. Evidence suggests that the use of alcohol as a reinforcer expedites habit formation, and that a history of alcohol use produces alterations in striatal morphology, aids habit learning for non-psychoactive reinforcers, and promotes alcohol drinking despite aversive adulterants.In this review, we suggest directions for future alcoholism research that seeks to measure action made despite a devalued outcome, including procedural modifications and genotypic, pharmacological, or neurological manipulations. Most alcoholism models currently in use fail to reach substantial blood ethanol concentrations, a shortcoming that may be alleviated through the use of high-drinking rodent lines. Additionally, satiety, one common mechanism of devaluing reinforcers, is not recommended for alcohol research because the psychoactive effects of alcohol depress response rates, mimicking devaluation effects. Overall, further research of habit formation and potentially related perseverative behaviors could be invaluable in discovering genetic variance, traits that correlate with persistent alcohol seeking, implicated neural structures and processes of alcohol use, and eventually novel pharmacological treatment for alcoholism.",

     "abstract": "Instrumental behavior can shift from flexible, goal-directed actions to automatic, stimulus-response actions. The satiety-specific devaluation test assesses behavioral flexibility by evaluating reward seeking after temporary devaluation of the reinforcer via satiety; a decrease in responding compared to control conditions indicates goal-directed behavior. We have observed variability in the outcome of this test that may be dependent on the reinforcer. Another test of habit, contingency degradation, involves changing the action-outcome association over the course of retraining and determines whether reward seeking is sensitive to changing contingencies. We hypothesized that the outcome of the contingency-degradation test would remain consistent across reinforcers, while the satiety-specific devaluation test may vary across reinforcers because it depends on the ability of the reinforcer to induce satiety. Therefore, we trained rats to self-administer 1.5% sucrose, 10% sucrose, 10% ethanol, or 10\u00a0mM monosodium glutamate (MSG) on a fixed-ratio (FR5) schedule that has been shown to promote long-term, goal-directed responding. Next, behavioral flexibility was evaluated in three satiety-specific devaluation tests over 6 weeks. Finally, we investigated reward seeking after contingency-degradation training. All groups displayed sensitivity to satiety-specific devaluation in the first test, indicating goal-directed behavior. While the 10% sucrose and ethanol groups remained goal-directed, the 1.5% sucrose and MSG groups exhibited habit-like behavior in later tests. Nevertheless, all groups displayed decreased responding in an extinction session after contingency-degradation training, indicating goal-directed behavior. These results demonstrate that tests of behavioral flexibility can yield dissimilar results in the same rats. Next, rats from the 1.5% sucrose group underwent the entire experiment again, now self-administering 10% sucrose. These rats showed pronounced goal-directed behavior in satiety-specific and contingency-degradation tests under 10% sucrose conditions, further suggesting that the reinforcer solution affected the outcome of the satiety-specific devaluation test. We conclude that reinforcer characteristics should be considered when investigating habit-like behavior in alcohol research.",

     "abstract": "It has become clear that adolescence is a period of distinct responsiveness to the acute effects of ethanol on learning and other cognitive functions. However, the effects of repeated intermittent ethanol exposure during adolescence on learning and cognition are less well studied, and other effects of repeated ethanol exposure such as withdrawal and chronic tolerance complicate such experiments. Moreover, few studies have compared the effects of repeated ethanol exposure during adolescence and adulthood, and they have yielded mixed outcomes that may be related to methodological differences and/or secondary effects of ethanol on behavioral performance. One emerging question is whether relatively brief intermittent ethanol exposure (i.e., sub-chronic exposure) during adolescence or adulthood might alter learning at a time after exposure when chronic tolerance would be expected, and whether tolerance to the cognitive effects of ethanol might influence the effect of ethanol on learning at that time. To address this, male adolescent and adult rats were pre-treated with sub-chronic daily ethanol (five doses [4.0\u00a0g/kg, i.p.] or saline at 24-h intervals, across 5 days). Two days after the last pre-exposure, spatial learning was assessed on 4 consecutive days using the Morris water maze. Half of the animals from each treatment cell received ethanol (2.0\u00a0g/kg, i.p.) 30\u00a0min prior to each testing session and half of the animals received saline. Ethanol pre-exposure altered water maze performance in adult animals but not in adolescents, and acute ethanol exposure impaired learning in animals of both ages independent of pre-exposure condition. There was no evidence of cognitive tolerance in animals of either age group. These results indicate that a relatively short period of intermittent ethanol exposure during adulthood, but not adolescence, promotes thigmotaxis in the water maze shortly after pre-exposure but does not induce cognitive tolerance to the effects of ethanol in either age group.",

Both physical activity and alcohol drinking are potentially reinforcing and may be more strongly associated among individuals who tend to be higher in reward seeking and related processes governed by the prefrontal cortex. Thus, behaviors linked to the prefrontal cortex, such as impulsivity, may influence the association between physical activity and alcohol intake. The present study therefore evaluated dimensions of impulsivity as moderators of the association between physical activity and alcohol consumption. We surveyed 198 undergraduate students and obtained self-reports of their drinking habits, physical activity, and dimensions of impulsivity. We found that moderate but not vigorous physical activity was positively associated with drinking. Linear regression analyses were used to evaluate dimensions of impulsivity as moderators of the association between physical activity (vigorous or moderate) and drinks per week. Results revealed a consistent pattern of interactions between the positive urgency and sensation seeking dimensions of impulsivity and moderate physical activity on number of drinks per week. For both interactions, there was a significant positive association between moderate physical activity and drinking at higher but not lower levels of impulsivity. We conclude that impulsivity moderates the positive association between physical activity and alcohol consumption.

     "abstract": "Ethanol induces appetitive, aversive, and anxiolytic effects that are involved in the development of ethanol use and dependence. Because early ethanol exposure produces later increased responsiveness to ethanol, considerable effort has been devoted to analysis of ethanol's appetitive and aversive properties during early ontogeny. Yet, there is a relative scarcity of research related to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol during early infancy, perhaps explained by a lack of age-appropriate tests. The main aim of this study was to validate a model for the assessment of ethanol's anxiolytic effects in the infant rat (postnatal days 13\u201316). The potentially anxiolytic effects of ethanol tested included: i) amelioration of conditioned place aversion, ii) ethanol intake in the presence of an aversive conditioned stimulus, iii) the inhibitory behavioral effect in an anxiogenic environment, and iv) innate aversion to a brightly illuminated area in a modified light/dark paradigm. Ethanol doses employed across experiments were 0.0, 0.5, and 2.0\u00a0g/kg. Results indicated that a low ethanol dose (0.5\u00a0g/kg) was effective in attenuating expression of a conditioned aversion. Ethanol intake, however, was unaffected by simultaneous exposure to an aversive stimulus. An anxiogenic environment diminished ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation. Finally, animals given 0.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol and evaluated in a light/dark box showed increased time spent in the illuminated area and increased latency to escape from the brightly lit compartment than rats treated with a higher dose of ethanol or vehicle. These new results suggest that ethanol doses as low as 0.5\u00a0g/kg are effective in ameliorating an aversive and/or anxiogenic state in preweanling rats. These behavioral preparations can be used to assess ethanol's anxiolytic properties during early development.",

     "abstract": "To date, no screening tools for alcohol withdrawal syndromes (AWS) have been validated in the medically ill. Although several tools quantify the severity of AWS (e.g., Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol [CIWA]), none identify subjects at risk of AWS, thus missing the opportunity for timely prophylaxis. Moreover, there are no validated tools for the prediction of complicated (i.e., moderate to severe) AWS in the medically ill.Our goals were (1) to conduct a systematic review of the published literature on AWS to identify clinical factors associated with the development of AWS, (2) to use the identified factors to develop a tool for the prediction of alcohol withdrawal among patients at risk, and (3) to conduct a pilot study to assess the validity of the tool.For the creation of the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale (PAWSS), we conducted a systematic literature search using PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines for clinical factors associated with the development of AWS, using PubMed, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Databases. Eligibility criteria included: (i) manuscripts dealing with human subjects, age 18 years or older, (ii) manuscripts directly addressing descriptions of AWS or its predisposing factors, including case reports, naturalistic case descriptions, and all types of clinical trials (e.g., randomized, single-blind, or open label studies), (iii) manuscripts describing characteristics of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and (iv) manuscripts dealing with animal data (which were considered only if they directly dealt with variables described in humans). Obtained data were used to develop the Prediction of Alcohol Withdrawal Severity Scale, in order to assist in the identification of patients at risk for complicated AWS.A pilot study was conducted to assess the new tool's psychometric qualities on patients admitted to a general inpatient medicine unit over a 2-week period, who agreed to participate in the study. Blind to PAWSS results, a separate group of researchers retrospectively examined the medical records for evidence of AWS.The search produced 2802 articles describing factors potentially associated with increased risk for AWS, increased severity of withdrawal symptoms, and potential characteristics differentiating subjects with various forms of AWS. Of these, 446 articles met inclusion criteria and underwent further scrutiny, yielding a total of 233 unique articles describing factors predictive of AWS. A total of 10 items were identified as correlated with complicated AWS (i.e., withdrawal hallucinosis, withdrawal-related seizures, and delirium tremens) and used to construct the PAWSS. During the pilot study, a total of 68 subjects underwent evaluation with PAWSS. In this pilot sample the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of PAWSS were 100%, using the threshold score of\u00a04.The results of the literature search identified 10 items which may be correlated with risk for complicated AWS. These items were assembled into a tool to assist in the identification of patients at risk: PAWSS. The results of this pilot study suggest that PAWSS may be useful in identifying risk of complicated AWS in medically ill, hospitalized individuals. PAWSS is the first validated tool for the prediction of severe AWS in the medically ill and its use may aid in the early identification of patients at risk for complicated AWS, allowing for prophylaxis against AWS before severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes develop.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol increases the risk of injuring oneself and others. However, following an injury there appears to be a benefit to alcohol in mediating the body's response to a traumatic injury and reducing mortality. The physiological mechanism underlying this reported association is poorly understood. One approach to explaining the pathways by which alcohol affects acute mortality following a traumatic injury is to identify differential prevalence of medical complications associated with increased mortality. The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between blood alcohol concentration and complications subsequent to a traumatic injury that are associated with increased in-hospital mortality. This study involved a retrospective analysis of traumatic injuries occurring between 2000 and 2009 as reported by all level I and II trauma units in the state of Illinois. The study includes all patients with blood alcohol toxicological examination levels ranging from zero to 500\u00a0mg/dL and meeting additional inclusion criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a084,974). A reduction in complications of cardiac and renal function by 23.5% and 30.0%, respectively, was attributable to blood alcohol concentration. In addition, blood alcohol concentration was associated with fewer cases of pneumothorax and convulsions. However, blood alcohol concentration continued to be positively associated with aspiration pneumonitis and acute pancreatitis in the final models. The net impact of alcohol following an injury is protective, largely attributable to a reduction in complications relating to cardiac and renal function. This study helps to explain the observed protective effect from blood alcohol concentrations in reducing in-hospital mortality after an injury, as reported in many studies.",

The P line of rats meets all of the originally proposed criteria for a suitable animal model of alcoholism.

Previous rodent models of alcohol consumption largely failed to demonstrate that animals were patterning drinking in such a way as to experience intoxication. Therefore, few rodent models of binge-like drinking and no specifically genetic models were available to study possible predisposing genes. The High Drinking in the Dark (HDID) selective breeding project was started to help fill this void, with HDID mice selected for reaching high blood alcohol levels in a limited access procedure. HDID mice now represent a genetic model of drinking to intoxication and can be used to help answer questions regarding predisposition toward this trait as well as potential correlated responses.

     "abstract": "Binge alcohol drinking continues to be a public health concern among today's youth and young adults. Moreover, an early onset of alcohol use, which usually takes the form of binge drinking, is associated with a greater risk for developing alcohol use disorders. Given this, it is important to examine this behavior in rat models of alcohol abuse and dependence. Toward that end, the objective of this article is to review findings on binge-like drinking by selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) and high-alcohol-drinking (HAD) lines of rats. As reviewed elsewhere in this special issue, the P line meets all, and the HAD line meets most, of the proposed criteria for an animal model of alcoholism. One model of binge drinking is scheduled ethanol access during the dark cycle, which has been used by our laboratory for over 20 years. Our laboratory has also adopted a protocol involving the concurrent presentation of multiple ethanol concentrations. When this protocol is combined with limited access, ethanol intake is maximized yielding blood ethanol levels (BELs) in excess, sometimes greatly in excess, of 80\u00a0mg%. By extending these procedures to include multiple scheduled ethanol access sessions during the dark cycle for 5 consecutive days/week, P and HAD rats consume in 3 or 4\u00a0h as much as, if not more than, the amount usually consumed in a 24\u00a0h period. Under certain conditions, using the multiple scheduled access procedure, BELs exceeding 200\u00a0mg% can be achieved on a daily basis. An overview of findings from studies with other selectively bred, inbred, and outbred rats places these findings in the context of the existing literature. Overall, the findings support the use of P and HAD rats as animal models to study binge-like alcohol drinking and reveal that scheduled access procedures will significantly increase ethanol intake by other rat lines and strains as well.",

     "abstract": "This review provides an overview of an animal model of binge-like ethanol drinking that has come to be called \u201cdrinking in the dark\u201d (DID), a procedure that promotes high levels of ethanol drinking and pharmacologically relevant blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) in ethanol-preferring strains of mice. Originally described by Rhodes, Best, Belknap, Finn, and Crabbe (2005), the most common variation of the DID procedure, using singly housed mice, involves replacing the water bottle with a bottle containing 20% ethanol for 2\u20134\u00a0h, beginning 3\u00a0h into the dark cycle. Using this procedure, high ethanol drinking strains of mice (e.g., C57BL/6J) typically consume enough ethanol to achieve BECs greater than 100\u00a0mg/dL and to exhibit behavioral evidence of intoxication. This limited access procedure takes advantage of the time in the animal's dark cycle in which the levels of ingestive behaviors are high, yet high ethanol intake does not appear to stem from caloric need. Mice have the choice of drinking or avoiding the ethanol solution, eliminating the stressful conditions that are inherent in other models of binge-like ethanol exposure in which ethanol is administered by the experimenter, and in some cases, potentially painful. The DID procedure is a high throughput approach that does not require extensive training or the inclusion of sweet compounds to motivate high levels of ethanol intake. The high throughput nature of the DID procedure makes it useful for rapid screening of pharmacological targets that are protective against binge-like drinking and for identifying strains of mice that exhibit binge-like drinking behavior. Additionally, the simplicity of DID procedures allows for easy integration into other paradigms, such as prenatal ethanol exposure and adolescent ethanol drinking. It is suggested that the DID model is a useful tool for studying the neurobiology and genetics underlying binge-like ethanol drinking, and may be useful for studying the transition to ethanol dependence.",

     "abstract": "One of the major challenges in preclinical studies of alcohol abuse and dependence remains the development of paradigms that will elicit high ethanol intake and mimic the progressive transition from low or moderate social drinking to excessive alcohol consumption. Exposure of outbred rats to repeated cycles of free-choice ethanol intake and withdrawal with the use of intermittent access to 20% ethanol in a 2-bottle choice procedure (IA2BC) has been shown to induce a gradual escalation of voluntary ethanol intake and preference, eventually reaching ethanol consumption levels of 5\u20136\u00a0g/kg/24\u00a0h, and inducing pharmacologically relevant blood ethanol concentrations (BECs). This procedure has recently been gaining popularity due to its simplicity, high validity, and reliable outcomes. Here we review experimental and methodological data related to IA2BC, and discuss the usefulness and advantages of this procedure as a valuable pre-training method for initiating operant ethanol self-administration of high ethanol intake, as well as conditioned place preference (CPP). Despite some limitations, we provide evidence that IA2BC and related operant procedures provide the possibility to operationalize multiple aspects of alcohol abuse and addiction in a rat model, including transition from social-like drinking to excessive alcohol consumption, binge drinking, alcohol seeking, relapse, and neuroadaptations related to excessive alcohol intake. Hence, IA2BC appears to be a useful and relevant procedure for preclinical evaluation of potential therapeutic approaches against alcohol abuse disorders.",

This compulsive drive for alcohol, defined by resistance to adverse and deleterious consequences, represents a major challenge when attempting to treat alcoholism clinically. Thus, there has long been interest in developing pre-clinical rodent models for the compulsive drug use that characterizes drug addiction. Here, we review recent studies that have attempted to model compulsive aspects of alcohol and cocaine intake in rodents, and consider technical and conceptual issues that need to be addressed when trying to recapitulate compulsive aspects of human addiction. Aversion-resistant alcohol intake has been examined by pairing intake or seeking with the bitter tastant quinine or with footshock, and exciting recent work has used these models to identify neuroadaptations in the amygdala, cortex, and striatal regions that promote compulsive intake. Thus, rodent models do seem to reflect important aspects of compulsive drives that sustain human addiction, and will likely provide critical insights into the molecular and circuit underpinnings of aversion-resistant intake as well as novel therapeutic interventions for compulsive aspects of addiction.",

     "abstract": "Schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) is generated by subjecting a highly motivated animal to a sub-optimal rate of food reinforcement while also providing access to a fluid. SIP is one of several adjunctive (or displacement) behaviors that are expressed in an exaggerated form that is deemed \u2018excessive.\u2019 This feature makes SIP an attractive model for studying an excessive ethanol drinking phenotype in rodents. Multiple experimental variables are crucial for the full manifestation of adjunctive drinking, including the degree of food deprivation, the inter-pellet interval selected, and the size of the food reward offered. Although these variables were extensively studied and optimized for water polydipsia in rats, a similarly customized approach to ethanol SIP and application of the procedure in mice have largely been curtailed in favor of the default variable values historically used for water SIP in rats. Further, ethanol SIP also requires careful consideration of variables such as taste and ethanol concentration. Investigation of the stress axis and neurochemical systems such as dopamine and serotonin in mediating adjunctive drinking stemmed from two leading hypotheses regarding the underlying mechanisms of SIP generation: 1) SIP as a coping strategy to mitigate stress associated with the aversive environmental condition, and 2) SIP as a displacement of reward in a highly motivated animal. Ethanol SIP is a powerful model of excessive intake because it can generate an ethanol-dependent state and sustain frequent and intoxicating levels of blood ethanol with voluntary oral consumption. The required food deprivation and the loss of the excessive drinking phenotype following removal of the generator schedule are the two main limitations of the model. Future utility of ethanol SIP will be enhanced by more fully dissecting the underlying hormonal and neurochemical mechanisms and optimizing experimental variables for ethanol SIP on a per species and strain basis.",

     "abstract": "Alcoholism (alcohol dependence) is characterized by a compulsion to seek and ingest alcohol (ethanol), loss of control over intake, and the emergence of a negative emotional state during withdrawal. Animal models are critical in promoting our knowledge of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol dependence. Here, we review the studies involving operant alcohol self-administration in rat models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal with the focus on the alcohol vapor model. In 1996, the first articles were published reporting that rats made dependent on alcohol by exposure to alcohol vapors displayed increased operant alcohol self-administration during acute withdrawal compared with nondependent rats (i.e., not exposed to alcohol vapors). Since then, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that this model reliably produces physical and motivational symptoms of alcohol dependence. The functional roles of various systems implicated in stress and reward, including opioids, dopamine, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), glucocorticoids, neuropeptide Y (NPY), \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), norepinephrine, and cannabinoids, have been investigated in the context of alcohol dependence. The combination of models of alcohol withdrawal and dependence with operant self-administration constitutes an excellent tool to investigate the neurobiology of alcoholism. In fact, this work has helped lay the groundwork for several ongoing clinical trials for alcohol dependence. Advantages and limitations of this model are discussed, with an emphasis on what future directions of great importance could be.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol dependence continues to be an important health concern and animal models are critical to furthering our understanding of this complex disease. A hallmark feature of alcoholism is a significant increase in alcohol drinking over time. While several different animal models of excessive alcohol (ethanol) drinking exist for mice and rats, a growing number of laboratories are using a model that combines chronic ethanol exposure procedures with voluntary ethanol drinking with mice as experimental subjects. Primarily, these studies use a chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure pattern to render mice dependent and a 2-h limited access procedure to evaluate drinking behavior. Compared to non-dependent mice that also drink ethanol, the ethanol-dependent mice demonstrate significant increases in voluntary ethanol drinking. The increased drinking significantly elevates blood and brain ethanol concentrations compared to the non-dependent control mice. Studies report that the increased drinking by dependent mice is driven by neuroadaptations in glutamatergic and corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in different brain regions known to be involved in alcohol-related behaviors. The dysregulation of these systems parallels findings in human alcoholics and treatments that demonstrate efficacy in alcoholics can also reduce drinking in this model. Moreover, preclinical findings have informed the development of human clinical trials, further highlighting the translational potential of the model. As a result of these features, the CIE exposure and free-choice drinking model is becoming more widely used and promises to provide more insight into mechanisms of excessive drinking that may be important for developing treatments for human alcoholics. The salient features and possible future considerations for CIE exposure and free-choice drinking in mice are discussed.",

Alcohol intake was highly positively correlated with the time of the drinking session and averaged approximately 2\u00a0g/kg when the drinking session occurred during the 12th hour of the dark phase. Alcohol drinking during the 12th hour of the dark phase resulted in (a) blood alcohol levels averaging approximately 100\u00a0mg% and (b) severe signs of alcohol intoxication (e.g., impaired performance at a Rota-Rod task). The results of a series of additional experiments indicate that (a) both singular aspects of this paradigm (i.e., unpredictability of alcohol exposure and concurrent availability of multiple alcohol concentrations) contributed to this high alcohol intake, (b) alcohol intake followed a circadian rhythm, as it decreased progressively over the first 3\u00a0h of the light phase and then maintained constant levels until the beginning of the dark phase, and (c) sensitivity to time schedule was specific to alcohol, as it did not generalize to a highly palatable chocolate-flavored beverage. These results demonstrate that unpredictable, limited access to multiple alcohol concentrations may result in exceptionally high intakes of alcohol in sP rats, modeling \u2013 to some extent \u2013 human binge drinking.

     "abstract": "Understanding the psychological mechanisms and underlying neurobiology of relapse behavior is essential for improving the treatment of addiction. Because the neurobiology of relapse behavior cannot be well studied in patients, we must rely on appropriate animal models. The alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) is a phenomenon in laboratory animals that models a relapse-like drinking situation, providing excellent face and predictive validity. In rodents, relapse-like behavior is largely influenced by the genetic make-up of an animal. It is not clear which other factors are responsible for variability of this behavior, but there seems to be no correlation between levels of baseline alcohol intake and the occurrence, duration, and robustness of the ADE. Rats that undergo long-term alcohol drinking for several months with repeated deprivation phases develop a compulsive drinking behavior during a relapse situation, characterized by insensitivity to taste adulteration with quinine, a loss of circadian drinking patterns during relapse-like drinking, and a shift toward drinking highly concentrated alcohol solutions to rapidly increase blood alcohol concentrations and achieve intoxication. Some mouse strains also exhibit an ADE, but this is usually of shorter duration than in rats. However, compulsive drinking in mice during a relapse situation has yet to be demonstrated. We extend our review section with original data showing that during long-term alcohol consumption, mice show a decline in alcohol intake, and the ADE fades with repeated deprivation phases. Furthermore, anti-relapse compounds that produce reliable effects on the ADE in rats produce paradoxical effects in mice. We conclude that the rat provides a better model system to study alcohol relapse and putative anti-relapse compounds.",

Certain features of the resting EEG are altered in chronic alcoholics and their offspring, and have been proposed as biomarkers for alcoholism.

This study examined effects of the eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting paradigm and alcohol challenge on the spatial profile of spontaneous MEG and EEG oscillations. Whole-head MEG and scalp EEG signals were acquired simultaneously from healthy social drinkers (n\u00a0=\u00a017) who participated in both alcohol (0.6\u00a0g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55\u00a0g/kg for women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design.

High-resolution structural MRI images were additionally obtained from all participants and used to constrain distributed minimum norm inverse source power estimates. The spatial estimates of the main generator nodes were in agreement with studies using a combined fMRI-EEG approach. Alpha band oscillations dominated the spectral profile and their source was estimated to the medial parieto-occipital area. Power in theta and beta bands was weaker overall and their sources were estimated to a more focal medial prefrontal area. EO and EC manipulation most strongly modulated power in the alpha band, but a wide-band power increase was observed during the EC condition. Alcohol intoxication increased alpha power, particularly during the EC condition. Application of this methodology to cohorts of chronic alcoholics or individuals at risk could potentially provide insight into the neural basis of oscillatory differences that may be predictive of the vulnerability to alcoholism.",

Using a similar PD 7 binge alcohol exposure paradigm in B6 mice, we tested whether a single-day (PD 7 only) alcohol treatment produced place learning deficits in both adolescence and in adulthood, and further tested whether a more extended (3-day, PD 7\u20139) alcohol exposure would induce more severe and enduring deficits. B6 mice were given either 2 subcutaneous injections of alcohol (2.5\u00a0g/kg each) 2\u00a0h apart on PD 7 or on PD 7\u20139, and compared with controls that received saline vehicle injections and controls that received no injections.

Mice were given standard place training or random location training in the Morris water maze either as adolescents (PD 30\u201339) or adults (PD 70\u201379).

     "abstract": "Pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating frequently used to assess information processing in both humans and rodents. Both alcohol and stress exposure can modulate PPI, making it possible to assess how stress and alcohol interact to influence information processing. Humans with an increased genetic risk for alcoholism are more reactive to stressful situations compared to those without a family history, and alcohol may have stress-dampening effects for those with high genetic risk. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of stress, acute alcohol exposure, or both on PPI in male and female mice selectively bred for high- (HAP2) and low- (LAP2) alcohol preference. Experiment 1 assessed the effects of various doses of acute alcohol on PPI. Experiments 2 and 3 assessed the effect of 10 days of restraint stress on subsequent PPI tested at 30\u00a0min (Experiment 2) or 24\u00a0h (Experiment 3) following the termination of stress exposure. Experiment 3 also examined the effects of acute alcohol treatment (0.75\u00a0g/kg) on PPI in mice previously exposed to stress or no stress. Results indicate that 0.75 and 1.0\u00a0g/kg doses of alcohol increased PPI in HAP2 but not LAP2 mice. When PPI was tested 30\u00a0min after stress exposure, stressed HAP2 mice showed a trend toward decreased PPI and stressed LAP2 mice showed a trend toward increased PPI. The combination of stress and alcohol treatment did not alter PPI in either line 24\u00a0h following the termination of stress exposure, suggesting that alcohol does not ameliorate the effect of stress on PPI. Stressed LAP2 mice had increased basal circulating corticosterone on the final stress exposure day compared to non-stressed LAP2 mice, and no difference was found between stressed and non-stressed HAP2 mice. The results suggest that high genetic risk for alcoholism may be related to increased sensitivity to alcohol and stress effects on PPI, and this sensitivity could signify an endophenotype for increased genetic risk to develop alcoholism.",

     "abstract": "Andrographis paniculata (AP) is a traditional medicinal plant of Ayurveda. It grows widely in Asia and is\u00a0prescribed in the treatment of liver diseases. Here we have investigated the beneficial role of 14-deoxyandrographolide (14-DAG), a bioactive diterpenoid from AP, against alcoholic steatosis in rats. 14-DAG was extracted from aerial parts (leaves and stems) of AP. Rats were fed with ethanol for 8 weeks. Animals were treated with 14-DAG during the last 4 weeks of ethanol treatment. In\u00a0vitro studies were undertaken in a human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line culture. Hepatosteatosis was assessed from histopathological studies of liver sections. Acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, and triglyceride contents were determined using commercially available kits. Fatty acid synthesis was evaluated from incorporation of 1-14C acetate. Regulation of fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis were monitored with immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation studies. Ethanol exposure led to hepatotoxicity, as evident from the marked enhancement in the levels of AST and ALT. The values decreased almost to control levels in response to 14-DAG treatment. Results showed that ethanol feeding induced deactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that led to enhanced lipid synthesis and decreased fatty acid oxidation, culminating in hepatic fat accumulation. Treatment with 14-DAG activated AMPK through induction of cyclic AMP-protein kinase A pathway. Activation of AMPK was followed by down-regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthase, leading to suppression of lipogenesis. This was associated with up-regulation of sirtuin 1 and depletion of malonyl-CoA, in favor of increased fatty acid oxidation. 14-DAG controlled ethanol-induced hepatosteatosis by interfering with dysregulation of lipid metabolism. In conclusion, our results indicated that 14-DAG was capable of preventing the development of fatty liver through AMPK-mediated regulation of lipid metabolism. This finding supported the hepatoprotective role of 14-DAG, which might serve as a therapeutic option to alleviate hepatosteatosis in chronic alcoholism.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol abuse is associated with the development of fatty liver disease and also with significant osteopenia in both genders. In this study, we examined ethanol-induced pathology in response to diets with differing fat/carbohydrate ratios. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed intragastrically with isocaloric liquid diets. Dietary fat content was either 5% (high carbohydrate, HC) or 45% (high fat, HF), with or without ethanol (12\u201313\u00a0g/kg/day). After 14, 28, or 65 days, livers were harvested and analyzed. In addition, bone morphology was analyzed after 65 days. HC rats gained more weight and had larger fat pads than HF rats with or without ethanol. Steatosis developed in HC\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol (HC\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH) compared to HF\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol (HF\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH) rats, accompanied by increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis and increased nuclear carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but in the absence of effects on hepatic silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT-1) or nuclear sterol regulatory binding element protein (SREBP-1c). Ethanol reduced serum leptin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but not adiponectin. Over time, HC rats developed fatty liver independent of ethanol. FA degradation was significantly elevated by ethanol in both HC and HF groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). HF\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH rats had increased oxidative stress from 28 days, increased necrosis compared to HF controls and higher expression of cytochromes P450, CYP2E1, and CYP4A1 compared to HC\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast, HC\u00a0+\u00a0EtOH rats had no significant increase in oxidative stress until day 65 with no observed increase in necrosis. Unlike liver pathology, no dietary differences were observed on ethanol-induced osteopenia in HC compared to HF groups. These data demonstrate that interactions between diet composition and alcohol are complex, dependent on the length of exposure, and are an important influence in development of fatty liver injury. Importantly, it appears that diet composition does not affect alcohol-associated skeletal toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Alcoholism is associated with acute and long-term cognitive dysfunction including memory impairment, resulting in substantial disability and cost to society. Thus, understanding how ethanol impairs cognition is essential for developing treatment strategies to dampen its adverse impact. Memory processing is thought to involve persistent, use-dependent changes in synaptic transmission, and ethanol alters the activity of multiple signaling molecules involved in synaptic processing, including modulation of the glutamate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmitter systems that mediate most fast excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the brain. Effects on glutamate and GABA receptors contribute to ethanol-induced changes in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), forms of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie memory acquisition. In this paper, we review the effects of ethanol on learning-related forms of synaptic plasticity with emphasis on changes observed in the hippocampus, a brain region that is critical for encoding contextual and episodic memories. We also include studies in other brain regions as they pertain to altered cognitive and mental function. Comparison of effects in the hippocampus to other brain regions is instructive for understanding the complexities of ethanol's acute and long-term pharmacological consequences.",

The present study tested developing rats (5-day-old) in a novel operant technique to assess the degree of ethanol self-administration as a result of prenatal exposure to low ethanol doses during late gestation. On a single occasion during each of gestational days 17\u201320, pregnant rats were intragastrically administered ethanol 1\u00a0g/kg, or water (vehicle). On postnatal day 5, pups were tested on a novel operant conditioning procedure in which they learned to touch a sensor to obtain 0.1% saccharin, 3% ethanol, or 5% ethanol. Immediately after a 15-min training session, a 6-min extinction session was given in which operant behavior had no consequence. Pups were positioned on a smooth surface and had access to a touch-sensitive sensor. Physical contact with the sensor activated an infusion pump, which served to deliver an intraoral solution as reinforcement (Paired group). A Yoked control animal evaluated at the same time received the reinforcer when its corresponding Paired pup touched the sensor. Operant behavior to gain access to 3% ethanol was facilitated by prenatal exposure to ethanol during late gestation. In contrast, operant learning reflecting ethanol reinforcement did not occur in control animals prenatally exposed to water only. Similarly, saccharin reinforcement was not affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. These results suggest that in 5-day-old rats, prenatal exposure to a low ethanol dose facilitates operant learning reinforced by intraoral administration of a low-concentration ethanol solution. This emphasizes the importance of intrauterine experiences with ethanol in later susceptibility to drug reinforcement. The present operant conditioning technique represents an alternative tool to assess self-administration and seeking behavior during early stages of development.",

     "abstract": "Late prenatal exposure to ethanol recruits sensory processing of the drug and of its motivational properties, an experience that leads to heightened ethanol affinity. Recent studies indicate common sensory and neurobiological substrates between this drug and sweet tastants. Using a recently developed operant conditioning technique for infant rats, we examined the effects of prenatal ethanol history upon sucrose self-administration (postnatal days, PDs 14\u201317). Prior to the last conditioning session, a low (0.5\u00a0g/kg) or a high (2.5\u00a0g/kg) ethanol dose were paired with sucrose. The intention was to determine if ethanol would inflate or devalue the reinforcing capability of the tastant and if these effects are dependent upon prenatal ethanol history. Male and female pups prenatally exposed to ethanol (2.0\u00a0g/kg) responded more when reinforced with sucrose than pups lacking this antenatal experience. Independently of prenatal status, a low ethanol dose (0.5\u00a0g/kg) enhanced the reinforcing capability of sucrose while the highest dose (2.5\u00a0g/kg) seemed to ameliorate the motivational properties of the tastant. During extinction (PD 18), two factors were critical in determining persistence of responding despite reinforcement omission. Pups prenatally exposed to ethanol that subsequently experienced the low ethanol dose paired with sucrose, showed higher resistance to extinction. The effects here reported were not associated with differential blood alcohol levels across prenatal treatments. These results indicate that fetal ethanol experience promotes affinity for a natural sweet reinforcer and that low doses of ethanol are also capable of enhancing the positive motivational consequences of sucrose when ethanol and sucrose are paired during infancy.",

Exposure during this developmental window reveals a linear relationship between alcohol dose and spatial learning impairment in the context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE), a hippocampus-dependent variant of contextual fear conditioning. The purpose of the current report was to examine the effect of a range of alcohol doses administered during a narrower window, PND7-9, than previously reported (Experiment 1) and to begin to determine which memory processes involved in this task are impaired by developmental alcohol exposure (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, rats pups received a single day binge alcohol dose of either 2.75, 4.00, 5.25\u00a0g/kg/day or were sham-intubated (SI) from PND7-9. Conditioned freezing during the test day was evident in all dosing groups, except for Group 5.25\u00a0g, indicating no graded dose-related behavioral deficits with alcohol exposure limited to PND7-9. In Experiment 2, rat pups were exposed to the highest effective dose from Experiment 1 (5.25\u00a0g/kg/day) or were sham intubated over PND7-9. During training, rats remained in the conditioning context for 5-min following immediate shock delivery. During this test of post-shock freezing, both SI and alcohol-exposed rats given prior exposure to the conditioning context showed comparable freezing levels. Since alcohol-exposed rats showed normal post-shock freezing, deficits by these rats on the test day likely reflect a failure to consolidate or retrieve a context-shock association, rather than a deficit in hippocampal conjunctive processes (consolidation, pattern completion) that occur prior to shock on the training day. These findings illustrate the value of the CPFE for characterizing the separable memory processes that are impaired by neonatal alcohol exposure in this task.",

To that end, a DTI study was carried out on 35 alcohol-dependent subjects and 30 healthy male control subjects. Neuropsychological tests were assessed for visual processing skills and deficits were reported as raw dysfunction scores (rDyS). Reduced FA (fractional anisotropy) and increased MD (mean diffusivity) were observed bilaterally in inferior and superior fronto-occipital fasciculus (FOF) fiber bundles. A significant inverse correlation in rDyS and FA values was observed in these fiber tracts whereas a positive correlation of these scores was found with the MD values. Our results suggest that FOF fiber bundles linking the frontal lobe to occipital lobe might be related to visual processing skills. This is the first report of an alteration of the white matter microstructure of FOF fiber bundles that might have functional consequences for visual processing in alcohol-dependent subjects who exhibit no neurological complications.",

     "abstract": "Inbred mouse strains such as C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) and related strains have been used extensively to help identify genetic controls for a number of ethanol-related behaviors, including acute intoxication and sensitivity to repeated exposures. The disparate ethanol drinking behaviors of B6 mice expressing high-drinking/preference and D2 mice expressing low-drinking/preference have yielded considerable insight into the heritable control of alcohol drinking. However, the B6-high and D2-low drinking phenotypes are contrasted with ethanol-conditioned reward-like behaviors, which are robustly expressed by D2 mice and considerably less expressed by B6 mice. This suggests that peripheral factors, chiefly ethanol taste, may help drive ethanol drinking by these and related strains, which complicates mouse genetic studies designed to understand the relationships between reward-related behaviors and ethanol drinking. Traditional approaches such as the sucrose/saccharin-substitution procedure that normally accentuate ethanol drinking in rodents have had limited success in low drinking/preferring mice such as the D2 line. This may be due to allelic variations of the sweet taste receptor subunit, expressed by many ethanol low-drinking/preferring strains, which would limit the utility of these types of substitution approaches. We have recently shown (McCool & Chappell, 2012) that monosodium glutamate (MSG), the primary component of umami taste, can be used in a substitution procedure to initiate ethanol drinking in both B6 and D2 mice that greatly surpasses that initiated by a more traditional sucrose-substitution procedure. In this study, we show that ethanol drinking initiated by MSG substitution in D2 mice, but not sucrose substitution, can persist for several weeks following removal of the flavor. These findings further illustrate the utility of MSG substitution to initiate ethanol drinking in distinct mouse strains.",

The peptide NPY plays an important role given its involvement in drug addiction, anxiety, and mood disorders. Interestingly, it is well established that outbred Swiss mice exhibit a prominent behavioral variability to ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Here, we investigated whether mice that were either susceptible or resistant to ethanol sensitization differed in their NPY expression during abstinence. The mice were treated daily with ethanol (2\u00a0g/kg, i.p.) or saline for 21 days. According to the locomotor activity after the last injection, the ethanol group was classified as sensitized (EtOH_High) or non-sensitized (EtOH_Low). To evaluate NPY expression, some of the mice were sacrificed at 18\u00a0h or 5 days of abstinence, and others were challenged at the 5th day of abstinence with ethanol (1.4\u00a0g/kg) and sacrificed after 1.5\u00a0h. At 5 days of abstinence, NPY expression increased in the orbital cortex, dorsomedial striatum, and dentate gyrus in the EtOH_High mice. These changes were counteracted by the ethanol challenge. In the EtOH_Low mice, NPY expression increased in the dentate gyrus only after 18\u00a0h of abstinence. Lastly, a decreased level of NPY was found in the prelimbic cortex of the EtOH_Low mice at 5 days of abstinence, and this was reversed by ethanol challenge. Therefore, behavioral variability in ethanol sensitization confers differential neurochemical features during the subsequent abstinence, including distinct patterns of NPY expression.",

     "abstract": "Genetically engineered mice are a valuable resource for studies of the behavioral effects of ethanol. However, for some behavioral tests of ethanol action, the rat is a superior model organism. Production of genetically engineered rats has been severely hampered due to technical limitations. Here we utilized a promising new technique for efficient site-specific gene modification to create a novel gene knockout rat line. This approach is based on transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALENs function in pairs and bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Upon binding to the target sequence, a functional nuclease is reconstituted that creates double-stranded breaks in the DNA that are efficiently repaired by non-homologous end joining. This error-prone process often results in deletions of varying lengths at the targeted locus. The toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) gene was selected for TALEN-mediated gene inactivation. Tlr4 has been implicated in ethanol-induced neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, as well as multiple ethanol-induced behavioral effects. To generate Tlr4 knockout rats, a pair of TALEN constructs was created that specifically target Exon 1 immediately downstream of the start of translation. TALEN mRNAs were microinjected into the cytoplasm of one-cell Wistar rat embryos. Of 13 live-born pups that resulted, one harbored a mutation in Exon 1 of Tlr4. The mutated allele consisted of a 13 base-pair deletion that was predicted to create a frameshift mutation after amino acid 25. This founder rat successfully transmitted the mutation to F1 offspring. Heterozygous F1 offspring were interbred to produce homozygous F2 animals. Homozygous mutants expressed the 13-bp deletion in Tlr4 mRNA. In contrast to control rats that produced a robust increase in plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to a lipopolysaccharide challenge, homozygous rats had a markedly attenuated response. Thus, the mutant Tlr4 allele generated by TALEN-mediated gene inactivation represents a null allele. This knockout rat line will be valuable for studies of ethanol action as well as more general inflammatory conditions including septic shock. In conclusion, TALEN-mediated gene targeting in rat zygotes represents an inexpensive, efficient, and rapid method for creating genetically engineered rats.",

The present study evaluated the acute and protracted (hangover) effects of ethanol in adolescent (P33\u2013P40) and adult (P100\u2013P107) Wistar rats, using the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG). Six minutes of EEG was recorded during waking, 15\u00a0min after administration of 0, 1.5, or 3.0\u00a0g/kg ethanol, and for 3\u00a0h at 20\u00a0h post ethanol, during the rats' next sleep cycle. Significantly higher overall frontal and parietal cortical power was seen in a wide range of EEG frequencies in adolescent rats as compared to adult rats in their waking EEG. Acute administration of ethanol did not produce differences between adolescents and adults on behavioral measures of acute intoxication. However, it did produce a significantly less intense acute EEG response to ethanol in the theta frequencies in parietal cortex in the adolescents as compared to the adults. At 20\u00a0h following acute ethanol administration, during the rats' next sleep cycle, a decrease in slow-wave frequencies (1\u20134\u00a0Hz) was seen and the adolescent rats were found to display more reduction in the slow-wave frequencies than the adults did. The present study found that adolescent rats, as compared to adults, demonstrate low sensitivity to acute ethanol administration in the theta frequencies and more susceptibility to disruption of slow-wave sleep during hangover. These studies may lend support to the idea that these traits may contribute to increased risk for alcohol use disorders seen in adults who begin drinking in their early teenage years.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorder, characterized by modest levels of alcohol use, commonly occurs in patients with schizophrenia and dramatically worsens their course. Recent data indicate that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, but not the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, decreases alcohol drinking both in patients with schizophrenia and also in the Syrian golden hamster, an animal model of moderate alcohol drinking. The present study was designed to assess the comparative effects of clozapine and haloperidol in the alcohol-preferring (P) rat, an animal model of alcoholism. First, the study investigated the comparative effects of clozapine and haloperidol on initiation of alcohol consumption in P rats, which models the early stage of alcoholism. Second, the study assessed the comparative effects of clozapine and haloperidol on maintenance of chronic alcohol consumption in P rats to provide a clue as to whether either drug may also limit alcohol consumption in alcohol-dependent patients. Clozapine attenuated the initiation of alcohol drinking and development of alcohol preference while haloperidol did not. However, neither clozapine nor haloperidol attenuated maintenance of chronic alcohol drinking. Taken together, the current data suggest that clozapine, but not haloperidol, may be effective at reducing alcohol abuse or non-dependent drinking and the P rat, used within an alcohol initiation paradigm, and may differentiate the effects of clozapine and haloperidol on alcohol drinking.",

This study was designed as a cross-sectional sampling survey. A self-administered questionnaire survey was administered to students enrolled in randomly selected junior and senior high schools throughout Japan. A total of 99,416 adolescents responded, and 98,867 questionnaires were subjected to analysis. The prevalence rates of sleep disturbance in the 30 days preceding the day of the survey were as follows: subjectively insufficient sleep (SIS) (boys: 37.6%, girls: 38.7%); short sleep duration (SSD) with less than 6\u00a0h of sleep (boys: 28.0%, girls: 33.0%); difficulty initiating sleep (DIS) (boys: 12.5%, girls: 14.1%); difficulty maintaining sleep (DMS) (boys: 10.1%, girls: 10.9%); and early morning awakening (EMA) (boys: 5.1%, girls: 5.0%). Adolescents reporting one or more symptoms of DIS, DMS, and EMA were classified as having insomnia, and its prevalence was 21.5%. The prevalence of each symptom of sleep disturbance increased significantly with the number of days on which alcohol was consumed in the previous 30 days and the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking session (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for each symptom of sleep disturbance, except SIS and EMA, tended to increase with the number of days on which alcohol was consumed and the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking session. The prevalence of sleep disturbance is particularly high among adolescents drinking alcohol. The risk of having each symptom of sleep disturbance, except SIS and EMA, increases with the number of days on which alcohol was consumed and the amount of alcohol consumed per drinking session. These findings reconfirm the need to eliminate underage drinking to ensure good sleep among adolescents.",

     "abstract": "Previously we have shown that chronic alcohol intake causes alcohol-induced ciliary dysfunction (AICD), leading to non-responsive airway cilia. AICD likely occurs through the downregulation of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic nucleotide-dependent kinases, protein kinase G (PKG) and protein kinase A (PKA). Studies by others have shown that dietary supplementation with the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and procysteine prevent other alcohol-induced lung complications. This led us to hypothesize that dietary supplementation with NAC or procysteine prevents AICD. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6 mice drank an alcohol/water solution (20% w/v) ad libitum for 6 weeks and were concurrently fed dietary supplements of either NAC or procysteine. Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) was measured in mice tracheas, and PKG/PKA responsiveness to \u03b2-agonists and NOx levels were measured from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Long-term alcohol drinking reduced CBF, PKG and PKA responsiveness to \u03b2-agonists, and lung NOx levels in BAL fluid. In contrast, alcohol-drinking mice fed NAC or procysteine sustained ciliary function and PKG and PKA responsiveness to \u03b2-agonists. However, BAL NO levels remained low despite antioxidant supplementation. We also determined that removal of alcohol from the drinking water for as little as 1 week restored ciliary function, but not PKG and PKA responsiveness to \u03b2-agonists. We conclude that dietary supplementation with NAC or procysteine protects against AICD. In addition, alcohol removal for 1 week restores cilia function independent of PKG and PKA activity. Our findings provide a rationale for the use of antioxidants to prevent damage to airway mucociliary functions in chronic alcohol-drinking individuals.",

This study aimed to clarify the relationship between alcohol consumption and PWV among female and male workers in Japan. Study participants were local government employees in Hokkaido, Japan, who underwent annual health check-ups. All data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. The average daily alcohol consumption of the previous month, based on the alcohol concentration of each beverage type (g/day, ethanol equivalent), was estimated according to the frequency and amount of consumption. Data from 3893 participants (812 women and 3081 men) were analyzed. In women, non-drinkers had significantly higher PWV than women who consumed <10\u00a0g/day of alcohol. In men, compared with those who reportedly drank 20\u201339\u00a0g/day, non-drinkers and those who drank <20\u00a0g/day and \u226560\u00a0g/day had significantly higher PWV.

In alcoholic patients, these biomarkers are usually measured at late stages, i.e., when the alcoholic patients are showing clear signs of impaired hepatic function. OD biomarkers are sensitive indicators of impaired metabolic function, and might be useful in early stages of alcohol consumption to identify individuals who are at greater risk of damage in later stages of alcohol consumption. The aim of the present work was to evaluate some OD biomarkers in young people at early stages of alcohol consumption.The study was carried out in a group of young people (18\u201323 years old) who drank alcohol, Youngsters Exposed to Alcohol (YEA) with an average intake of 118\u00a0g of ethanol/week, and a control group (CG) of non-drinkers. Blood counts, alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, oxidative damage to DNA, and lipid peroxidation were determined in both groups.The anthropometric and blood parameters of both groups were similar and no clinical symptoms of hepatic damage were observed. Nevertheless, ADH activity, lipid peroxidation, and percentage of damaged DNA cells were higher in the YEA group than in the control group. In contrast, GSH-Px activity was lower in the YEA group than in the control group.Alteration in OD biomarkers can be found in individuals with 4\u20135 years of alcohol drinking history. To our knowledge, this is the first study giving evidence of OD in individuals at early stages of alcohol abuse.",

     "abstract": "The chronic high-level alcohol consumption seen in alcoholism leads to dramatic effects on the hippocampus, including decreased white matter, loss of oligodendrocytes and other glial cells, and inhibition of neurogenesis. Examining gene expression in post mortem hippocampal tissue from 20 alcoholics and 19 controls allowed us to detect differentially expressed genes that may play a role in the risk for alcoholism or whose expression is modified by chronic consumption of alcohol. We identified 639 named genes whose expression significantly differed between alcoholics and controls at a False Discovery Rate (FDR)\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.20; 52% of these genes differed by at least 1.2-fold. Differentially expressed genes included the glucocorticoid receptor and the related gene FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), UDP glycosyltransferase 8 (UGT8), urea transporter (SLC14A1), zinc transporter (SLC39A10), Interleukin 1 receptor type 1 (IL1R1), thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP), and many metallothioneins. Pathways related to inflammation, hypoxia, and stress showed activation, and pathways that play roles in neurogenesis and myelination showed decreases. The cortisol pathway dysregulation and increased inflammation identified here are seen in other stress-related conditions such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and most likely play a role in addiction. Many of the detrimental effects on the hippocampus appear to be mediated through NF-\u03baB signaling. Twenty-four of the differentially regulated genes were previously identified by genome-wide association studies of alcohol use disorders; this raises the potential interest of genes not normally associated with alcoholism, such as suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18), BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), and von Willebrand factor (VWF).",

Microarray analysis revealed up to 1772 unique named genes in the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh) and 494 unique named genes in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) that significantly differed [False Discovery Rate (FDR)\u00a0=\u00a00.10; fold-change at least 1.2] in expression between the individual line\u2013pairs. Analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathways information indicated significant categories and networks in common for up to 3 or 4 line\u2013pairs, but not for all 5 line\u2013pairs. However, there were almost no individual genes in common within these categories and networks. ANOVAs of the combined data for the 5 line\u2013pairs indicated 1014 and 731 significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) differences in expression of named genes in the AcbSh and CeA, respectively.

     "abstract": "Glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission undergo significant changes during adolescence. Receptors for both of these transmitters (NMDAR, and GABAA) are known to be key targets for the acute effects of ethanol in adults. The current study set out to investigate the acute effects of ethanol on both NMDAR-mediated excitatory transmission and GABAergic inhibitory transmission within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) across age. The BNST is an area of the brain implicated in the negative reinforcing properties associated with alcohol dependence, and the BNST plays a critical role in stress-induced relapse. Therefore, assessing the developmental regulation of ethanol sensitivity in this key brain region is important to understanding the progression of ethanol dependence. To do this, whole-cell recordings of isolated NMDAR-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) or evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were performed on BNST neurons in slices from 4- or 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Ethanol (50\u00a0mm) produced greater inhibition of NMDAR\u2013eEPSCs in adolescent mice than in adult mice. This enhanced sensitivity in adolescence was not a result of shifts in function of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR, measured by Ro25-6981 inhibition and decay kinetics measured across age. Adolescent mice also exhibited greater ethanol sensitivity of GABAergic transmission, as ethanol (50\u00a0mm) enhanced eIPSCs in the BNST of adolescent but not adult mice. Collectively, this work illustrates that a moderate dose of ethanol produces greater inhibition of transmission in the BNST (through greater excitatory inhibition and enhancement of inhibitory transmission) in adolescents compared to adults. Given the role of the BNST in alcohol dependence, these developmental changes in acute ethanol sensitivity could accelerate neuroadaptations that result from chronic ethanol use during the critical period of adolescence.",

However, the means by which ethanol may impair microtubule formation or function and the role that microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) have in mediating such effects are not clear. In the present studies, purified MAP-deficient (2\u00a0mg/mL) and MAP-rich (pre-conjugated; 1\u00a0mg/mL) bovine \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulin dimer was allowed to polymerize at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, forming microtubules in the presence or absence of ethanol (25\u2013500\u00a0mm). Microtubule formation was assessed in a 96-well format using a turbidity assay, with absorption measured at 340\u00a0nm for 45\u00a0min. Additional studies co-exposed \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulin dimers to 50\u00a0mm ethanol and purified MAPs (0.1\u00a0mg/mL) for 45\u00a0min. Polymerization of MAP-deficient tubulin was significantly decreased (at 15\u201345\u00a0min of polymerization) during exposure to ethanol (>25\u00a0mm). In contrast, ethanol exposure did not alter polymerization of \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulin dimers pre-conjugated to MAPs, at any concentration. Concurrent exposure of MAP-deficient tubulin with purified MAPs and ethanol resulted in significant and time-dependent decreases in tubulin polymerization, with recovery from inhibition at later time points. The present results suggest that ethanol disrupts MAP-independent microtubule formation and MAP-dependent microtubule formation via direct actions at an MAP-sensitive microtubule residue, indicating that disruption of neuronal microtubule formation and function may contribute to the neurodegenerative effects of binge-like ethanol intake.",

Selenium-supplemented diet (0.5\u00a0ppm) was administered to ethanol-exposed (20% v/v) dams during gestation and lactation. When the dams' pups were 21 days old, the pups' levels of the main hepatic selenoproteins glutathione peroxidase (GPx1 and GPx4) and selenoprotein P (SelP) were measured. The pups were divided into control (C), alcohol (A), control-selenium (CS), and alcohol-selenium (AS) groups. The purpose was to evaluate the effect of the selenium-supplemented diet on the levels of Se deposits present in the livers of their pups. Alcohol decreases hepatic Se deposits, GPx activity, and GPx1 expression; alcohol increases GPx4 and SelP expression. Se was measured by furnace graphite atomic absorption spectrometry, the antioxidant activity of GPx and concentration of hepatic phospholipids (PL) were determined by spectrophotometry, and the selenoprotein expressions were detected by Western blotting. Selenite treatment prevented alcohol's effects of diminishing the Se deposits, GPx activity, and GPx1 expression, while maintaining the high levels of the expression of GPx4 and SelP. These results suggest that depletion of hepatic Se levels in rat pups, caused by ethanol exposure to their dams, affects the synthesis of the 3 main hepatic selenoproteins in different ways, which is related to a decrease in GPx activity and PL concentration, and an increase in serum Se levels. Selenium supplementation to the dams increased the expression of GPx1, GPx4, and SelP in their pups.",

     "abstract": "Acetaminophen is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic, antipyretic medications. Use of acetaminophen and alcohol are commonly associated. Previous studies showed that acetaminophen might affect bioavailability of ethanol by inhibiting gastric alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). However, potential inhibitions by acetaminophen of first-pass metabolism (FPM) of ethanol, catalyzed by the human ADH family and by relevant aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) isozymes, remain undefined. ADH and ALDH both exhibit racially distinct allozymes and tissue-specific distribution of isozymes, and are principal enzymes responsible for ethanol metabolism in humans. In this study, we investigated acetaminophen inhibition of ethanol oxidation with recombinant human ADH1A, ADH1B1, ADH1B2, ADH1B3, ADH1C1, ADH1C2, ADH2, and ADH4, and inhibition of acetaldehyde oxidation with recombinant human ALDH1A1 and ALDH2. The investigations were done at near physiological pH 7.5 and with a cytoplasmic coenzyme concentration of 0.5\u00a0mm NAD+. Acetaminophen acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor for ADH enzymes, with the slope inhibition constants (Kis) ranging from 0.90\u00a0mm (ADH2) to 20\u00a0mm (ADH1A), and the intercept inhibition constants (Kii) ranging from 1.4\u00a0mm (ADH1C allozymes) to 19\u00a0mm (ADH1A). Acetaminophen exhibited noncompetitive inhibition for ALDH2 (Kis\u00a0=\u00a03.0\u00a0mm and Kii\u00a0=\u00a02.2\u00a0mm), but competitive inhibition for ALDH1A1 (Kis\u00a0=\u00a00.96\u00a0mm). The metabolic interactions between acetaminophen and ethanol/acetaldehyde were assessed by computer simulation using inhibition equations and the determined kinetic constants. At therapeutic to subtoxic plasma levels of acetaminophen (i.e., 0.2\u20130.5\u00a0mm) and physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (10\u00a0mm) and acetaldehyde (10\u00a0\u03bcm) in target tissues, acetaminophen could inhibit ADH1C allozymes (12\u201326%) and ADH2 (14\u201328%) in the liver and small intestine, ADH4 (15\u201331%) in the stomach, and ALDH1A1 (16\u201333%) and ALDH2 (8.3\u201319%) in all 3 tissues. The results suggest that inhibition by acetaminophen of hepatic and gastrointestinal FPM of ethanol through ADH and ALDH pathways might become significant at higher, subtoxic levels of acetaminophen.",

     "abstract": "Improving the quality of alcohol-related care requires practical approaches to assessing alcohol consumption to guide management and monitor outcomes. Given the increasing use of alcohol screening questionnaires to identify alcohol misuse it would be ideal if scores on screening questionnaires were also indicators of average alcohol consumption. However, the questionnaires were not designed for this purpose and include dimensions of drinking that may not reflect average consumption (e.g. heavy episodic drinking, alcohol-related problems). In a general population sample, scores on the AUDIT-C screen correlated with reports of alcohol consumption in detailed interviews, but the relationship is unknown for clinical populations and other questionnaires. Serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) is a biomarker routinely obtained in clinical care and is known to rise with average alcohol consumption. This cross-sectional study of 11,175 male U.S. Veterans Affairs patients enrolled in a primary care study used HDL as an objective biomarker to evaluate whether average alcohol consumption increased as scores increased on 3 brief alcohol screens \u2013 the AUDIT-C, AUDIT Question #3 (a single-item screen), and the CAGE questionnaire. Mean HDL progressively increased as screening scores increased for the AUDIT-C and AUDIT Question #3: about 12\u00a0mg/dL from the lowest to the highest scores. The association was much weaker for the CAGE questionnaire. Results were minimally affected by adjustment for covariates (e.g. age, race, medical comorbidity, smoking, medication count, and depression) but the association was modified (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and mildly attenuated by adherent use of lipid-lowering medications. This study using HDL as a biomarker of average alcohol consumption adds to evidence that some alcohol screening scores may also serve as scaled markers of average alcohol consumption.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to ethanol in neonatal rats results in reduced neuronal numbers in the cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei of juvenile and adult animals. This reduction in cell numbers is correlated with impaired delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a simple motor learning task in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS; tone) is repeatedly paired with a co-terminating unconditioned stimulus (US; periorbital shock). Across training, cell populations in the interpositus (IP) nucleus model the temporal form of the eyeblink-conditioned response (CR). The hippocampus, though not required for delay EBC, also shows learning-dependent increases in CA1 and CA3 unit activity. In the present study, rat pups were exposed to 0, 3, 4, or 5\u00a0mg/kg/day of ethanol during postnatal days (PD) 4\u20139. As adults, CR acquisition and timing were assessed during 6 training sessions of delay EBC with a short (280\u00a0ms) interstimulus interval (ISI; time from CS onset to US onset) followed by another 6 sessions with a long (880\u00a0ms) ISI. Neuronal activity was recorded in the IP and area CA1 during all 12 sessions. The high-dose rats learned the most slowly and, with the moderate-dose rats, produced the longest CR peak latencies over training to the short ISI. The low dose of alcohol impaired CR performance to the long ISI only. The 3E (3\u00a0mg/kg/day of ethanol) and 5E (5\u00a0mg/kg/day of ethanol) rats also showed slower-than-normal increases in learning-dependent excitatory unit activity in the IP and CA1. The 4E (4\u00a0mg/kg/day of ethanol) rats showed a higher rate of CR production to the long ISI and enhanced IP and CA1 activation when compared to the 3E and 5E rats. The results indicate that binge-like ethanol exposure in neonatal rats induces long-lasting, dose-dependent deficits in CR acquisition and timing and diminishes conditioning-related neuronal excitation in both the cerebellum and hippocampus.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is involved in ethanol's deleterious effects on the intestinal barrier. Caco-2 cells were incubated in\u00a0vitro with 1\u201310% ethanol. The results indicated that ethanol had a dose-dependent effect in increasing TLR4 expression and intercellular permeability. Then the effects of TLR4 on protein kinase C (PKC) and the intercellular junction protein occludin were assessed with and without pretreatment with a TLR4 inhibitor. The results indicated that TLR4 increased nonspecific PKC activity and reduced the expression of phosphorylated occludin in the membrane, which increased intercellular permeability. These effects were prevented by pretreatment with TLR4 mAb.Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were fed an ethanol or isocaloric liquid diet for 6 weeks. Hepatitis was diagnosed by the presence of an associated elevated blood endotoxin level. Chronic ethanol treatment significantly elevated blood endotoxin levels, intestinal permeability, and the expression of TLR4 in the ileum and colon. Moreover, ethanol exposure reduced the distribution of phosphorylated occludin in the intestinal epithelium because of PKC activation. In conclusion, chronic ethanol exposure induces a high response of TLR4 to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and TLR4 increases intestinal permeability through down-regulation of phosphorylated occludin expression in the intestinal epithelial barrier, accompanied by membrane PKC hyperactivity.",

The liquid diets were prepared daily. Gold flakes were added to the ethanol 1\u00a0h before preparing the ethanol liquid diets, as an aging process. After 10 weeks, rats in group E showed significantly higher plasma aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities than those in group C. A significantly increased concentration of hepatic triglyceride (TG) was found in group E. Furthermore, higher hepatic glutathione reductase (GRD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities together with higher tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 concentration and higher hepatic cytochrome (CYP2E1) protein expression were also observed in group E. In contrast, the hepatic TG concentration in group EHF was significantly lower than that of group E. In addition, hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GPX), SOD, and CAT activities together with TNF-\u03b1 concentration and hepatic CYP2E1 protein expression in group EHF were significantly lower than those in group E. We concluded that nanogold flakes might ameliorate alcohol-induced liver injury by maintaining the hepatic antioxidative status. In addition, nanogold flakes may reduce fat accumulation caused by chronic ethanol feeding via decreasing hepatic TNF-\u03b1.",

By comparing 191 new ECG-LVH cases with 4311 controls, excessive drinking (>210\u00a0g/week) showed excess risks for ECG-LVH (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.12\u20133.24), after adjusting for education, income, occupation, physical activity, smoking, body mass index, fasting glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, BP, and antihypertensive medication.

Low power prevented us from examining whether drinking at <once/week to \u2264210\u00a0g/week is associated with decreased/increased risk of ECG-LVH. Elevated BP partially mediates between alcohol and ECG-LVH.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression profile of apoptosis-associated miRNAs in ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury and the mechanisms underlying injury. Gastric mucosal injury was induced in rats by oral administration of ethanol, and gastric tissues were collected for analysis of gastric ulcer index, apoptosis ratio, caspase-3 activity, and miRNAs expression. Cell cultures of human gastric mucosal epithelial cells (GES-1) were incubated with ethanol to induce apoptosis. Mimics or inhibitors of miRNAs or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor were added to the cell culture medium. GES-1 cells were collected for analysis of apoptosis ratio, caspase-3 activity, miRNAs expression, and protein phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK), or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). In the animal experiments, gastric ulcer index, cellular apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity were significantly increased, accompanied by up-regulation of miR-145 and down-regulation of the microRNAs miR-17, miR-19a, miR-21, miR-181a, and miR-200c. In the human cell culture experiments, the anti-apoptotic effects of miR-19a and miR-21 or pro-apoptotic effect of miR-145 were confirmed by their corresponding mimics or inhibitor; the ethanol-induced GES-1 apoptosis as well as the changes in miRNAs expression were significantly attenuated in the presence of JNK inhibitor. These results demonstrated that miR-145, miR-19a, and miR-21 were the apoptosis-associated miRNAs in gastric mucosal epithelial cells. The regulation of expression of these 3 miRNAs in ethanol-induced GES-1 apoptosis involved the JNK pathway.",

Both nicotine injection alone and ethanol feeding alone increased hepatic collagen type I deposition, and nicotine injection and ethanol feeding combined further increased hepatic collagen type I deposition. The combination of nicotine and ethanol also activated hepatic stellate cells, a principal liver fibrogenic cell. Hepatic fat accumulation was induced by ethanol feeding, which was further enhanced by nicotine injection. Ethanol feeding caused an increase in serum ALT, but nicotine did not further increase serum ALT levels. Lipid droplets and inflammatory foci were observed in liver sections from ethanol-fed mice; nicotine treatment increased the number and size of lipid droplets, but not the number and size of inflammatory foci.

The objective of the present study was to determine the role of the DYN/KOR system in the regulation of anxiety-related behaviors during an extended period of abstinence from ethanol in animals with a history of ethanol dependence. Male Wistar rats (n\u00a0=\u00a094) were fed an ethanol or control liquid diet for 25\u201330 days. Six weeks after its removal, rats were exposed to 20\u00a0min of immobilization, and the ability of the KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (0\u201320\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]) to attenuate the enhanced responsiveness to stress observed in rats chronically exposed to ethanol was investigated using the elevated plus maze. In addition, the ability of U50,488 (0\u201310\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) to prime anxiety-like behavior during protracted withdrawal was also examined. Rats with a history of ethanol dependence showed a significant decrease in open-arm exploration after exposure to restraint, indicating an anxiety-like state, compared to similarly treated controls, an effect that was blocked by nor-BNI. nor-BNI also selectively decreased center time and open-arm approaches in ethanol-exposed rats. The highest dose of U50,488 decreased open-arm exploration and the total number of arm entries in ethanol-exposed and control rats. Although lower doses of U50,488 did not affect open-arm exploration in either group, the 0.1\u00a0mg/kg dose selectively decreased motor activity in the ethanol-exposed rats when compared to similarly pretreated controls. These findings further support the hypothesis that behaviors associated with withdrawal from ethanol are in part regulated by the DYN/KOR system, and suggest that these effects may be long lasting in nature.",

There were 211 unique named genes that significantly differed (FDR\u00a0=\u00a00.1) between the water and EtOH groups. Bioinformatics analyses indicated alterations in a) transcription factors that reduced excitation-coupled transcription and promoted excitotoxic neuronal damage involving clusters of genes associated with Nfkbia, Fos, and Srebf1, b) genes that reduced cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, and increased protein degradation, and c) genes involved in cell-to-cell interactions and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Among the named genes, there were 62 genes that showed differences between alcohol-na\u00efve P and non-preferring (NP) rats, with 43 of the genes changing toward NP-like expression levels following excessive binge-like drinking in the P rats. These genes are involved in a pro-inflammatory response, and enhanced response to glucocorticoids and steroid hormones. Overall, the results of this study indicate that the repeated excessive binge-like alcohol drinking can change the expression of genes that may alter neuronal function in several ways, some of which may be deleterious.",

An early drinking study with WSP and WSR mice showed modest evidence consistent with this genetic correlation, but there were several limitations to that experiment. We therefore conducted a thorough assessment of two bottle ethanol preference drinking in both replicate pairs of WSP/WSR selected lines in mice of both sexes. Greater preference drinking of WSR-2 than WSP-2 female mice confirmed the earlier report. However, in the parallel set of selected lines, the WSP-1 mice drank more than the WSR-1s. Naive mice tested for preference for sucrose, saccharin and quinine did not differ markedly for any tastant. Finally, in a test of binge-like drinking, Drinking in the Dark (DID), WSP mice drank more than WSR mice and attained significantly higher (but still modest) blood ethanol concentrations. Tests of acute withdrawal after DID showed a mild, but significant elevation in handling-induced convulsions in the WSP line. These results provide further evidence that 2-bottle ethanol preference and DID are genetically distinguishable traits.",

The rapidly evolving nature of these efforts allows substantial room for the development of novel experimental paradigms suited to this freshwater species. The field of ethorobotics may prove particularly beneficial, due to its ability to convey fully controllable and easily reproducible experimental tools. In this study, we addressed the possibility of using a biologically inspired robot to investigate the emotionally related properties of ethanol in a preference task in zebrafish. To this aim, we evaluated wild-type zebrafish preference toward a robotic stimulus and addressed whether ethanol administration (0.25% and 1.00% ethanol/water concentration) may alter such preferences. In accordance with our previous studies, we observed that zebrafish exhibit a natural attraction toward the robot. Additionally, in agreement with our predictions, we showed that ethanol administration abolishes such preferences. This work is the first to demonstrate that robotic stimuli can be used in zebrafish to investigate the reward-related properties of alcohol.",

The MicroCT scans were performed on pups on postnatal days 7 (P7) and P21. The volumes of the neurocranium (volume encased by the frontal, parietal, and occipital bones) and the viscerocranium (volume encased by the mandible and nasal bone), along with total skull bone volume, head size, and head circumference were evaluated using general linear models and discriminant analyses. The pups in the alcohol-treated group, when compared to the chow-fed controls (ALC vs CHOW) and the isocaloric-fed controls (ALC vs PF), showed differences in head size and circumference at P7 and P21, the total skull volume and parietal bone volume at P7, and volume of all the tested bones except nasal at P21. There was a growth trend of ALC\u00a0<\u00a0CHOW and ALC\u00a0<\u00a0PF. While covarying for gender and head size or circumference, the treatment affected the total skull and mandible at P7 (ALC\u00a0>\u00a0CHOW), and the total skull, parietal bone, and occipital bone at P21 (ALC\u00a0<\u00a0CHOW, ALC\u00a0<\u00a0PF). While covarying for the P7 measures, the treatment affected only the 3 neurocranial bones at P21 (ALC\u00a0<\u00a0CHOW, ALC\u00a0<\u00a0PF). Discriminant analysis sensitively selected between ALC and CHOW (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.967), between ALC and PF (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.995), and between PF and CHOW (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.805). These results supported our hypothesis that craniofacial bones might be a reliable and sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of prenatal alcohol exposure. Significantly, we found that the neurocranium (upper skull) was more sensitive to alcohol than the viscerocranium (face).",

     "abstract": "Children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) display striking craniofacial abnormalities. These features are proposed to result from perturbations in the morphology and function of cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs), which contribute significantly to the craniofacial complex. While certain pathways by which this may occur have been suggested, precise teratogenic mechanisms remain intensely investigated, as does the question of the teratogenic dose. The present study focused on examining how avian cNCC actin cytoskeleton, migratory distance, and proliferation are affected ex\u00a0vivo by exposure to ethanol concentrations that simulate maternal intoxication. Chick cNCCs were cultured in 0.2% and 0.4% v/v ethanol. Distances migrated by both ethanol-treated and control cells at 24 and 48\u00a0h were recorded. Following phalloidin immunocytochemistry, treated and control cNCCs were compared morphologically and quantitatively. Apoptosis and proliferation in control versus treated cNCCs were also studied. Chick cNCCs cultured in ethanol lost their spindle-like shapes and their ordered cytoskeleton. There was a significant stage-dependent effect on cNCC migration at 24\u00a0h (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035), which was greatest at stage 10 (HH). Ethanol treatment for 48\u00a0h revealed a significant main effect for ethanol, chiefly at the 0.4% level. There was also an interaction effect between ethanol dose and stage of development (stage 9 HH). Actin microfilament disruption was quantitatively increased by ethanol at the doses studied while cNCC proliferation was increased but not significantly. Ethanol had no effect on cNCC apoptosis. At ethanol levels likely to induce human FAS, avian cNCCs exhibit various subtle, potentially significant changes in morphology, migration, and proliferation, with possible consequences for fated structures.",

Given its impact on the anatomy of the prefrontal cortex, the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism may well be involved in this specific endophenotype. Forty-six healthy adult children of alcoholics (HACA) and 82 healthy controls (HC) took part in the study. All the participants were assessed with the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies, and their family histories of alcohol and substance use were assessed with the Family Informant Schedule and Criteria. The Trail Making Test, Arithmetic Switching Task, Stroop Color-Word Test and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were administered to assess EFs. An overall executive factor score was calculated using factorial analyses. Genotyping of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was performed using the TaqMan\u00ae allelic discrimination assay. HACA had significantly lower EFs performance than HC. Genetic analysis showed that BDNF genotype distributions were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium in the HACA and HC. Genotype and allele distributions did not differ significantly between the two groups. Participants with the Met\u00a0allele performed significantly more poorly than participants with the Val allele, and a group by allele interaction was observed, the BDNF Met\u00a0allele being associated with a poorer executive factor score in the HACA group. These results suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may contribute to alcohol dependence vulnerability via lower EFs performance.",

Many of the brain regions impacted by prenatal alcohol exposure are also linked with olfactory processing, and odor identification deficits have been documented in certain neurological disorders associated with these brain regions. As odor identification following prenatal alcohol exposure is not well studied, we compared odor identification in children with prenatal exposure to alcohol (AE) to typically developing controls (CON) (N\u00a0=\u00a016/group). It was hypothesized that children in the AE group would perform more poorly than children in the CON group on the San Diego Odor Identification Test, an identification test of 8 common household odorants. Children exposed to alcohol during prenatal development were significantly impaired in olfactory identification (M\u00a0=\u00a05.95, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.37) compared to typically developing controls (M\u00a0=\u00a07.24, SE\u00a0=\u00a00.37).

The majority of these studies, however, have focused on the DA neurons located in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and their projections to the nucleus accumbens. DA neurons within the ventral periaqueductal gray (vPAG) have been shown to regulate reward but little is known about the\u00a0functional properties of these neurons, or how they are modified by drugs of abuse. This lack of knowledge is likely due to the highly heterogeneous cell composition of the vPAG, with both \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate neurons present in addition to DA neurons. In this study, we performed whole-cell recordings in a TH\u2013eGFP transgenic mouse line to evaluate the properties of vPAG-DA neurons. Following this initial characterization, we examined how both acute and chronic alcohol exposure modify synaptic transmission onto vPAG-DA neurons. We found minimal effects of acute alcohol exposure on GABA transmission, but a robust enhancement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in vPAG-DA. Consistent with this effect on excitatory transmission, we also found that alcohol caused an increase in firing rate. These data were in contrast to the effects of chronic intermittent alcohol exposure, which had no significant impact on either inhibitory or excitatory synaptic transmission on the vPAG-DA neurons. These data add to a growing body of literature that points to alcohol having both region-dependent and cell-type dependent effects on function.",

During the transition from recreational to compulsive consumption of reinforcing drugs, however, the dorsal striatum seems to\u00a0be recruited. Understanding how synaptic activity is altered in a sub-region specific manner in the striatum during the course of long-term drug consumption thus could be essential for understanding the long-lasting changes produced by addictive substances, including ethanol. Here we evaluated synaptic activity in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, nAc) of single-housed Wistar rats consuming water, or water and ethanol, for up to 10 months. Even though ethanol intake was moderate, it was sufficient to decrease input/output function in response to stimulation intensity in the DLS, while recorded population spike (PS) amplitudes in the nAc were unaffected. Striatal disinhibition induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline had a slower onset in rats that had consumed ethanol for 2 months, and was significantly depressed in slices from rats that had consumed ethanol for 4 months. Bicuculline-induced disinhibition in the nAc, on the other hand, was not significantly altered by long-term ethanol intake. Changes in PS amplitude induced by taurine or the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine were not significantly altered by ethanol in any brain region. Even though input/output function was not significantly affected by age, there was a significant decline in antagonist-induced disinhibition in brain slices from aged rats. The data presented here suggest that even modest consumption of ethanol is sufficient to alter neurotransmission in the striatum, while synaptic activity appears to be relatively well-preserved in the nAc during the course of long-term ethanol consumption.",

     "abstract": "Chronic administration of ethanol induces persistent accumulation of \u0394FosB, an important transcription factor, in the midbrain dopamine system. This process underlies the progression to addiction. Previously, we have shown that cytisine, a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) partial agonist, reduces various ethanol-drinking behaviors and ethanol-induced striatal dopamine function. However, the effects of cytisine on chronic ethanol drinking and ethanol-induced up-regulation of striatal \u0394FosB are not known. Therefore, we examined the effects of cytisine on chronic voluntary ethanol consumption and associated striatal \u0394FosB up-regulation in C57BL/6J mice using behavioral and biochemical methods. Following the chronic voluntary consumption of 15% (v/v) ethanol under a 24-h two-bottle choice intermittent access (IA; 3 sessions/week) or continuous access (CA; 24\u00a0h/d and 7\u00a0d/week) paradigm, mice received repeated intraperitoneal injections of saline or cytisine (0.5 or 3.0\u00a0mg/kg). Ethanol and water intake were monitored for 24\u00a0h post-treatment. Pretreatment with cytisine (0.5 or 1.5\u00a0mg/kg) significantly reduced ethanol consumption and preference in both paradigms at 2\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h post-treatment. The \u0394FosB levels in the ventral and dorsal striatum were determined by Western blotting 18\u201324\u00a0h after the last point of ethanol access. In addition, cytisine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) significantly attenuated up-regulation of \u0394FosB in the ventral and dorsal striatum following chronic ethanol consumption in IA and CA paradigms. The results indicate that cytisine modulates chronic voluntary ethanol consumption and reduces ethanol-induced up-regulation of striatal \u0394FosB. Further, the data suggest a critical role of nAChRs in chronic ethanol-induced neurochemical adaptations associated with ethanol addiction.",

Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to ethanol (4\u00a0g/kg, 20% v/v for 4 weeks) and effects of three exercise protocols (pre-ethanol, post-ethanol and pre-to-post-ethanol treatment) were examined. Results showed that ethanol exposure resulted in longer escape latencies during the acquisition phase of the Morris Water Maze task. Moreover, all three exercise protocols significantly decreased the latency to locate the hidden platform. During the probe trial, ethanol led to decreased time spent in the target quadrant. In contrast, performance on the probe trial was significantly better in the rats that had done the post- and pre-to-post-ethanol, but not pre-ethanol, exercises.

Sensitization to the locomotor stimulant effects of ethanol has often been used as an animal model of ethanol-induced neuroadaptations. Previously, we showed that young mice were more sensitive than adults to the locomotor sensitization induced by high ethanol doses. However, this effect could be due to age-related differences in chronic tolerance to the sedative effects of ethanol. The aim of the present study is to assess chronic tolerance to the sedative effects of ethanol in weaning 21-day-old (P21), adolescent 35-day-old (P35) and adult 63-day-old (P63) female Swiss mice. After a daily injection of saline or 4\u00a0g/kg ethanol during 6 consecutive days, all P21, P35 and P63 mice were injected with 4\u00a0g/kg ethanol and submitted to the loss of righting reflex procedure. Our results confirm that the sensitivity to the acute sedative effects of ethanol gradually increases with age. Although this schedule of ethanol injections induces significant age-related differences in ethanol sensitization, it did not reveal significant differences between P21, P35 and P63 mice in the development of a chronic ethanol tolerance to its sedative effects. The present results show that age-related differences in the development of ethanol sensitization cannot be explained by differences in chronic ethanol tolerance to its sedative effects. More broadly, they do not support the idea that ethanol-induced sensitization is a by-product of chronic ethanol tolerance.",

Several scales were used to assess risk factors, including personality traits, alcohol expectancy (i.e., beliefs about the consequences of using alcohol), and perceived peer alcohol use, for alcohol drinking and alcohol drinking experiences. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the contribution of multiple risk factors to the quantity of alcohol consumed. The results showed that 58% of the children had tasted alcohol, and approximately one-third drank alcohol again after the first drinking experience. Twelve-year-old children had a significantly higher prevalence of tasting and drinking alcohol and a significantly greater frequency and quantity of alcohol consumed than younger children. Eighty percent of the children who liked alcohol during their first drinking experience reported that they drank alcohol again. Among the children who did not like alcohol during their first drinking experience, only 31% drank alcohol again. Underage drinking usually occurred under adult supervision in family settings when parents or other relatives allowed them to drink or were aware of their children's drinking. The hierarchical regression analysis showed that being older and male, having more peers that drink alcohol, having higher levels of extroversion, and having alcohol expectancy for social facilitation increased the risk for greater alcohol use. The final model explained 33% of the total variance.",

These receptors are critical for excitatory synaptic signaling and inhibition of NMDA receptors leads to impaired cognition and learning. Ethanol inhibits NMDA currents at concentrations associated with intoxication and this action may underlie some of the behavioral effects of ethanol. Although numerous sites and mechanisms of action have been tested, the manner in which ethanol inhibits NMDA receptors remains unclear. Recent findings in the literature suggest that ethanol, via facilitation of tyrosine phosphatase activity, may dephosphorylate key tyrosine residues in the C-terminus of GluN2B subunits resulting in diminished channel function. To directly test this hypothesis, we engineered GluN2B mutants that contained phenylalanine in place of tyrosine at three different sites and transiently expressed them with the GluN1 subunit in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to record glutamate-activated currents in the absence and presence of ethanol (10\u2013600\u00a0mM). All mutants were functional and did not differ from one another with respect to current amplitude, steady-state to peak ratio, or magnesium block. Analysis of ethanol dose\u2013response curves showed no significant difference in IC50 values between wild-type receptors and Y1252F, Y1336F, Y1472F or triple Y-F mutants.

These results indicate that some alleles influencing ethanol preference also contribute to circadian rhythm regulation. Selective breeding has also been used to produce lines of mice differing in a number of other ethanol-related traits, while studies of phenotypic and genetic correlation indicate that diverse ethanol-related traits are influenced by both shared and unshared genetics. In the present study, we examined several features of circadian activity rhythms in a mouse line selected for binge-like drinking and in mouse lines selected for high and low severity of ethanol withdrawal convulsions. Specifically, Experiment 1 compared High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1) mice to their genetically heterogeneous progenitor line (HS/Npt), and Experiment 2 compared Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP-2) and Withdrawal Seizure-Resistant (WSR-2) mice. Both line pairs displayed differences in their daily activity patterns under light\u2013dark conditions. In addition, HDID-1 mice showed shorter free-running periods in constant light and less coherent activity rhythms across lighting conditions relative to HS/Npt controls, while WSP-2 mice showed longer free-running periods in constant darkness relative to WSR-2 mice. These results strengthen the evidence for genetic linkages between responsiveness to ethanol and circadian regulation, and extend this evidence to include ethanol-related phenotypes other than preference drinking.

     "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows observing cerebral activity not only in separated cortical regions but also in functionally coupled cortical networks. Although moderate doses of ethanol slowdown the neurovascular coupling, the functions of the primary sensorimotor and the visual system remain intact. Yet little is known about how more complex interactions between cortical regions are affected even at moderate doses of alcohol. Therefore the method of psychophysiological interaction (PPI) was applied to analyze ethanol-induced effects on the effective connectivity in the visuomotor system. Fourteen healthy social drinkers with no personal history of neurological disorders or substance abuse were examined. In a test/re-test design they served as their own controls by participating in both the sober and the ethanol condition. All participants were scanned in a 3\u00a0T MR scanner before and after ingestion of a body-weight-dependent amount of ethanol calculated to achieve a blood alcohol concentration of 1.0\u2030. PPIs were calculated for the primary visual cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the left and right primary motor cortex using the statistical software package SPM. The PPI analysis showed selective disturbance of the effective connectivity between different cortical areas. The regression analysis revealed the influence of the supplementary motor area on connected regions like the primary motor cortex to be decreased yet preserved. However, the connection between the primary visual cortex and the posterior parietal cortex was more severely impaired by the influence of ethanol, leading to an uncoupled regression between these regions. The decreased effective connectivity in the visuomotor system suggests that complex tasks requiring interaction or synchronization between different brain areas are affected even at moderate levels of alcohol. This finding may have important consequences for determining which components of demanding tasks such as driving a car might be compromised earlier than the functions of the main cortical motor and visual areas.",

Sixteen healthy males participated in a single-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design study involving 4 experimental trials (separated by \u22657\u00a0d). In each trial, participants were dehydrated by 2.5% body mass through exercise. After 1\u00a0h recovery in a thermo-neutral environment (22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0\u00b0C, 60\u201370% relative humidity) 4 tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) were administered to the participants (test 1). In two of the trials, participants were provided with water equivalent to either 50% or 150% body mass loss and given salt (NaCl) capsules (50\u00a0mmol/L). A set volume of alcohol or placebo was then consumed in each trial, incorporating the conditions: dehydration-placebo (DP), dehydration-alcohol (DA), partial rehydration-alcohol (PA), and full rehydration-alcohol (FA). The same 4 CANTAB tasks were then re-administered (test 2). Subjective ratings of mood and estimates of alcohol intoxication and driving impairment were also recorded in each trial. Alcohol consumption caused deterioration on 3 of the 4 CANTAB measures (viz., choice reaction time, executive function and response inhibition). This reduction in performance was exacerbated when participants were dehydrated compared to trials where full rehydration occurred. Subjective ratings of impairment and intoxication were not significantly different between any of the trials where alcohol was consumed; however ratings for alcohol trials were significantly higher than in the placebo trial. These findings suggest that rehydration after exercise that causes fluid loss can attenuate alcohol-related deterioration of cognitive functions. This may pose implications for post match fluid replacement if a moderate amount of alcohol is also consumed.",

Twenty-four male Lewis rats were fed a thiamine deficient diet, which contained 0.04% of normal thiamine intake. Six control rats were fed 200\u00a0\u03bcg of thiamine per day. Every week a group of six rats on the thiamine-deficient diet was sacrificed and blood, urine and tissue were stored. Blood and tissue transketolase activity, thiamine and thiamine metabolites were measured and PCR of thiamine transporter-1 (ThTr-1) was performed. Transketolase activity was significantly reduced in red blood cells, liver, lung, kidney and spleen tissue after two weeks of thiamine deficient diet. In brain tissue, transketolase activity was not reduced after up to four weeks of thiamine deficient diet. The amount of thiamine pyrophosphate was also significantly conserved in brain and heart tissue (decrease of 31% and 28% respectively), compared to other tissues (decrease of \u223c70%) after four weeks of thiamine deficient diet. There was no difference between tissues in ThTr-1 expression after four weeks of thiamine deficient diet. Despite the fact that the heart and the brain are predilection sites for complications from thiamine deficiency, these tissues are protected against thiamine deficiency. Other organs could be suffering from thiamine deficiency without resulting in clinical signs of classic thiamine deficiency in beriberi and Wernicke's encephalopathy.",

Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients are associated with increased morbidity and mortality after injury, and high systemic and pulmonary levels of IL-6 have been observed after the combined insult of ethanol exposure and burn injury. To further investigate the role of IL-6 in the pulmonary inflammatory response, we examined leukocyte infiltration and cytokine and chemokine production in the lungs of wild-type and IL-6 knockout mice given vehicle or ethanol (1.11\u00a0g/kg) and subjected to a sham or 15% total body surface area burn injury. Levels of neutrophil infiltration and neutrophil chemoattractants were increased to a similar extent in wild-type and IL-6 knockout mice 24\u00a0h after burn injury. When ethanol exposure preceded the burn injury, however, a further increase of these inflammatory markers was seen only in the wild-type mice. Additionally, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) phosphorylation did not increase in response to ethanol exposure in the IL-6 knockout mice, in contrast to their wild-type counterparts. Visual and imaging analysis of alveolar wall thickness supported these findings and similar results were obtained by blocking IL-6 with antibody.

This study investigated the effects of acute ethanol intake on the TLR4 pathway in rat intestinal epithelia, which usually encounters luminal antigens at first and participates in the development of intestinal immunity. Twenty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to an ethanol group given ethanol as a 25% (v/v) solution in water at 7.5\u00a0g/kg, or a control group given saline, by oral gavage daily for 3\u00a0days. The epithelial histology and ultrastructure, the intestinal microflora, peripheral and portal venous plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels, and somatostatin (SST) levels in the peripheral plasma and small intestine were evaluated. Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), TLR4, TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK1), activated nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in the intestinal mucosa were assayed. LPS responsiveness with or without SST pretreatment was assayed in\u00a0vitro by quantification of TLR4, TBK1, activated NF-\u03baB, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in isolated intestinal epithelia. Mucosal damage was observed in the ethanol group by light and electron microscopy. Escherichia coli cultures were unchanged in rat intestine of the ethanol group compared with controls, but lactobacilli cultures were reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). LPS levels increased in peripheral and portal venous plasma (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but mucosal TLR4, TBK1, nuclear NF-\u03baB, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 were unchanged in the ethanol group.

The stimulatory effects of LPS on intestinal epithelia isolated from the control group were significantly inhibited by SST pretreatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The peripheral plasma and intestinal levels of SST and the mucosal expression of SSTR2 in the ethanol group were significantly higher than in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These findings suggest the hyposensitivity of intestinal epithelial TLR4 to LPS induced by acute alcohol abuse probably through ethanol per se and ethanol-enhanced intestinal mucosal SST pathway may be a novel mechanism for increased susceptibility to intestinal pathogens.",

Using a large birth cohort study, which includes the mother, father and child triad, this study aims to determine the prevalence and change in any harmful drinking levels prenatally, antenatally and in the postpartum period for mothers and fathers, and to measure the concordance of both partners' reports of that drinking in an ethnically representative sample of Pacific families within New Zealand. Participants were selected from births where at least one parent was identified as being of Pacific ethnicity and a New Zealand permanent resident (1376 mothers and 825 fathers at baseline); many of whom are young to middle aged adults. These participants have been prospectively followed-up multiple times since. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test consumption questions (AUDIT-C) were used over successive measurement waves to define any and harmful drinking levels. Recommended screening thresholds were employed. Longitudinal analyses on complete cases and imputed data, accounting for differential attrition, were undertaken and reported. Clear temporal patterns of alcohol consumption emerged for both mothers and fathers, together with significant and important ethnic differences. Moreover, there was considerable movement in alcohol consumption categories between consecutive measurement waves for both mothers and fathers. Among couples, there was significant asymmetry in drinking patterns and poor statistical agreement. However, 9.1% (14.1% in imputed analyses) of Pacific children aged 2 years had both parents indicated for harmful drinking. The significant important heterogeneity and ethnic differences suggest that both ethnic-specific and pan-Pacific interventions and prevention strategies are likely needed for successful interventions. More emphasis should be placed on targeting and addressing parents' alcohol misuse, particularly in the antenatal or postnatal period.",

Using age of onset variables created for the purpose, analysis was done to determine rates of and risk factor for transition between the levels. Lifetime prevalence estimates were 57.8% for alcohol use, 27.6% for regular use, 2.9% for abuse, and 0.3% for dependence. Whereas 47.8% transited to regular use from lifetime ever use, only 10.5% transited to abuse from regular use and 9.5% from abuse to dependence. Male sex, age 18\u201349\u00a0years and being never married predicted onset of alcohol use. Transition to regular use was predicted only by male sex while transition to abuse was predicted by male sex and age 35\u201349\u00a0years. Factors associated with recovery from abuse were female sex and a student status. Higher rates of transition occurred in the stages preceding the onset of alcohol use disorders. Sex and age were the main determinants of transition, with male gender and middle age being risk factors for transition to problematic use of alcohol.",

C57BL/6N mice were fed Lieber-DeCarli liquid diets containing EtOH and enriched in USF (corn oil/linoleic acid) or SF (medium chain triglycerides: beef tallow) for 8\u00a0weeks. Intestinal histology, morphometry, markers of inflammation, as well as levels of mucus protective factors were evaluated. Alcohol and dietary USF triggered an intestinal pro-inflammatory response, characterized by increase in Tnf-\u03b1, MCP1, and MPO activity. Further, alcohol and dietary USF, but not SF, resulted in alterations of the intestinal mucus layer, characterized by decreased expression of Muc2 in the ileum. A strong correlation was observed between down-regulation of the antimicrobial factor Cramp and increased Tnf-\u03b1 mRNA. Therefore, dietary unsaturated fat (corn oil/LA enriched) is a significant contributing factor to EtOH-mediated intestinal inflammatory response and mucus layer alterations in rodents.",

     "abstract": "The high co-morbidity between alcohol (ethanol) and nicotine abuse suggests that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), thought to underlie nicotine dependence, may also be involved in alcohol dependence. The \u03b22* nAChR subtype serves as a potential interface for these interactions since they are the principle mediators of nicotine dependence and have recently been shown to modulate some acute responses to ethanol. Therefore, the aim of this study was to more fully characterize the role of \u03b22* nAChRs in ethanol-responsive behaviors in mice after acute exposure to the drug. We conducted a battery of tests in mice lacking the \u03b22* coding gene (Chrnb2) or pretreated with a selective \u03b22* nAChR antagonist for a range of ethanol-induced behaviors including locomotor depression, hypothermia, hypnosis, and anxiolysis. We also tested the effect of deletion on voluntary escalated ethanol consumption in an intermittent access two-bottle choice paradigm to determine the extent of these effects on drinking behavior. Our results showed that antagonism of \u03b22* nAChRs modulated some acute behaviors, namely by reducing recovery time from hypnosis and enhancing the anxiolytic-like response produced by acute ethanol in mice. Chrnb2 deletion had no effect on ethanol drinking behavior, however. We provide further evidence that \u03b22* nAChRs have a measurable role in mediating specific behavioral effects induced by acute ethanol exposure without affecting drinking behavior directly. We conclude that these receptors, along with being key components in nicotine dependence, may also present viable candidates in the discovery of the molecular underpinnings of alcohol dependence.",

To simulate binge drinking, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of 25% (v/v) ethanol (3\u00a0g/kg) on postnatal days (PND) 25, 26, 29, 30, 33, 34, 37 and 38. On PND 42 and PND 61 animals were tested on their ability to traverse both square and round beams. There were no significant differences in the time to traverse the beams, or the amount of foot slips, between treated and untreated animals. On PND 48 and PND 62, animals were tested using a horizontal ladder walking apparatus. On PND 48 there were no differences in the ability of treated and untreated animals to traverse the ladder. On PND 62, there were no differences in the time to traverse the ladder, but ethanol treated animals had more foot slips than controls. On PND 43, we conducted footprint analysis of control and treated animals, which included measurements of stride length, paw overlap, and angle of foot placement. There was a significant difference in the angle of foot placement between treated and control animals, and this finding was significant for both male and female animals. There was also a significant overall difference in paw overlap between treatment groups. Although this effect was manifested in male animals there was no significant difference in females. These findings suggest that adolescent ethanol exposure can produce long-lasting effects on motor coordination, and that overall, effects are similar in males and females. In a second set of experiments, male rats received i.p. ethanol (3\u00a0g/kg) for 7 days (P31\u201337) or 4 days (P31,33,35,37). No significant differences were detected by footprint analysis when compared to control animals. However, ethanol treated animals had significantly less cerebellar Purkinje cells at 3 weeks after the last ethanol exposure. Altered motor function suggests a possible neurodegenerative effect in the cerebellum initiated by adolescent ethanol exposure, and may depend on the extent of exposure during the preadolescent and/or adolescent brain periods.",

In this regard, quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has emerged as an essential technique in our efforts to characterize alterations in gene expression brought on by exposure to alcohol. However, many publications continue to report the utilization of inappropriate methods of qPCR normalization, and for many in\u00a0vitro models, no consistent set of empirically tested normalization controls have been identified. In the present study, we sought to identify a group of candidate reference genes for use within studies of alcohol exposed embryonic, placental, and neurosphere stem cells under both conditions maintaining stemness as well as throughout in\u00a0vitro differentiation. To this end, we surveyed the recent literature and compiled a short list of fourteen candidate genes commonly used as normalization controls in qPCR studies of gene expression. This list included: Actb, B2m, Gapdh, Gusb, H2afz, Hk2, Hmbs, Hprt, Mrpl1, Pgk1, Ppia, Sdha, Tbp, and Ywhaz. From these studies, we find no single candidate gene was consistently refractory to the influence of alcohol nor completely stable throughout in\u00a0vitro differentiation. Accordingly, we propose normalizing qPCR measurements to the geometric mean CT values obtained for three independent reference mRNAs as a reliable method to accurately interpret qPCR data and assess alterations in gene expression within alcohol treated cultures. Highlighting the importance of careful and empirical reference gene selection, the commonly used reference gene Actb was often amongst the least stable candidate genes tested. In fact, it would not serve as a valid normalization control in many cases. Data presented here will aid in the design of future experiments using stem cells to study the transcriptional processes driving differentiation, and model the developmental impact of teratogens.",

Diosmin is a flavone glycoside, having anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Thirty female Wistar rats segregated in five groups, each with six animals. Group I as control followed by Group II, III and IV were treated with ethanol for 28 days. While groups III and IV were administered with diosmin at 10\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0b wt (D1) and 20\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0b wt (D2) respectively prior to ethanol administration. Group V was given only higher dose of diosmin. In ethanol-treated group, ethanol metabolizing enzymes viz., CYP 450 2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) significantly increased by 77.82% and 32.32% in liver tissues respectively as compared with control group and this enhancement is significantly normalized with diosmin administration. Diosmin administration (D1 & D2) significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) attenuates oxidative stress markers i.e., LPO, GSH, GPx, GR and XO by 90.77 & 137.55%, 17.18 & 25%, 37.3 & 49.86%, 21.63 & 44.9% and 56.14 &77.19% respectively.

Ethanol-incubated primary rat hepatocytes (100\u00a0mmol/L) were treated by quercetin, bilirubin, inflammatory factors, and/or HO-1 inducer/inhibitor for 24\u00a0h, and the cellular damage was assayed. Quercetin lowered ethanol-induced glutathione depletion and superoxide dismutase inactivation, inhibited the overproduction of malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species, and decreased the leakage of cellular aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, accompanying the normalization of bilirubin level. The effect of quercetin was mimicked by exogenous bilirubin in a dose-dependent manner to some extent (within 25\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) and pharmacological HO-1 inducer hemin, but abolished by HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin-IX. Inflammatory challenge of TNF-\u03b1 plus IL-6 further aggravated ethanol-induced oxidative damage, which was also attenuated by bilirubin in part. These findings shed a light on the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory role of bilirubin released from quercetin/HO-1 and biliverdin reductase pathway against ethanol hepatotoxicity and highlight a prospective strategy of nutritional intervention for ALD by naturally occurring quercetin to induce HO-1 with the release of bioactive end-products.",

The current study assessed vulnerability for alcohol-related consequences by comparing self-reported drinking with coping styles and physiological and behavioral stress responses during a challenging task. Cardiovascular measurements and saliva samples were taken from 88 female students at the beginning of the experiment and after the task. Hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal (HPA) activity was measured by assessing cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) salivary levels. The behavioral task consisted of a set of three anagrams of increasing difficulty, the last of which had no possible solution, to test the distress tolerance of the participants. Results showed that the majority of participants (70%) reported drinking in the six months prior to data collection, most of whom reported at least one incident of binge drinking. Excessive alcohol use was related to an impaired physiological response to stress during the impossible task. College students who drank to cope with stress had significantly higher basal levels of cortisol and DHEA, an indication of HPA axis over-regulation, while their stress response remained remarkably flat. Self-reported consequences of drinking were related to motives for drinking and lower DHEA levels. Regression analysis indicated that higher cortisol levels mediated the relationship between motives for drinking and problematic drinking.",

Three different solutions of alcoholic liquor (ethanol 55.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45\u00a0g) with different dissolved oxygen concentrations were administered, and blood alcohol concentration was determined in 59 healthy subjects using a breath analyzer. Samples (n\u00a0=\u00a02955) were collected at various time points. Population pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to describe the pharmacokinetics of ethanol. The influence of individuals' demography and dissolved oxygen concentration was investigated, and Visual Predictive Check and bootstrapping were conducted for internal evaluation. The developed model was used to perform simulations to visualize the effects of covariates on individuals. A one-compartment model with Michaelis\u2013Menten elimination kinetics described the multiple ethanol intake data. Population pharmacokinetic estimates of Vmax and Km were 3.256\u00a0mmol\u00a0min\u22121 and 0.8183\u00a0mmol\u00a0L\u22121, respectively. Vd/F was estimated to be 77.0\u00a0L, and Ka was 0.0767\u00a0min\u22121. Body weight, age, and the dissolved oxygen concentration were confirmed to be significant covariates. The mean estimates from the developed population pharmacokinetic model were very similar to those from 500 bootstrap samples, and Visual Predictive Check showed that approximately 94% of the observed data fit well within the 5th\u201395th percentile. A one-compartment model with nonlinear elimination kinetics for multiple ethanol intake was developed and the significant covariates were determined. The robustness of the developed model was evaluated by bootstrap and Visual Predictive Check.

Measures of impulsive personality, WMC, and alcohol problems were assessed in a sample of young adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0474), that varied widely in severity of alcohol problems, 57% of whom had alcohol dependence. Simple correlations revealed that WMC, impulsive personality traits, and alcohol problems were all significantly related. Structural equation models (SEMs) showed that impulsivity partially mediated the association between WMC and alcohol problems.

The right hippocampus was significantly smaller in adult alcoholic patients with adolescent-onset use compared to the controls and the late-onset group.

This paper describes the proportions in a general population sample that meet different numbers of diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence and their association with drinking and social background factors. Data came from a random, cross-sectional, self-report survey of adults from 12 Swedish communities. 28,800 persons, age 19\u201370, were surveyed through postal questionnaires. 14,706 questionnaires (51%) could be used for analysis. Alcohol dependence was assessed by questions relating to the seven DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. Alcohol consumption and social background factors were examined in relation to alcohol dependence. A total of 73.8% of the general population fulfilled no criteria for alcohol dependence; 4.0% reported 3 or more criteria and qualified for the diagnosis of alcohol dependence. There were trends toward an increasing number of dependence criteria with increasing consumption levels and negative social background factors. The majority of people with alcohol dependence however did not drink at the highest consumption levels, did not live alone, and were not unemployed. Given the current definition of alcohol dependence the majority of people have few criteria fulfilled (3 or 4) and few social problems. This has important implications for treatment as dependence with low severity may require less treatment and less specialist involvement.",

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of dissolved oxygen in alcohol and the supportive effect of oxygenated water on alcohol pharmacokinetics after the excessive consumption of alcohol, i.e., 540\u00a0ml of 19.5% alcohol (v/v). Fifteen healthy males were included in this randomized, 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03 crossover study. Three combinations were tested: X, normal alcoholic beverage and normal water; Y, oxygenated alcoholic beverage and normal water; Z, oxygenated alcoholic beverage and oxygenated water. Blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) were determined by conversion of breath alcohol concentrations. Four pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, Kel, and AUCall) were obtained using non-compartmental analysis and the times to reach 0.05% and 0.03% BAC (T0.05% and T0.03%) were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan's post hoc test. With combination Z, the BAC decreased to 0.05% significantly faster (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than with combination X. Analyzing the pharmacokinetic parameters, the mean Kel was significantly higher for combination Z than for combinations X and Y (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the mean values of Cmax, Tmax and AUCall did not differ significantly among the combinations. Dissolved oxygen in drinks accelerates the decrease in BAC after consuming a large amount of alcohol. However, the oxygen dissolved in the alcoholic beverage alone did not have a sufficient effect in this case. We postulate that highly oxygenated water augments the effect of oxygen in the alcoholic beverage in alcohol elimination. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the supportive effect of ingesting additional oxygenated water after heavy drinking of normal alcoholic beverages.",

     "abstract": "The opioid system is known to enhance motivated behaviors, including ethanol drinking and food ingestion, by acting in various reward-related brain regions, such as the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area and medial hypothalamus. There is indirect evidence, however, suggesting that opioid peptides may act differently in the perifornical lateral hypothalamus (PF/LH), causing a suppression of consummatory behavior. Using brain-cannulated Sprague\u2013Dawley rats trained to voluntarily drink 7% ethanol, the present study tested the hypothesis that opioids in the PF/LH can reduce the consumption of ethanol, with animals receiving PF/LH injections of the \u03b4-opioid receptor agonist D-Ala2-met-enkephalinamide (DALA), the \u03bc-receptor agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), the \u03ba-receptor agonist (\u00b1)-trans-U-50,488 methanesulfonate (U-50,488H), or the general opioid antagonist methylated naloxone (m-naloxone). The consumption of ethanol, lab chow, and water was monitored for 4\u00a0h after injection. The results showed that the three opioid receptor agonists injected into the PF/LH specifically and significantly reduced ethanol intake, while causing little change in chow or water intake, and the opposite effect, enhanced ethanol intake, was observed with the opioid antagonist. Of the three opioid agonists, the \u03b4-agonist appears to produce the most consistent and long-lasting suppression of consumption. This effect was not observed with injections 2\u00a0mm dorsal to this area, focusing attention on the PF/LH as the main site of action. These results suggest that the opioid peptides have a specific role in the PF/LH of reducing ethanol drinking, which is distinct from their more commonly observed appetitive actions in other brain areas. The additional finding, that m-naloxone in the PF/LH stimulates ethanol intake in contrast to its generally suppressive effect in other regions, focuses attention on this hypothalamic area and its distinctive role in contributing to the variable effects sometimes observed with opioid antagonist therapy for alcoholism.",

Significant changes in the proteins could implicate activation of specific neuroinflammatory signaling pathways in these rats as well as in severely binge-intoxicated adult animals that are reported to incur degeneration of vulnerable neurons in HC and EC. Male Wistar rats, ethanol-intoxicated (3\u00a0g/kg i.p.) once daily for 6 days over an 8-day interval beginning at 37 days old and repeated at age 68\u201375 days, were sacrificed 1\u00a0h after the day 75 dose (blood ethanol, 200\u2013 230\u00a0mg/dl). Analysis of HC with an immunoblot technique showed that AQP4, Ca+2-dependent PLA2 (cPLA2 IVA), phosphorylated (activated) p-cPLA2, cleaved (89\u00a0kD) PARP (c-PARP), and caspase-3 levels were significantly elevated over controls, whereas Ca+2-independent PLA2 (iPLA2 VIA) was reduced \u223c70%; however, cleaved caspase-3 was undetectable. In the EC, AQP4 was unchanged, but cPLA2 and p-cPLA2 were significantly increased while iPLA2 levels were diminished (\u223c40%) similar to HC, although just outside statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). In addition, EC levels of PARP-1 and c-PARP were significantly increased. The ethanol-induced activation of cPLA2 in association with reduced iPLA2 mirrors PLA2 changes in reports of neurotrauma and also of dietary omega-3 fatty acid depletion. Furthermore, the robust PARP-1 elevations accompanied by negligible caspase-3 activation indicate that repetitive ethanol intoxication may be potentiating non-apoptotic neurodegenerative processes such as parthanatos. Overall, the repetitive ethanol treatments appeared to instigate previously unappreciated neuroinflammatory pathways in\u00a0vivo. The data provide insights into mechanisms of binge ethanol abuse that might suggest new therapeutic approaches to counter neurodegeneration and dementia.",

Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that third trimester equivalent binge alcohol exposure at a dose of 1.75\u00a0g/kg/day results in significant fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss in fetal sheep and that both maternal and fetal adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol levels are elevated in response to alcohol treatment. In this study, we hypothesized that repeated elevations in cortisol from chronic binge alcohol are responsible at least in part for fetal neuronal deficits. Animals were divided into four treatment groups: normal control, pair-fed saline control, alcohol and cortisol. The magnitude of elevation in cortisol in response to alcohol was mimicked in the cortisol group by infusing pregnant ewes with hydrocortisone for 6\u00a0h on each day of the experiment, and administering saline during the first hour in lieu of alcohol. The experiment was conducted on three consecutive days followed by four days without treatment beginning on gestational day (GD) 109 until GD 132. Peak maternal blood alcohol concentration in the alcohol group was 239\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0mg/dl. The fetal brains were collected and processed for stereological cell counting on GD 133. The estimated total number of fetal cerebellar Purkinje cells, the reference volume and the Purkinje cell density were not altered in response to glucocorticoid infusion in the absence of alcohol. These results suggest that glucocorticoids independently during the third trimester equivalent may not produce fetal cerebellar Purkinje cell loss. However, the elevations in cortisol along with other changes induced by alcohol could together lead to brain injury seen in the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",

After the initial confirmation that iP rats displayed lower body weight when compared to iNP rats (data not shown), body weight and growth rates of each chromosome 4 reciprocal congenic rat strain (P.NP and NP.P) were measured, and their body weight was consistent with their respective donor strain phenotype, confirming that a quantitative trait locus for body weight mapped to the chromosome 4 interval.

To this end, sP rats were exposed to the homecage, 2-bottle \u201calcohol (10%, v/v) vs water\u201d choice regimen, with unlimited access for 24\u00a0h/day. rac-BHFF was administered once daily and for 7 consecutive days at the doses of 0, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0mg/kg (i.g.).

An increase in daily water intake fully compensated the reduction in alcohol intake, so that daily total fluid intake was unaffected by treatment with rac-BHFF. Daily food intake tended to be reduced only by the highest dose of rac-BHFF. These results complement closely with previous data indicating that (a) rac-BHFF suppressed operant, oral alcohol self-administration in sP rats and (b) the prototypic GABAB PAMs, CGP7930 and GS39783, reduced alcohol drinking in sP rats. However, while the reducing effect of CGP7930 and GS39783 on the daily alcohol intake tended to vanish after the first 2\u20133 days of treatment, the reducing effect of rac-BHFF on daily alcohol intake remained unchanged over the entire 7-day treatment period.

The progressive nature of ALD is well described; however, the complex interactions under which these pathologies evolve remain to be fully elucidated. Clinically there are no clear biomarkers or universally accepted, effective treatment strategies for ALD. Experimental models of ALD are an important component in identifying underlying mechanisms of alcohol-induced injury to develop better diagnostic markers, predictors of disease progression, and therapeutic targets to manage, halt, or reverse disease progression. Rodents remain the most accessible model for studying ALD pathology. Effective rodent models must mimic the natural history of ALD while allowing examination of complex interactions between multiple hepatic, and non-hepatic, cell types in the setting of altered metabolic or oxidative/nitrosative stress, inflammatory responses, and sensitivity to cytotoxic stress. Additionally, mode and duration of alcohol delivery influence hepatic response and present unique challenges in understanding disease pathology. This review provides an overview of rodent models of ALD, their strengths and weaknesses relative to human disease states, and provides insight of the potential to develop novel rodent models to simulate the course of human ALD.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that chronic exposure to ethanol lowers blood pressure (BP) via altering cardiac contractility and autonomic control in female rats. In this investigation we conducted pharmacological and molecular studies to elucidate the role of constitutive and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in these hemodynamic effects of ethanol. Changes caused by selective inhibition of eNOS [N5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine; l-NIO], nNOS (N\u03c9-propyl-l-arginine; NPLA), or iNOS (1400W) in BP, heart rate (HR), myocardial contractility index (dP/dtmax), and power spectral indices of hemodynamic variability were evaluated in telemetered female rats receiving ethanol (5%, w/v) or control liquid diet for 8 weeks. Ethanol increased plasma nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and enhanced the phosphorylation of eNOS and nNOS, but not iNOS, in the tail artery. Ethanol also reduced BP,\u00a0+dP/dtmax, low-frequency bands of interbeat intervals (IBILF, 0.25\u20130.75\u00a0Hz) and IBILF/HF ratio while high-frequency bands (IBIHF, 0.75\u20133\u00a0Hz) were increased, suggesting parasympathetic overactivity. l-NIO (20\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) caused greater increases in BP in control than in ethanol-fed rats but elicited similar reductions in IBILF/HF and\u00a0+dP/dtmax both groups. NPLA (1\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) caused minimal effects in control rats but exacerbated the reductions in BP,\u00a0+dP/dtmax, and IBILF/HF in ethanol-fed rats. No hemodynamic modifications were caused by 1400W (5\u00a0mg/kg i.p.) in either rat group. Together, these findings suggest that nNOS acts tonically to offset the detrimental cardiovascular actions of ethanol in female rats, and the enhanced vascular NO bioavailability may explain the blunted l-NIO evoked pressor response in ethanol-fed rats.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol, a drug widely abused, impacts the central nervous system functioning of diverse organisms. The behavioral responses to acute alcohol exposure are remarkably similar among humans and fruit flies. In its natural environment, rich in fermentation products, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster encounters relatively high levels of ethanol. The effects of ethanol and its metabolites on Drosophila have been studied for decades, as a model for adaptive evolution. Although extensive work has been done for elucidating patterns of genetic variation, substantially less is known about the genomic regions or genes that underlie the genetic variation of this important trait. To identify regions containing genes involved in the responses to ethanol, we used a mapping population of recombinant inbred (RIL) lines to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variation in resistance and recovery from ethanol sedation in adults and ethanol resistance in larvae. We mapped fourteen QTL affecting the response to ethanol on the three chromosomes. Seven of the QTL influence the resistance to ethanol in adults, two QTL are related to ethanol-coma recovery in adults and five affect the survival to ethanol in larvae. Most of the QTL were trait specific, suggesting that overlapping but generally unique genetic architectures underlie each trait. Each QTL explained up to 16.8% of the genetic variance among lines. Potential candidate loci contained within our QTL regions were identified and analyzed.",

     "abstract": "In the present study, we sought to determine whether the interoceptive effects of alcohol (1\u00a0g/kg, IG) could be assessed using a Pavlovian discrimination method, in which the alcohol drug state sets the occasion for which an environmental stimulus (e.g., light) will be followed by a sucrose reward. This procedure takes advantage of a naturally occurring behavior (i.e., food-seeking) which can be trained rapidly prior to the initiation of discrimination training. Given that the interoceptive effects of alcohol are routinely assessed using operant drug discrimination methods, another group of rats was trained using standard two-lever operant drug discrimination procedures in an effort to compare the Pavlovian procedure to a known behavioral benchmark. The results from this work show that, in addition to operant discrimination procedures, a Pavlovian discrimination task can be used to evaluate the interoceptive effects of alcohol. In addition to the brief behavioral sucrose access training (3 days) required prior to the initiation of the Pavlovian discrimination, the alcohol discrimination was acquired relatively rapidly (i.e., 8 training sessions), shortening the overall duration of the experiment. These features of the Pavlovian procedure make it a valuable method by which to assess the interoceptive effects of alcohol if a short experimental time frame is required, such as assessing the interoceptive effects of alcohol during a brief developmental window (e.g., adolescence) or determining the effects of a pretreatment (i.e., chronic stress, chronic drug pretreatment) on the acquisition of the alcohol discrimination. As such, this initial characterization confirms the feasibility of using this Pavlovian discrimination training method as an additional tool by which to assess the interoceptive effects of alcohol, as there may be experimental situations that necessitate short term discrimination training.",

Unfortunately, research has predominantly focused in cardiometabolic problems, neglecting other important areas. In fact, the immune-calcium\u2013skeletal interface has been understudied despite its potential relevance in people living with HIV (PLWH). Using a case-control methodology, 200 PLWH receiving medical care were enrolled and stratified according to hazardous vs. non-hazardous alcohol intake (HAU vs. non-HAU) and calcium (Ca) levels by analyzing baseline data. The group was chosen to represent relatively \"pure\" HAU with minimal drug use and no psychiatric diagnoses. With these narrow parameters in place, we found evidence that HAU significantly increases TNF-\u03b1 levels compared to Non-HAU (2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 vs. 1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0pg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and decreases blood Ca levels (9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 vs. 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Our analyses also suggest that chronic inflammation, as indicated by increased TNF-\u03b1 levels, is associated with hypocalcemia (hypoCa <8.6). Despite the limited prevalence of hypoCa, these findings are clinically significant given that hypoCA PLWH exhibited decreased CD4 (253\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0224 vs. 417.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0281, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), B cells (147\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058 vs. 248\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0151, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and NK cells (146.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a090 vs. 229\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0148, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and elevated CD8 (902.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0438 vs. 699\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0510, p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) compared to those with normal calcium. Furthermore, calcium effects on viral load were also evident with hypoCA exhibiting the highest loads (140,187\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0111 vs. 35,622\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07770 HIV copies, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

     "publication date": "12-2012",
     "abstract": "Although the relationship between alcohol and injury incidence is well researched, there continues to be dispute about the relationship between alcohol and mortality following an injury. Findings from past studies have varied primarily because of methodological issues and have failed to characterize the dose\u2013response relationship. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the dose response relationship of in-hospital mortality and blood alcohol concentration (BAC). This study was a retrospective analysis of traumatic injuries occurring between 1995 and 2009 as reported by all level 1 and 2 trauma units in the State of Illinois. The study includes all patients with blood alcohol toxicological examination levels ranging from zero to 500\u00a0mg/dl (N\u00a0=\u00a0190,612). The Illinois trauma registry includes all patients sustaining traumatic injuries and admitted to a trauma center for \u226512\u00a0h. A total of 6733 patients meeting the inclusion criteria died following admission. Patients that were dead on arrival and those that died during the initial assessment within the emergency room were excluded. In the adjusted multivariable model, a decrease in in-hospital mortality was strongly associated with an increase in blood alcohol concentration (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.83 per 100\u00a0mg/dl units change in BAC; CI 95%: 0.80, 0.85; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The direction of the dose response relationship was consistent across the stratified models, with the exception of patients suffering burns. The largest reduction of in-hospital case fatality rates by blood alcohol concentration was observed among patients suffering penetrating or severe injuries (Injury Severity Score\u00a0\u2265\u00a016). In the clinical setting, it is important to understand not only how to recognize intoxicated patients, but also how alcohol may affect the course of treatment. The consistency of the findings across the multivariable models indicates that blood alcohol concentration is strongly associated with lower in-hospital mortality among those that survive long enough to receive treatment in specialized trauma units.",

Three hundred and fifty-four inpatients with alcohol dependence from five regions of China were interviewed in person by five trained interviewers using the ASI-C-5. Responses were then analyzed for internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, criterion validity, and responsiveness. Forty subjects were re-interviewed 7 days later to assess test\u2013retest reliability. The ASI-C-5 had good internal consistency, with an overall standardized Cronbach's alpha of 0.79. The Cronbach's alpha values for internal consistency of domain CSs ranged from 0.48 to 0.95, and were above 0.60 for six domains. The 7 day test\u2013retest reliability was acceptable as evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients (0.75\u20130.92, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for 6 of 7 domain CSs. Correlation coefficients between the seven domain CSs ranged from 0.007 to 0.390 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or 0.01 two-sided), indicating strong discriminant validity. The correlation coefficient between the alcohol dependence composite score of ASI-C-5 and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) was 0.69 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), indicating good criterion validity. The frequency of extreme scores was low, except for significant floor effects in the \u201cDrugs\u201d and \u201cLegal Status\u201d domains.

To resolve this ambiguity and better approximate in\u00a0vivo conditions, we quantitatively analyzed neuronal morphology using a new, whole hemisphere explant model. In this model, Layer 6 (L6) cortical neurons migrate, laminate and extend neurites in an organotypic fashion. To selectively label L6 neurons, we performed ex utero electroporation of a GFP expression construct at embryonic day 13 and allowed the explants to develop for 2 days in\u00a0vitro. Explants were exposed to (400\u00a0mg/dL) ethanol for either 4 or 24\u00a0h prior to fixation. Complete 3-D reconstructions were made of >80 GFP-positive neurons in each experimental condition. Acute responses to ethanol exposure included compaction of the Golgi apparatus accompanied by elaboration of supernumerary primary apical neurites, as well as a modest (\u223c15%) increase in higher order apical neurite length. With longer exposure time, ethanol exposure leads to a consistent, significant disorientation of the cell (cell body, primary apical neurite, and Golgi) with respect to the pial surface. The effects on cellular orientation were accompanied by decreased expression of cytoskeletal elements, microtubule-associated protein 2 and F-actin. These findings indicate that upon exposure to ethanol, developing L6 neurons manifest disruptions in Golgi apparatus and cytoskeletal elements which may in turn trigger selective and significant perturbations to primary neurite formation and neuronal polarity.",

A role for non-coding RNAs in alcoholism is beginning to emerge. PCR-differential display using total RNA extracted from brain material of human alcoholics and control cases identified a cDNA fragment corresponding to a section of a known non protein-coding RNA (ncRNA), MALAT-1, (also known as NEAT2). Comparison of mRNA levels of MALAT-1 was performed by northern and dot blot experiments using different regions of brain from human alcoholics and rats chronically treated with ethanol vapours and following withdrawal. A massive increase of MALAT-1 transcripts was detected in cerebellum of human alcoholics and increases were also noted in hippocampus and brain stem, while no significant increase of MALAT-1 expression was noted in frontal or motor cortices. In the rat no significant difference of MALAT-1 ortholog mRNA could be detected in cerebellum. In addition, similarly to humans, no significant increase of MALAT-1 expression was detected in cortex of alcohol-treated rats, however, after 24\u00a0h alcohol withdrawal, a significant upregulation of MALAT-1 expression was observed in rat cortex. MALAT-1 is upregulated in specific regions of the human alcoholic brain and following alcohol withdrawal in the rat. As MALAT-1 regulates RNA processing, this suggests that alcohol-induced upregulation of MALAT-1 represents an important novel mechanism for alcohol actions in the CNS.",

     "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated that alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are regulated by multiple mechanisms such as neurotransmitters and enzymes. The neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may contribute to alcohol effects and serotonin receptors, including 5-HT3, play an important role in AUDs. Recent studies have also implicated histone deacetylases (HDACs) and acetyltransferases (HATS) in regulation of drug addiction, and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been reported as transcriptional modulators of monoaminergic neurotransmission. Therefore, we hypothesize that HDACs may play a role in ethanol-induced serotonergic modulation. The effects of ethanol on serotonin and 5-HT3, and the role HDACs, HDAC activity and the HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), play in alcohol-induced serotonergic effects were studied. Human SK\u2013N\u2013MC and neurons, were treated with ethanol (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2%), and/or TSA (50\u00a0nM), and 5-HT3 levels were assessed at 24\u201372\u00a0h. Gene expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR and protein by western blot and flow cytometry. Serotonin release was assessed by ELISA and HDAC activity by fluorometric assay. Our results show an increase in 5-HT3 gene after ethanol treatment. Further, ethanol significantly increased HDACs 1 and 3 genes accompanied by an increased in HDAC activity while TSA significantly inhibited HDACs. Studies with TSA show a significant upregulation of ethanol effects on 5-HT3, while surprisingly TSA inhibited ethanol-induced serotonin production. These results suggest that ethanol affects 5-HT3 and serotonin through mechanisms involving HDACs and HATs. In summary, our studies demonstrate some of the novel properties of HDAC inhibitors and contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involve in alcohol-serotonergic modulation in the CNS.",

In Experiment 1, rats were given four 30\u00a0min conditioning sessions with 1.5\u00a0g/kg ethanol (i.p.) or an equivalent volume of saline on the paired side. Animals were found to demonstrate CPP to the ethanol-paired side, an unexpected finding at this relatively high dose in rats. To replicate this finding, and to examine the possibility of non-associative conditioning, an unpaired control group was included in Experiment 2. Once again, rats showed a CPP to the side paired with ethanol relative to either control group. Given that testing in an unfamiliar environment typically results in elevated levels of anxiety and that animals in Experiments 1 and 2 were not exposed to the apparatus prior to conditioning, Experiment 3 was conducted to examine the potential role of context unfamiliarity for induction of ethanol CPP in this test situation by varying whether animals were exposed to the apparatus prior to conditioning. In this study, pre-exposure to the CPP apparatus was found to eliminate the CPP to ethanol observed in rats who were not familiarized with the apparatus. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that ethanol-na\u00efve rats can find ethanol reinforcing as indexed by the CPP test, and provide some evidence for the conditions under which this uncommon finding is observed.",

Relaxant responses to serotonin were decreased in the ethanol-fed group compared to the control groups. In TMM, isoproterenol- and papaverine-induced relaxant responses were similar in the ethanol-fed and control groups. In LES smooth muscle, relaxant responses to papaverine or isoproterenol were similar in the control groups and the ethanol-fed group. There was no change in agonist potency among the groups.

All study participants voluntarily fulfilled a structured, anonymous, and self-questionnaire regarding alcohol and drug use, social-demographic data, and TRB. Alcohol was assessed according to the average number of alcoholic units consumed on standard occasions over the past 12\u00a0months. The associations between alcohol intake and TRB were summarized with odds ratio and their confidence interval obtained from logistic regression. Compared with abstainers students who consumed only one alcohol unit had the risk of being a passenger in a car driven by a drunk driver increased by almost four times, students who reported using five or more units were increased by almost five times the risk of being involved in a car crash. Compared with students who consumed one alcohol unit, the risk of driving under the influence of alcohol increased four times in students using three alcohol units. Age group, use of illicit drugs, employment status, gender, and marital status significantly influenced occurrence of TRB among college students. Our study highlights the potential detrimental effects of low and moderate pattern of alcohol consumption and its relation to riding with an intoxicated driver and other TRB.

Between 1999 and 2010, 37,635 road traffic accidents were evaluated by the Accident Research Unit. Overall 20,741 patients were injured, 2.3% of the patients were killed. Among the injured patients, 2.2% with negative BAC were killed, compared to 4.6% fatal injuries in patients with a positive BAC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Of the patients with a positive BAC, 8.0% were severely injured, compared to 3.6% in the BAC negative group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Regarding the relative speed at impact (\u0394v for motorized drivers, vehicle collision speed for pedestrians and bikers), there was a significant higher difference for BAC positive patients (30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020) compared to the BAC negative patients (25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Alcohol intoxication in trauma patients leads to higher preclinical mortality, higher impact speed difference, and higher injury severity. The subgroup analysis for different alcohol concentrations shows no difference in ISS, MAIS, and relative speed, but a correlation of increasing age of patients with higher alcohol concentrations.",

Three studies were conducted. The first consisted of field research in which 51 barracks were visited and group-interviews were held. The second was an Internet study in which 442 barracks' websites were analyzed using content analysis. The third consisted of a questionnaire completed by 1457 adolescents, aged 15\u201317, in order to explore differences in behavior between barracks visitors and non-visitors. There was wide variation in barracks' characteristics and culture. Barracks' members and visitors also organize diverse activities that are publicly shown on the websites. Barracks are associated with various legal issues, such as alcohol sales to minors, lack of parental supervision, and illicit drug use. Barracks' visitors drink alcohol more frequently, drink more alcohol per occasion (up to fifteen bottles of beer a night), and have been drunk more frequently than non-visitors. Policymakers must be aware of the barracks phenomenon and use their powers in adjacent political and legal areas (such as in binge drinking, illicit drug use, and public safety) to intervene and create solid, responsible, and tailor-made policies.",

A confidential survey was administered to 1229 students in grades 7\u201312 at two schools in a northern border city in Mexico. Youths were categorized into five groups based on their alcohol use frequency and symptoms of DSM-IV alcohol Abuse and Dependence, specifically: no lifetime alcohol use, lifetime alcohol use but none in the past year, past year alcohol use, one or two alcohol Abuse or Dependence symptoms, and three or more alcohol Abuse or Dependence symptoms. The association between five levels of alcohol-use problem severity and three problem behaviors, lifetime marijuana use, lifetime sexual intercourse, and past year arrest/law trouble, was examined using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. Several alcohol-use problem severity categories were significantly different with respect to rates of lifetime marijuana use, lifetime sexual intercourse, and past year arrest/law trouble. Higher alcohol-use problem severity was associated with greater endorsement of problem behaviors. Knowing about variations in adolescent alcohol use and alcohol problems may be instrumental in determining if youths are also engaging in a range of other risk behaviors. Considering varying levels of alcohol use and alcohol problems is important for effective targeted prevention and treatment interventions.",

The purpose of our study was to identify opportunities to detect, assess, and manage alcohol problems in primary care according to evidence-based guidelines. We carried out a cross-sectional study on patients who died from alcohol-related conditions in the calendar year 2003 within National Health Service Greater Glasgow Health Board area, Scotland (population 920,000). We described patient characteristics and care recorded in health service records, comparing it with best evidence-based practice in Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and Health Technology Board for Scotland recommendations on the management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence. 501 deaths occurred from an alcohol-related cause. The mean age at death was 57.5 years and 72% were male. The most common causes of death, recorded by the International Classification of Diseases, revision 10, excluding accidents, were alcoholic liver disease (290, 57.9%) and mental and behavioural disorders due to alcohol (70, 14.0%). Lifetime mean consultations at primary care general practitioner and hospital outpatient departments were 24 in males and 5 in females. All individuals who died from an alcohol-related cause had at least one biochemical or physical indicator suggestive of alcohol misuse. 21% (95% CI 13\u201333%) had no record of having been advised to abstain from alcohol and 23% (95% CI 15\u201335%) had received brief interventions. 58% (95% CI 46\u201370%) had been referred to specialist alcohol services but a third of them did not attend. The majority of patients (83%, 95% CI 72\u201390%) had no evidence of shared health service and social work care. We concluded that individuals who died from alcohol-related conditions were usually in contact with statutory and voluntary services but further efforts were required to use these opportunities to detect, assess, and manage serious alcohol problems according to evidence-based guidelines.",

Cortisol responses to opioid receptor antagonists are assumed to impart information about opioid receptor activity. In the present study we examined naloxone-induced cortisol responses in 18 healthy control (HC) and 25 recently detoxified AD subjects and then correlated the cortisol response with mu opioid receptor availability across 15 brain regions using positron emission tomography (PET) and the mu opioid receptor selective ligand [11C] Carfentanil (CFN). On average the AD subjects required twice the dose of naloxone to induce a peak cortisol response compared to the HC subjects. Using the rising slope of the cortisol curve (placebo to peak) as a metric we then went on to examine the relationship between cortisol responses to naloxone and [11C]CFN BPND. There were significant negative relationships between cortisol and [11C]CFN binding potential (BPND) in multiple brain regions of HC subjects. However, cortisol responses did not correlate with [11C]CFN BPND across any brain region in AD subjects. In summary, naloxone imparts information about individual differences in mu opioid receptor availability throughout the mesolimbic system in healthy individuals. However pathways governing the relationship between naloxone-induced cortisol and mu opioid receptor availability are disrupted during early abstinence in AD subjects.",

     "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between genetic copy number variations and brain volume differences in an alcohol use disorder (AUD) population. We hypothesized that copy number variations may influence subject's risk for alcohol use disorders through variations in regional gray and white matter brain volumes. Since genetic influences upon behavior are the result of many complicated interactions we focus on differences in brain volume as a putative intermediate phenotype between genetic variation and behavior. Copy number variation, alcohol use assessments and brain structural magnetic resonance images from 283 subjects, 199 male and 84 females who were enrolled in two AUD studies were obtained and analyzed using a combination of the Freesurfer image analysis suite and independent component analysis. Because brain volume varies by age we compared participant's volume variation with that derived from a control cohort of 75 subjects. In addition we also regressed out the possible brain volume changes induced by long term alcohol consumption. Small cerebral cortex, cerebellar and caudate along with large cerebral white matter and 5th ventricle volumes are shown to be significantly associated with increased AUD severity. When these volume variations are compared with control subject volumes; the variations seen in subjects with AUD are markedly different from normal aging effects. CNVs at 11 q14.2 are marginally (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 uncorrected) correlated with such brain volume variations and the correlation holds true after controlling for long-term alcohol consumption; deletion carriers have smaller cerebral cortex, cerebellar, caudate and larger cerebral white matter and 5th ventricle volumes than insertion carriers or subjects with no variation in this region. Similarly, deletion carriers also demonstrate higher AUD severity scores than insertion carriers or subjects with no variation. The results presented here suggest that copy number variation and in particular the variation at chromosome 11 q14.2 may have an impact in brain volume variation, potentially influencing AUD behavior.",

     "abstract": "Suicide is one of the major causes of deaths worldwide. Several studies have showed that alcohol use disorders (AUD) are associated with suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion. The majority of the theoretical conceptualization and the bulk of evidence on suicidal behavior and AUD are based on investigations of nonfatal cases because data on nonfatal suicidal behaviors are more readily available. This study aims to explore demographic, clinical, and behavioral dimensions in a large sample of alcohol-related suicides compared to an age-gender matched sample of non-AUD suicides to identify specific factors associated with AUD suicides. We conducted a psychological autopsy study with 158 pairs of AUD and non-AUD suicides. Findings showed that AUD suicides have lower educational level, more biological children and were more likely to be heavy smokers (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.32). Cases were more likely to have family history of alcohol (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.73) and drug abuse (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.61). Subjects had similar prevalences of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders or psychotic disorders. AUD suicides were more likely to meet criteria for current cocaine abuse/dependence (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.64). With respect to personality disorders, AUD suicides presented higher prevalence of Antisocial Personality Disorder (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.68), and were less likely to meet criteria for Avoidant (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.26) and Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorders (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.35). Impulsivity scores were higher in AUD suicides (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18), as well as aggression scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Results form the conditional logistic regression models showed that cocaine abuse/dependence (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.20) and Antisocial Personality Disorder (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.24) were associated with AUD suicide. After controlling for impulsive-aggressive behaviors, levels of aggression were the only psychopathological feature statistically different between AUD and non-AUD suicides (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.28). In conclusion, higher levels of aggressive behaviors are a specific characteristic of AUD suicides. Apart from substance-related diagnoses, AUD and non-AUD suicides have comparable Axis I psychiatric diagnoses and familial transmission of suicidal behavior.",

Between January 2006 and August 2008, a total of 72 cirrhotic male patients with an initial diagnosis of\u00a0HCC, hospitalized in three major hospitals in the Incheon area, were enrolled as cases. Another 72\u00a0cirrhotic male patients without HCC, who matched the cases by age (\u00b13 years), were enrolled as controls. All cases and controls were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HCV, but had history of chronic alcohol intake over 80\u00a0g per day.

     "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that implicit attentional bias to alcohol-related cues may serve as a cognitive measure of susceptibility to alcohol dependence. The primary goal of the current study was to examine whether college students who drink to escape dysphoric emotions or moods (i.e., escape drinkers) have stronger attentional biases for alcohol-related cues than non-escape drinkers. Additionally, because previous research has shown that presentation time and content of smoking-related stimuli moderates differences between smokers' and nonsmokers' reaction times, this study sought to determine whether these effects generalized to alcohol-related stimuli. Participants who were identified as either escape (n\u00a0=\u00a074) or non-escape drinkers (n\u00a0=\u00a048) completed a dot-probe task in which alcohol-related pictures that contained humans interacting with the alcohol-related cues (active) or alcohol-related cues alone (inactive) were presented along with matched control pictures. These stimuli were presented for either 500\u00a0ms or 2000\u00a0ms to determine whether attentional biases occur as a function of initial or maintained attention to the alcohol-related cues. Escape drinkers displayed a significantly stronger attentional bias for alcohol-related inactive cues at longer presentation times (i.e., 2000\u00a0ms) compared to non-escape drinkers. This bias was independent of alcohol dependence and family history of alcoholism. These results suggest that in addition to dependence and family history, escape drinking is an important factor to consider when examining attentional biases to alcohol-related cues.",

     "abstract": "Brief alcohol interventions (BAI) have shown the potential to decrease problematic alcohol use among adolescents and young adults. Most of the BAI studies have been efficacy trials designed to achieve high internal validity but have raised questions regarding the feasibility of large-scale implementation. Providing interventions for those voluntarily wanting them might offer an alternative, and studies using this design would be more similar to effectiveness studies. The present research compares randomly selected 20-year-old men who took part in a scientific trial (efficacy) with those who voluntarily sought an intervention (effectiveness). Sampling took place during army recruitment procedures that are mandatory for all males in Switzerland. At-risk drinking (20+ drinks per week, or more than one risky drinking occasion of 6+ drinks per month) was determined a posteriori; there was no screening. There were a higher percentage of at-risk drinkers in the volunteer arm at baseline, but at-risk drinkers did not differ from those in the trial arm on any of the assessed alcohol measures. This suggests that offering BAI on a large-scale, voluntary basis may reach at-risk drinkers as effectively as do more scientifically oriented trials, without needing to adhere to screening and stringent research procedures. Nevertheless, BAI was more effective for at-risk drinkers who were invited for trial participation versus those who volunteered. This could be due to behavior that is already consolidated and is difficult to change. Lacking further modifications, real-world implementations of BAI for young men may be less effective than randomized controlled trials designed to test the efficacy of BAI.",

     "abstract": "The process of ethanol anticipation is a particularly important phenomenon that can determine subsequent drug-taking behavior. Recent studies suggest that systems within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), during anticipation, may contribute to the goal-directed seeking of ethanol. The current investigation examined the possibility that the opioid peptide enkephalin (ENK), known to mediate some of the reinforcing properties of ethanol, may function in the mPFC during the anticipation of ethanol access. Using a limited access (3\u00a0h/d) paradigm for 10 days with 20% ethanol, Sprague-Dawley rats were first identified either as low drinkers (LD, <1.0\u00a0g/kg/3\u00a0h) or as high drinkers (HD, >2.0\u00a0g/kg/3\u00a0h) that exhibited a long-term phenotype of high ethanol consumption and a significant ethanol deprivation effect. During the anticipation period immediately preceding daily ethanol access, the HD rats compared to LD or Control animals with ad libitum ethanol access exhibited increased anticipatory behaviors, including greater exploratory behavior in a novel open field as revealed by significantly more time spent in the rearing position (+53\u201365%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and increased number of rears made (+33\u201344%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and greater novelty-seeking behavior in a hole-board apparatus revealed by an increase in total (+50\u201352%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and novel nose pokes (+45\u201348%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the HD rats, analysis of the mPFC using real-time quantitative PCR showed significantly greater mRNA levels of ENK (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not delta-opioid receptor (DOR), and this increase in ENK expression was found, using in situ hybridization, to occur specifically in the prelimbic (PrL) subregion of the mPFC. When injected into the PrL during the anticipation period, a MOR agonist but not DOR agonist significantly increased consumption of 20% ethanol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These findings support the role of ENK, acting through MOR within the PrL to promote the anticipation and excessive consumption of ethanol.",

     "publication date": "09-2012",
     "abstract": "Recent studies have identified synaptic proteins that undergo synapse-to-nucleus translocation in response to neuronal activity that modulate protein synthesis. One such translational regulatory protein of the postsynaptic density (PSD) is AIDA-1d, which binds to PSD-95 via its C-terminus. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces the cleavage of AIDA-1d, and the N-terminus is then shuttled to nuclear Cajal bodies where it plays a role in regulating global protein synthesis. Chronic ethanol exposure has been shown to increase the synaptic clustering of NMDA receptors and PSD-95. Here, we tested the hypothesis that AIDA-1d regulates chronic ethanol-induced increases in synaptic NMDA receptor expression. As reported, we found that AIDA-1 was highly enriched in dendritic spines and co-localized with PSD-95. Acute NMDA treatment increased AIDA-1 colocalization with p80 coilin, a marker of Cajal bodies. Chronic treatment (4 day) of cultures with ethanol (25\u2013100\u00a0mM) or with the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-V (50\u00a0\u03bcM) enhanced the clustering of AIDA-1 at synaptic sites. However, chronic ethanol treatment (50\u00a0mM) in the presence of the NMDA receptor agonist NMDA (2.5\u00a0\u03bcM) prevented this increase. Surprisingly, PSD-95 did not seem to play a role in the synaptic distribution of AIDA-1 as this distribution was not affected by declustering PSD-95 from synapses in response to inhibition of palmitoylation. We found that lentiviral knockdown of AIDA-1d did not affect protein expression levels of NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN1 C2\u2032, or GluN2B. The results of this study demonstrate that synaptic AIDA-1 expression is enhanced by chronic ethanol exposure that can be prevented by concurrent stimulation of NMDA receptors. In addition, we found that the association of AIDA-1 with PSD-95 is not required for its localization to the PSD. Moreover, we found that AIDA-1 does not regulate protein expression levels or alternative splicing of the GluN1 subunit of NMDA receptors.",

Motivated by the strong connectivity between this region of frontal cortex and the striatum and a growing body of data linking specific components of the mesocortical/limbic system to effects of ethanol and ethanol self-administration, the current study investigated the effects of moderate fetal ethanol exposure on the dendritic morphology of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in several regions of the striatum. Throughout gestation, pregnant rat dams either consumed a saccharin solution (control) or achieved average daily blood ethanol concentrations of 84\u00a0mg% via voluntary consumption of a 5% ethanol solution. The brains of adult male offspring were extracted and processed for Golgi-Cox staining. MSNs from the dorsomedial striatum, dorsolateral striatum and the nucleus accumbens core and shell were sampled for analysis. Relative to saccharin controls, robust reductions in dendritic length and branching, but not spine density, were observed in the shell of the nucleus accumbens in fetal-ethanol-exposed rats. No significant prenatal ethanol effects were found in the other regions of the striatum. These findings suggest that exposure to moderate levels of ethanol in utero can have profound effects on brain regions related to reward processing and provide possible clues relevant to understanding increased self-administration of drugs of abuse in animals exposed to ethanol during brain development.",

Little is known about the basis of \u2018this effect of prenatal ethanol on the sensitivity to ethanol\u2019s reinforcing effects. One possibility is that prenatal ethanol exposure makes subjects more sensitive to the appetitive effects of ethanol or less sensitive to ethanol\u2019s aversive consequences. The present study assessed ethanol-induced second-order conditioned place preference (CPP) and aversion and ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in infant rats prenatally exposed to ethanol (2.0\u00a0g/kg) or vehicle (water) or left untreated. The involvement of the \u03ba opioid receptor system in ethanol-induced CTA was also explored. When place conditioning occurred during the ascending limb of the blood\u2013ethanol curve (Experiment 1), the pups exposed to ethanol in utero exhibited greater CPP than untreated controls, with a shift to the right of the dose\u2013response curve. Conditioning during a later phase of intoxication (30\u201345\u00a0min post-administration; Experiment 2)\u00a0resulted in place aversion in control pups exposed to vehicle during late gestation but not in pups that were exposed to ethanol in utero. Ethanol induced a reliable and similar CTA (Experiment 3) in the pups treated with vehicle or ethanol during gestation, and CTA was insensitive to \u03ba antagonism. These results suggest that brief exposure to a moderate ethanol dose during late gestation promotes ethanol-mediated reinforcement and alters the expression of conditioned aversion by ethanol. This shift in the motivational reactivity to ethanol may be an underlying basis of the effect of prenatal ethanol on later ethanol acceptance.",

     "abstract": "Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are often associated with structural and functional hippocampal abnormalities, leading to long-lasting learning and memory deficits. The mechanisms underlying these abnormalities are not fully understood. Here, we investigated whether ethanol exposure during the 3rd trimester-equivalent period alters spontaneous network activity that is involved in neuronal circuit development in the CA3 hippocampal region. This activity is driven by GABAA receptors, which can have excitatory actions in developing neurons as a consequence of greater expression of the Cl\u2212 importer, NKCC1, with respect to expression of the Cl\u2212 exporter, KCC2, resulting in high [Cl\u2212]i. Rat pups were exposed to ethanol vapor from postnatal day (P) 2\u201316 (4\u00a0h/day). Weight gain was significantly reduced in pups exposed to ethanol compared to control at P15 and 16. Brain slices were prepared immediately after the end of the 4-h exposure on P4-16 and experiments were also performed under ethanol-free conditions at the end of the exposure paradigm (P17-22). Ethanol exposure did not significantly affect expression of KCC2 or NKCC1, nor did it affect network activity in the CA3 hippocampal region. Ethanol exposure significantly decreased the frequency (at P9-11) and increased the amplitude (at P5-8 and P17-21) of GABAA receptor-mediated miniature postsynaptic currents.

To investigate the long-term effects of P7 ethanol treatment on adult brain, mice received either two doses of saline or ethanol on P7 (2.5\u00a0g/kg, s.c., 2\u00a0h apart) and were assessed as adults (P82) for brain volume (using postmortem MRI) and cellular architecture (using immunohistochemistry). Adult mice that received P7 ethanol had reduced MRI total brain volume (4%) with multiple brain regions being reduced in both males and females. Immunohistochemistry indicated reduced frontal cortical parvalbumin immunoreactive (PV\u00a0+\u00a0IR) interneurons (18\u201333%) and reduced Cux1+IR layer II pyramidal neurons (15%) in both sexes. Interestingly, markers of adult hippocampal neurogenesis differed between sexes, with only ethanol treated males showing increased doublecortin and Ki67 expression (52 and 57% respectively) in the dentate gyrus, consistent with increased neurogenesis compared to controls. These findings suggest that P7 ethanol treatment causes persistent reductions in adult brain volume and frontal cortical neurons in both males and females. Increased adult neurogenesis in males, but not females, is consistent with differential adaptive responses to P7 ethanol toxicity between the sexes. One day of ethanol exposure, e.g. P7, causes persistent adult brain dysmorphology.",

Despite a large body of evidence documenting the associations between alcohol and injuries, data from Asian countries including South Korea are sparse. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between episodic heavy past-year drinking, problem drinking symptomatic of alcohol dependence and alcohol-related and intentional injuries. Data from 1989 injured patients recruited for the WHO/NIAAA Collaborative Study on Alcohol and Injury in South Korea were analyzed with respect to the prevalence rates and associations between injuries and frequency of past-year episodic heavy drinking and problem drinking. In estimating the odds ratios (ORs) and the associated 95% confidence intervals between alcohol intake and injuries multivariable logistic models were employed to adjust for sociodemographic characteristics and selected drinking variables. All analyses were conducted using the SAS 9.2 software. Findings of this study were consistent with prior studies that the risk of alcohol-related or intentional injury was positively associated with the frequency of episodic heavy drinking. The magnitudes of the associations were larger with frequent consumption of 5+ drinks (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.0 approximately) than with frequent consumption of 12+ drinks (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.1). Strong associations were also noted between RAPS4-assessed alcohol dependence and alcohol-related and intentional injuries. Further, the prevalence of intentional injury and its association with alcohol increased sharply once the acute alcohol intake exceeded 90\u00a0ml. Our results were consistent with prior studies that episodic heavy consumption, acute intoxication and problem drinking are pervasive among emergency room patients. Results of our study also lent support for administering a single-item screener querying consumption of 5+ drinks at a sitting in the past 12 months as a triage tool in Korea.",

In 56 patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis we found that IL-8, IL-4, Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), malondialdehyde and C-reactive protein remained higher in patients than in 18 age- and sex-matched controls at admission, at the 7th day and at the 15th day after admission.

However, other mechanisms, particularly ethanol-induced increase in blood vessel density, may also be involved. Our goal was to understand the relationship between ethanol consumption, new blood vessel formation in\u00a0vivo and protection from injury due to ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion. Using paired ethanol fed and control rats, we assessed capillary density in the heart, brain and skeletal muscle by immunostaining and quantified expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. Numbers of vessels were significantly increased in the brain, heart and skeletal muscle of animals fed ethanol-rich diets. VEGF (and its receptors) were upregulated in these organs. These effects were very rapid: highly significantly increased vascularization was seen within 2 weeks of commencing alcohol feeding. A neutralizing VEGF antibody, bevacizumab, inhibited new blood vessel formation induced by moderate doses of ethanol. Ethanol consumption increased vascularization and promoted skeletal muscle regeneration following hindlimb ischemia; these effects were prevented by bevacizumab. Finally, ethanol consumption protected myocardium following experimental ischemia/reperfusion. Conclusion: Experimental ethanol ingestion rapidly increases VEGF production, significantly increasing the capillary bed in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. Moreover, the ethanol-induced increase of blood vessel density is protective against ischemic events (i.e., hindlimb ischemia and myocardium ischemia/reperfusion) and promotes skeletal muscle regeneration.",

Recent evidence suggests that GS39783, a GABAB positive allosteric modulator, may be effective at reducing both the rewarding and reinforcing effects of several drugs of abuse, including ethanol. The goal of this study was to determine if GS39783 was capable of altering acute ethanol-induced stimulation, and the induction and expression of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization, without effecting basal locomotion levels. Several doses of GS39783 (ranging from 0 to 100\u00a0mg/kg, depending on experiment) were tested on adult male DBA/2J mice in four experiments using 3-day basal locomotion and acute ethanol stimulation paradigms, and 14-day induction and expression of ethanol sensitization paradigms. The results of experiment 1 are in agreement with current literature, suggesting that 30\u00a0mg/kg doses of GS39783 and lower do not alter basal locomotor activity. In experiment 2, we found that GS39783 significantly decreased acute ethanol stimulation, but only at the 30\u00a0mg/kg dose, supporting our hypothesis and other publications suggesting that GABAB receptors modulate acute ethanol stimulation. Contrary to our hypothesis, GS39783 did not alter the expression of locomotor sensitization. Additionally, repeated administration of GS39783 in conjunction with ethanol unexpectedly potentiated ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization. Further study of GS39783 is warranted as it may be a more tolerable treatment for alcoholism than full agonists, due to its behavioral efficacy at doses that lack sedative side effects. Our results add to current literature suggesting that the GABAB receptor system is indeed involved in the modulation of ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation and sensitization.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol and nicotine are often co-used and data from human and animals studies have demonstrated that common genes underlie responses to these two drugs. Recently, the genes that code for the subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been implicated as a common genetic mediator for alcohol and nicotine responses. The mammalian genes that code for the \u03b16 and \u03b23 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Chrna6 and Chrnb3, respectively) are located adjacent to each other on human and mouse chromosome 8. These subunits have gained attention as potential regulators of drug behaviors because of their expression in the striatum where they have been shown to modulate dopamine release. Human genetic studies have shown that variation in these genes is associated with alcohol phenotypes. In the current experiments, mice lacking the Chrna6 or Chrnb3 gene were tested for three ethanol behaviors: choice ethanol consumption, ataxia, and sedation. Wildtype (WT), heterozygous (HET), and knockout (KO) mice of each strain went through a standard 2-bottle choice drinking paradigm, the balance beam, and the Loss of Righting Reflex (LORR) paradigm. No genotypic effects on any of the 3 behavioral tasks were observed in Chrnb3 animals. While the Chrna6 gene did not significantly influence ethanol consumption (g/kg) or ataxia, mice lacking the \u03b16 subunit took significantly longer to recover their righting reflex than WT animals. These data provide evidence that receptors containing this subunit modulate the sedative effects of ethanol. Further work examining other models of ethanol consumption and behavioral responses to ethanol is needed to fully characterize the role of these receptor subunits in modulating ethanol responses.",

Evaluation of motor performance and brain cortex mitochondrial function during alcohol hangover was performed in mice 6\u00a0hours after a high ethanol dose (hangover onset). Animals were injected i.p. either with saline (control group) or with ethanol (3.8\u00a0g/kg BW) (hangover group). Ethanol hangover group showed a bad motor performance compared with control animals (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Oxygen uptake in brain cortex mitochondria from hangover animals showed a 34% decrease in the respiratory control rate as compared with the control group. Mitochondrial complex activities were decreased being the complex I\u2013III the less affected by the hangover condition; complex II\u2013III was markedly decreased by ethanol hangover showing 50% less activity than controls. Complex IV was 42% decreased as compared with control animals. Hydrogen peroxide production was 51% increased in brain cortex mitochondria from the hangover group, as compared with the control animals. Quantification of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential indicated that ethanol injected animals presented 17% less ability to maintain the polarized condition as compared with controls. These results indicate that a clear decrease in proton motive force occurs in brain cortex mitochondria during hangover conditions. We can conclude that a decreased motor performance observed in the hangover group of animals could be associated with brain cortex mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting impairment of its energetic metabolism.",

The purpose of the present work was to study the influence of chronic ethanol intake, a well known neurotoxic compound, on APA and ASAP activity under resting and K+-stimulated conditions at the synapse level. APA and ASAP activity were determined against glutamate- and aspartate-\u03b2-naphthylamide respectively in mouse frontal cortex synaptosomes and in their incubation supernatant in a Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The neurotoxic effects were analyzed by determining free radical generation, peroxidation of membrane lipids and the oxidation of synaptosomal proteins. In addition, the bioenergetic behavior of synaptosomes was analyzed under different experimental protocols. We obtained several modifications in oxidative stress parameters and a preferential inhibitor effect of chronic ethanol intake on APA and ASAP activities. Although previous in\u00a0vitro studies failed to show signs of neurodegeneration, these in\u00a0vivo modifications in oxidative stress parameters do not seem to be related to changes in APA and ASAP, invalidating the idea that an excess of free acidic amino acids released by APA and ASAP induces neurodegeneration.",

This study examined the effects of l-cysteine pre-treatment during the acquisition and maintenance phases of ACD (0.2%) self-administration as well as on the deprivation effect after ACD extinction and on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. In a separate PR schedule of reinforcement, the effect of l-cysteine was assessed on the break-point produced by ethanol (10%). Furthermore, we tested the effect of l-cysteine on saccharin (0.2%) reinforcement. Wistar rats were trained to self-administer ACD by nose poking on a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule in 30-min daily sessions. Responses on an active nose-poke caused delivery of ACD solution, whereas responses on an inactive nose-poke had no consequences. l-cysteine reduced the acquisition (40\u00a0mg/kg), the maintenance and the deprivation effect (100\u00a0mg/kg) of ACD self-administration. Furthermore, at the same dose, l-cysteine (120\u00a0mg/kg) decreased both ACD and ethanol break point. In addition, l-cysteine was unable to suppress the different responses for saccharin, suggesting that its effect did not relate to an unspecific decrease in a general motivational state. Compared to saline, l-cysteine did not modify responses on inactive nose-pokes, suggesting an absence of a non-specific behavioural activation.

Alcoholics in treatment claim that life stressors are the leading cause of continued drinking or relapse. However, few studies have investigated the interactive effects of stress and alcohol on cognitive behavior. The effects of restraint stress, alcohol, and stress in combination with alcohol were examined on a spatial memory test, the object placement (OP) task. In addition, intake levels were measured to determine if stress altered general consumption of alcohol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of four conditions: no alcohol/no stress control (CON), stress alone (STR), alcohol alone (ALC), and STR\u00a0+\u00a0alcohol (STR\u00a0+\u00a0ALC). Following each restraint stress bout, the STR\u00a0+\u00a0ALC and the ALC groups were given access to 8% alcohol for 1\u00a0h using the two-bottle choice limited access paradigm. As predicted, the STR\u00a0+\u00a0ALC group significantly increased alcohol consumption, while the ALC group had consistent drinking over the 10-day treatment. On the OP task, STR and ALC groups performed at chance levels, whereas the CON and STR\u00a0+\u00a0ALC groups significantly discriminated between objects in the new and old locations.

In this mini-review, we discuss new evidence that chronic alcohol-associated plasticity critically involves KCa2 channels in hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, and nucleus accumbens. KCa2 channel activity can modulate the magnitude of excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons induced by acute alcohol exposure. Emerging evidence indicates that KCa2 channels regulate neuroadaptations to chronic alcohol that contribute to withdrawal hyperexcitability and escalation of voluntary alcohol consumption. Restoring KCa2 channel activity can attenuate the severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in vivo and withdrawal-associated neurotoxicity in vitro. Pharmacological modulation of KCa2 channels can bi-directionally influence drinking behavior in rat and mouse models of voluntary alcohol consumption. Collectively, these studies using various rodent models have clearly indicated a central role for KCa2 channels in the neuroplasticity of chronic alcohol exposure. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that KCa2 channels are a novel therapeutic target to alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and reduce high amounts of alcohol drinking.",

This brain region has long been attributed an important role in aversive (e.g., fear) conditioning, as well as the negative emotional states that define alcohol dependence and withdrawal. The CeA is the major output region of the amygdala and receives complex inputs from other amygdaloid nuclei as well as regions that integrate sensory information from the external environment (e.g., thalamus, cortex). The CeA is functionally and anatomically divided into lateral and medial subdivisions that themselves are interconnected and populated by inhibitory interneurons and projections neurons. Neuropeptides are highly expressed in the CeA, particularly in the lateral subdivision, and the role of many of these peptides in regulating anxiety- and alcohol-related behaviors has been localized to the CeA. This review focuses on two of these peptides, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and neuropeptide Y (NPY), that exhibit a high degree of neuroanatomical overlap (e.g., in CeA) and largely opposite behavioral profiles (e.g., in regulating anxiety- and alcohol-related behavior). CRF and NPY systems in the CeA appear to be recruited and/or up-regulated during the transition to alcohol dependence. These and other neuropeptides may converge on GABA synapses in CeA to control projection neurons and downstream effector regions, thereby translating negative affective states into anxiety-like behavior and excessive alcohol consumption.",

Collectively, the information presented within this review provides a framework to assess the negative reinforcing effects of alcohol in a manner that distinguishes neuroadaptations produced by chronic alcohol exposure from the actual plasticity that is associated with negative reinforcement learning in dependent organisms.",

     "abstract": "It is widely accepted that stress, anxiety, depression and alcohol abuse-related disorders are in large part controlled by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors. However, evidence is accumulating that some of the actions on these receptors are mediated not by CRF, but by a family of related Urocortin (Ucn) peptides Ucn1, Ucn2 and Ucn3. The initial narrow focus on CRF as the potential main player acting on CRF receptors appears outdated. Instead it is suggested that CRF and the individual Ucns act in a complementary and brain region-specific fashion to regulate anxiety-related behaviors and alcohol consumption. This review, based on a symposium held in 2011 at the research meeting on \u201cAlcoholism and Stress\u201d in Volterra, Italy, highlights recent evidence for regulation of these behaviors by Ucns. In studies on stress and anxiety, the roles of Ucns, and in particular Ucn1, appear more visible in experiments analyzing adaptation to stressors rather than testing basal anxiety states. Based on these studies, we propose that the contribution of Ucn1 to regulating mood follows a U-like pattern with both high and low activity of Ucn1 contributing to high anxiety states. In studies on alcohol use disorders, the CRF system appears to regulate not only dependence-induced drinking, but also binge drinking and even basal consumption of alcohol. While dependence-induced and binge drinking rely on the actions of CRF on CRFR1 receptors, alcohol consumption in models of these behaviors is inhibited by actions of Ucns on CRFR2. In contrast, alcohol preference is positively influenced by actions of Ucn1, which is capable of acting on both CRFR1 and CRFR2. Because of complex distribution of Ucns in the nervous system, advances in this field will critically depend on development of new tools allowing site-specific analyses of the roles of Ucns and CRF.",

Walker. The primary goal of the symposium was to evaluate and disseminate contemporary findings regarding the emerging role of kappa-opioid receptors (KORs) and their endogenous ligands dynorphins (DYNs) in the regulation of escalated alcohol consumption, negative affect and cognitive dysfunction associated with alcohol dependence, as well as DYN/KOR mediation of the effects of chronic stress on alcohol reward and seeking behaviors. Dr. Glenn Valdez described a role for KORs in the anxiogenic effects of alcohol withdrawal. Dr. Jay McLaughlin focused on the role of KORs in repeated stress-induced potentiation of alcohol reward and increased alcohol consumption. Dr. Brendan Walker presented data characterizing the effects of KOR antagonism within the extended amygdala on withdrawal-induced escalation of alcohol self-administration in dependent animals. Dr. Georgy Bakalkin concluded with data indicative of altered DYNs and KORs in the prefrontal cortex of alcohol dependent humans that could underlie diminished cognitive performance. Collectively, the data presented within this symposium identified the multifaceted contribution of KORs to the characteristics of acute and chronic alcohol-induced behavioral dysregulation and provided a foundation for the development of pharmacotherapeutic strategies to treat certain aspects of alcohol use disorders.",

     "abstract": "Early childhood stress is a risk factor for the development of substance-abuse disorders. A nonhuman primate model of early life stress, social impoverishment through nursery-rearing rather than mother-rearing, has been shown to produce increased impulsive and anxiety-like behaviors, cognitive and motor deficits, and increased alcohol consumption. These behavioral changes have been linked to changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a serotonin (5-HT) metabolite. The effects of different rearing conditions on ethanol drinking and three measures of 5-HT function in the central nervous system were evaluated, including CSF 5-HIAA levels and tissue levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in brain samples. Brain samples were taken from the dorsal caudate, putamen, substantia nigra (SN) pars reticulata, SN pars compacta and hippocampus. There was a clear effect of rearing condition on the 5-HT system. Overall 5-HIAA and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio measures of 5-HT turnover were significantly lower in nursery reared compared to mother-reared animals. In addition, there was a strong within-subject correlation between CSF and brain tissue 5-HIAA levels. Ethanol drinking was greater in nursery reared monkeys, consistent with previous results. These findings show that CSF 5-HIAA measurements can be used to predict brain 5-HT activity that may be involved in behavioral outcomes such as anxiety and alcohol consumption. Thus, CSF sampling may provide a minimally invasive test for neurochemical risk factors related to alcohol abuse.",

Alcohol is well-characterized to influence central glutamatergic transmission, including AMPA receptor function. Herein, we examined the influence of injected and ingested alcohol upon Narp protein expression, as well as basal Narp expression in mouse lines selectively bred for high blood alcohol concentrations under limited access conditions. Alcohol up-regulated accumbens Narp levels, concomitant with increases in levels of the GluR1 AMPA receptor subunit. However, accumbens Narp or GluR1 levels did not vary as a function of selectively bred genotype. We next employed a Narp knock-out (KO) strategy to begin to understand the behavioral relevance of alcohol-induced changes in protein expression in several assays of alcohol reward. Compared to wild-type mice, Narp KO animals: fail to escalate daily intake of high alcohol concentrations under free-access conditions; shift their preference away from high alcohol concentrations with repeated alcohol experience; exhibit a conditioned place-aversion in response to the repeated pairing of 3\u00a0g/kg alcohol with a distinct environment and fail to exhibit alcohol-induced locomotor hyperactivity following repeated alcohol treatment. Narp deletion did not influence the daily intake of either food or water, nor did it alter any aspect of spontaneous or alcohol-induced motor activity, including the development of tolerance to its motor-impairing effects with repeated treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that Narp induction, and presumably subsequent aggregation of AMPA receptors, may be important for neuroplasticity within limbic subcircuits mediating or maintaining the rewarding properties of alcohol.",

     "abstract": "NMDA receptors become a major contributor to acute ethanol intoxication effects at high concentrations as ethanol binds to a unique site on the receptor and inhibits glutamatergic activity in multiple brain areas. Although a convincing body of literature exists on the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to mimic and worsen cellular and behavioral ethanol effects, receptor agonists have been less well-studied. In addition to a primary agonist site for glutamate, the NMDA receptor contains a separate co-agonist site that responds to endogenous amino acids glycine and d-serine. d-serine is both selective for this co-agonist site and potent in boosting NMDA dependent activity even after systemic administration. In this study, we hypothesized that exogenous d-serine might ameliorate some acute ethanol behaviors by opposing NMDA receptor inhibition. We injected adult male C57 mice with a high concentration of d-serine at various time windows relative to ethanol administration and monitored sedation, motor coordination and voluntary ethanol drinking. d-serine (2.7\u00a0g/kg, ip) prolonged latency to a loss of righting reflex (LoRR) and shortened LoRR duration when given 15\u00a0min before ethanol (3\u00a0g/kg) but not when it was injected with or shortly after ethanol. Blood samples taken at sedative recovery and at fixed time intervals revealed no effect of d-serine on ethanol concentration but an ethanol-induced decrease in l-serine and glycine content was prevented by acute d-serine pre-administration. d-serine had no effect on ethanol-induced (2\u00a0g/kg) rotarod deficits in young adult animals but independently and interactively degraded motor performance in a subset of older mice. Finally, a week-long series of daily ip injections resulted in a 50% decrease in free choice ethanol preference for d-serine treated animals compared to saline-injected controls in a two-bottle choice experiment.",

     "abstract": "Over the past fifty years a significant body of evidence has been compiled suggesting an interaction between the endocannabinoid (EC) system and alcohol dependence. However, much of this work has been conducted only in the past two decades following the elucidation of the molecular constituents of the EC system that began with the serendipitous discovery of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1). Since then, novel pharmacological and genetic tools have enabled researchers to manipulate select components of the EC system, to determine their contribution to the motivation to consume ethanol. From these preclinical studies, it is evident that CB1 contributes the motivational and reinforcing properties of ethanol, and chronic consumption of ethanol alters EC transmitter levels and CB1 expression in brain nuclei associated with addiction pathways. These results are augmented by in\u00a0vitro and ex\u00a0vivo studies showing that acute and chronic treatment with ethanol produces physiologically relevant alterations in\u00a0the function of the EC system. This report provides a current and comprehensive review of the literature regarding the interactions between ethanol and the EC system. We begin be reviewing the studies published prior to the discovery of the EC system that compared the behavioral and physiological\u00a0effects of cannabinoids with ethanol in addition to cross-tolerance between these drugs. Next, a brief overview of the molecular constituents of the EC system is provided as context for the subsequent\u00a0review\u00a0of more recent studies examining the interaction of ethanol with the EC system.

The posterior ventral tegmental area (pVTA) appears to support the reinforcing and dopamine-stimulating effects of both drugs. The current study tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure of the pVTA to one drug would increase the sensitivity of local dopamine neurons to the stimulating effects of the other drug. Female Wistar rats received repeated daily microinjections of either 100\u00a0\u03bcM nicotine or vehicle directly into the pVTA for 7 days. On the 8th day, rats received microinjections of either vehicle or ethanol (100 or 200\u00a0mg%) into the pVTA while extracellular dopamine samples were collected from the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens shell (NACsh) with microdialysis. Another experiment tested the effects of challenge microinjections of 200\u00a0\u03bcM nicotine in the pVTA on extracellular dopamine levels in the NACsh following 7 daily pretreatments with 200\u00a0mg% ethanol in the pVTA. Nicotine pretreatments increased the dopamine-stimulating effects of ethanol in the pVTA (100\u00a0mg% ethanol: 115% vs 160% of baseline in the vehicle and nicotine groups, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 200\u00a0mg% ethanol: 145% vs 190% of baseline in the vehicle and nicotine groups, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In contrast, ethanol pretreatments did not alter the stimulating effects of nicotine in the pVTA.

     "abstract": "Pairing a conditioned stimulus (CS) with ethanol generally produces aversion for that CS in adult rodents. However, infant rats (PD1-PD3) exposed to ethanol demonstrate appetitive reinforcement to ethanol (Nizhnikov, Varlinskaya, Petrov, & Spear, 2006; Petrov, Varlinskaya, & Spear, 2003). This sensitivity to the appetitive properties of ethanol during infancy may be transient, as during the second postnatal week rat pups tend to exhibit conditioned aversions to flavors paired with ethanol. The present study examined changes in the motivation properties of ethanol through ontogeny and the neurobiology underlying these changes. Rat pups were exposed to a taste conditioning procedure on PD4 or PD12. Rat pups were intraorally infused with 2.5% of their body weight of saccharin solution (0.1%) and immediately after injected intraperitoneolly (i.p.) with one of six doses of ethanol (0.0\u20132.0\u00a0g/kg). A day later pups were given saccharine infusions and percent body weight gain was used as an index of ethanol's reinforcing effects. PD4 pups expressed appetitive reinforcement to ethanol, as indicated by greater saccharin intake, as compared to control counterparts and to the older PD12 pups. Subsequent experiments revealed that PD4 pups were less sensitive to the aversive properties of the drug than PD12 pups. The older pups found high doses of ethanol aversive while PD4 rat pups did not condition aversions to this dose of ethanol after a single trial. A similar pattern of results was observed between the low doses of ethanol and the highest doses of a kappa opioid agonist. The PD12 animals did not condition to the kappa opioid agonist, while the younger rats expressed an appetitive response. These results illustrate an ontogenetic change in the motivational properties of ethanol, with sensitivity to its appetitive properties declining and responsiveness to the aversive properties increasing with age during early infancy.",

This ethanol effect can be modulated by pharmacological treatments that also can attenuate the development of ethanol-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. By the end of the preweanling period the mechanisms underlying sensitization induced by psychostimulants are functional. The aim of the present study was to analyze the locomotor response to ethanol in preweanling rats as a function of repeated exposure to the drug under two different social conditions. Subjects were treated with ethanol between postnatal days 15 and 18 after being isolated for four hours (Experiment 1a) or simply residing in their home-cage (Experiment 1b). After two days of withdrawal locomotor response to ethanol was assessed in both social conditions. In Experiment 2 na\u00efve rats were tested in terms of ethanol-induced activation of the locomotor response in both social conditions. Results from the present study showed no evidence of locomotor sensitization in preweanling rats in any of the social conditions. Instead we observed behavioral tolerance to the stimulating effect of ethanol in animals trained in the home-cage condition, in which subjects trained with ethanol showed sedation in response to ethanol at testing. Overall these results contribute to the understanding of the sensitivity of rats to the acute and chronic locomotor response to ethanol in an ontogenetic period characterized by high sensitivity to ethanol.",

     "abstract": "Although the effects of alcohol on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) have been extensively studied in rodents, BDNF levels have rarely been measured in abstinent, alcohol-dependent (AD) individuals. Interpretation of reported group comparisons of serum BDNF levels is difficult due to limited information regarding analytical variance, biological variability, and the relative contribution of platelet and plasma pools to serum BDNF. Analytical variance (intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation) of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was characterized. Within- and between-subject variability, and group differences in serum and plasma BDNF, was assessed on three separate days in 16, 4-week abstinent AD individuals (7M/9F) and 16 social drinkers (SDs; 8M/8F). Significantly higher mean (\u00b1sd) serum BDNF levels were observed for the AD group compared to the SD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). No significant difference in mean baseline plasma BDNF levels was observed between AD and SD groups. The low analytical variance, high day-to-day within-individual stability and the high degree of individuality demonstrates the potential clinical utility of measuring serum BDNF levels. The low correlations that we observed between plasma and serum levels are congruent with their representing separate pools of BDNF. The observation of higher basal serum BDNF in the AD group without a concomitant elevation in plasma BDNF levels indicates that the elevated serum BDNF in AD patients is not due to greater BDNF exposure. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate mechanisms underlying this alteration and determine the utility of serum BDNF as a predictor or surrogate marker of chronic alcohol abuse.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is one potential risk factor for spontaneous abortion (SAb). Prior research suggested that heavy drinking during pregnancy was associated with significantly increased rates of SAb, but results for lower levels of drinking have been inconsistent. We examined the association between different levels and patterns of prenatal alcohol consumption and SAb in a high-risk inner-city sample. We hypothesized that higher levels, binge patterns, and more frequent drinking would be associated with increased rates of SAb. The quantity and frequency of self-reported peri-conceptional and repeated in-pregnancy maternal drinking volumes per beverage type were assessed with semi-structured interviews in a prospective subsample of 302 African-American mothers. Relations between various measures of prenatal alcohol exposure and SAb were assessed using logistic regression. After controlling for various potential confounders, there was a significant positive relation between average absolute alcohol use per day across pregnancy and SAb. Greater frequency of drinking episodes also predicted SAb: an average of even one day of drinking per week across pregnancy was associated with an increase in the incidence of SAb. However, contrary to our hypothesis, neither the amount of alcohol drunk per drinking day nor a measure of binge drinking was significantly related to SAb after controlling for confounders. Differences in when women who drank at risk levels initiated antenatal care may have under-estimated the impact of alcohol on SAb in this low-SES urban African-American sample. Some drinking measures averaged across pregnancy may have under-estimated consumption and overestimated risk of SAb, but other risk drinking measures that avoid this limitation show similar relations to SAb. Identifying fetal risk drinking in pregnant women is critical to increasing the effectiveness of interventions that reduce risk level alcohol consumption and protect from pregnancy loss.",

The purpose of this study was to assess whether women would willingly partake in a screening program of this nature. This was determined by launching a pilot screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure in a high-risk obstetric unit previously shown to have a high prevalence of FAEE-positive meconium via anonymous meconium testing. The program involved voluntary testing of meconium for FAEEs and long-term developmental follow-up of positive cases through an existing public health program. The participation rate in the screening program was significantly lower than when testing was conducted anonymously (78% vs. 95%, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and the positivity rate was 3% in contrast to 30% observed under anonymous conditions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These low rates suggest that the majority of mothers who consumed alcohol in pregnancy refused to participate. We conclude that despite the potential benefits of such screening programs, maternal unwillingness to consent, likely due to fear, embarrassment, and guilt, may limit the effectiveness of meconium testing for population-based open screening, highlighting the need for public education and social marketing efforts for such programs to be of benefit.",

The primary aim of this study is to determine whether, in a population where binge drinking is common but total alcohol consumption across pregnancy is low, prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with effects on prenatal growth, visual acuity and cognitive development during infancy. The second aim is to determine which of several indicators of alcohol consumption best predicts pre- and postnatal outcomes. Data were collected from 216 Inuit women and their infants living in Nunavik, the northern region of Qu\u00e9bec. Maternal interviews were conducted during mid-pregnancy and at 1 and 6 months postpartum. Birth weight, length, and head circumference were assessed at delivery. Visual acuity and cognitive development were assessed at 6 months of age. In this population in which infrequent heavy episodic drinking is common, even occasional binge exposure was associated with reduced prenatal growth and poorer visual acuity at 6 months of age. A simple dichotomous measure of binge drinking during pregnancy provided the best predictor of fetal growth and 6-month acuity. The population studied here is unusual in terms of its pattern of binge alcohol consumption.

     "abstract": "The Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study sought to answer questions about the benefits of combining behavioral and pharmacological interventions (naltrexone and acamprosate) in alcohol-dependent patients. Our goals were to identify trajectories of heavy drinking before randomization in COMBINE, to characterize patients in these trajectories, and to assess whether prerandomization trajectories predict drinking outcomes. We analyzed daily indicators of heavy drinking 90 days before randomization using a trajectory-based approach. Each patient was assigned to the most likely prerandomization heavy-drinking trajectory, and the baseline characteristics of participants in the baseline trajectories were compared. The main and interactive effects of these trajectories and treatment factors (acamprosate, naltrexone, or combined behavioral intervention) on summary drinking measures during active treatment (16 weeks) were assessed. We identified five trajectories of heavy drinking prerandomization: \u201cT1: frequent heavy drinkers\u201d; \u201cT2: very frequent heavy drinkers\u201d; \u201cT3: nearly daily heavy drinkers\u201d; \u201cT4: daily heavy drinkers\u201d; and \u201cT5: daily heavy drinkers stopping early\u201d before randomization. Trajectory membership was significantly associated with all drinking outcomes. Patients in \u201cT5: daily heavy drinkers stopping early\u201d had comparable drinking outcomes to those in \u201cT1: frequent heavy drinkers,\u201d whereas the remaining trajectories were associated with significantly worse outcomes. The baseline trajectory did not interact significantly with the treatment condition. These exploratory analyses confirmed the hypothesis that baseline trajectories predict postrandomization drinking outcomes. Interestingly, \u201cT5: daily heavy drinkers stopping early\u201d had outcomes that were comparable to the least severe baseline trajectory \u201cT1: frequent heavy drinkers,\u201d and baseline trajectories of heavy drinking did not moderate the treatment effects.",

     "abstract": "Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is an orthopedic protocol, which induces direct new bone formation as a result of the stimulating effects of mechanical distraction. Chronic ethanol exposure has been demonstrated to inhibit bone formation in rodent models of DO. Further, it has been demonstrated that (1) tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF) blockers are protective against ethanol exposure and (2) recombinant mouse TNF (rmTNF) inhibits direct bone formation in ethanol na\u00efve mice through TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1). These results suggest that the inhibitory effects are significantly mediated by TNF signaling. Therefore, we hypothesized that direct new bone formation in TNFR1 knockout (KO) mice would be protected from ethanol exposure. We used a unique model of mouse DO combined with liquid/chow diets to compare the effects of ethanol on both a strain of TNFR1 knockout (TNFR1 KO) mice and on mice of their C57BL/6 (B6) control strain. In the B6 study, and in concordance with previous work, both radiological and histological analyses of direct bone formation in the distraction gaps demonstrated significant osteoinhibition due to ethanol compared with chow- or pair-fed mice. In the TNFR1 KO study and in support of the hypothesis, both radiological and histological analyses of distraction gap bone formation demonstrated no significant differences between the ethanol, chow fed, or pair fed. We conclude that exogenous rmTNF and ethanol-induced endogenous TNF act to inhibit new bone formation during DO by signaling primarily through TNFR1.",

A total of 35,102 men aged 45 years and older were surveyed about their alcohol drinking as part of a cohort study. These respondents were followed up over time, and all deaths were recorded. Compared with those who never drank alcohol, alcohol drinkers had 1.22 times higher risk of mortality, with the highest risk observed for liver disease (hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a03.19). Among ever drinkers, risk of mortality varied according to types (country/desi), frequency (four or less times a week, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39), and quantity of alcohol consumed (>100\u00a0mL) per day. In addition, country/desi drinkers (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.34) had the highest mortality risk compared with all other types of alcohol (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.97). Alcohol drinkers had increased risk of mortality for tuberculosis (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.53), cerebrovascular disease (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.83), and liver disease (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.19).

The results of this study show a direct association between greater consumption of alcohol and increased risk of mortality from alcohol-specific causes.

Human data suggest that maximum blood EtG (BEtG) concentrations are reached between 3.5 and 5.5\u00a0h after ethanol administration. This study was undertaken to determine if the Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rat biotransforms ethanol to EtG after a single high oral dose of ethanol. SD rats (male, n\u00a0=\u00a06) were gavaged with a single ethanol dose (4\u00a0g/kg), and urine was collected for 3\u00a0h in metabolic cages, followed by euthanization and collection of heart blood.

Blood and urine were collected up to 24\u00a0h after administration for ethanol and EtG analysis. Maximum blood ethanol, urine ethanol, and UEtG were reached within 4\u00a0h, whereas maximum BEtG was reached 6\u00a0h after administration.

To restrict the sample to youth, respondents were excluded who were younger than 15 or older than 24 years. Over 17,000 respondents were assessed to determine whether they met criteria for depression, binge drinking, the comorbid condition, or neither condition (reference group). Binge drinking was defined as five drinks or more on an occasion. The 12-month prevalence rates for comorbid binge drinking and depression were 2.7% for male respondents and 2.1% for female respondents. When adjusted for demographic factors and when compared with the reference group, the risk of suicidality was increased for the depressed group (odds ratio [OR] 5.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.34\u20138.2) and the comorbid group (OR 6.28, 95% CI: 3.68\u201310.70), but not for the binge-drinking group. With the exception of increasing age, sociodemographic factors were not correlates of comorbidity. In conclusion, binge drinking was not associated with an increased risk of suicidality among Canadian youth living in the community, although depression and comorbidity were associated with suicidality.",

We assessed alterations in both astrocytic and neuronal viability, and alterations in N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function, in cocultures of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) and astrocytes after continuous ethanol exposure (CEE). Treatment of cells with 100 mM EtOH once every 24 h for 4 days resulted in a mean ethanol concentration of 57.3 \u00b1 2.1 mM. Comparisons between control and post\u2013ethanol-treated cells were made 4 days after the last ethanol treatment. CEE did not alter glial cell viability, as indicated by the absence of either changes in astrocytic morphology, actin depolymerization, or disruption of astrocytic intracellular mitochondrial distribution at any day postethanol treatment. The CGCs were healthy and viable after CEE, as indicated by phase-contrast microscopy and the trypan-blue exclusion method. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments indicated that NMDA-induced currents (INMDA) were altered by CEE treatment. Similar to previous results obtained during the withdrawal phase from chronic ethanol exposure, INMDA from CEE-treated cells were significantly larger than INMDA from NMDARs in control CGCs, but returned to control values by the fourth day post-CEE. However, after the last ethanol dosing and during a time when ethanol concentrations remained high, INMDA were significantly smaller than control values. Identical results were observed in CGCs expressing the NR2A or NR2B subunit. In summary, both neurons and astrocytes remained healthy following exposure to CEE with no signs of neurotoxicity at the cellular level, and modulation of NMDAR function is consistent with findings from prior experiments. Thus, we conclude that the CEE paradigm in glial\u2013neuronal cocultures readily lends itself to long-term in\u00a0vitro studies of ethanol effects that include glial\u2013neuronal interactions and the ability to study ethanol withdrawal-induced neurotoxicity.",

However, tests examining the effects of opioid antagonists on ethanol seeking and relapse behavior have been limited. The present study examined the effects of two opioid antagonists on ethanol maintenance, seeking, and relapse responding by alcohol-preferring (P) rats. Adult P rats were self-trained in two-lever operant chambers to self-administer 15% (vol/vol) ethanol on a fixed-ratio 5 (FR5) versus water on a FR1 concurrent schedule of reinforcement in daily 1-h sessions. After 10 weeks, rats underwent extinction training, followed by 2 weeks in their home cages. Rats were then returned to the operant chambers without ethanol or water to measure responses on the ethanol and water levers for four sessions. After a subsequent 2\u00a0weeks in the home cage, without access to ethanol, rats were returned to the operant chambers with ethanol and water available. Effects of antagonists on maintenance responding were tested after several weeks of daily 1-h sessions. Naltrexone (NAL; 1\u201310\u00a0mg/kg, subcutaneously [s.c.]; n\u00a0=\u00a08/dose), LY255582 (LY; 0.03\u20131\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.; n\u00a0=\u00a08/dose), or vehicle were injected 30\u00a0min before the first session (in the absence of ethanol), following 2 weeks in their home cages, and for four consecutive sessions of ethanol self-administration under maintenance and relapse conditions. Both NAL and LY reduced responses on the ethanol lever without any fluids present, and ethanol self-administration under relapse and on-going drinking conditions, with LY being more potent than NAL. Both NAL and LY were less effective in reducing responding in the absence of ethanol than in reducing ethanol self-administration. Overall, the results indicate that the opioid system is involved in mediating ethanol seeking, and ethanol self-administration under relapse and on-going alcohol drinking, but that different neurocircuits may underlie these behaviors.",

Despite no significant differences in baseline (home cage) CORT levels, CORT responses to ethanol were greater in females than in males and in adult females than in adolescent females; males, however, showed less marked age differences in CORT levels after ethanol consumption. Adolescent blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) were lower than those of adults, although these BEC differences appear insufficient to account for the ontogenetic differences in CORT levels.

The goal of this study was to systematically determine the functional expressions and cellular localization of ADHs and ALDHs in human rectal mucosa, the lesions of adenocarcinoma and hemorrhoid, and the genetic association of allelic variations of ADH and ALDH with large bowel disorders. Twenty-one surgical specimens of rectal adenocarcinoma and the adjacent normal mucosa, including 16 paired tissues of rectal tumor, normal mucosae of rectum and sigmoid colon from the same individuals, and 18 surgical mixed hemorrhoid specimens and leukocyte DNA samples from 103 colorectal cancer patients, 67 hemorrhoid patients, and 545 control subjects recruited in previous study, were investigated. The isozyme/allozyme expression patterns of ADH and ALDH were identified by isoelectric focusing and the activities were assayed spectrophotometrically. The protein contents of ADH/ALDH isozymes were determined by immunoblotting using the corresponding purified class-specific antibodies; the cellular activity and protein localizations were detected by immunohistochemistry and histochemistry, respectively. Genotypes of ADH1B, ADH1C, and ALDH2 were determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. At 33\u00a0mM ethanol, pH 7.5, the activity of ADH1C*1/1 phenotypes exhibited 87% higher than that of the ADH1C*1/*2 phenotypes in normal rectal mucosa. The activity of ALDH2-active phenotypes of rectal mucosa was 33% greater than ALDH2-inactive phenotypes at 200\u00a0\u03bcM acetaldehyde. The protein contents in normal rectal mucosa were in the following order: ADH1\u00a0>\u00a0ALDH2\u00a0>\u00a0ADH3\u00a0\u2248\u00a0ALDH1A1, whereas those of ADH2, ADH4, and ALDH3A1 were fairly low. Both activity and content of ADH1 were significantly decreased in rectal tumors, whereas the ALDH activity remained unchanged. The ADH activity was also significantly reduced in hemorrhoids. ADH4 and ALDH3A1 were uniquely expressed in the squamous epithelium of anus at anorectal junctions. The allele frequencies of ADH1C*1 and ALDH2*2 were significantly higher in colorectal cancer and that of ALDH2*2 also significantly greater in hemorrhoids. In conclusion, ADH and ALDH isozymes are differentially expressed in mucosal cells of rectum and anus.

     "abstract": "In addition to cigarette smoking, alcohol exposure is also associated with increased lung infections and decreased mucociliary clearance. However, little research has been conducted on the combination effects of alcohol and cigarette smoke on lungs. Previously, we have demonstrated in a mouse model that the combination of cigarette smoke and alcohol exposure results in the formation of a very stable hybrid malondialdehyde\u2013acetaldehyde (MAA)-adducted protein in the lung. In in\u00a0vitro studies, MAA-adducted protein stimulates bronchial epithelial cell interleukin-8 (IL-8) via the activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKC\u025b). We hypothesized that direct MAA-adducted protein exposure in the lungs would mimic such a combination of smoke and alcohol exposure leading to airway inflammation. To test this hypothesis, C57BL/6J female mice were intranasally instilled with either saline, 30\u00a0\u03bcL of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA)\u2013MAA, or unadducted BSA for up to 3 weeks. Likewise, human lung surfactant proteins A and D (SPA and SPD) were purified from human pulmonary proteinosis lung lavage fluid and successfully MAA-adducted in\u00a0vitro. Similar to BSA\u2013MAA, SPD\u2013MAA was instilled into mouse lungs. Lungs were necropsied and assayed for histopathology, PKC\u025b activation, and lung lavage chemokines. In control mice instilled with saline, normal lungs had few inflammatory cells. No significant effects were observed in unadducted BSA- or SPD-instilled mice. However, when mice were instilled with BSA\u2013MAA or SPD\u2013MAA for 3 weeks, a significant peribronchiolar localization of inflammatory cells was observed. Both BSA\u2013MAA and SPD\u2013MAA stimulated increased lung lavage neutrophils and caused a significant elevation in the chemokine, keratinocyte chemokine, which is a functional homologue to human IL-8. Likewise, MAA-adducted protein stimulated the activation of airway and lung slice PKC\u025b. These data support that the MAA-adducted protein induces a proinflammatory response in the lungs and that the lung surfactant protein is a biologically relevant target for malondialdehyde and acetaldehyde adduction. These data further implicate MAA-adduct formation as a potential mechanism for smoke- and alcohol-induced lung injury.",

     "abstract": "Regular and irregular abuse of alcohol are global health priorities associated with diseases at multiple sites, including cancer. Mechanisms of diseases induced by alcohol are closely related to its metabolism. Among conventional markers of alcohol abuse, the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of erythrocytes is prognostic of alcohol-related cancer and its predictivity increases when combined with functional polymorphisms of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1B [rs1229984] and ADH1C [rs698]) and the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2 [rs671]). Whether these genetic variants can influence abuse in alcohol drinking and MCV has never been examined in drunk-driving traffic offenders. We examined 149 drunk drivers, diagnosed as alcohol abusers according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) and enrolled in a probation program, and 257 social drinkers (controls), all Caucasian males. Alcohol intake was assessed according to self-reported drink-units/d and MCV unadjusted and adjusted for age, smoking, and body mass index. Multivariable models were used to compute MCV adjusted means. Genotype analyses were performed by PCR on DNA from blood. The adjusted MCV mean was higher in drunk-driving abusers than in controls (92 vs. 91\u00a0fL; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and increased with the number of drink-units/d in both abusers and controls (P-trend\u00a0=\u00a0.0316 and .0089) already at intermediate quantities (0\u20131 vs. 2\u20134 drink-units/d: P\u00a0=\u00a0.054 and .024). Carriers of the common ADH1B*1/*1 (rs1229984) genotype were more likely to be drunk-driving abusers (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008), reported higher drink-units/d (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0126), and had larger MCV (P\u00a0=\u00a0.035). The rs698 ADH1C and rs671 ALDH2 polymorphisms were not associated with MCV. ADH1B*1/*1 polymorphism is significantly associated with being a drunk-driving abuser, higher alcohol drinking, and MCV enlargement. This suggests that drunk drivers with augmented MCV modulated by the alcohol metabolic ADH1B*1/*1 genotype may be at higher risk of driving incapability and of alcohol-related cancer.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol-related falls are recognized as a major contributor to the occurrence of traumatic brain injury. The control of upright standing balance is complex and composes of contributions from several partly independent mechanisms such as appropriate information from multiple sensory systems and correct feedback and feed forward movement control. Analysis of multisegmented body movement offers a rarely used option for detecting the fine motor problems associated with alcohol intoxication. The study aims were to investigate whether (1) alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) affected the body movements under unperturbed and perturbed standing; and (2) alcohol affected the ability for sensorimotor adaptation. Body movements were recorded in 25 participants (13\u00a0women and 12 men, mean age 25.1 years) at five locations (ankle, knee, hip, shoulder, and head) during quiet standing and during balance perturbations from pseudorandom pulses of calf muscle vibration over 200\u00a0s with eyes closed or open. Tests were performed at 0.00, 0.06, and 0.10% BAC. The study revealed several significant findings: (1) an alcohol dose-specific effect; (2) a direction-specific stability decrease from alcohol intoxication; (3) a movement pattern change related to the level of alcohol intoxication during unperturbed standing and perturbed standing; (4) a sensorimotor adaptation deterioration with increased alcohol intoxication; and (5) that vision provided a weaker contribution to postural control during alcohol intoxication. Hence, alcohol intoxication at 0.06 and 0.10% BAC causes a complex multifaceted deterioration of human postural control.",

Ethanol reduced insulin secretion by interfering with muscarinic signaling and PKC activation but not the K-ATP channels. In addition, ethanol reduced insulin content and caused ER stress. The deleterious effects of ethanol on \u03b2-cells were prevented by 4-methyl pyrazole, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, suggesting that ethanol metabolism is required for these effects.",

The FASDSG membership includes clinical, basic, and social scientists who meet to discuss recent advances and issues in Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) research. The central theme of the meeting was \u201cGlia and Neurons: Teamwork in Pathology and Therapy.\u201d Alcohol disruption of neuron development and alcohol-induced neurodegeneration is central to the pathology and clinical expression of FASD. The active role of glia as perpetrator, victim, or bystander in neurotoxicology and neurodegenerative processes has emerged at the forefront of adult central nervous system (CNS) disorders and therapy. Glia\u2013 and neuron\u2013glial interactions hold the potential to elucidate causes and offer treatment of FASD as well. Growing evidence indicates that neurons and glia are direct targets of alcohol, but may also be vulnerable to molecules produced in peripheral systems as a result of alcohol exposure. Diagnostics and therapies can take advantage of these processes and biomarkers, and these may be applicable to CNS pathology in FASD. Two keynote speakers, Howard E. Gendelman, M.D., and Ernest M. Graham, M.D, addressed the role of glia and neuroinflammation in brain development and neurodegeneration. The invited speakers and FASDSG members discussed new paradigms in CNS development and discuss new strategies for understanding and treating neurodegenerative disease. Members of the FASDSG provided updates on new findings through presentation of breaking research in the FASt data sessions.

     "abstract": "An increasing number of studies use functional MRI (fMRI) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal to investigate the neurofunctional basis of acute alcohol effects on the brain. However, the BOLD signal reflects neural activity only indirectly as it depends on regional hemodynamic changes and is therefore sensitive to vasoactive substances, such as alcohol. We used MRI-based pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) method to quantify effects of acute intoxication on resting cerebral perfusion. Gender effects have not been previously examined and yet they are of particular interest given the differences in hormonal dynamics, alcohol metabolism, and hemodynamic regulation. Nineteen young, healthy individuals (nine women) with no personal or familial alcohol- or drug-related problems served as their own controls by participating in both alcohol (0.6\u00a0g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55\u00a0g/kg for women) and placebo scanning sessions in a counterbalanced manner. Regionally specific effects of the moderate alcohol dose on gray matter perfusion were examined with voxel-wise and region-of-interest analyses suggesting an interaction between gender and alcohol beverage. Acute intoxication increased perfusion in bilateral frontal regions in men but not in women. Under placebo, stronger cortical perfusion was observed in women compared with men primarily in the left hemisphere in frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These results emphasize gender differences and regional specificity of alcohol\u2019s effects of cerebral perfusion possibly because of interactive influences on hormonal, metabolic, and hemodynamic autoregulatory systems. Alcohol-induced perfusion increase correlated positively with impulsivity/antisocial tendencies, consistent with dopaminergic mediation of reward, and its effects on cortical perfusion. Additional ASL studies are needed to investigate dose- and time-dependent effects of alcohol intoxication and gender on the hemodynamic factors that conjointly influence BOLD signal to disambiguate the vascular/metabolic mechanisms from the neurally based changes.",

     "abstract": "The swim-test susceptible (SUS) line of rats has been bred in our laboratory for the characteristic of reduced motor activity in the swim test following exposure to an acute stressor. Testing of multiple generations of SUS rats has also revealed that they consume large amounts of ethanol voluntarily. As reported for lines of rats that show a propensity for high-ethanol intake, the SUS rats show evidence of low serotonergic function. Because serotonergic function has often been shown to be involved in the regulation of alcohol consumption, here we examined the effects of manipulations of serotonin transmission on intake of ethanol by SUS rats. Fenfluramine, a serotonin-releasing drug, was injected at various doses (0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0\u00a0mg/kg) twice per day and ethanol intake was measured using a two-bottle free-choice method. The 8-OH-DPAT, a 5\u2011HT1A agonist, was injected at various doses (0.03125, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0\u00a0mg/kg) before a 1-h session of exposure to ethanol (single-bottle test, water available the other 23\u00a0h per day). A diet enriched with 3% tryptophan (TRP), the amino acid precursor for serotonin synthesis, was administered in a restricted feeding schedule (5\u00a0h per day) with ethanol intake measured the last 4\u00a0h. Fenfluramine decreased ethanol intake at all doses tested. The 8-OH-DPAT increased ethanol intake at lower doses, presumably acting at autoreceptors, which inhibit serotonergic neurons, and decreased intake at higher doses, presumably acting at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. TRP-enriched diet\u00a0also significantly decreased ethanol intake. Food and water intake were less or unaffected by these three manipulations. With all three manipulations, ethanol intake remained suppressed one or more days after the day of tests that decreased ethanol intake. These data suggest that SUS rats, like many other lines/strains of rodents that consume large amounts of alcohol, show an inverse relationship between serotonin transmission and voluntary intake of ethanol.",

It was found that five pairings with ethanol induced CPA in ethanol-na\u00efve rats of both lines, but the magnitude of avoidance was lower in the UChB relative to the UChA rats, indicating that ethanol was less aversive to na\u00efve rats bred for high alcohol drinking. After 2 months of high voluntary ethanol drinking (\u223c6\u20137\u00a0g/kg/day), in free choice between 10% ethanol and water, ethanol produced CPP in UChB rats, reflecting that ethanol had become rewarding to these rats. By contrast, the low voluntary ethanol intake (<1\u00a0g/kg/day) displayed by UChA rats preexposed for 2 months in free choice did not change ethanol-induced CPA. However, preexposure of UChA rats to forced ethanol drinking (\u223c5.7\u00a0g/kg/day) and the later inhibition of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde by 4-methylpyrazole (10\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneal), an inhibitor of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase, not only increased their voluntary ethanol intake in free choice, but also had a facilitating effect on the development of CPP. Taken together, these results show that the expression of the reinforcing effects of ethanol required a period of voluntary ethanol intake in UChB rats, whereas in UChA rats, both prior exposure to forced ethanol drinking and reduction of high blood ethanol-derived acetaldehyde were required.",

Consistent with this idea, there was an inverse relationship between ALLO levels and symptoms of anxiety and depression in humans and convulsive activity in rodents during alcohol withdrawal. Our recent studies examined the activity and expression of 5\u03b1-reductase (Srd5a1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of ALLO, during alcohol withdrawal in mice selectively bred for high chronic alcohol withdrawal (Withdrawal Seizure-Prone [WSP]) and found that Srd5a1 was downregulated in the cortex and hippocampus over the time course of dependence and withdrawal. The purpose of the present studies was to extend these findings and more discretely map the regions of Srd5a1 expression in mouse brain using radioactive in situ hybridization in WSP mice that were ethanol na\u00efve, following exposure to 72\u00a0h ethanol vapor (dependent) or during peak withdrawal. In na\u00efve animals, expression of Srd5a1 was widely distributed throughout the mouse brain, with highest expression in specific regions of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. In dependent animals and during withdrawal, there was no change in Srd5a1 expression in cortex or hippocampus, which differed from our recent findings in dissected tissues. These results suggest that local Srd5a1 mRNA expression in WSP brain may not change in parallel with local ALLO content or withdrawal severity.",

     "abstract": "We have previously shown that acetaldehyde (ACD), the first metabolite of ethanol, regulates its motivational properties and possesses reinforcing effects by itself. A large and still growing body of evidence indicates that the endogenous opioidergic system plays a critical role in the motivational effects of ethanol and suggests a role for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in these effects of both ethanol and ACD. The present study was undertaken to examine if opioid-mediated mechanisms are involved in the reinforcing properties of ACD and in ACD-elicited ERK activation. To this end, Wistar rats were trained to orally self-administer ACD (0.2%) by nose poking. Responses on active nose poke caused delivery of ACD solution, whereas responses on inactive nose poke had no consequences. The effect of pretreatment with a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), was evaluated during (1) maintenance of ACD self-administration, (2) deprivation effect after ACD extinction, and (3) ACD self-administration under a progressive-ratio schedule of reinforcement. Additionally, we tested the effect of NTX on saccharin (0.05%) reinforcement, as assessed by oral self-administration, and on ACD-elicited ERK phosphorylation in the nucleus accumbens (Acb), as assessed by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we examined the effect of a \u03bc1-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naloxonazine (NLZ), on the maintenance phase of ACD and saccharin self-administration. The results indicate that NTX (0.4\u20130.8\u00a0mg/kg) reduced the maintenance, the deprivation effect, and the break points of ACD self-administration without suppressing saccharin self-administration. Moreover, NTX decreased ACD-elicited ERK activation in the Acb shell and core. NLZ (10\u201315\u00a0mg/kg) reduced the maintenance phase of ACD self-administration without interfering with saccharin self-administration, whereas both NTX and NLZ failed to modify responses on inactive nose poke indicating the lack of a nonspecific behavioral activation. Overall, these results indicate that the opioid system is implicated in the reinforcing properties of ACD and suggest an involvement of ERK. The finding that NTX and NLZ reduce ACD but not saccharin self-administration indicates that these effects are specific to ACD.",

     "abstract": "Chronic ethanol abuse results in hepatocyte injury and impairs hepatocyte replication. We have previously shown that ethanol metabolism results in cell cycle arrest at the G2/M transition, which is partially mediated by inhibitory phosphorylation of the cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdc2. To further delineate the mechanisms by which ethanol metabolism mediates this G2/M arrest, we investigated the involvement of upstream regulators of Cdc2 activity. Cdc2 is activated by the phosphatase Cdc25C. The activity of Cdc25C can, in turn, be regulated by the checkpoint kinase, Chk2, which is regulated by the kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). To investigate the involvement of the regulators of Cdc2 activity, VA-13 cells, which are Hep G2 cells modified to efficiently express alcohol dehydrogenase, were cultured in the presence or absence of 25 mM ethanol. Immunoblots were performed to determine the effects of ethanol metabolism on the activation of Cdc25C, Chk2, and ATM. Ethanol metabolism increased the active forms of ATM and Chk2, as well as the phosphorylated form of Cdc25C. Additionally, inhibition of ATM resulted in approximately 50% of the cells being rescued from the G2/M cell cycle arrest and ameliorated the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdc2. Our findings demonstrated that ethanol metabolism activates ATM. ATM can activate the checkpoint kinase Chk2, resulting in phosphorylation of Cdc25C and ultimately in the accumulation of inactive Cdc2. This may, in part, explain the ethanol metabolism\u2013mediated impairment in hepatocyte replication, which may be important in the initiation and progression of alcoholic liver injury.",

     "abstract": "Sepsis is a major cause of death worldwide. The associated risks and mortality are known to significantly increase on exposure to alcohol (chronic or acute). The underlying mechanisms of the association of acute ethanol ingestion and poor prognosis of sepsis are largely unknown. The study described here was designed to determine in detail the role of ethanol and TLR4 in the pathogenesis of the sepsis syndrome. The effects of acute ethanol exposure and TLR4 on bacterial clearance, spleen cell numbers, peritoneal macrophage numbers, and cytokine production were evaluated using wild-type and TLR4 hyporesponsive mice treated with ethanol and then challenged with a nonpathogenic strain of Escherichia coli. Ethanol-treated mice exhibited a decreased clearance of bacteria and produced lesser amounts of most pro-inflammatory cytokines in both strains of mice at 2\u00a0h after challenge. Neither ethanol treatment nor a hyporesponsive TLR4 had significant effects on the cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity and spleen 2\u00a0h postinfection. The suppressive effect of acute ethanol exposure on cytokine and chemokine production was more pronounced in the wild-type mice, but the untreated hyporesponsive mice produced less of most cytokines than untreated wild-type mice. The major conclusion of this study is that acute ethanol exposure suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokine production and that a hyporesponsive TLR4 (in C3H/HeJ mice) decreases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, but the cytokines and other mediators induced through other receptors are sufficient to ultimately clear the infection but not enough to induce lethal septic shock. In addition, results reported here demonstrate previously unknown effects of acute ethanol exposure on leukemia inhibitory factor and eotaxin, and provide the first evidence that interleukin (IL)-9 is induced through TLR4 in\u00a0vivo.",

We investigated the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on vascular reactivity to AM and the expression of AM system components in the rat aorta. Male Wistar rats were treated with ethanol (20% vol/vol) for 6 weeks. Vascular reactivity experiments were performed in the isolated rat aorta. Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) levels were determined by gelatin zymography. Nitrite and nitrate generation was measured by chemiluminescence. Protein and mRNA levels of pre-pro-AM, calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) and RAMP1, 2, and 3 (receptor-activity-modifying proteins) were assessed by western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Ethanol intake reduced AM-induced relaxation in endothelium-intact rat aortas, whereas calcitonin gene-related peptide-, acetylcholine-, and sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation were not affected by ethanol intake. NG-nitro-l-arginine-methyl-ester (l-NAME), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, and tetraethylammonium reduced AM-induced relaxation in aortic rings from both control and ethanol-treated rats. Ethanol consumption did not alter basal levels of nitrate and nitrite, nor did it affect the expression of MMP-2 in the rat aorta. Ethanol consumption increased mRNA levels of pre-pro-AM and RAMP1. Protein levels of AM, CRLR, and RAMP1, 2, and 3 were not affected by ethanol consumption. The major findings of the present study are that ethanol consumption reduces the vascular relaxation induced by AM and changes the mRNA expression of the components of the AM system in the vasculature. This response could be one of the mechanisms by which ethanol predisposes individuals to vascular dysfunction and hypertension.",

Thus, the objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of (1) activating CRH receptors (CRHRs) by microinjection of CRH in CeA and (2) blocking CRHRs by local microinjections of CRHR antagonists in the CeA on the alcohol-induced changes in the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8 with in\u00a0vivo microdialysis experiments.

The content of dynorphin A1-8 was determined in dialyzate samples obtained prior to and following the various treatments using a specific radioimmunoassay. Activation of CRHRs in CeA induced an increase in the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8. Moreover, acute alcohol administration increased the extracellular concentrations of dynorphin A1-8 in CeA, an effect that was attenuated by blocking CRHR2 with anti-sauvagine-30 microinjection but not blocking CRHR1 with antalarmin microinjection. Therefore, the findings suggest an interaction between the CRH and dynorphin A1-8 systems at the level of CeA in response to acute alcohol exposure.",

D2R exists in two isoforms, D2 long (D2LR) and D2 short (D2SR), produced by alternative splicing of the same gene. The relative contributions of D2LR versus D2SR to ethanol and sugar water drinking are not known. Genetic engineering was used to produce a line of knockout (KO) mice that lack D2LR and consequently have increased expression of D2SR. KO and wild-type (WT) mice of both sexes were tested for intake of 20% ethanol, 10% sugar water and plain tap water using established drinking-in-the-dark procedures. Mice were also tested for effects of the D2 antagonist eticlopride on intake of ethanol to determine whether KO responses were caused by lack of D2LR or overrepresentation of D2SR. Locomotor activity on running wheels and in cages without wheels was also measured for comparison. D2L KO mice drank significantly more ethanol than WT in both sexes. KO mice drank more sugar water than WT in females but not in males. Eticlopride dose dependently decreased ethanol intake in all groups except male KO. KO mice were less physically active than WT in cages with or without running wheels. Results suggest that overrepresentation of D2SR contributes to increased intake of ethanol in the KO mice. Decreasing wheel running and general levels of physical activity in the KO mice rules out the possibility that higher intake results from higher motor activity. Results extend the literature implicating altered expression of D2R in risk for addiction by delineating the contribution of individual D2R isoforms. These findings suggest that D2LR and D2SR play differential roles in consumption of alcohol and sugar rewards.",

     "abstract": "The alcohol-tolerant AT and alcohol-nontolerant ANT rat lines have been selectively bred for innate sensitivity to ethanol-induced motor impairment. The cerebellar GABAA receptor (GABAAR) \u03b16 subunit alleles \u03b16-100R and \u03b16-100Q are segregated in the AT and ANT rats, respectively. This \u03b16 polymorphism might explain various differences in pharmacological properties and density of GABAARs between the rat lines. In the present study, we have used nonselected outbred Sprague\u2013Dawley rats homozygous for the \u03b16-100RR (RR) and \u03b16-100QQ (QQ) genotypes to show that these RR and QQ rats display similar differences between genotypes as AT and ANT rat lines. The genotypes differed in their affinity for [3H]Ro 15-4513 and classic benzodiazepines (BZs) to cerebellar \u201cdiazepam-insensitive\u201d (DZ-IS) binding sites, in density of cerebellar [3H]muscimol binding and in the antagonizing effect of furosemide on GABA-induced inhibition of [3H]EBOB binding. The results suggest the involvement of \u03b16-R100Q polymorphism in these line differences and in the differences previously found between AT and ANT rats. In addition, the \u03b16-R100Q polymorphism induces striking differences in [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding kinetics to recombinant \u03b16\u03b23\u03b32s receptors and cerebellar DZ-IS sites. Association of [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding was \u223c10-fold faster and dissociation was \u223c3\u20134-fold faster in DZ-IS \u03b16\u03b2\u03b32 receptors containing the \u03b16-100Q allele, with a resulting change of \u223c2.5-fold in equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). The results indicate that in addition to the central role of the homologous \u03b16-100R/Q (\u03b11-101H) residue in BZ binding and efficacy, this critical BZ binding site residue has a major impact on BZ binding kinetics.",

     "abstract": "Excessive consumption of fluoride and ethanol has been identified as injurious to human health. Fluoride and ethanol co-exposures are commonly seen among the alcoholics residing in endemic fluoride areas worldwide. This study was undertaken to examine the modulation of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defense systems in rat intestine by subchronic fluoride and ethanol administration. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: group I (control), group II (fluoride was given orally at a dose of 25\u00a0mg/kg body weight), group III (30% ethanol was given orally at a dose of 1\u00a0mL/kg body weight), and group IV (a combination of fluoride and ethanol was administered orally at the dose described for groups II and III). Lipid peroxidation was elevated (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in intestine of rats by fluoride or ethanol treatments for 20 or 40 days. However, glutathione content was reduced by fluoride (32 and 44%) and ethanol (21 and 40%) treatments after 20 and 40 days, respectively. Fluoride-exposed animals showed reduction (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in the activities of superoxide dismutase (22 and 42%), catalase (30 and 37%), glutathione peroxidase (22 and 35%), glutathione reductase (32 and 34%), and glutathione-S-transferase (24 and 30%) after 20 and 40 days. A similar decrease (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in the activities of these enzymes was also noticed in animals exposed to ethanol for 20 or 40 days. The observed changes in lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione levels, and enzyme systems were further augmented in intestine of rats exposed to fluoride and ethanol together. Intestinal histology showed large reactive lymphoid follicles along with mild excess of lymphocytes in lamina propria of villi, villous edema, focal ileitis, and necrosis of villi in animals exposed to fluoride and ethanol for 40 days. These findings suggest that fluoride and ethanol exposure induces considerable changes in lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defense, and morphology of rat intestine, which may affect its functions.",

Previously, we demonstrated that lambs exposed to ethanol during gestation had impaired expression of pulmonary surfactant protein A, a crucial component of lung immunity. In this study, we investigated the effects of in utero exposure to ethanol on maturation and immunity of the fetal lung. Pregnant ewes were surgically implanted with an abomasal cannula and administered 1\u00a0g ethanol/kg (n\u00a0=\u00a08) or water (n\u00a0=\u00a08) during the last trimester of pregnancy. Lambs were delivered prematurely or naturally. Neonatal lungs were assessed for maturation markers (hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 [HIF-1\u03b1], HIF-2\u03b1, HIF-3\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor-A [VEGF-A], VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, glycogen, and lung protein levels) and immunity (cytokines and chemokines). Preterm animals exposed to ethanol had significantly reduced VEGF-A mRNA (P\u00a0=\u00a0.066) and protein levels, HIF-1\u03b1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.055), HIF-2\u03b1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.019), VEGFR-1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.088), and VEGFR-2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.067) mRNA levels but no changes in HIF-3\u03b1 mRNA. No significant changes occurred in full-term animals exposed to ethanol. Glycogen levels were significantly higher in preterm animals exposed to ethanol (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006) but not in full-term animals. Ethanol exposure was associated with significantly lower lung protein levels in preterm (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03) but not full-term animals. Preterm animals exposed to ethanol had significantly reduced TNF-\u03b1 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05), IL-10 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.03), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.017), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0004) mRNA.

The ethanol-mediated alterations in fetal lung maturation and immunity may explain the increased incidence of respiratory infections in neonates exposed to ethanol in utero.",

Genotyping of the LIPG 584C\u00a0>\u00a0T was performed in 763 unrelated nondrinkers and 520 drinkers aged 15\u201385 years. The levels of serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoprotein (Apo) AI, and the ratio of ApoAI to ApoB were higher in drinkers than in nondrinkers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01 for all). There were no significant differences in the genotypic and allelic frequencies between nondrinkers and drinkers. The levels of TC, HDL-C, and ApoAI in nondrinkers were different among the three genotypes (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05\u2013.01), the subjects with CT genotype had higher TC, HDL-C, and ApoAI levels than the subjects with CC genotype. The levels of HDL-C and ApoAI in drinkers were different among the three genotypes (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 and P\u00a0<\u00a0.05; respectively), the individuals with TT genotype had higher HDL-C and ApoAI levels than the individuals with CT and CC genotypes.

     "abstract": "The mechanism for the observed association of alcohol consumption breast cancer risk is not known; understanding that mechanism could improve understanding of breast carcinogenesis and optimize prevention strategies. Alcohol may impact breast malignancies or tumor progression by altering DNA methylation. We examined promoter methylation of three genes, the E-cadherin, p16, and retinoic acid-binding receptor-\u03b22 (RAR-\u03b22) genes in archived breast tumor tissues from participants in a population-based case\u2013control study. Real time methylation-specific PCR was performed on 803 paraffin-embedded samples, and lifetime alcohol consumption was queried. Unordered polytomous and unconditional logistic regression were used to derive adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RAR-\u03b22 methylation was not associated with drinking. Among premenopausal women, alcohol consumption was also not associated with promoter methylation for E-cadherin and p16 genes. In case\u2013case comparisons of postmenopausal breast cancer, compared with lifetime never drinkers, promoter methylation likelihood was increased for higher alcohol intake for E-cadherin (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.39; 95% CI, 1.15\u20134.96), in particular for those with estrogen receptor-negative tumors (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.13; 95% CI, 1.16\u201314.72), and decreased for p16 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.52; 95% CI, 0.29\u20130.92). There were indications that the association with p16 was stronger for drinking at younger ages. Methylation was also associated with drinking intensity independent of total consumption for both genes. We found alcohol consumption was associated with DNA methylation in postmenopausal breast tumors, suggesting that the association of alcohol and breast cancer may be related, at least in part, to altered methylation, and may differ by drinking pattern.",

This study examines whether school performance at 14 years is associated with drinking problems in early\u00a0adulthood; and whether this association is explained by family and individual factors in childhood and adolescence. Data were from a 21-year follow-up of 3,478 Australian young adults from birth to the age of 21 years when data on use of alcohol were collected. Child school performance (CSP) was assessed at 14 years via self- and maternal report. Alcohol consumption at 21 years was measured via self-report, and alcohol abuse and dependence were assessed by the computerized version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI-Auto). Potential confounding factors were prospectively measured between the child\u2019s birth and age of 14 years. School performance at 14 years predicted young adults\u2019 alcohol consumption and alcohol use disorders (AUDs). After controlling for confounding, children who had lower school performance had increased risk of drinking more than two glasses of alcohol per day in early adulthood (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.1\u20132.6). There was a similar pattern of association between CSP and young adults\u2019 alcohol abuse and dependence (AUD) measured by CIDI-Auto. Level of academic performance in high school children predicts their drinking problems as young adults, independently of a selected group of individual and family confounders. Exploration of the pathway linking school performance and alcohol problems in young people may help identify opportunities for preventive interventions.",

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. The frequency and severity of pneumococcal infections in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse is much higher than the general population. Despite this obvious epidemiological relevance, very few experimental studies have focused on the interaction of pneumococci with the immune system of a host acutely or chronically exposed to alcohol. Understanding these host\u2013pathogen interactions is imperative for designing effective prophylactic and therapeutic interventions for such populations. Recent advances in pneumococcal research have greatly improved our understanding of pneumococcal pathogenesis and virulence mechanisms. Additionally, a large body of data is available on the effect of alcohol on the physiology of the lungs and the innate and adaptive immune system of the host. The purpose of this review is to integrate the available knowledge in these diverse areas of for a better understanding of the how the compromised immune system derived from alcohol exposure responds to pneumococcal infections.",

Moreover, moderate ethanol drinking and moderate systemic exposure elevates extracellular DA levels in mesocorticolimbic projection regions. However, the neuroadaptive changes subsequent to moderate ethanol drinking on basal DA levels have not been investigated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In the present study, adult female alcohol-preferring (P) rats were divided into alcohol-naive, alcohol-drinking, and alcohol-deprived groups. The alcohol-drinking group had continuous access to water and ethanol (15%, vol/vol) for 8 weeks. The alcohol-deprived group had 6 weeks of access followed by 2 weeks of ethanol deprivation, 2 weeks of ethanol re-exposure, followed again by 2 weeks of deprivation. The deprived rats demonstrated a robust alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) on ethanol reinstatement. The alcohol-na\u00efve group had continuous access to water only. In the last week of the drinking protocol, all rats were implanted with unilateral microdialysis probes aimed at the posterior VTA and no-net-flux microdialysis was conducted to quantify extracellular DA levels and DA clearance. Results yielded significantly lower basal extracellular DA\u00a0concentrations in the posterior VTA of the alcohol-drinking group compared with the alcohol-naive and alcohol-deprived groups (3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nM vs. 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0nM [P\u00a0<\u00a0.02] and 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0nM, [P\u00a0<\u00a0.05], respectively).

The data indicate that reductions in basal DA levels within the posterior VTA occur after moderate chronic ethanol intake in nondependent P rats. This reduction may result, in part, from increased DA uptake and may be important for the maintenance of ethanol drinking. These adaptations normalize with ethanol deprivation and may not contribute to the ADE.",

The animals were required to press the lever four times to gain continuous access to the drinking solution for 20 minutes, and microdialysis was performed on either the first or second day of 10% ethanol plus 10% sucrose self-administration or 10% sucrose as controls. Ethanol and dopamine were both analyzed in the dialysates. All groups (day 1 and 2 ethanol and their corresponding sucrose controls) showed an increase in accumbal dopamine during the transfer from the home cage into the operant chamber. Our main finding was an increase in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens core\u2013shell border during the first 5 minutes of consumption on the second day but not on the first day of ethanol self-administration. Our results suggest that a single exposure to a 10% ethanol plus 10% sucrose drinking solution may be sufficient to learn the association between ethanol cues and its reinforcing properties. Furthermore, we speculate that the dopamine response during ethanol consumption likely reflects the reward-prediction role of the mesolimbic dopamine system.",

Also, when its effects were tested on unlimited access to alcohol in P rats, preference for alcohol solution was transiently suppressed but without affecting voluntary alcohol intake. JNJ-31020028 (15\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) did reverse the anxiogenic effects of withdrawal from a single bolus dose of alcohol on the elevated plus-maze, confirming the anxiolytic-like properties of NPY Y2 antagonism. Our data do not support Y2 antagonism as a mechanism for reducing alcohol consumption or relapse-like behavior, but the observed effects on withdrawal-induced anxiety suggest that NPY Y2 receptor antagonists may be a putative treatment for the negative affective states following alcohol withdrawal.",

The high ethanol sensitivity of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors containing the \u03b4 subunit combined with the role of tonic inhibition in maintaining the background inhibitory \u201ctone\u201d in hippocampal circuits has suggested that they may play a key role mediating certain behavioral effects of ethanol, including those related to learning and memory. We have found that ethanol disrupts learning and learning-related hippocampal function more potently in adolescent animals than in adults and that ethanol promotes extrasynaptic receptor-mediated GABAergic tonic currents more potently in adolescents than in adults. However, there have been no studies of potential mechanisms that may underlie the enhanced ethanol sensitivity of the tonic current in adolescents. In this study, we recorded GABAA receptor-mediated tonic currents in dentate gyrus granule cells in hippocampal slices from adolescent and adult rats. As previously reported, we found that ethanol potentiated the currents more efficaciously in cells from adolescents than in those from adults. We also found that the GAT-1 blocker NO-711 eliminated this developmental difference in ethanol sensitivity. These findings suggest that regulation of ambient GABA by GABA transporters may contribute to the difference in ethanol sensitivity between adolescents and adults.",

To date, however, no study has assessed the potential long-term effects of chronic intermittent and unpredictable ethanol (EtOH) exposure in mice chronically stressed beginning in adolescence on brain function and anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood. In particular, alterations in function of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a brain region heavily implicated in anxiety-related behaviors and altered plasticity following EtOH exposure, may play a key role in the pathological responses to chronic stress and EtOH. In the present study, adolescent and adult C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to a regimen of chronic social isolation and unpredictable stressors and EtOH (or\u00a0air [sham]; CSI-CUS-EtOH and CSI-CUS-Sham, respectively) for 8\u201310 weeks. In adulthood, mice were tested for altered anxiety-like behavior (elevated plus maze [EPM] and modified social interaction [SI] test). Following behavioral testing, mice were reexposed to CSI-CUS-EtOH (and CSI-CUS-Sham for controls) for an additional 3 days. Four to six hours following the final EtOH (or air) exposure, field potential recordings of the dorsal-lateral (dl)BNST were performed. Mice first exposed during adolescence to CSI-CUS-EtOH displayed lower levels of anxiety-like behavior on the EPM compared with mice first exposed to CSI-CUS-EtOH during adulthood and control mice only exposed to CSI-CUS-Sham, regardless of age of first exposure. However, mice first exposed to CSI-CUS-EtOH during adulthood displayed lower levels of anxiety-like behavior on the SI test compared with mice first exposed during adolescence and control CSI-CUS-Sham mice. CSI-CUS-EtOH exposure, regardless of age, produced blunted expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dlBNST compared with CSI-CUS-Sham mice. This study demonstrates age-dependent effects of chronic unpredictable ethanol exposure in chronically stressed mice on anxiety-like behaviors during adulthood. Further, CSI-CUS-EtOH exposure results in blunted LTP expression in the adult dlBNST.",

     "abstract": "Many intracellular proteins and signaling cascades contribute to the ethanol sensitivity of native N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). One putative protein is the serine/threonine kinase, protein kinase C (PKC). The purpose of this study was to assess if PKC modulates the ethanol sensitivity of native NMDARs expressed in primary cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). With the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we assessed if ethanol inhibition of NMDA-induced currents (INMDA) (100\u00a0\u03bcM NMDA plus 10\u00a0\u03bcM glycine) were altered in CGCs in which the novel and classical PKC isoforms were activated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Percent inhibition by 10, 50, or 100\u00a0mM ethanol of NMDA-induced steady-state current amplitudes (ISS) or peak current amplitudes (IPk) of NMDARs expressed in CGCs in which PKC was activated by a 12.5\u00a0min, 100\u00a0nM PMA exposure at 37\u00b0C did not differ from currents obtained from receptors contained in control cells. However, PMA-mediated augmentation of IPk in the absence of ethanol was abolished after brief applications of 10 or 1\u00a0mM ethanol coapplied with agonists, and this suppression of enhanced receptor function was observed for up to 8\u00a0min post-ethanol exposure. Because we had previously shown that PMA-mediated augmentation of INMDA of NMDARs expressed in these cells is by activation of PKC\u03b1, we assessed the effect of ethanol (1, 10, 50, and 100\u00a0mM) on PKC\u03b1 activity. Ethanol decreased PKC\u03b1 activity by 18% for 1\u00a0mM ethanol and activity decreased with increasing ethanol concentrations with a 50% inhibition observed with 100\u00a0mM ethanol. The data suggest that ethanol disruption of PMA-mediated augmentation of INMDA may be due to a decrease in PKC\u03b1 activity by ethanol. However, given the incomplete blockade of PKC\u03b1 activity and the low concentration of ethanol at which this phenomenon is observed, other ethanol-sensitive signaling cascades must also be involved.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the mechanism of action of ethanol and the neurobiological substrates for alcohol use disorders is challenging. In search of this knowledge, it is imperative to use valid animal experimental models. The Wistar rat is one example of a commonly used strain that also exert foundation stock for several rat lines selectively bred for high and low voluntary ethanol intake. Different studies report varying ethanol intake in Wistar rats posing the question of whether this is because of the methodological differences or the rat strain. The purpose of this study was therefore to compare voluntary ethanol intake in Wistar rats from five different suppliers. Rats from B&K Universal, UK (BK); Charles River, Germany; Harlan Laboratories, IN (Hsd); Harlan Laboratories, The Netherlands (RccHan\u2122); and Taconic,\u00a0Denmark were exposed to a three-bottle free-choice paradigm with intermittent 24\u00a0h access to 5 and 20% ethanol and water three times per week for 6 weeks. A general finding was that the RccHan\u2122 rats differed significantly from the other groups. At the end of the experiment, the RccHan\u2122 group had the highest median ethanol intake of 3.85\u00a0g/kg/24\u00a0h, whereas the BK rats had the lowest intake of 1.84\u00a0g/kg/24\u00a0h. The preference for ethanol was also different throughout the experiment. At the end of the experiment, the RccHan\u2122 rats had the highest preference of approximately 80%, whereas the BK rats had the lowest preference around 25%. During the 6-week drinking period, only the Hsd rats increased their ethanol intake, as evidenced by a significant increase of 5% ethanol intake. Although all rats are of Wistar origin, they display profound differences in voluntary ethanol consumption depending on the supplier. The choice of Wistar can therefore have implications for the outcome and make comparisons between studies difficult. The present findings highlight the supplier as an important parameter to consider when planning and performing preclinical animal studies in the field of alcohol research.",

The objective of the present study was to get more conclusive evidence for the potential role of the hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal and hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal axes in alcohol drinking by using the F2 experimental design. Alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-nonpreferring ANA rat lines were crossbred to form a F1 population from which the final F2 population was derived. Male animals were challenged with a priming alcohol dose after which a 3 weeks\u2019 voluntary alcohol drinking period took place. After a washout period of 1 week, one-half of the 40 highest and 40 lowest alcohol drinkers were challenged with a second dose of alcohol and the other half with saline. Serum testosterone and corticosterone levels were measured before and during the test. Higher endogenous testosterone levels were detected in the rats of the high alcohol consumption group compared with the low consumption group. Also supporting the original AA/ANA line differences, a trend for lower endogenous corticosterone levels were measured in the high alcohol consumption group compared with the low consumption group. The alcohol challenge test after the drinking period resulted in a higher frequency (38%) of testosterone elevations in the high drinkers compared with the low drinkers (5%). The present data confirms the validity of the positive connections between testosterone elevation and increased alcohol drinking, as well as between testosterone reduction and decreased alcohol drinking, in AA and ANA rats.",

     "abstract": "We have selectively bred mice that reach very high blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) after drinking from a single bottle of 20% ethanol. High Drinking in the Dark (HDID-1) mice drink nearly 6\u00a0g/kg ethanol in 4\u00a0h and reach average BECs of more than 1.0\u00a0mg/mL. Previous studies suggest that DID and two-bottle preference for 10% ethanol with continuous access are influenced by many of the same genes. We therefore asked whether HDID-1 mice would differ from the HS/Npt control stock on two-bottle preference drinking. We serially offered mice access to 3\u201340% ethanol in tap water versus tap water. For ethanol concentrations between 3 and 20%, HDID-1 and HS/Npt controls did not differ in two-bottle preference drinking. At the highest concentrations, the HS/Npt mice drank more than the HDID-1 mice. We also tested the same mice for preference for two concentrations each of quinine, sucrose, and saccharin. Curiously, the mice showed preference ratios (volume of tastant/total fluid drunk) of about 50% for all tastants and concentrations. Thus, neither genotype showed either preference or avoidance for any tastant after high ethanol concentrations. Therefore, we compared naive groups of HDID-1 and HS/Npt mice for tastant preference. Results from this test showed that ethanol-naive mice preferred sweet fluids and avoided quinine but the genotypes did not differ. Finally, we tested HDID-1 and HS mice for an extended period for preference for 15% ethanol versus water during a 2-h access period in the dark. After several weeks, HDID-1 mice consumed significantly more than HS. We conclude that drinking in the dark shows some genetic overlap with other tests of preference drinking, but that the degree of genetic commonality depends on the model used.",

     "abstract": "Genetic factors influence adverse pregnancy outcome in both humans and animal models. Animal research reveals that both the maternal and fetal genetic profiles are important for determining the risk of physical birth defects and prenatal mortality. Using a reciprocal-cross breeding design, we investigated whether the mother\u2019s genes may be more important than fetal genes in determining risk for ethanol teratogenesis. Examination of possible synergistic genetic effects on ethanol teratogenesis was made possible by using two mouse strains known to be susceptible to specific malformations. Inbred A/J (A) and C57BL/6J (B6) mice were mated to produce four fetal genotype groups: the true-bred A\u010bA and B6\u010bB6 genotypes and the genetically identical A\u010bB6 and B6\u010bA genotypes (the F1 genotype). Dams were administered either 5.8\u00a0g/kg ethanol or an isocaloric amount of maltose\u2013dextrin on day 9 of pregnancy. Fetuses were removed by laparotomy on gestation day 18, weighed, and assessed for digit, vertebral, and kidney malformations. Digit malformations in the genetically identical F1 ethanol-exposed litters showed a pattern consistent with a maternal genetic effect (A\u010bB6 [2%] and B6\u010bA [30%]). In contrast, vertebral malformations were similar in all ethanol-exposed litters (A\u010bA [26%], A\u010bB6 [18%], B6\u010bA [22%], and B6\u010bB6 [33%]). The percentage of malformations did not differ between male and female fetuses, indicating sex-linked factors are not responsible for the maternal effect. Ethanol exposure decreased litter weights but did not affect litter mortality compared with maltose-exposed controls. This study supports the idea that genes influence malformation risk following in utero alcohol exposure. Specifically, maternal genes influence risk more than fetal genes for some teratogenic outcomes. No evidence supported synergistic genetic effects on ethanol teratogenesis. This research supports the conclusion that uterine environment contributes to determining risk of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.",

     "abstract": "Repeated administration of low doses of ethanol gradually increases locomotor responses to ethanol in adult Swiss mice. This phenomenon is known as behavioral sensitization. However, we have shown that adolescent Swiss mice show either behavioral tolerance or no sensitization after repeated ethanol injections. Although the mesolimbic dopamine system has been extensively implicated in behavioral sensitization, several studies have demonstrated an important role of glutamatergic transmission in this phenomenon. In addition, relatively few studies have examined the role of developmental factors in behavioral sensitization to ethanol. To examine the relationship between age differences in behavioral sensitization to ethanol and the neurochemical adaptations related to glutamate within nucleus accumbens (NAc), in\u00a0vivo microdialysis was conducted in adolescent and adult Swiss mice treated with ethanol (1.8\u00a0g/kg) or saline for 15 days and subsequently challenged with an acute dose (1.8\u00a0g/kg) of ethanol 6 days later. Consistent with previous findings, only adult mice demonstrated evidence of behavioral sensitization. However, ethanol-treated adolescent mice demonstrated a 196.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040.0% peak increase in extracellular levels of glutamate in the NAc after ethanol challenge in comparison with the basal values, whereas ethanol-treated adult mice demonstrated a 52.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2% reduction in extracellular levels of glutamate in the NAc after ethanol challenge. These observations suggest an age-dependent inverse relationship between behavioral and glutamatergic responses to repeated ethanol exposure.",

The present study addresses the effects of a single acute ethanol exposure on growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in neurons in the cerebellum and hippocampus of adolescent rats. Male postnatal day 23 (P23) Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were exposed to ethanol vapors for 2\u00a0h and after a recovery period of 2\u00a0h, the cerebellum and hippocampus were harvested and samples were taken for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) determinations. We found that this exposure resulted in a mean BAC of 174\u00a0mg/dL, which resembles levels in human adolescents after binge drinking. Analyses of total RNA and protein by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blotting, respectively, revealed that this single ethanol exposure significantly decreased the levels of GAP-43 mRNA and protein in the cerebellum but increased the levels of mRNA and protein in the hippocampus. BDNF mRNA and protein levels were also increased in the hippocampus but not in the cerebellum of these animals. In situ hybridizations revealed that GAP-43 and BDNF mRNA levels were primarily increased by alcohol exposure in hippocampal dentate granule cells and CA3 neurons. Overall, the reported alterations in the expression of the plasticity-associated genes GAP-43 and BDNF in juvenile rats are consistent with the known deleterious effects of binge drinking on motor coordination and cognitive function.",

     "abstract": "The effects of ethanol differ in adolescent and adult rats on a number of measures. The evidence of the effects of ethanol on spatial memory in adolescents and adults is equivocal. Whether adolescents are more or less sensitive to ethanol-induced impairment of spatial memory acquisition remains unclear; with regard to the effects of acute ethanol on spatial memory retrieval there is almost no research looking into any age difference. Thus, we examined the effects of acute ethanol on spatial memory in the Morris Watermaze in adolescents and adults. Allopregnanolone (ALLO) is a modulator of the GABAA receptor and has similar behavioral effects as ethanol. We sought to also determine the effects of allopreganolone on spatial memory in adolescent and adults. Male adolescent (post natal [PN]28\u201330) and adult (PN70\u201372) rats were trained in the Morris Watermaze for 6 days and acute doses of ethanol (saline, 1.5 and 2.0\u00a0g/kg) or ALLO (vehicle, 9 and 18\u00a0mg/kg) were administered on Day 7. A probe trial followed on Day 8. As expected, there were dose effects; higher doses of both ethanol and ALLO impaired spatial memory. However, in both the ethanol and ALLO conditions adolescents and adults had similar spatial memory impairments. The current results suggest that ethanol and ALLO both impair hippocampal-dependent spatial memory regardless of age in that once learning has occurred, ethanol or ALLO does not differentially impair the retrieval of spatial memory in adolescents and adults. Given the mixed results on the effect of ethanol on cognition in adolescent rats, additional research is needed to ascertain the factors critical for the reported differential results.",

The present study extended these observations to examine the intake of beer and equivalent dilute ethanol solutions with an inbred line of alcohol-preferring P rats. In Experiment 1, male adolescent P rats and age-matched Wistar rats had access to either beer or equivalent ethanol solutions for 1\u00a0h daily in a custom-built lickometer apparatus. In subsequent experiments, adolescent (Experiment 2) and adult (Experiment 3) male P rats were given continuous 24-h home cage access to beer or dilute ethanol solutions, with concomitant access to lab chow and water. In each experiment, the alcohol content of the beer and dilute ethanol solutions was gradually increased from 0.4, 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, 4.4, 5 to 10% EtOH (vol/vol). All three experiments showed a major augmentation of alcohol intake when rats were given beer compared with equivalent ethanol solutions. In Experiment 1, the overall intake of beer was higher in P rats compared with Wistar rats, but no strain difference was found during the 1-h sessions with plain ethanol consumption. Experiment 1 also showed that an alcohol deprivation effect was more readily obtained in rats with a history of consuming beer rather than plain ethanol solutions. In Experiments 2 and 3, voluntary beer intake in P rats represented ethanol intake of 10\u201315\u00a0g/kg/day, among the highest reported in any study with rats. This excessive consumption was most apparent in adolescent rats. Beer consumption markedly exceeded plain ethanol intake in these experiments except at the highest alcohol concentration (10%) tested. The advantage of using beer rather than dilute ethanol solutions in both selected and nonselected rat strains is therefore confirmed. Our findings encourage the use of beer with alcohol-preferring rats in future research that seeks to obtain high levels of alcohol self-administration.",

Human hepatoma HepG2 cells transfected with ethanol-metabolizing enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (VA 13 cells) were used. Knock down of Gcn5 by siRNA silencing decreased mRNA and protein levels of general control nondepressible 5 (GCN5), HAT activity, and also attenuated ethanol-induced H3AcK9 in VA13 cells. Illumina gene microarray analysis using total RNA showed 940 transcripts affected by GCN5 silencing or ethanol. Silencing caused differential expression of 891 transcripts (\u22651.5-fold upregulated or downregulated). Among these, 492 transcripts were upregulated and 399 were downregulated compared with their respective controls. Using a more stringent threshold (\u22652.5-fold), the array data from GCN5-silenced samples showed 57 genes differentially expressed (39 upregulated and 18 downregulated). Likewise, ethanol caused differential regulation of 57 transcripts with \u22651.5-fold change (35 gene upregulated and 22 downregulated). Further analysis showed that eight genes were differentially regulated that were common for both ethanol treatment and GCN5 silencing. Among these, SLC44A2 (a putative choline transporter) was strikingly upregulated by ethanol (three fold), and GCN5 silencing downregulated it (1.5-fold). The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction profile corroborated the array findings. This report demonstrates for the first time that (1) GCN5 differentially affects expression of multiple genes, (2) ethanol-induced histone H3-lysine 9 acetylation is mediated via GCN5, and (3) GCN5 is involved in ethanol-induced expression of the putative choline transporter SLC44A2.",

Heterozygous (DAT+/\u2212) and homozygous mutant (DAT\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type (DAT+/+) mice were allowed to consume 5% alcohol in a schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) task.

Previously, we showed that pharmacologic and genetic suppression of the GHS-R1A attenuates the alcohol-induced stimulation, accumbal dopamine release, and conditioned place preference as well as alcohol consumption in mice, implying that the GHS-R1A is required for alcohol reward. The present study further elucidates the role of ghrelin for alcohol-induced dopamine release in nucleus accumbens and locomotor stimulation by means of ghrelin knockout mice. We found that the ability of alcohol to increase accumbal dopamine release in wild-type mice is not observed in ghrelin knockout mice. Furthermore, alcohol induced a locomotor stimulation in the wild-type mice and ghrelin knockout mice; however, the locomotor stimulation in homozygote mice was significantly lower than in the wild-type mice. The present series of experiments suggest that endogenous ghrelin may be required for the ability of alcohol to activate the mesolimbic dopamine system.",

     "abstract": "Administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a neurosteroid that can negatively modulate the GABAA receptor, has been shown to decrease voluntary intake of ethanol in rats. In vivo, DHEA can be metabolized to a variety of metabolites, including 3\u03b2-acetoxyandrost-5-ene-7,17-dione (7-keto DHEA), a metabolite without the prohormonal effects of DHEA. This study compared the effectiveness of 7-keto DHEA with DHEA for reducing ethanol intake in the same group of rats. The subjects, previously trained to drink ethanol using a saccharin-fading procedure, had access to ethanol for 30\u00a0min daily and the amount consumed was recorded. Subjects were administered 10 and 56\u00a0mg/kg of DHEA or 7-keto DHEA intraperitoneally 15\u00a0min before drinking sessions. Subjects received each particular dose daily until one of two criteria was met, that is, either ethanol intake did not differ by more than 20% of the mean for 3 consecutive days or for a maximum of 8 days. Both 10 and 56\u00a0mg/kg of 7-keto DHEA significantly reduced the dose of ethanol consumed. Although 10\u00a0mg/kg of 7-keto DHEA produced decreases similar to those found with DHEA, the 56-mg/kg dose of 7-keto DHEA was significantly more effective at decreasing the dose of ethanol consumed than the same dose of DHEA. These results show that 7-keto DHEA is comparable with, or possibly more effective than, DHEA at decreasing ethanol consumption in rats, and that 7-keto DHEA is a compound deserving further investigation as a possible clinical treatment for alcohol abuse without the prohormonal effects of DHEA.",

     "abstract": "Experience with stress situations during early development can have long-lasting effects on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors. Importantly, this can also favor drug self-administration. These studies examined the effects of chronic social isolation and/or variable stress experiences during early development on subsequent voluntary ethanol intake in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice. The experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of chronic isolation between weaning and adulthood (Experiment 1), chronic isolation during adulthood (Experiment 2), and chronic variable stress (CVS) alone or in combination with chronic social isolation between weaning and adulthood (Experiment 3) on subsequent voluntary ethanol intake. Mice were born in our facility and were separated into two housing conditions:\u00a0isolate housed (one mouse/cage) or group housed (four mice/cage) according to sex. Separate groups were isolated for 40 days starting either at time of weaning postnatal day 21 (PD 21) (early isolation, Experiments 1 and 3) or at adulthood (PD 60: late isolation, Experiment 2). The effects of housing condition on subsequent ethanol intake were assessed starting at around PD 65 in Experiments 1 and 3 or PD 105 days in Experiment 2. In Experiment 3, starting at PD 32, isolate-housed and group-housed mice were either subjected to CVS or left undisturbed. CVS groups experienced random presentations of mild stressors for 14 days, including exposure to an unfamiliar open field, restraint, physical shaking, and forced swim, among others. All mice were tested for ethanol intake for 14 days using a two-bottle choice (ethanol 15% vol/vol vs. water) for a 2-h limited access procedure. Early social isolation resulted in greater ethanol intake compared with the corresponding group-housed mice (Experiment 1). In contrast, social isolation during adulthood (late isolation) did not increase subsequent ethanol intake compared with the corresponding group-housed mice (Experiment 2). For mice that did not experience CVS, early social isolation resulted in greater ethanol intake compared with group-housed mice (Experiment 3). CVS subsequently resulted in a significant increase in ethanol intake in group-housed mice, but CVS failed to further increase ethanol intake in mice that experienced chronic social isolation early in life (Experiment 3). Overall, female mice consumed more ethanol than males, whether isolated (early or late) or group housed. These results indicate that early but not late social isolation can subsequently influence ethanol consumption in C57BL/6J mice. Thus, the developmental timing of chronic social isolation appears to be an important factor in defining later effects on ethanol self-administration behavior. In addition, experience with CVS early in life results in elevated ethanol intake later in adulthood. Taken\u00a0together, these results emphasize the important role of early stress experiences that modulate later voluntary ethanol intake during adulthood.",

The rats\u2019 anxiety-related behavior was then assessed on reaching mid adulthood at PND120 in a light\u2013dark box and an open field. For males only, alcohol alone led to increased entries of the light\u2013dark box and (compared with water- or caffeine-exposed subjects) open-field rearing. Alcohol and caffeine combined also increased entries of the light\u2013dark box light compartment and open-field ambulation for males only. The drug combination led to more male ambulation than for alcohol alone, and higher occupancy of the center squares of the apparatus than for males in any other group. Although alcohol alone had no subsequent effects on female behavior, alcohol and caffeine combined led to fewer entries of and less time spent in the light\u2013dark box side then females in any other group. The drug combination also led to less female ambulation in the open field compared with either water- or caffeine-exposed females. The results were interpreted as sex-related potentiation by caffeine of alcohol\u2019s developmental effects that resulted in lower levels of adult anxiety in male, but higher levels in females. The possible significance of this outcome for humans, especially females, was discussed.",

     "abstract": "N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated ion channels activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. These channels are highly expressed by brain neurons and are critically involved in excitatory synaptic transmission. Results from previous studies show that both native and recombinant NMDA receptors are inhibited by ethanol at concentrations associated with signs of behavioral impairment and intoxication. Given the important role that NMDA receptors play in synaptic transmission and brain function, it is important to understand the factors that regulate the ethanol inhibition of these receptors. One dynamic mechanism for regulating ethanol action may be via phosphorylation of NMDA subunits by serine\u2013threonine and tyrosine kinases. Both NR1 and NR2 subunits contain multiple sites of phosphorylation; and in the NR1 subunit, most of these are contained within the C1 domain, a carboxy-terminal cassette that is subject to alternative splicing. Although results from our previous studies suggest that single phosphorylation sites do not greatly affect ethanol sensitivity of NMDA receptors, it is likely that in vivo, these subunits are phosphorylated at multiple sites by different kinases. In the present study, we constructed a series of NMDA receptor mutants at serine (S) or threonine (T) residues proposed to be sites of phosphorylation by protein kinase A and various isoforms of protein kinase C. Ethanol (100\u00a0mM) inhibited currents from wild-type NR1/2A and NR1/2B receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells by approximately 25 and 30%, respectively. This inhibition was not different in single-site mutants expressing alanine (A) or aspartate/glutamate (D/E) at positions T879, S896, or T900. The mutant NR1(S890D) showed greater ethanol inhibition than NR1(890A) containing receptors, although this was only observed when it was combined with the NR2A subunit. Ethanol inhibition was not altered by aspartate substitution at four serines (positions 889, 890, 896, and 897) or when T879D was added to the four serine-substituted mutant. Ethanol inhibition was increased when T900E was added to the five serine-/threonine-substituted mutants, but again this was selective for NR2A containing receptors. Together with previously published data, these findings suggest that modification of putative phosphorylation sites could contribute to the overall acute ethanol sensitivity of recombinant NMDA receptors.

     "abstract": "Moderate intake of alcoholic beverages decreases the incidence of cardiovascular pathologies, but it is in dispute if cardioprotective effects are due to ethanol, to polyphenolic compounds present in beverages or to a combination of both. In humans, effects of high, moderate, and low doses of alcoholic beverages are widely studied, but effects of pure alcohol remain unclear. On the other hand, experiments with laboratory animals are centered on high toxicological doses of ethanol but not on low doses. In the present study, we have aimed to mimic in the rat the pattern of alcohol intake in Mediterranean population. Alcohol ingestion is spread along the day and not always related to solid food consumption. We tried to define the beneficial and harmful effects of pure ethanol ingestion without polyphenol\u2019s influence. Experimental rats were given 1% ethanol in their drinking water for 30 days, resulting in a daily ingestion of 0.27\u00a0mL of ethanol/rat/d. Ethanol ingestion did not cause deleterious effects on the general status of the animals, but it decreased cholesterol, triglycerides, and catecholamine stores\u2019 rate of utilization in peripheral sympathetic system. Moreover, ethanol lowered pulmonary arterial pressure and did not alter systemic arterial pressure. In the liver, the reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio was augmented and lipid peroxide, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were decreased. However, catalase activity was unaltered. Liver cytochrome P4502E1 distribution and protein level and activity were unchanged by ethanol ingestion. Data indicate a lack of harmful effects and underscore a set of potentially beneficial effects of this dose of ethanol.",

Adult bone marrow\u2013derived stromal cells (BMSCs) and adipose tissue\u2013derived stromal cells (ASCs) likely contribute to bone homeostasis and formation. Direct and indirect alcohol exposure inhibits osteoprogenitor cell function through a variety of proposed mechanisms. The goal of this study was to characterize the effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on the native number and in vitro growth characteristics and multipotentiality of adult BMSCs and ASCs in a rat model. Adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats received a liquid diet containing 36% ethanol or an isocaloric substitution of dextramaltose (control). After 4, 8, or 12 weeks of the diet, ASCs were harvested from epididymal adipose tissue and BMSCs from femoral and tibial bone marrow. Cell doublings (CDs) per day and doubling times (DTs) were determined for primary cells (P0) and cell passages 1 through 6 (P1\u2013P6). Fibroblastic (CFU-F), adipogenic (CFU-Ad), and osteogenic (CFU-Ob) colony-forming unit (CFU) frequencies were assessed for P0, P3, and P6. The CDs and DTs were lower and higher, respectively, for ASCs and BMSCs harvested from ethanol versus control rats at all time points. The CFU-F, CFU-Ad, and CFU-Ob were significantly higher in ASCs harvested from control versus ethanol rats for P0, P3, and P6 at all times. Both CFU-Ad and CFU-Ob were significantly higher in P0 BMSCs harvested from control versus ethanol rats after 12 weeks of the diet. The CFU-Ob for P3 BMSCs from control rats was significantly higher than those from ethanol rats after 8 and 12 weeks on the diet. All three CFU frequencies in ASCs from ethanol rats tended to decrease with increasing diet duration. The ASC cell and colony morphology was different between control and ethanol cohorts in culture. These results emphasize the significant detrimental effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on the in vitro expansion and multipotentiality of adult mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Maintenance of the effects through multiple cell passages in vitro suggests cells may be permanently compromised.",

Both acute and chronic alcohol consumption may affect spermatozoal chromatin disorders through apoptosis. Therefore, for the first time, this experimental study was performed to evaluate the effect of ethanol consumption on sperm parameters and chromatin integrity of spermatozoa aspirated from cauda epididymis of rats. Twenty adult Wistar rats were divided into ethanol consumption and control groups. Access to ethanol and water was provided ad libitum for experimental and control animals, respectively. The cauda epididymal spermatozoa were aspirated for analysis of sperm parameters and sperm chromatin integrity with aniline blue (AB), chromomycin A3 (CMA3), toluidine blue (TB), and acridine orange (AO) assays. Sperm progressive and nonprogressive motility of ethanol-consuming rats were significantly decreased compared with control animals (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). In addition, the rates of AB-reacted spermatozoa were similar in both groups (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05).

The results showed that ethanol consumption disturbs sperm motility, nuclear maturity and DNA integrity of spermatozoa in rat. Therefore, ethanol abuse results in the production of spermatozoa with less condensed chromatin, and this may be one possible cause of infertility following ethanol consumption.",

After 40 and 60\u00a0min of incubation, glucose (20\u00a0mM) and carbamoylcholine (200\u00a0\u03bcM), respectively, were introduced into the chambers. The absolute and percent increase in short-circuit current (Isc) and potential difference (Vt) induced by glucose were increased significantly with 0.1% ethanol. There was no significant effect of 0.1% ethanol on carbamoylcholine-induced electrophysiological variables. To investigate if higher levels of ethanol have similar effects, we tested the effects of 0, 0.33, and 0.66% ethanol under similar experimental conditions until the glucose-addition step. Contrary to 0.1% ethanol, both the 0.33 and 0.66% ethanol levels significantly decreased the basal and glucose-induced Isc and Vt. Tissue conductivity remained unaffected in all cases. These results indicate that intestinal epithelia of chicken may be more sensitive to the effects of ethanol as compared with other species.

The aim of this study was to assess whether platelet 5-HT concentration is altered in alcoholic patients with or without suicide attempt. Platelet 5-HT concentration was evaluated in 397 male and 108 female ethnically homogenous medication-free patients with alcoholism, subdivided according to smoking status, comorbid depression, and a history of suicide attempt and in 450 male and 139 female healthy control (nonsuicidal) subjects. Suicide attempt was assessed by two measures: according to the score 4 on the item 3 from the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and according to the Structured Clinical Interview regarding suicidal attempt during lifetime. Both male and female patients with alcoholism who were nonsmokers had significantly lower platelet 5-HT concentration than the corresponding healthy subjects. Multifactor analyses of variance revealed the significant effects of alcoholism and smoking, but the lack of significant effects of suicide attempt, sex, or comorbid depression, and no interactions between variables, on platelet 5-HT concentration. Platelet 5-HT concentration did not differ significantly between suicidal patients compared with nonsuicidal patients with alcoholism. Because the results from the present study showed similar platelet 5-HT values between patients with or without a history of suicide attempt, our data did not support the hypothesis that platelet 5-HT concentration might be used as a peripheral marker of the pronounced suicidal behavior in alcoholism.",

Adjusted incidence rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. In subjects who reported to have consumed equal amounts of total alcohol both 5 years before baseline and at baseline, drinkers of \u226530\u00a0g of alcohol per day with the ADH1C*2/*2 genotype were associated\u2014although not statistically significant\u2014with an increased risk of CRC relative to abstainers with the ADH1C*1/*1 genotype (RR: 1.91, 95% CI: 0.68, 5.34).

Also presented are the differences between the two centers in terms of mechanisms and types of injuries and the locations where these injuries were sustained. Alcohol was involved in 34.78 and 30.77% of patients at Westmead and Birmingham, respectively. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a reduced likelihood of alcohol involvement in episodes of maxillofacial trauma where patients were unemployed (P\u00a0=\u00a0.04), and where injuries were sustained secondary to mechanisms other than assault (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and in locations other than pubs and nightclubs (P\u00a0=\u00a0.024). There appeared to be no statistically significant contribution to the likelihood of alcohol involvement by treating center, marital status, patient sex, or age. Alcohol continues to be a strong driving factor in cases of maxillofacial trauma, particularly those due to alleged assault, with a typical patient demographic of the gainfully employed frequenting drinking establishments being most at risk for alcohol-related trauma, most commonly sustaining their injuries secondary to assault. Identifying patient groups most at risk is a key step in developing public health strategies aimed at prevention, and our findings would appear to suggest this group of patients as being the most worthwhile to target with measures aimed at reducing alcohol-fueled maxillofacial trauma.",

     "abstract": "A relevant number of trauma patients are intoxicated with alcohol at admission in trauma centers. Meanwhile, some studies provide data suggesting a profound influence of ethanol on the posttraumatic clinical course; others could not confirm these findings. Knowledge of the influence of ethanol in a multiple trauma cohort is lacking. Therefore, we performed a retrospective outcome study of initially intoxicated multiple trauma patients in a German level-1 trauma center. Patients with an Injury Severity Score greater than or equal to 16 and aged 16\u201365 years were included in our study. Ventilation time, duration of intensive care unit treatment, the course of cytokines, and the incidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were analyzed. Total in-patient time, mortality, and the requirement for blood products were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were performed. Injury severity was comparable in both groups but there were more severe abdominal injuries in alcohol-intoxicated patients. The clinical course was comparable in both groups. Alcohol consumption was not an independent risk factor to sustain SIRS (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59\u20131.70), sepsis (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.54\u20131.31), or for mortality (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.53\u20132.13). There was a trend toward an increased incidence of MODS in alcohol-intoxicated patients (OR, 2.74; 95% CI, 0.90\u20138.35).Blood alcohol level at the time of admission is not a valuable marker for worse or improved outcome in multiple trauma patients. There were no ethanol-related differences concerning overall injury severity; however, more severe abdominal injuries were found in alcohol-intoxicated patients. There was no increased risk for posttraumatic complications in primarily alcohol\u2013intoxicated multiple trauma patients.",

This study investigated the prevalence and biological significance of IgE antibodies to N-glycans from wine glycoproteins in heavy drinkers. A structured questionnaire, skin prick tests, serum IgE levels, IgE-immunoblotting to wine extracts, and basophil activation tests were used to characterize 20 heavy drinkers and 10 control subjects. Eleven heavy drinkers (55%) showed IgE binding to proteins in wine extracts. The proteins were identified by mass spectrometry as grape-derived vacuolar invertase and thaumatin-like protein. Immunoblot reactivity was closely associated with the presence of IgE to CCDs and was inhibited by preincubation with a glycoconjugate containing bromelain-type N-glycans. The same conjugate, CCD-bearing allergens, and wine extracts activated basophils in patients with high-titer CCD-specific IgE but not in healthy controls. There was no relationship between immunoblot reactivity and consumption of any specific type of wine. No patient reported symptoms of hypersensitivity to Hymenoptera venom, food, or wine. In conclusion, heavy drinkers frequently show IgE reactivity to the N-glycans of wine glycoproteins. Glycans and wine glycoprotein extracts can induce basophil activation in sensitized alcoholics. The clinical significance of these findings remains to be elucidated.",

Several studies have demonstrated that increases of NPY are associated with reduced alcohol intake and anxiety manifestations. The Leu7Pro polymorphism in the NPY has been associated with alcohol consumption, but evidence is scarce. In the Spanish Mediterranean population, this variant is not polymorphic. Thus, our aim is to identify novel functional variants in the NPY and to investigate the impact of these markers and others previously described on alcohol consumption in this population. A total of 911 subjects (321 men and 590 women) from the Spanish Mediterranean population were recruited. Alcohol consumption, and demographic and lifestyle variables were measured. Nucleotide sequence determination and SNP analyses were carried out. Only one exonic SNP was detected by direct sequencing (1258 G>A or rs9785023; allele frequency 0.47). From the intronic markers chosen (483 A>G or rs13235938, 2517 A>G or rs4722342, and 7065 A>G or rs4722343), only the two latter ones were polymorphic (allele frequencies 0.46 and 0.04, respectively), and none of them were associated with alcohol consumption.

Rats selectively bred for high alcohol preference (P rats) appear to be particularly sensitive to the behavioral effects of NPY. The dual purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effects of intraventricular NPY on (1) the acoustic startle response (ASR) of P rats in a high-anxiety setting and (2) social interaction behavior of P rats. In experiment 1, P rats were either cycled through periods of long-term ethanol access and abstinence or they remained ethanol naive. Rats were injected with one of four NPY doses and tested for ASR before and after footshock stress. NPY suppressed ASR in all P rats regardless of shock condition or drinking history. In experiment 2, rats received intraventricular infusion of one of four NPY doses and were then injected with either ethanol (0.75\u00a0g/kg) or saline and tested for social interaction. NPY increased social interaction in P rats even at doses that suppressed locomotor activity, regardless of ethanol dose. Suppression of anxiety-like and arousal behaviors by NPY in the present study confirm a role for NPY in alcohol-related behaviors in alcohol-preferring P rats.",

     "abstract": "A functional connection between the circadian timing system and alcohol consumption is suggested by multiple lines of converging evidence. Ethanol consumption perturbs physiological rhythms in hormone secretion, sleep, and body temperature; and conversely, genetic and environmental perturbations of the circadian system can alter alcohol intake. A fundamental property of the circadian pacemaker, the endogenous period of its cycle under free-running conditions, was previously shown to differ between selectively bred high- (HAP) and low- (LAP) alcohol preferring replicate 1 mice. To test whether there is a causal relationship between circadian period and ethanol intake, we induced experimental, rather than genetic, variations in free-running period. Male inbred C57Bl/6J mice and replicate 2 male and female HAP2 and LAP2 mice were entrained to light:dark cycles of 26 or 22\u00a0h or remained in a standard 24\u00a0h cycle. On discontinuation of the light:dark cycle, experimental animals exhibited longer and shorter free-running periods, respectively. Despite robust effects on circadian period and clear circadian rhythms in drinking, these manipulations failed to alter the daily ethanol intake of the inbred strain or selected lines. Likewise, driving the circadian system at long and short periods produced no change in alcohol intake. In contrast with replicate 1\u00a0HAP and LAP lines, there was no difference in free-running period between ethanol na\u00efve HAP2 and LAP2 mice. HAP2 mice, however, were significantly more active than LAP2 mice as measured by general home\u2013cage movement and wheel running, a motivated behavior implicating a selection effect on reward systems. Despite a marked circadian regulation of drinking behavior, the free-running and entrained period of the circadian clock does not determine daily ethanol intake.",

     "abstract": "The endocrine disruption associated with alcohol (ethanol) abuse in both males and females is widely recognized. Ethanol intoxication and withdrawal in males results in significant reductions in androgen levels. Less is known about female alcoholics, and because the changes in testosterone concentrations remain controversial, we systematically characterized changes in sex steroids after chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal in both sexes. Testosterone and 17\u03b2-estradiol concentrations were determined during chronic high intoxication, over a withdrawal time course, and following a period of abstinence using a genetic model of withdrawal vulnerability, the Withdrawal Seizure-Resistant (WSR) and -Prone (WSP) selected lines. In males, testosterone concentrations were significantly lower in intoxicated WSP mice after chronic ethanol exposure, and were dramatically and transiently reduced during the withdrawal period in both WSR and WSP lines. In contrast, testosterone levels were increased in intoxicated WSP females and in both WSR and WSP mice during withdrawal. Chronic ethanol exposure disrupted normal estrous cycling in WSP mice, associated with hyperandrogenemia while intoxicated. In abstinence, elevated testosterone was observed in both sexes but only in WSR mice. Estrogen levels were modestly reduced during withdrawal in both WSR and WSP lines, predominantly in males. These findings identify a mechanism based on altered androgen signaling that likely contributes to sex-specific responses during withdrawal. However, only WSR mice showed similar elevations in androgen long after withdrawal in both sexes, suggesting that genotype is an important determinant of steroid responses after abstinence. Increased androgen signaling in females as a consequence of chronic ethanol exposure may play an important and relatively uncharacterized role in sexually dimorphic responses to alcohol abuse.",

     "abstract": "Glial-derived transforming growth factor alpha (TGF\u03b1) activates the erbB1/erbB2 receptor complex on adjacent glial cells in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH). This receptor activation stimulates the synthesis and release of prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) from the glial cells, which then induces the release of prepubertal luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion from nearby nerve terminals; thus, showing the importance of glial\u2013neuronal communications at the time of puberty. Ethanol (EtOH) is known to cause depressed prepubertal LHRH secretion and delayed pubertal development. In this study, we assessed whether short-term EtOH exposure could alter the hypothalamic glial to glial signaling components involved in prepubertal PGE2 secretion. Immature female rats began receiving control or EtOH diets beginning when 27 days old. The animals were killed by decapitation after 4 and 6 days of treatment and confirmed to be in the late juvenile stage of development. Blood and brain tissues were collected for gene, protein, and hormonal assessments. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis demonstrated that EtOH did not affect basal levels of erbB1 gene expression in the MBH. Expression of total erbB1 protein was also unaffected; however, the EtOH caused suppressed phosphorylation of erbB1 protein in the MBH at both 4 and 6 days (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) as revealed by Western blotting. Phosphorylation and total protein levels of erbB2 receptor were not affected by EtOH exposure. Because this receptor is critical for PGE2 synthesis/release, which mediates the secretion of LHRH, we assessed whether in vivo EtOH exposure could affect the release of PGE2. EtOH exposure for 6 days suppressed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) basal levels of PGE2 released into the medium. The effects of 4- and 6-day EtOH exposure on gene and protein expressions of TGF\u03b1, an upstream component in the activation of erbB1/erbB2, were also studied. The levels of TGF\u03b1 mRNA were increased markedly at 4 days (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but declined to near basal levels by 6 days in the EtOH-treated animals. The EtOH caused increases in TGF\u03b1 protein expression at both 4 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 6 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) days; hence, suggesting that the EtOH inhibited release of the peptide. We confirmed this inhibition by showing decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) TGF\u03b1 released from MBHs incubated in vitro following 6\u00a0days of EtOH exposure in vivo. Thus, these results demonstrate that EtOH is capable of interfering with hypothalamic glial to glial signaling processes involved in prepubertal PGE2 secretion.",

Generally, such a behavior tends to be confined to the weekends, to attain frequently binge drinking. This study in peripubertal male rats compares the effect of the discontinuous feeding of a liquid diet containing a moderate amount of ethanol (6.2% wt/vol) to that of continuous ethanol administration or a control diet, taking as end points the 24-h variations of plasma prolactin levels and mitogenic responses and lymphocyte subset populations in submaxillary lymph nodes and spleen. Animals received the ethanol liquid diet starting on day 35 of life, the diet being similar to that given to controls except for that maltose was isocalorically replaced by ethanol. Ethanol provided 36% of the total caloric content. Every week, the discontinuous ethanol group received the ethanol diet for 3 days and the control liquid diet for the remaining 4 days. After 4 weeks, rats were killed at six time intervals, beginning at 0900\u00a0h. A significant decrease of splenic cells\u2019 response to concanavalin A, and of lymph node and splenic cells\u2019 response to lipopolysaccharide was found in rats under the discontinuous ethanol regime, when compared with control- or ethanol-chronic rats. Under discontinuous ethanol feeding, mean values of lymph node and splenic CD8+ and CD4+-CD8+cells decreased, whereas those of lymph node and splenic T cells, and splenic B cells, augmented. In rats chronically fed with ethanol, splenic mean levels of CD8+ and CD4+-CD8+cells augmented. Both modalities of ethanol administration disrupted the 24\u00a0h variation in immune function seen in controls. Mean plasma prolactin levels increased by 3.6-fold and 8.5-fold in rats chronically or discontinuously fed with alcohol, respectively. The immune parameters examined in an additional group of rats fed regular chow and water ad libitum did not differ significantly from control liquid diet. The results support the view that the discontinuous drinking of a moderate amount of ethanol can be more harmful for the immune system than a continuous ethanol intake, presumably by inducing a greater stress as indicated by the augmented plasma prolactin levels observed.",

FAEE in meconium has been recommended as useful and cost-effective for universal screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. To support an efficient universal screening program, an analytical method to detect and quantify FAEE in meconium needs to be accurate, inexpensive, and rapid. The purpose of this study was to develop an analytical method that would satisfy these criteria and to validate this method using established laboratory guidelines. A method was developed and validated to detect and quantify four FAEEs (ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl oleate, and ethyl stearate) from 0.5\u00a0g of meconium using d5-ethyl esters as internal standards. The sample undergoes liquid\u2013liquid extraction with heptane:acetone, the heptane layer is isolated and evaporated, and then, the resulting residue undergoes headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. The detection limits of the four FAEEs ranged from 0.020 to 0.042\u00a0nmol/g and are 6- to 25-fold lower than the individual FAEE threshold concentrations (0.5\u00a0nmol/g). This method also has good precision with the coefficient of variation ranging from 2.6 to 19.4% for concentrations of individual FAEE between 0.5 and 2.62\u00a0nmol/g meconium (n\u00a0=\u00a04). Calculated concentrations of FAEE that underwent extraction from meconium were 100\u2013101% of the expected concentration, demonstrating the accuracy of the method. The peak shape and retention time of each FAEE were unaffected by the presence of the matrix, and there is no carryover at clinically relevant concentrations. This method was also able to produce clean chromatograms from meconium samples that could not be quantified using a previous method because of high chromatographic background. This method provides an optimal approach to detecting and quantifying FAEE in meconium that could be used in a universal screening program for prenatal alcohol exposure.",

When an ELISA assay is performed on cell culture supernatants, samples often contain the treatment agents. The purpose of the present study was to determine if some of the agents evaluated might inhibit cytokine detection by interfering with the ELISA, leaving the question of whether cytokine production was inhibited unanswered. Mouse and human cytokine ELISA kits from BD Biosciences were used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Cytokine proteins were subjected to one to five carbon alcohols at 86.8\u00a0mM (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol). After treating cell cultures with alcohols of different carbon chain lengths, we found that some of the alcohols interfered with measurement of some cytokines by ELISA, thus making their effects on cytokine production by cells in culture unclear. Increasing carbon chain length of straight chain alcohols positively correlated with their ability to inhibit detection of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), but not with the detection of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8, (IL-8), and interleukin 12 (IL-12). To avoid misinterpretation of treatment effects, ELISA assays should be tested with the reference protein and the treatment agent first, before testing biological samples. These results along with other recent results we obtained using circular dichroism indicate that alcohols with two or more carbons can directly alter protein conformation enough to disrupt binding in an ELISA (shown in the present study) or to inhibit ligand-induced conformational changes (results not shown). Such direct effects have not been given enough consideration as a mechanism of ethanol action in the immune system.",

Our previous studies have demonstrated that the zebrafish, an animal model used currently to study genetics and development related to a variety of human diseases, is also sensitive to pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol. Sensitivity to ethanol in the zebrafish can be easily gauged with a simple nonintrusive behavioral test that measures ethanol-related alterations in schooling by determining the distance between each fish and its nearest neighbor. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gender on the strain-specific ethanol sensitivity that we had observed previously. One hundred and sixty zebrafish of the wild-type (WT) and the long fin striped (LFS) strains were equally divided by gender for use in this study. For acute ethanol treatment, the fish were separated by gender and strain and exposed to 0.0, 0.125, 0.25 0.50, or 1.0% (vol/vol) ethanol. In the chronic study, eight fish of each strain and gender were exposed to 0.5% (vol/vol) ethanol for a period of 10 weeks and the swimming behavior tested before treatment and after each week of treatment. Results showed that female WT zebrafish displayed enhanced sensitivity to the effects of chronic ethanol exposure of increased nearest neighbor distances, whereas male and female LFS fish were not significantly affected by chronic ethanol exposure. Results of the acute ethanol study showed a dose-dependent effect in both strains and a gender effect that needs to be further investigated before enhanced female sensitivity to acute ethanol can be verified.",

Animals received stereotaxic injections of viral vectors expressing either 5-HT1B receptor and green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP alone. Home cages equipped with a three-bottle (water and 6 and 12% ethanol) lickometer system recorded animals\u2019 drinking behaviors continuously, capturing either initiation or maintenance of drinking behavior patterns. Overexpression of 5-HT1B receptors during initiation increased consumption of 12% ethanol during both forced-access and free-choice consumption. There was a shift in drinking pattern for 6% ethanol with an increase in number of drinking bouts per day, although the total number of drinking bouts for 12% ethanol was not different. Finally, increased 5-HT1B expression induced more bouts with very high\u2013frequency licking from the ethanol bottle sippers. During the maintenance phase of drinking, there were no differences between groups in total volume of ethanol consumed; however, there was a shift toward drinking bouts of longer duration, especially for 12% ethanol. This suggests that during maintenance drinking, increased 5-HT1B receptors facilitate longer drinking bouts of more modest volumes. Taken together, these results indicate that 5-HT1B receptors expressed on NAcSh projection neurons facilitate ethanol drinking, with different effects during initiation and maintenance of ethanol-drinking behavior.",

The purpose of the present studies was to determine the effects of pharmacological manipulation of the opioidergic, glutamatergic, and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems on binge drinking with the SHAC procedure. Parallel manipulations were conducted in mice trained in operant self-administration of either sucrose or ethanol. For the SHAC procedure, genetically heterogeneous Withdrawal Seizure Control mice were given varying periods of fluid access, with a 30-min ethanol session every third day (total of seven). Mice were pretreated intraperitoneally with naltrexone (0, 0.6, or 1.25\u00a0mg/kg), baclofen (0, 2.5, or 5.0\u00a0mg/kg), or 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP; 0, 3.0, or 10.0\u00a0mg/kg) before each ethanol session. For the operant self-administration procedure, separate groups of C57BL/6 mice were trained to complete a single response requirement (16 presses on the active lever) to gain 30\u00a0min of access to an ethanol or a sucrose solution. Mice received pretreatments of the same doses of naltrexone, MPEP, or baclofen before the self-administration sessions, with saline injections on intervening days. Naltrexone produced a dose-dependent decrease in binge drinking, and the highest dose also significantly decreased operant self-administration of ethanol and sucrose. Both doses of baclofen significantly decreased binge alcohol consumption, but the higher dose also tended to decrease water intake. The highest dose of baclofen also significantly decreased operant self-administration of sucrose. MPEP (10\u00a0mg/kg) significantly decreased binge alcohol consumption and sucrose self-administration. These results indicate that manipulation of the opioidergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic systems significantly decreased binge drinking.",

Low to moderate ethanol doses (0.5 and 2.0\u00a0g/kg, intragastrically [i.g.]) induce single-trial, appetitive second-order place conditioning (SOC) in adolescent, but not adult, rats. Recent studies have demonstrated that adolescents may be less sensitive than adults to the aversive properties of ethanol, reflected by conditioned taste aversion. The present study assessed the aversive motivational effects of high-dose ethanol (3.0 and 3.25\u00a0g/kg, i.g., for adolescents and adults, respectively) using SOC. Experiment 1 revealed similar blood and brain ethanol levels in adolescent and adult rats given 3.0 and 3.25\u00a0g/kg ethanol, respectively. In Experiment 2, animals received ethanol or vehicle paired with intraoral pulses of sucrose (conditioned stimulus 1 [CS1]). After one, two, or three conditioning trials, the rats were presented with the CS1 while in a distinctive chamber (CS2). When tested for CS2 preference, ethanol-treated animals exhibited reduced preference for the CS2 compared with controls. This result, indicative of ethanol-mediated aversive place conditioning, was similar for adolescents and adults; for females and males; and after one, two, or three training trials. In conjunction with previous results, the present study showed that, in adolescent rats subjected to SOC, ethanol\u2019s hedonic effects vary from appetitive to aversive as the ethanol dose increases. Adolescent and adult animals appear to perceive the postingestive effects of high-dose ethanol as similarly aversive when assessed by SOC.",

     "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading cause of childhood neurodevelopmental disability. The adverse behavioral effects of alcohol exposure during the second and third trimester are well documented; less clear is whether early first trimester-equivalent exposures also alter behavior. We investigated this question using an established chick model of alcohol exposure. In ovo embryos experienced a single, acute ethanol exposure that spanned gastrulation through neuroectoderm induction and early brain patterning (19\u201322\u00a0h incubation). At 7 days posthatch, the chicks were evaluated for reflexive motor function (wingflap extension, righting reflex), fearfulness (tonic immobility [TI]), and fear/social reinstatement (open-field behavior). Chicks exposed to a peak ethanol level of 0.23\u20130.28% were compared against untreated and saline-treated controls. Birds receiving early ethanol exposure had a normal righting reflex and a significantly reduced wingflap extension in response to a sudden descent. The ethanol-treated chicks also displayed heightened fearfulness, reflected in increased frequency of TI, and they required significantly fewer trials for its induction. In an open-field test, ethanol treatment did not affect latency to move, steps taken, vocalizations, defecations, or escape attempts. The current findings demonstrate that early ethanol exposure can increase fearfulness and impair aspects of motor function. Importantly, the observed dysfunctions resulted from an acute ethanol exposure during the period when the major brain components are induced and patterned. The equivalent period in human development is 3\u20134 weeks postconception. The current findings emphasize that ethanol exposure during the early first trimester equivalent can produce neurodevelopmental disability in the offspring.",

We have previously shown that genomic imprinting may play a role in differential sensitivity between B6 and D2. The best-characterized mechanism mediating genomic imprinting is differential DNA methylation. In the present study we examined DNA methylation and gene expression, in both embryonic and placental tissue, at the mouse Igf2 locus following in utero ethanol exposure. We also examined the effects of a methyl-supplemented diet on methylation and ethanol teratogenesis. In embryos from susceptible B6 mice, we found small decreases in DNA methylation at four CpG sites in one of the differentially methylated regions of the Igf2 locus; only one of the four sites showed a statistically significant decrease. We observed no significant decreases in methylation in placentae. All Igf2 transcripts showed approximately 1.5-fold decreases following intrauterine alcohol exposure. Placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet before pregnancy and throughout gestation brought methylation back up to control levels. Methyl supplementation also resulted in lower prenatal mortality, greater prenatal growth, and decreased digit malformations; it dramatically reduced vertebral malformations. Thus, although prenatal alcohol had only small effects on DNA methylation at the Igf2 locus, placing dams on a methyl-supplemented diet partially ameliorated ethanol teratogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The biology of placental and fetal development suggests that alcohol may play a significant role in increasing the risk of feto-infant morbidity and mortality, but study results are inconsistent and the mechanism remains poorly defined. Previous studies have not examined the risk of placenta-associated syndromes (PASs: defined as the occurrence of either placental abruption, placenta previa, preeclampsia, small for gestational age, preterm, or stillbirth) as a unique entity. Therefore, we sought to examine the relationship between prenatal alcohol use and the risk of PAS among singleton births in the Missouri maternally linked data files covering the period 1989\u20132005. Logistic regression with adjustment for intracluster correlation was used to generate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with nondrinkers, drinkers were more likely to be smokers, 35 years of age or older, black, and multiparous. Drinkers had an increased risk of PAS (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.26, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.22,1.31) when compared with their nondrinking counterparts. The risk of PAS was progressively amplified with increasing prenatal alcohol consumption (P for trend <.01). Women who reported consuming five or more alcoholic drinks per week had more than twofold increased risk of PASs, whereas women in the lowest drinking category (one to two drinks per week) had only a slight increased risk of PAS (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05, 1.14). Enhanced understanding of the mechanism by which prenatal alcohol consumption leads to PAS may aid in the development of more targeted interventions designed to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Screening women for alcohol use may assist providers in protecting developing fetuses from the potential dangers of prenatal alcohol use.",

     "abstract": "Detecting patterns of maternal drinking that place fetuses at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) is critical to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention but is challenging because information on antenatal drinking collected during pregnancy is often insufficient or lacking. Although retrospective assessments have been considered less favored by many researchers due to presumed poor reliability, this perception may be inaccurate because of reduced maternal denial and/or distortion. The present study hypothesized that fetal alcohol exposure, as assessed retrospectively during child adolescence, would be related significantly to prior measures of maternal drinking and would predict alcohol-related behavioral problems in teens better than antenatal measures of maternal alcohol consumption. Drinking was assessed during pregnancy, and retrospectively about the same pregnancy, at a 14-year follow-up in 288 African-American women using well-validated semistructured interviews. Regression analysis examined the predictive validity of both drinking assessments on pregnancy outcomes and on teacher-reported teen behavior outcomes. Retrospective maternal self-reported drinking assessed 14 years postpartum was significantly higher than antenatal reports of consumption. Retrospective report identified 10.8 times more women as risk drinkers (\u2265 one drink per day) than the antenatal report. Antenatal and retrospective reports were moderately correlated and both were correlated with the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy based on retrospective report identified significantly more teens exposed prenatally to at-risk alcohol levels than antenatal, in-pregnancy reports. Retrospective report predicted more teen behavior problems (e.g., attention problems and externalizing behaviors) than the antenatal report. Antenatal report predicted younger gestational age at birth and retrospective report predicted smaller birth size; neither predicted teen IQ. These results suggest that if only antenatal, in-pregnancy maternal report is used, then a substantial proportion of children exposed prenatally to risk levels of alcohol might be misclassified. The validity of retrospective assessment of prior drinking during pregnancy as a more effective indicator of prenatal exposure was established by predicting more behavioral problems in teens than antenatal report. Retrospective report can provide valid information about drinking during a prior pregnancy and may facilitate diagnosis and subsequent interventions by educators, social service personnel, and health-care providers, thereby reducing the life-long impact of FASDs.",

The widely used T-ACE screen has been applied in various ways, although the impact of those different uses on effectiveness is uncertain. We examined relations among different T-ACE scoring criteria, maternal drinking, and child outcome. Self-reported across-pregnancy maternal drinking was assessed in 75 African-American women. The different T-ACE criteria used varied the level of drinking that defined tolerance (two or three drinks) and the total T-ACE score cut-points (two or three). Receiver operator curves and regression analysis assessed the significance of relations. Increasing the total T-ACE score cut-point to 3 almost doubled specificity in detecting risk drinking whereas maintaining adequate sensitivity, equivalent to that in the original report, and identified substantially more neurobehavioral deficits in children. Redefining tolerance at three drinks did not improve T-ACE effectiveness in predicting outcomes. This study is among the first to show the ability of an in-pregnancy T-ACE assessment to predict child neurodevelopmental outcome. In addition, increasing the total T-ACE score criterion (from 2\u00a0to 3) improved identification of non-drinking mothers and unaffected children with little loss in detection of drinkers and affected\u00a0children. Efficient in-pregnancy screens for risk drinking afford greater opportunities for intervention that could prevent/limit FASDs.",

All subjects were seen for evaluation in the genetic/dysmorphology clinics, which are funded by the state to provide genetic diagnostic services for residents of North Dakota. We compared the clinical diagnosis and the FASDC scores to determine the performance characteristics of the FASDC in the categorical diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum (FAS), other-FASD, and a group with No-FASD. Comparisons were made using univariate and logistic models of outcomes using both the presence and the absence of alcohol exposure or FASDC phenotype data. The FASDC performance characteristics for differentiation of the FAS group from non-FASD were excellent (accuracy 99%, sensitivity 99%, and specificity 99%). Logistic models for subjects with scores in the FASD range were differentiated with an accuracy of 82%, sensitivity 85%, and specificity 80% using the data on phenotype and exposure. We were able to delineate subjects with scores in the No-FASD range with an accuracy of 78%, sensitivity 64%, and specificity 81% without including the exposure and phenotype data by use of the other descriptive data (maternal characteristics, birth records, and demographic data) from the FASDC. All diagnostic tools should have performance characteristics assessed and available before adoption for use in clinical settings.

Meconium and hair analyses for the presence of other drugs of abuse were obtained for some of these neonates and the rates of drug exposure were compared with the rates in a cohort of neonates who were tested negative (FAEE below 2\u00a0nmol per gram meconium) for ethanol exposure (n\u00a0=\u00a0622). Odds ratios (ORs) for various drugs were calculated with ethanol exposure. A 15.5% positive rate for intrauterine ethanol exposure was detected. A high rate of in utero drug exposure was detected in neonates with and without in utero ethanol exposure, 60.5% versus 62.7% respectively.

We worked with various researchers and research programs in the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CI-FASD) to develop a set of common data dictionaries to describe the data to be collected, including definitions of terms and specification of allowable values. The resulting data dictionaries were the basis for creating a central data repository (CI-FASD Central Repository) and software tools to input and query data. Data entry restrictions ensure that only data that conform to the data dictionaries reach the CI-FASD Central Repository. The result is an effective system for centralized and unified management of the data collected and analyzed by the initiative, including a secure, long-term data repository.

Data on the relative position of 17 morphologic landmarks were obtained from facial scans of children who were classified as either FAS or control. Shape data obtained from the landmarks were analyzed with the methods of geometric morphometrics. Our analyses showed significant directional asymmetry of facial shape, consisting primarily of a shift of midline landmarks to the right and a displacement of the landmarks around the eyes to the left. The asymmetry of FAS and control groups differed significantly and average directional asymmetry was increased in those individuals exposed to alcohol in utero.

However, many children with developmental damage because of prenatal alcohol exposure exhibit none, or only a subset, of the above features, making diagnosis difficult.

Mouse dams were provided alcohol (Alc) consisting of 4.8% (vol/vol) alcohol in a liquid diet for 16 days prepregnancy and chow and water diet during mating, and then the alcohol liquid diet was reinstated on gestational days 7 (E7) to gestational day 17 (E17). Treatment controls included a pair-fed (PF) group given matched volumes of an alcohol-free liquid diet made isocalorically and a group given ad lib access to lab chow and water (Chow). Maternal diet intake (Alc and PF), blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), embryo weights, and 15 morphometric facial measurements for E17 embryos were analyzed. B6N dams drank more alcohol during pregnancy and generated higher BAC than B6J dams. Both the Alc and PF treatments induced significant reductions in embryo weights relative to Chow in both substrains. Alcohol treatments produced significant changes, relative to controls, in 4 of the 15 facial measures for the B6N substrain but only in two measures for the B6J substrain. Discriminant analysis demonstrated successful classification of the alcohol-exposed versus nonalcohol-exposed B6N embryos, with a high sensitivity of 86%, specificity 80%, and overall classification (total correct 83%), whereas B6J mice yielded sensitivity of 80%, specificity 78%, and overall correct classification in 79%. In addition, B6N mice showed significantly more effects of pair feeding on these facial measures than did B6J mice, suggesting that the B6N substrain may be more vulnerable to nutritional stress during pregnancy. Overall, these data indicate that both B6N and B6J mice were vulnerable to alcohol but show differences in the severity and location of alcohol-induced dysmorphic facial features and may parallel findings from human studies comparing different ethnic groups. Furthermore, these findings suggest that discriminant analysis may be useful in predicting alcohol exposure in either mouse substrains.",

     "abstract": "Many children adversely affected by maternal drinking during pregnancy cannot be identified early in life using current diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). We conducted a preliminary investigation to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in placental gene expression may have some utility as a diagnostic indicator of maternal drinking during pregnancy and as a prognostic indicator of risk for adverse neurobehavioral outcomes in affected offspring. Pregnant Long-Evans rats voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 h each day throughout gestation. Ethanol consumption produced a mean maternal daily intermittent peak serum ethanol concentration of 84 mg/dL. Placentas were harvested on gestational day 20 for gene expression studies. Microarray analysis of more than 28,000 genes revealed that the expression of 304 known genes was altered twofold or greater in placenta from ethanol-consuming dams compared with controls. About 76% of these genes were repressed in ethanol-exposed placentas. Gene expression changes involved proteins associated with central nervous system development; organ morphogenesis; immunological responses; endocrine function; ion homeostasis; and skeletal, cardiovascular, and cartilage development. To date, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis has confirmed significant alterations in gene expression for 22 genes, including genes encoding for three calcium binding proteins, two matrix metalloproteinases, the cannabinoid 1, galanin 2 and toll-like receptor 4, iodothyronine deiodinase 2, 11-\u03b2 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, placental growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, gremlin 1, and epithelial growth factor (EGF)-containing extracellular matrix protein. These results suggest that the expression of a sufficiently large number of placental mRNAs is altered after moderate drinking during pregnancy to warrant more detailed investigation of the placenta as a biomarker system for maternal drinking during pregnancy and as an early indicator of FASD. Furthermore, these results provide new insights into novel mechanisms on how ethanol may directly or indirectly mediate its teratogenic effects through alterations in placental function during pregnancy.",

To identify a proteomic signature profile for maternal alcohol consumption, we carried out high-throughput proteomics on maternal endothelial caveolae exposed to moderate binge-like alcohol conditions. In these specialized lipid-ordered microdomains that contain a rich assembly of proteins, we demonstrate that moderate binge-like alcohol resulted in a distinctive maternal caveolar proteomic signature with important proteins being dramatically decreased/knocked out in the alcoholic profile. These proteins span from histones and basic structural proteins like \u03b1 tubulin to proteins involved in trafficking, deubiquitination, cell signaling, and cell\u2013cell adhesion. The profile also suggests an important role for the mother and the uteroplacental compartment in the pathogenesis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).

     "abstract": "N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a derivative of the amino acid l-cysteine, which, previously, has been shown to protect against ethanol-induced apoptosis during early development. Ongoing research demonstrates that NAC is also proving clinically beneficial in reducing oxidative stress\u2013mediated lung, liver, and kidney damage, with protection likely resulting from a NAC-mediated increase in glutathione levels. In the present study, the hypothesis that coadministration of NAC and ethanol by means of liquid diet on days 7 and 8 of pregnancy in mice would reduce ethanol's teratogenicity was tested. For this work, adult nonpregnant female mice were acclimated to a liquid diet containing ethanol for 16 days, withdrawn from the ethanol, bred, and then returned to the liquid diet containing 4.8% ethanol and/or either 0.5 or 1-mg NAC/mL diet on their seventh and eighth days of pregnancy. At the concentrations used, the mice received NAC dosages of approximately 300 or 600\u00a0mg/kg/day and achieved peak blood ethanol concentrations (BEC) that averaged approximately 200\u00a0mg/dL. There was no difference in BEC between the ethanol-alone and ethanol plus 600\u00a0mg/kg NAC group. After maternal euthanasia, gestational day (GD) 14 fetuses were removed, fixed, weighed, and examined for the presence and severity of ocular abnormalities, a readily assessed endpoint that results from GD 7 and 8 ethanol exposures. Although the lower dosage of NAC (300\u00a0mg/kg) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of ocular defects in both the left and right eyes, this reduction was not statistically significant. However, doubling the NAC concentration did yield a significant change; as compared with the group treated with ethanol alone, the incidence of ocular abnormalities was diminished by 22%. These results show the potential of an orally administered compound with proven clinical efficacy to reduce ethanol's teratogenic effects and support the premise that oxidative damage plays an important mechanistic role in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",

RA deficiency may be a causative factor leading to a spectrum of birth defects classified as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Experimental support for this hypothesis using Xenopus showed that effects of treatment with ethanol could be partially rescued by adding retinoids during ethanol treatment. Previous studies show that treating zebrafish embryos during gastrulation and somitogenesis stages with a pathophysiological concentration of ethanol (100\u00a0mM) produces effects that are characteristic features of FASD. We found that treating zebrafish embryos with RA at a low concentration (10\u22129\u00a0M) and 100\u00a0mM ethanol during gastrulation and somitogenesis stages significantly rescued a spectrum of defects produced by treating embryos with 100\u00a0mM ethanol alone. The rescued phenotype that we observed was quantitatively more similar to embryos treated with 10\u22129\u00a0M RA alone (RA toxicity) than to untreated or 100\u00a0mM ethanol-treated embryos. RA rescued defects caused by 100\u00a0mM ethanol treatment during gastrulation and somitogenesis stages that include early gastrulation cell movements (anterior\u2013posterior axis), craniofacial cartilage formation, and ear development. Morphological evidence also suggests that other characteristic features of FASD (e.g., neural axis patterning) are rescued by RA supplement.",

The main goals of this article, therefore, are to summarize published intervention studies of FASD and to present a neurodevelopmental framework, based on recent findings from a number of disciplines, for designing new therapies for alcohol-affected children. This framework assumes a neuroconstructionist view, which posits that reciprocal interactions between neural activity and the brain's hardware lead to the progressive formation of intra- and interregional neural connections. In this view, behavioral interventions can be conceptualized as a series of guided experiences that are designed to produce neural activation. Based on evidence from cognitive neuroscience, it is hypothesized that specific interventions targeting executive attention and self-regulation may produce greater generalizable results than those aimed at domain-specific skills in children with FASD. In view of reciprocal interactions between environmental effects and neural structures, the proposed framework suggests that the maximum effects of interventions can eventually be achieved by optimally combining behavioral methods and cognition-enhancing drugs.",

The etiology has not been elucidated although it is clear that the depressive symptoms may be alcohol independent or alcohol induced. To contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology of chronic ethanol use, we investigated the effects of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure on behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) levels in specific brain regions. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to intermittent ethanol vapor (14\u00a0h on/10\u00a0h off) or air exposure for 2 weeks and were then tested at three time points corresponding to acute withdrawal (8\u201312\u00a0h into withdrawal) and protracted withdrawal (30 and 60 days of withdrawal) in the FST. The behaviors that were measured in the five-min FST consisted of latency to immobility, swim time, immobility time, and climbing time. The FST results showed that the vapor-exposed animals displayed depressive-like behaviors; for instance, decreased latency to immobility in acute withdrawal and decreased latency to immobility, decreased swim time and increased immobility time in protracted withdrawal, with differences between air- and vapor-exposed animals becoming more pronounced over the 60-day withdrawal period. NPY levels in the frontal cortex of the vapor-exposed animals were decreased compared with the control animals, and CRF levels in the amygdala were correlated with increased immobility time. Thus, extended ethanol vapor exposure produced long-lasting changes in FST behavior and NPY levels in the brain.",

     "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms accompanying ethanol-induced cytotoxicity remain to be defined. The renin\u2013angiotensin system with its respective receptors, the angiotensin AT1 and AT2 receptor (AT1R and AT2R), has been implicated in these processes. The AT2R seems to counteract the pro-inflammatory, pro-hypertrophic, and pro-fibrotic actions of the AT1R and is involved in cellular differentiation and tissue repair. Recently, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a novel negative transcriptional regulator of the AT2R. However, the complex interactions between ethanol, PARP-1, and the AT2R are largely unknown. In this in vitro study, we aimed to clarify whether acute ethanol treatment modifies AT2R promoter activity or AT2R mRNA and protein levels and whether PARP-1 is involved in ethanol-mediated regulation of the AT2R. Murine fibroblasts of the R3T3 and MEF line (murine embryonic fibroblasts) were exposed to ethanol for 24\u00a0h. AT2R promoter activity, mRNA and protein levels were analyzed with and without PARP-1 inhibition and in PARP-1 knockout MEF cells. Expression of PARP-1 was analyzed over course of time, and cell viability and DNA fragmentation were measured on single-cell level by flow cytometry. Ethanol exposition induced substantial downregulation of the AT2R on promoter, mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Pharmacological inhibition or ablation of PARP-1 completely abolished this effect. Ethanol treatment did not have any effect on AT1R mRNA and protein levels in MEF cells. Further, acute ethanol treatment promoted DNA fragmentation and caused transcriptional induction of PARP-1. Our findings reveal that PARP-1 is an upstream transcriptional regulator of the AT2 receptor in the context of ethanol exposure and represses the AT2R gene in fibroblasts in vitro. Variations in expression of the potentially tissue-protective AT2R might contribute to ethanol-mediated pathology.",

However, the suitability of quantitative EtG measurements in hair to determine the quantity of alcohol consumed has not clearly been demonstrated yet. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of ethanol dose and hair pigmentation on the incorporation of EtG into rat hair. Ethanol and EtG kinetics in blood were investigated after a single administration of ethanol.Eighteen rats were divided into four groups receiving 0 (control group), 1, 2, or 3\u00a0g ethanol/kg body weight. Ethanol was administered on 4\u00a0consecutive days per week for 3 weeks by intragastric route. Twenty-eight days after the initial ethanol administration, newly grown hair was shaved. Pigmented and nonpigmented hair were analyzed separately by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Blood samples were collected within 12\u00a0h after the ethanol administration. EtG and ethanol blood levels were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and headspace gas chromatography-flame ionization detector, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed in EtG concentrations between pigmented and nonpigmented hair (Spearman's rho\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Thus, EtG incorporation into rat hair was not affected by hair pigmentation. Higher doses of ethanol resulted in greater blood ethanol area under the curve of concentration versus time (AUC) and in greater blood EtG AUC. A positive correlation was found between blood ethanol AUC and blood EtG AUC (Spearman's rho\u00a0=\u00a00.84). Increased ethanol administration was associated with an increased EtG concentration in hair. Blood ethanol AUC was correlated with EtG concentration in hair (Pearson's r\u00a0=\u00a00.89). EtG concentration in rat hair appeared to reflect the EtG concentration in blood. Ethanol was metabolized at a median rate of 0.22\u00a0g/kg/h, and the median elimination half-life of EtG was 1.21\u00a0h. This study supports that the bloodstream is likely to display a major role in the hair EtG incorporation.",

Age-related decrease in antioxidant enzyme status was further exacerbated with ethanol drinking, which indicates liver in aged rats is more susceptible to oxidative damage because of decreased free radical scavenging system in aged/old ethanol-drinking rats. However, the decrease in liver antioxidant enzymes status with ethanol consumption was ameliorated by 2 months exercise training in old and young rats. These results demonstrate that age-associated decrease in hepatic free radical scavenging system exacerbated by ethanol drinking. For the first time, we found that this deterioration was significantly reversed by exercise training in aging liver, thus protects against alcohol-induced oxidative damage.",

Despite significant morbidity and mortality resulting from ethanol consumption, the precise cellular mechanism of its toxicity remains unknown. Previous work has shown that wild-type Bcl-2 is protective against ethanol. The present study investigated whether protection from ethanol toxicity involves mitochondrial Bcl-2 or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Bcl-2, and whether mitochondria-associated or ER-associated caspases are involved in ethanol toxicity. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO695) cells were transiently transfected with cDNA constructs encoding wild-type Bcl-2, mitochondria-targeted Bcl-2, or ER-targeted Bcl-2. MTT assay was used to measure cell viability in response to ethanol. Ethanol treatments of 1 and 2.5\u00a0M reduced cell viability at 5, 10, and 24\u00a0h. Wild-type Bcl-2, localized both to mitochondria and ER, provided significant rescue for CHO695 cells treated with 1\u00a0M ethanol for 24\u00a0h, but did not rescue toxicity at 2.5\u00a0M. ER-targeted Bcl-2, however, provided significant and robust rescue following 24\u00a0h of 1 and 2.5\u00a0M ethanol. Mitochondria-targeted Bcl-2 offered no protection at any ethanol concentration and generally reduced cell viability. To follow up these experiments, we used a peptide inhibitor approach to investigate which caspases were responsible for ethanol-induced apoptosis. Caspase-9 and caspase-12 are known to be downstream of mitochondria and the ER, respectively. CHO695 cells were treated with a pan-caspase inhibitor, a caspase-9 or caspase-12 inhibitor along with 1.5\u00a0M ethanol, followed by MTT cell viability assay. Treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor provided significant rescue from ethanol, whereas inhibition of caspase-9 did not. Inhibition of ER-associated caspase-12, however, conferred significant protection from ethanol toxicity, similar to the pan inhibitor. These findings are consistent with our transfection data and, taken together, suggest a significant role for the ER in ethanol toxicity.",

This was studied in a double-blind, placebo-balanced, design on six healthy male volunteers. Of the three bipolar aspects of mood (calmness, activity, and pleasantness), only calmness was significantly affected by intravenous alcohol. In contrast, there were significant differences between alcohol and placebo for five of the six unipolar indexes. This support the hypothesis that subjective effects of alcohol on mood are preferably studied with self-ratings that allows positive and negative aspects to be analyzed separately. Further, our data suggest that the effects of alcohol are primarily on negative aspects of mood rather than on positive.",

     "abstract": "A serotonin deficiency state has been implicated in alcohol-dependent individuals' experience of obsessive\u2013compulsive alcohol craving. Because the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) functions to remove serotonin from the synapse, it is thought that increased reuptake (indicated by the number of high-expressing LA alleles present in the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region [5-HTTLPR] of the SLC6A4 gene) is associated with an increase in obsessive\u2013compulsive alcohol craving. The current pilot investigation sought to explore this hypothesis by examining the extent to which obsessive\u2013compulsive alcohol craving varies by 5-HTTLPR genotype among participants enrolled in an ongoing pharmacogenetics trial. All participants were screened with a semi-structured diagnostic interview, completed self-report measures of alcohol-related behavior, and underwent peripheral venous blood draw for DNA genotyping. Cross-sectional data obtained at baseline from 176 currently drinking alcohol-dependent individuals were analyzed using multiple regression. Preliminary findings suggest that 5-HTTLPR is not predictive of Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale total and factor scores. Although the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism was not related to obsessive\u2013compulsive alcohol craving in this pilot study, additional research is needed to clarify the possible role of serotonergic mechanisms in alcohol craving.",

With a view to further understanding of this particular aspect, in the light of the \u201cself-medication hypothesis,\u201d we focused our attention on the gamma aminobutyric acid system and, in particular, on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the glutamate decarboxylase 67 or glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) gene region in association with alcohol dependence. The research was structured as a case\u2013control study. The patient cohort included 283 Caucasian males from the Veneto region, North-east Italy; 107 were alcohol dependent according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR) criteria, and 176 were controls recruited from blood donors. We analyzed 26 SNPs located in the coding and untranslated regions of the GAD67 gene with the GenomeLab SNPStream Genotyping System (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Fisher's Chi-square test for allele and genotype distributions and Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium analysis for cases and controls were performed. Ten SNPs at the GAD67 gene were valid for further statistics. Preliminary results show a difference in genotype distribution (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003; \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a011.6081) between alcoholic subjects and controls of SNP rs 11542313 located in exon 3 of the GAD67 gene, responsible for a silent mutation (His37His). This is the first genetic study regarding the GAD67 gene in relation to the condition of alcohol dependence in an Italian population of subjects all coming from the same region (Veneto). The results highlight a statistical association between one SNP of GAD67 and the condition of alcohol dependence. To clarify the possible meaning of this association, further genetic analyses are being undertaken. In particular, we are investigating other genetic polymorphisms, both upstream and downstream from rs 11542313, which may interfere with splicing and/or GAD67 mRNA stability.",

Acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). The genetic variation of ADH1B, ALDH2, and CYP2E1 is different among racial populations and cause difference in elimination rates of alcohol. The aim of this study was to determine the polymorphisms of ADH1B (rs1229984; Arg47His), ALDH2 (rs671; Glu487Lys), CYP2E1*6 (rs6413432; T7632A), and CYP2E1*7B (rs6413420; G-71T) in unrelated healthy Turkish population and compare it with other populations. ADH1B and ALDH2 polymorphisms were analyzed with an allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and CYP2E1*6 and CYP2E1*7B polymorphisms were genotyped by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. ADH1B polymorphism analysis yielded the genotype distribution as 83.9% ADH1B*1/1 and 16.1% ADH1B*1/2, and no individuals with ALDH2*1/2 and ALDH2*2/2 genotypes were found in Turkish population. The genotype frequencies for CYP2E1*6 polymorphism were found as 85.3% for homozygote common, 14.1% for heterozygote, and 0.6% for homozygote uncommon. For CYP2E1*7B polymorphism, the genotype frequencies were determined to be 86.5% G/G, 13.5% for G/T; however, no individuals with homozygote uncommon genotype were detected. According to our study results, the genotype distributions of ADH1B, ALDH2, CYP2E1*6, and CYP2E1*7B in Turkish population were similar compared with Caucasian and some European populations, whereas differed significantly from East Asian populations.

Distinguishing the functionally significant nsSNPs from tolerant nsSNPs is helpful to characterize the genetic basis of human diseases and assess individual susceptibility to diseases. Many nsSNPs have been found in alcohol metabolism-related genes but there is poor knowledge on the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of nsSNPs in these genes. In this study, we have identified a total of 203 nsSNPs in 29 human alcohol metabolism-related genes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) dbSNP and SWISS-Prot databases. Using the PolyPhen and SIFT algorithms, 43% of nsSNPs in alcohol metabolism-related genes were predicted to have functional impacts on protein function with a significant concordance of the prediction results between the two algorithms. The prediction accuracy is about 77\u201381% of all the nsSNPs based on the results of in vivo and in vitro studies. These amino acid substitutions are supposed to be the pathogenetic basis for the alteration of metabolism enzyme activity and the association with disease susceptivity. The phenotype of nsSNPs predicted as deleterious needs to be clarified in further studies and the prediction of nsSNPs in human alcohol metabolism-related genes would be useful hints for further genotype\u2013phenotype studies on the individual difference in susceptivity to alcohol-related diseases.",

Their findings were compared with those of 22 age-matched, male, normal controls (mean age, 59.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 years). Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed using the 99mTc-ethylcysteinate dimer ( 99mTc-ECD) Patlak Plot method, and the three-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest (ROI) template (3DSRT) and the fine stereotaxic ROI template (fine SRT) developed by Takeuchi et al were used to evaluate regional CBF, focusing primarily on the limbic system. These methods make it possible to precisely and objectively measure the details of regional CBF. The voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) was used to determine the degree of parahippocampal gyrus atrophy in chronic alcoholic patients. VSRAD is a method developed by Hirata et al for evaluating the degree of atrophy of the parahippocampal gyrus. The results were analyzed using Z scores (>2 indicating significant atrophy). Blood flows in the callosomarginal region, pericallosal region, thalamus, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdaloid body, anterior cingulate gyrus, and middle cingulate gyrus were lower in the chronic alcoholic group than in the control group.

     "abstract": "Alcohol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are noxious agents that can disrupt the integrity of the gastroduodenal mucosal and damage the epithelial barrier and lead to increased gastroduodenal permeability. Moreover, it is not uncommon that patients are exposed to these two barrier stressors at the same time. It is thus important to know how simultaneous exposure affects the gastroduodenal barrier, and acquiring that knowledge was the goal of this study. We used a method that has been widely used for the assessment of injury to the gastroduodenal barrier induced by these noxious agents\u2014measurement of gastroduodenal permeability as indicated by urinary excretion of ingested sucrose. We used gas chromatography to measure the amount of sucrose excreted in the urine over the 5\u201312\u00a0h after ingestion of a bolus of sucrose. The 148 participants in the study included 92 alcoholics and 56 healthy controls. All study subjects had a baseline permeability test. To determine whether addition of a second noxious agent, in addition to chronic alcohol, further decreases gastroduodenal barrier integrity, a subset of 118 study subjects participated in another permeability test in which they were exposed to aspirin. For this test, participants ingested 1,300\u00a0mg aspirin twice, 12 and 1\u00a0h before the final permeability test. The baseline permeability test showed that alcoholics have significantly higher gastroduodenal permeability than controls. Aspirin caused a significant within-group absolute increase in gastroduodenal permeability in both alcoholics and controls (+7.72%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003 and +2.25%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.011, respectively), but the magnitude of these increases was not significantly different from each other. Baseline permeability did vary by gender, self-reported illegal drug use, and employment type. The extent of the permeability increase after aspirin ingestion varied with illegal drug use and recruitment site (a surrogate marker of socioeconomic status). Our data show that alcoholics have greater gastroduodenal permeability than healthy controls. This difference was independent of the duration of any preceding period of sobriety, gender, smoking history, or illicit drug abuse. The injurious effects of alcohol on the gastroduodenal epithelial barrier are long lasting, persisting even after 7 days of sobriety. Although, acute aspirin and chronic alcohol each increase intestinal permeability in alcoholics, their effects appear to be additive rather than synergistic.",

The LSA is the fraction of SA attached to gangliosides that are transported in the blood by the lipoproteins. In this article, the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on the serum levels of LSA was evaluated. The objective of the study was to understand the mechanism of elevated serum TSA concentration during alcohol abuse. Additionally, the association of LSA with serum lipid profile was tested. For this purpose, the levels of LSA, TSA, lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apos) in the sera of 106 alcoholics were measured. The serum level of LSA in alcohol abusers was significantly elevated. This increase was because of the elevated level of LSA in patients drinking alcohol up to 2 days before sampling. The elevated level of LSA positively correlated with TSA, and also with biochemical indices of hepatocellular injury such as aspartate aminotransferase and \u03b3-glutamyltransferase, but did not correlate with any lipids, apos, and lipoproteins. The increase in LSA level is not related with the status of serum lipid profile but is related to the liver status estimated by the biochemical markers of liver cell damage. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the elevated level of LSA in alcohol abusers contributes to an increase in the serum concentration of TSA, and contrary to TSA, is affected by the status of liver cells.",

At least in part, such increased attraction may be the result of alcohol consumption decreasing ability to detect bilateral asymmetry, presumably because of the reductions in the levels of visual function. We tested the hypotheses that acute alcohol consumption decreases ability to detect asymmetry in faces and reduces preference for symmetrical faces over asymmetrical faces. Twenty images of a pair of faces and then 20 images of a single face were displayed on a computer, one at a time. Participants were instructed to state which face of each of the face pairs displayed was most attractive and then whether the single face being displayed was symmetrical or not. Data were collected near campus bars at Roehampton University. Sixty-four self-selecting students who undertook the study were classified as either sober (control) or intoxicated with alcohol. For each face pair or single face displayed, participant response was recorded and details of the alcohol consumption of participants that day were also obtained. Sober participants had a greater preference for symmetrical faces and were better at detecting whether a face was symmetrical or otherwise, supporting the hypotheses. A further, unexpected finding was that males made fewer mistakes than did females when determining whether individual faces were asymmetrical. The reduced ability of inebriated people to perceive asymmetry may be an important mechanism underlying the higher ratings of facial attractiveness they give for members of the opposite sex and hence their increased frequency of mate choice.",

     "abstract": "To investigate mechanisms in outbred animals that increase the propensity to consume ethanol, it is important to identify and characterize these animals before or at early stages in their exposure to ethanol. In the present study, different measures were examined in adult Sprague\u2013Dawley rats to determine whether they can predict long-term propensity to overconsume ethanol. Before consuming 9% ethanol with a two-bottle choice paradigm, rats were examined with the commonly used behavioral measures of novelty-induced locomotor activity and anxiety, as assessed during 15\u00a0min in an open-field activity chamber. Two additional measures, intake of a low 2% ethanol concentration or circulating triglyceride (TG) levels after a meal, were also examined with respect to their ability to predict chronic 9% ethanol consumption. The results revealed significant positive correlations across individual rats between the amount of 9% ethanol ultimately consumed and three of these different measures, with high scores for activity, 2% ethanol intake, and TGs identifying rats that consume 150% more ethanol than rats with low scores. Measurements of hypothalamic peptides that stimulate ethanol intake suggest that they contribute early to the greater ethanol consumption predicted by these high scores. Rats with high 2% ethanol intake or high TGs, two measures found to be closely related, had significantly elevated expression of enkephalin (ENK) and galanin (GAL) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) but no change in neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). This is in contrast to rats with high activity scores, which in addition to elevated PVN ENK expression showed enhanced NPY in the ARC but no change in GAL. Elevated ENK is a common characteristic related to all three predictors of chronic ethanol intake, whereas the other peptides differentiate these predictors, with GAL enhanced with high 2% ethanol intake and TG measures but NPY related to activity.",

N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity associated with ethanol withdrawal has been implicated as a significant component contributing to neurotoxic effects resulting from early ethanol exposure, and studies using MK-801 (dizocilpine) have reported protection from ethanol-induced damage. The present study examined whether the administration of MK-801 during ethanol withdrawal would ameliorate ethanol-associated cell death in the interpositus nucleus of the cerebellum and behavioral deficits in a cerebellar dependent task. Long Evans rat pups were treated with ethanol (5.25\u00a0g/kg) in a binge-like manner on postnatal day 6 using intragastric intubation. Subjects then received an injection of MK-801 (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) or vehicle during withdrawal, 30\u00a0h after ethanol exposure. Rats were then trained on an eyeblink classical conditioning task as juveniles (40 days of age), and cerebellar interpositus nucleus numbers were assessed after conditioning. Ethanol-exposed subjects exhibited reductions in neuronal populations and behavioral deficits during eyeblink conditioning. However, MK-801 administration significantly attenuated observed deficiencies, suggesting a protective effect resulting from MK-801 treatment during ethanol withdrawal. These results support the role of NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity as a component mechanism by which ethanol produces teratogenicity. Additionally, our findings support previous reports that have shown correlations between dependent measures of eyeblink classical-conditioning behavior and unbiased cell counts in the interpositus nucleus.",

This study examined the knowledge, skills, and practices of family medicine residency and clerkship directors and assessed the time devoted and format of FAS curricula in the programs.

More than half of the clerkship directors without FASD in their curriculum agreed that a need exists for its inclusion. These findings raise important medical education and policy issues and provide insight into the disparity in FASD content of curricula between predoctoral and family medicine residency programs in the United States.

To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the pattern of alcohol consumption and its self-reported effect on gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in patients with IBD. We recruited 129 consecutive patients: 52 patients with Crohn's disease, 38 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 39 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). All the participants completed a validated questionnaire on disease activity (the Crohn's disease activity index or ulcerative colitis clinical activity index, respectively) validated questionnaires to quantify alcohol consumption by National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria, and two structured questionnaires we designed to access patients' perception of the effect of alcohol on their GI symptoms and on overall GI symptom severity. The pattern of current, light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption in inactive IBD was similar to the general U.S. population. Specifically, of the 90 inactive IBD patients, 56 (62%) were current drinkers, compared with 61% in the general U.S. population.

Thus, chronic alcohol intake leads to widespread circadian disruption in both humans and experimental animals, while in turn, chronobiological disruption has been hypothesized to promote or sustain excessive alcohol intake. Nevertheless, the effects of circadian disruption on voluntary ethanol intake have not been investigated extensively, and prior studies have reported both increased and decreased ethanol intake in rats maintained under \u201cshift-lag\u201d lighting regimens mimicking those experienced by shift workers and transmeridian travelers. In the present study, male and female inbred Fischer and Lewis rats were housed in running wheel cages with continuous free-choice access to both water and 10% (vol/vol) ethanol solution and exposed to repeated 6-h phase advances of the daily light\u2013dark (LD) cycle, whereas controls were kept under standard LD 12:12 conditions. Shift-lag lighting reduced overall ethanol and water intake, and reduced ethanol preference in Fischer rats. Although contrary to the hypothesis that circadian disruption would increase voluntary ethanol intake, these results are consistent with our previous report of reduced ethanol intake in selectively bred high-alcohol-drinking (HAD1) rats housed under a similar lighting regimen. We conclude that chronic circadian disruption is a form of chronobiological stressor that, like other stressors, can either increase or decrease ethanol intake, depending on a variety of poorly understood variables.",

In general, these phenomena are potentiated by increased alcohol exposure duration and by prior withdrawal episodes. Previous studies have also reported locomotor hypoactivity during ethanol withdrawal in rats and mice, but only in novel test environments and not in the home cage. In the present study, we examined the effects of withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure on the level and circadian periodicity of wheel-running activity in C57BL/6J mice. CIE treatment resulted in reductions in wheel-running activity compared with plain-air controls that persisted for about 1 week after withdrawal. Analysis of circadian waveforms indicated that reduced activity occurred throughout the night phase, but that daily-activity patterns were otherwise unaltered. CIE failed to alter free-running circadian period or phase in animals maintained under constant darkness. These results show that ethanol withdrawal can result in locomotor hypoactivity even in the habitual, home-cage environment, and suggest that withdrawal-related reductions in wheel-running activity may reflect the specific motivational significance of this behavior.",

The objective of this study was to determine the involvement of 5-HT3 receptors within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in regulating ethanol self-administration by alcohol-preferring (P) rats. Standard two-lever operant chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) were used to examine the effects of seven consecutive bilateral microinfusions of ICS 205-930 (ICS), a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, directly into the posterior VTA on the acquisition and maintenance of 15% (vol/vol) ethanol self-administration. P rats readily acquired ethanol self-administration by the fourth session. The three highest doses (0.125, 0.25, and 1.25\u00a0\u03bcg) of ICS prevented acquisition of ethanol self-administration. During the acquisition postinjection period, all rats treated with ICS demonstrated higher responding on the ethanol lever, with the highest dose producing the greatest effect. In contrast, during the maintenance phase, the three highest doses (0.75, 1.0, and 1.25\u00a0\u03bcg) of ICS significantly increased responding on the ethanol lever; after the 7-day dosing regimen, responding on the ethanol lever returned to control levels. Microinfusion of ICS into the posterior VTA did not alter the low responding on the water lever and did not alter saccharin (0.0125% wt/v) self-administration. Microinfusion of ICS into the anterior VTA did not alter ethanol self-administration. Overall, the results of this study suggest that 5-HT3 receptors in the posterior VTA of the P rat may be involved in regulating ethanol self-administration.

Yet, animal models of alcohol drinking have yielded inconsistent evidence for a direct contribution of stress, and many studies have shown that stress suppresses alcohol consumption. The aim of the present study was to examine alcohol reward in animals exposed to repeated, mild social stress, and to determine whether alcohol drinking changes as a function of the temporal parameters of alcohol access relative to the stressor. Male Long-Evans rats, trained to self-administer a 6% (wt/vol) alcohol solution using a sucrose-fading procedure, were exposed to five brief (5\u00a0min) episodes of contact with an aggressive male. Full contact with the resident was limited to a single episode of defeat, whereas the following four encounters occurred with the subjects behind a protective wire mesh cage. Alcohol self-administration was measured 1 week prior to stress (baseline), on each day of stress exposure, and 1 week following stress. Separate groups of animals were randomly assigned to self-administer alcohol immediately prior, immediately following, or 2\u00a0h following defeat stress. Stress preferentially increased alcohol drinking on stress-exposure days, and further elevated the amount consumed 1 week following stress. Temporal parameters of alcohol access relative to the stressor were found to be important. Average alcohol consumption was greatest for animals drinking 2\u00a0h postdefeat, whereas animals drinking immediately prior to or following the stressor did not show a significant increase in alcohol consumption. Results suggest that mild social defeat stress is sufficient to elicit increases in alcohol consumption in nonpreferring strains of rodents, provided alcohol access occurs at an optimal time interval after the social defeat experience.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether ethanol doses that affect honeybee behavior also induce a significant stress response, measured by heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) concentrations, in honeybee brain tissues. Experiment 1 examined how pretreatment handling influenced brain HSP70 concentrations in three pretreatment groups of bees; immediately after being collected, after being harnessed and fed, and after 22\u201324\u00a0h in a harness. HSP70 concentrations did not differ among pretreatment groups within replicates, although we observed significantly different HSP70 concentrations between the two replicates. Experiment 2 investigated the relationship between ethanol dose and brain HSP70 concentrations. Bees were placed in seven experimental groups, the three pretreatment groups as in Experiment 1 and four ethanol-fed groups. Bees in ethanol treatments were fed 1.5\u00a0M sucrose (control) and 1.5\u00a0M sucrose\u2013ethanol solutions containing 2.5, 5, and 10% ethanol, allowed to sit for 4\u00a0h, and dissected brains were assayed for HSP70. We observed ethanol-induced increases in honeybee brain HSP70 concentrations from the control group through the 5% ethanol group. Only bees in the 5% ethanol group had HSP70 concentrations significantly higher than the control group. The inverted U-shaped ethanol dose\u2013HSP70 concentration response curve indicated that ingestion of 2.5% ethanol and 5% ethanol stimulated the stress response, whereas ingestion of 10% ethanol inhibited the stress response. Doses that show maximum HSP70 concentration (5% ethanol) or HSP70 inhibition (10% ethanol) correspond to those (\u22655% ethanol) that also impaired honeybees in previous studies.

The objective of this study was to further characterize the effect of ethanol on LTP in the developing CA1 hippocampus during the third trimester equivalent. To more closely model human ethanol exposure during this period, rat pups were exposed to ethanol vapor (2 or 4.5\u00a0g/dL in air, serum ethanol concentrations\u00a0=\u00a096.6\u2013147.2 or 322\u2013395.6\u00a0mg/dL) from P2\u20139 (4\u00a0h/d).

LTP was not different than group-matched controls in the 96.6\u2013147.2\u00a0mg/dL group; however, it was impaired in the 322\u2013395.6\u00a0mg/dL group.

Breath alcohol concentrations (BrAC) and temperature readings were obtained before and at fixed intervals after drinking. Pumping before drinking significantly decreased BrAC during both reproductive stages, whereas pumping after drinking resulted in different BrAC time curves during lactation when compared with after lactation. That is, levels were significantly lower during the descending phase of the time curve during than after lactation. The interactions between pumping and reproductive stage were most apparent during fed condition. Furthermore, women were more sensitive to hypothermic effects of both fasting and drinking alcohol during lactation. These findings add to the growing literature that lactating women metabolize alcohol differently, in part, due to the frequent breast stimulation during breastfeeding and the pronounced physiological changes that accompany one of the most energetically costly mammalian activities.",

In Portugal with a population of 10 millions of inhabitants, there are around 10% of alcoholics or excessive alcohol drinkers and 1% of chronically infected patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). To examine the characteristics of patients with higher levels of alcohol consumption and to investigate the association between alcohol consumption and liver damage a total of 298 chronically infected individuals, with HBV genotyped and submitted to liver biopsy, were classified with Child's grading and separated by habits of alcohol intake, less and greater than 20\u00a0g/day. No significant differences were observed about genotype but genotypes A and D were predominant in both of them. A higher percentage of males (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) were observed in the group with alcohol intake above 20\u00a0g/day, as well a lower proportion of patients with HBeAg negativity (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.035).

The present study examined the effects of selective inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 compared with the inhibition of overall ethanol metabolism on the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were fed via total enteral nutrition for 45 days with or without 10\u201312\u00a0g/kg/d ethanol. Some groups were given 200\u00a0mg/kg/d of the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide (DAS). Other groups were treated with 164\u00a0mg/kg/d of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and dosed at 2\u20133\u00a0g/kg/d ethanol to maintain similar average urine ethanol concentrations. Liver pathology scores and levels of apoptosis were elevated by ethanol (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) but did not differ significantly on cotreatment with DAS or 4-MP. However, liver triglycerides were lower when ethanol-fed rats were treated with DAS or 4-MP (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Serum alanine aminotransferase values were significantly lower in ethanol-fed 4-MP\u2013treated rats indicating reduced necrosis. Hepatic oxidative stress and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker tribbles-related protein 3 were increased after ethanol (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05); further increased by DAS but partly attenuated by 4-MP. Both DAS and 4-MP reversed ethanol increases in the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and the chemokine CXCL-2 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). However, neither inhibitors prevented ethanol suppression of interleukins IL-4 or IL-12. Moreover, neither inhibitors prevented ethanol increases in tumor growth factor-beta mRNA. Ethanol and DAS additively induced hepatic hyperplasia (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). These data suggest that a significant proportion of hepatic injury after ethanol exposure is independent of alcohol metabolism. Ethanol metabolism by CYP2E1 may be linked in part to triglyceride accumulation, to induction of TNF-\u03b1, and to chemokine production. Ethanol metabolism by ADH may be linked in part to oxidative and ER stress and necrotic injury.",

Adult male P rats were given 1-h access to 15 and 30% ethanol three times daily for 8 weeks. Rats (n = 10/time point for ethanol and n = 6/time point for water) were killed by decapitation 1, 6, and 24 h after the last drinking episode. RNA was prepared from individual micropunch samples of the nucleus accumbens shell (ACB-shell) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA); analyses were conducted with Affymetrix Rat Genome 230.2 GeneChips. Ethanol intakes were 1.5\u20132 g/kg for each of the three sessions. There were no genes that were statistically different between the ethanol and water control groups at any individual time point. Therefore, an overall effect, comparing the water control and ethanol groups, was determined. In the ACB-shell and CeA, there were 276 and 402 probe sets for named genes, respectively, that differed between the two groups. There were 1.5\u20133.6-fold more genes with increased expression than with decreased expression in the ethanol-drinking group, with most differences between 1.1- and 1.2-fold. Among the differences between the ethanol and water control groups were several significant biological processes categories that were in common between the two regions (e.g., synaptic transmission, neurite development); however, within these categories, there were few genes in common between the two regions. Overall, the results indicate that binge-like alcohol drinking by P rats produces region-dependent changes in the expression of genes that could alter transcription, synaptic function, and neuronal plasticity in the ACB-shell and CeA; within each region, different mechanisms may underlie these alterations because there were few common ethanol-responsive genes between the ACB-shell and CeA.",

     "abstract": "Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) often exhibit sensorimotor dysfunctions that include deficits in motor coordination and fine motor control. Although the underlying causes for these motor abnormalities are unknown, they likely involve interactions between sensory and motor systems. Rodent animal models have been used to study the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on skilled reaching and on the development and organization of somatosensory barrel field cortex. To this end, PAE delayed the development of somatosensory cortex, reduced the size of whisker and forelimb representations in somatosensory barrel field cortex, and delayed acquisition time to learn a skilled reaching task. However, whether PAE also affects the motor cortex (MI) remains to be determined. In the present study, we investigated the effect of PAE on the size of the forelimb representation in rat MI, thresholds for activation, and the overlap between motor and sensory cortical forelimb maps in sensorimotor cortex. Pregnant Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were assigned to alcohol (Alc), pair-fed (PF), and chow-fed (CF) groups on gestation day 1 (GD1). Rats in the Alc group (n\u00a0=\u00a04) were chronically intubated daily with binge doses of alcohol (6\u00a0g/kg body weight) from GD1 to GD20 that resulted in averaged blood alcohol levels measured on GD10 (mean\u00a0=\u00a0191.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a041.9\u00a0mg/dL) and on GD17 (mean\u00a0=\u00a0247.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a072.4\u00a0mg/dL). PF (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and CF (n\u00a0=\u00a03) groups of pregnant rats served as controls. The effect of PAE on the various dependent measures was obtained from multiple male offspring from each dam within treatment groups, and litter means were compared between the groups from alcohol-treated and control (Ct: CF and PF) dams. At approximately 8 weeks of age, rats were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and the skull opened over sensorimotor cortex. A tungsten microelectrode was then inserted into the depths of layer V and intracortical microstimulation was used to deliver trains of pulses to evoke muscle contractions and/or movements; maximum stimulating \u2264100\u00a0\u03bcA. When a motor response was observed, the threshold for movement was measured and the motor receptive field projected to the cortical surface to serve as representative point for that location. A motor map for the forelimb representation was generated by systematically stimulating at adjacent sites until current thresholds reached the maximum and/or motor responses were no longer evoked. The major findings in this study were as follows: (1) PAE significantly reduced the area of the forelimb representation in the Alc offspring (6.01\u00a0mm2, standard error of the mean\u00a0=\u00a0\u00b10.278) compared with the Ct offspring (8.03\u00a0mm2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.586), (2) PAE did not significantly reduce the averaged threshold for activation of movements between groups, (3) PAE significantly reduced the percent overlap (Alc\u00a0=\u00a031.1%, Ct\u00a0=\u00a055.4%) between the forelimb representation in sensory and motor cortices, and (4) no significant differences were observed in averaged body weight, hemisphere weight, or age of animal between treatment groups. These findings suggest that the effects of PAE are not restricted to somatosensory barrel field cortex but also involve the MI and may underlie deficits in motor control and sensorimotor integration observed among children with FASD.",

     "abstract": "Studies over the last decade demonstrate that adolescence is a brain maturation period from childhood to adulthood. Plastic and dynamic processes drive adolescent brain development, creating flexibility that allows the brain to refine itself, specialize, and sharpen its functions for specific demands. Maturing connections enable increased communication among brain regions, allowing greater integration and complexity. Compelling evidence has shown that the developing brain is vulnerable to the damaging effects of ethanol. It is possible to infer, therefore, that alcohol exposure during the critical adolescent developmental stages could disrupt the brain plasticity and maturation processes, resulting in behavioral and cognitive deficits. Recent neuroimaging studies have provided evidence of the impact of human adolescent drinking in brain structure and functions. Findings in experimental animals have also given new insight into the potential mechanisms of the toxic effects of ethanol on both adolescent brain maturation and the short- and long-term cognitive consequences of adolescent drinking.Adolescence is also characterized by the rapid maturation of brain systems mediating reward and by changes in the secretion of stress-related hormones, events that might participate in the increasing in anxiety and the initiation pattern of alcohol and drug consumption. Studies in human adolescents demonstrate that drinking at early ages can enhance the likelihood of developing alcohol-related problems. Experimental evidence suggests that early exposure to alcohol sensitizes the neurocircuitry of addiction and affects chromatin remodeling, events that could induce abnormal plasticity in reward\u2013related learning processes that contribute to adolescents' vulnerability to drug addiction.In this article, we review the potential mechanisms by which ethanol impacts brain development and lead to brain impairments and cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions as well as the neurobiological and neurochemical processes underlying the adolescent-specific vulnerability to drug addiction.",

     "abstract": "This review discusses evidence for long-lasting neurophysiological changes that may occur following exposure to ethanol during adolescent development in animal models. Adolescence is the time that most individuals first experience ethanol exposure, and binge drinking is not uncommon during adolescence. If alcohol exposure is neurotoxic to the developing brain during adolescence, not unlike it is during fetal development, then understanding how ethanol affects the developing adolescent brain becomes a major public health issue. Adolescence is a critical time period when cognitive, emotional, and social maturation occurs and it is likely that ethanol exposure may affect these complex processes. To study the effects of ethanol on adolescent brain, animal models where the dose and time of exposure can be carefully controlled that closely mimic the human condition are needed. The studies reviewed provide evidence that demonstrates that relatively brief exposure to high levels of ethanol, via ethanol vapors, during a period corresponding to parts of adolescence in the rat is sufficient to cause long-lasting changes in functional brain activity. Disturbances in waking electroencephalogram and a reduction in the P3 component of the event-related potential (ERP) have been demonstrated in adult rats that were exposed to ethanol vapor during adolescence. Adolescent ethanol exposure was also found to produce long-lasting reductions in the mean duration of slow-wave sleep (SWS) episodes and the total amount of time spent in SWS, a finding consistent with a premature aging of sleep. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings, in a range of strains, and to link those findings to the neuroanatomical and neurochemical mechanisms potentially underlying the lasting effects of adolescent ethanol exposure.",

Neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis are now thought to contribute to the structural integrity of the hippocampus, a limbic system region involved in learning, memory, behavioral control, and mood. In adolescents with alcohol use disorders (AUDs), the hippocampus appears to be particularly vulnerable to the neurodegenerative effects of alcohol, but the role of neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis in alcoholic neuropathology has only recently been considered. This review encompasses a brief overview of neural stem cells and the processes involved in adult neurogenesis, how neural stem cells are affected by alcohol, and possible differences in the neurogenic niche between adults and adolescents. Specifically, what is known about developmental differences in adult neurogenesis between the adult and adolescent is gleaned from the literature, as well as how alcohol affects this process differently among the age groups. Finally, this review suggests differences that may exist in the neurogenic niche between adults and adolescents and how these differences may contribute to the susceptibility of the adolescent hippocampus to damage. However, many more studies are needed to discern whether these developmental differences contribute to the vulnerability of the adolescent to developing an AUD.",

We have assessed sex differences in voluntary ethanol consumption during adolescence and adulthood and the influence of binge ethanol exposure during adolescence. We have observed that males are sensitive to passive social influences that mediate voluntary ethanol consumption, and early ethanol exposure induces long-term changes in responsivity to ethanol in adulthood. Exposure to moderate doses of ethanol during adolescence produced alterations in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens septi during adolescence and later in adulthood.

A key component of this research has been the development of animal models of adolescent alcohol consumption and alcohol response. Because of their extended period of adolescence, rhesus macaques are especially well suited for modeling alcohol-related phenotypes that contribute to the adolescent propensity for alcohol consumption. In this review, we discuss studies from our laboratory that have investigated both the initial response to acute alcohol administration and the consumption of alcohol in voluntary self-administration paradigms in adolescent rhesus macaques. These studies confirm that adolescence is a time of dynamic change both behaviorally and physiologically, and that alcohol response and alcohol consumption are influenced by life history variables, such as age, sex, and adverse early experience in the form of peer-rearing. Furthermore, genetic variants that alter functioning of the serotonin, endogenous opioid, and corticotropin-releasing hormone systems are shown to influence both physiological and behavioral outcomes, in some cases interacting with early experience to indicate gene by environment interactions. These findings highlight several of the pathways involved in alcohol response and consumption, namely reward, behavioral dyscontrol, and vulnerability to stress, and demonstrate a role for these pathways during the early stages of alcohol exposure in adolescence.",

Six weeks later, all the groups were subjected to chronic exposure to ethanol vapors and the severity of their ethanol withdrawal seizures was assessed by handling-induced convulsions. An adolescent exposure to chronic nicotine resulted in an exacerbation of ethanol withdrawal seizures in adulthood.

     "abstract": "Alcohol use during adolescence leads to increased risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) during adulthood. Converging evidence suggests that this period of enhanced vulnerability for developing an AUD may be due to the adolescent's unique sensitivity and response to alcohol. Adolescent rats have been shown to be less sensitive to alcohol intoxication and withdrawal susceptibility; however, age differences in ethanol pharmacokinetics may underlie these effects. Therefore, this study investigated alcohol intoxication behavior and withdrawal severity using a modified Majchrowicz model of alcohol dependence that has been shown to result in similar blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) despite age differences. Adolescent (postnatal day, PND, 35) and adult rats (PND 70+) received ethanol according to this 4-day binge paradigm and were observed for withdrawal behavior for 17\u00a0h. As expected, adolescents showed decreased sensitivity to alcohol-induced CNS depression as evidenced by significantly lower intoxication scores. Thus, adolescents received significantly more ethanol each day (12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0g/kg/day) than adults (9.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0g/kg/day). Despite greater ethanol dosing in adolescent rats, both adolescent and adult groups had comparable peak BECs (344.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2 and 338.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8\u00a0mg/dL, respectively). Strikingly, withdrawal severity was similar quantitatively and qualitatively between adolescent and adult rats. Further, this is the first time that withdrawal behavior has been reported for adolescent rats using this model of alcohol dependence. A second experiment confirmed the similarity in BECs at various time points across the binge. These results demonstrate that after consideration of ethanol pharmacokinetics between adults and adolescents by using a model that produces similar BECs, withdrawal severity is nearly identical. This study, in combination with previous reports on ethanol withdrawal in adolescents and adults, suggests only a BEC-dependent effect of ethanol on withdrawal severity regardless of age.",

At both ages, repeated ethanol exposure resulted in the development of apparent sensitization to anxiolytic effects of ethanol, indexed by enhancement of social investigation and transformation of social avoidance into social indifference or preference and expression of tolerance to the socially inhibiting effects induced by higher ethanol doses. Evidence for the emergence of sensitization in adults and tolerance at both ages was seen not only after chronic ethanol but also after chronic saline exposure, suggesting that chronic manipulation per se may be sufficient to alter the sensitivity of both adolescents and adults to socially relevant effects of ethanol.",

Participants recruited from local high schools were of ages 16\u201318 and consisted of 12 binge drinkers and 12 demographically similar nondrinkers. Participants were all nonsmokers, and drinkers were abstinent from alcohol for an average of 33 days at the time of scanning.

In addition, controls showed significant activation in the left hippocampus during novel encoding, whereas binge drinkers did not. Adolescent binge drinkers demonstrated (1) more response than nondrinkers in frontal and parietal regions, which could suggest greater engagement of working memory systems during encoding; (2) no hippocampal activation to novel word pairs; and (3) slightly poorer word pair recall, which could indicate disadvantaged processing of novel verbal information and a slower learning slope. Longitudinal studies will be needed to ascertain the degree to which emergence of binge drinking is linked temporally to these brain response patterns.",

This article discusses our current knowledge of the cellular and molecular brain changes that stem from heavy alcohol exposure, including binge patterns, during adolescence. Progress has been made in linking the behavioral effects of adolescent drinking to underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. However, it is suggested that future research on the etiology and consequences of adolescent drinking use an integrative approach to this problem by combining multiple levels, including genetic, cellular and molecular, systems (neuroimaging), and behavioral, with an emphasis on integrating the different levels of analysis.",
