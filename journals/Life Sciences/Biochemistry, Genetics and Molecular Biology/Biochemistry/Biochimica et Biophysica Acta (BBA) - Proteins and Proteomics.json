     "abstract": "Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (PPAT, EC. 2.7.7.3) catalyzes an essential step in the reaction that transfers an adenylyl group from adenosine tri phosphate (ATP) to 4\u2032-phosphopantetheine (pPant) yielding 3\u2032- dephospho-coenzyme A (dPCoA) and pyrophosphate (PP) in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. The enzyme PPAT from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbPPAT) was cloned, expressed and purified. The binding studies of AbPPAT were carried out with two compounds, tri\u2011sodium citrate (TSC) and l-ascorbic acid (LAA, vitamin-C) using fluorescence spectroscopic (FS) and surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) methods. Both methods provided similar values of dissociation constants for TSC and LAA which were of the order of 10\u22128\u202fM and 10\u22125\u202fM respectively. The computer aided docking studies indicated fewer interactions of LAA with AbPPAT as compared to those of TSC. The freshly purified samples of AbPPAT were crystallized. The crystals of AbPPAT were soaked in the solutions containing TSC and LAA. However, the crystals of the complex of AbPPAT with LAA did not diffract well and hence the structure of the complex of AbPPAT with LAA could not be determined. On the other hand, the crystals of the complex of AbPPAT with TSC diffracted well and the structure was determined at 1.76\u202f\u00c5 resolution. It showed that TSC bound to AbPPAT at the ATP binding site and formed several intermolecular contacts including 12 hydrogen bonds. The results of binding studies for both TSC and LAA and the structure of the complex of AbPPAT with TSC clearly indicated a potential role of TSC and LAA as antibacterial agents.",

     "abstract": "CD23 is involved in a myriad of immune reactions. It is not only a receptor for IgE, but also functions in the regulation of IgE synthesis, isotype switching in B cells, and induction of the inflammatory response. These effector functions of CD23 arise through its interaction with another leukocyte-specific cell surface receptor \u2013 the \u03b22 integrin subfamily. It has been shown that CD23 is also capable of interacting with the \u03b23 and \u03b25 integrin \u03b2-subunit of integrins via a basic RKC motif in a metal cation-independent fashion. In this study the interaction was probed for whether or not the RKC motif governs the interaction between CD23 and the \u03b1X\u03b22 integrin as well. This was done by performing bioinformatic docking predictions between CD23 and \u03b1X\u03b22 integrin \u03b1I domain and SPR spectroscopy analysis of the interaction. This revealed that in the absence of cations, the RKC motif is involved in interaction with the integrin \u03b1I domain. However, in the presence of divalent metal cations the interaction showed the involvement of a novel acidic motif within the CD23 protein. This same pattern of interaction was seen in docking predictions between CD23 and the \u03b23I-like domain. This study thus presents an alternative site as a possible contributor to the CD23-integrin interaction exhibiting cation-dependence.",

Glycosylation of B2GP1 can impact auto antibody recognition leading to the development of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which can result in miscarriages or thrombosis. Next to its glycosylation different genetic variants are known to increase the risk of suffering from APS. Here we show that ESI-q/TOF-MS of intact B2GP1 can be used to analyze genetic variants and glycosylation simultaneously. After enrichment of B2GP1 from 16 different plasma samples and subsequent ESI-MS measurement of the intact protein, we detected five different SNPs in our samples either homozygous or heterozygous. The dominant glycan composition shows four biantennary, fully sialylated glycan structures, with a relative proportion of about 30%. We also detected compositions with one or two triantennary glycan structures in lower amounts and fucosylated species with one or two fucosyl residues. Two of our samples showed an unreported partially occupied fifth glycosylation site presumably arising from the presence of SNP variant S88N. Our method allows a fast determination of genetic variants and glycan compositions of human B2GP1 to be potentially used as diagnostic marker.",

We analyze the effect of sequence heterogeneity on the dynamics of translocation by means of helical propensity of amino acid residues.

Results show non-symmetric free energy barriers as a consequence of sequence heterogeneity, such asymmetry in energy may be useful in differentiated directions of translocation. For the fifteen polypeptide chains considered we found conditions when sequence heterogeneity has not a significant effect on the time scale of translocation leading to a scaling law \u03c4\u202f\u221d\u202fN\u03bd, where \u03bd\u202f\u223c\u202f1.6 is an exponent that holds for most ground state energies.

     "abstract": "Pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminases are industrially important enzymes catalyzing the stereoselective amination of ketones and keto acids. Transaminases of PLP fold type IV are characterized by (R)- or (S)-stereoselective transfer of amino groups, depending on the substrate profile of the enzyme. PLP fold type IV transaminases include branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs), D-amino acid transaminases and (R)-amine:pyruvate transaminases. Recently, transaminases with a mixed type of activity were identified and characterized. Here, we report biochemical and structural characterization of a transaminase from myxobacterium Haliangium ochraceum (Hoch3033), which is active towards keto analogs of branched-chain amino acids (specific substrates for BCATs) and (R)-(+)-\u03b1-methylbenzylamine (specific substrate for (R)-amine:pyruvate transaminases). The enzyme is characterized by an alkaline pH optimum (pH\u202f10.0\u201310.5) and a tolerance to high salt concentrations (up to 2\u202fM NaCl). The structure of Hoch3033 was determined at 2.35\u202f\u00c5 resolution. The overall fold of the enzyme was similar to those of known enzymes of PLP fold type IV. The mixed type of activity of Hoch3033 was implemented within the BCAT-like active site. However, in the active site of Hoch3033, we observed substitutions of specificity-determining residues that are important for substrate binding in canonical BCATs. We suggest that these changes result in the loss of activity towards \u03b1-ketoglutarate and increase the affinity towards (R)-(+)-\u03b1-methylbenzylamine. These results complement our knowledge of the catalytic diversity of transaminases and indicate the need for further research to understand the structural basis of substrate specificity in these enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Methanotrophs play a prominent role in the global carbon cycle, by oxidizing the potent greenhouse gas methane to CO2. Methane is first converted into methanol by methane monooxygenase. This methanol is subsequently oxidized by either a calcium-dependent MxaF-type or a lanthanide-dependent XoxF-type methanol dehydrogenase (MDH). Electrons from methanol oxidation are shuttled to a cytochrome redox partner, termed cytochrome cL. Here, the cytochrome cL homolog from the thermoacidophilic methanotroph Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV was characterized. SolV cytochrome cGJ is a fusion of a XoxG cytochrome and a periplasmic binding protein XoxJ. Here we show that XoxGJ functions as the direct electron acceptor of its corresponding XoxF-type MDH and can sustain methanol turnover, when a secondary cytochrome is present as final electron acceptor. SolV cytochrome cGJ (XoxGJ) further displays a unique, red-shifted absorbance spectrum, with a Soret and Q bands at 440, 553 and 595\u202fnm in the reduced state, respectively. VTVH-MCD spectroscopy revealed the presence of a low spin iron heme and the data further shows that the heme group exhibits minimal ruffling. The midpoint potential Em,pH7 of +240\u202fmV is similar to other cytochrome cL type proteins but remarkably, the midpoint potential of cytochrome cGJ was not influenced by lowering the pH.

     "abstract": "In mammalian cells, human 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bonded enzyme, plays a central role in the cholesterol homeostasis via the negative feedback mechanism. The present study indicates that the interactions of novel peptides with the catalytic domain of HMGCR, provides an alternative therapeutic candidate for reducing cholesterol. The potential natural origin of HMGCR peptide inhibitors were filtered from the peptide library using the molecular docking, which revealed three strong candidates for inhibition. This information was used for synthesizing peptides, which were evaluated for inhibition against HMGCR. The stronger docking interactions were confirmed by experimental dissociation constant (KD) values of 9.1\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22129\u202fM, 1.4\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fM and 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22128\u202fM for peptides NALEPDNRIESEGG (Pep-1), NALEPDNRIES (Pep-2) and PFVKSEPIPETNNE (Pep-3) respectively. The immunological based interactions show a strong evidence of peptide-HMGCR complexes. The LDL uptake showed enhancements after treatments with peptides in the extracellular environment of HepG2 cells, which was further, corroborated through increase in the immunofluorescence signal of the localized LDL-R protein expression on the cell membrane. The results showed that the mRNA and protein expression of transcription factors were significantly up-regulated showing regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in peptide treated HepG2 cells. The binding of transcription factors, sterol regulatory element (SRE) and cAMP-response element (CRE) on HMGCR promotor further confirms the cholesterol biosynthesis regulation. All the above results suggested a key role of peptide/s in alleviating cholesterol accumulation in tissue via inhibition of rate-limiting HMGCR enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The I326T mutation in the TRNT1 gene encoding human tRNA nucleotidyltransferase (tRNA-NT) is linked to a relatively mild form of SIFD. Previous work indicated that the I326T variant was unable to incorporate AMP into tRNAs in vitro, however, expression of the mutant allele from a strong heterologous promoter supported in vivo CCA addition to both cytosolic and mitochondrial tRNAs in a yeast strain lacking tRNA-NT. To address this discrepancy, we determined the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of the I326T variant enzyme and the related variant, I326A. Our in vitro analysis revealed that the I326T substitution decreases the thermal stability of the enzyme and causes a ten-fold reduction in enzyme activity. We propose that the structural changes in the I326T variant that lead to these altered parameters result from a rearrangement of helices within the body domain of the protein which can be probed by the inability of the monomeric enzyme to form a covalent dimer in vitro mediated by C373. In addition, we confirm that the effects of the I326T or I326A substitutions are relatively mild in vivo by demonstrating that the mutant alleles support both mitochondrial and cytosolic CCA-addition in yeast.",

     "abstract": "While the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely unknown, abnormal accumulation and deposition of beta amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides into plaques has been proposed as a critical pathological process driving disease progression. Over the last years, neuronal lipid species have been implicated in biological mechanisms underlying amyloid plaque pathology. While these processes comprise genetic features along with lipid signaling as well as direct chemical interaction of lipid species with A\u03b2 mono- and oligomers, more efforts are needed to spatially delineate the exact lipid-A\u03b2 plaque interactions in the brain. Chemical imaging using mass spectrometry (MS) allows to probe the spatial distribution of lipids and peptides in complex biological tissues comprehensively and at high molecular specificity. As different imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) modalities provide comprehensive molecular and spatial information, we here describe a multimodal ToF-SIMS- and MALDI-based IMS strategy for probing lipid and A\u03b2 peptide changes in a transgenic mouse model of AD (tgAPPArcSwe). Both techniques identified a general AD-associated depletion of cortical sulfatides, while multimodal MALDI IMS revealed plaque specific lipid as well as A\u03b2 peptide isoforms. In addition, MALDI IMS analysis revealed chemical features associated with morphological heterogeneity of individual A\u03b2 deposits. Here, an altered GM1 to GM2/GM3 ganglioside metabolism was observed in the diffuse periphery of plaques but not in the core region. This was accompanied by an enrichment of A\u03b21\u201340arc peptide at the core of these deposits. Finally, a localization of arachidonic acid (AA) conjugated phosphatidylinositols (PI) and their corresponding degradation product, lyso-phosphatidylinositols (LPI) to the periphery of A\u03b2 plaques was observed, indicating site specific macrophage activation and ganglioside processing.",

     "abstract": "The apolipoprotein family is a set of highly conserved proteins characterized by the presence of amphipathic \u03b1-helical sequences that mediate lipid binding. Paradoxically, this family of proteins is also prominent among the proteins known to form amyloid fibrils, characterized by extensive cross-\u03b2 structure. Several apolipoproteins including apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, apoA-II and apoC-II accumulate in amyloid deposits of atherosclerotic lesions. This review illustrates the role of lipid-apolipoprotein interactions in apolipoprotein folding and aggregation with a specific focus on human apoC-II, a well-studied member of the family. In the presence of high concentrations of micellar lipid mimetics apoC-II adopts a stable and predominantly \u03b1-helical structure, similar to other members of the family and presumed to be the structure of apoC-II in circulating plasma lipoproteins. In contrast, lipid-free apoC-II aggregates to form long amyloid fibrils with a twisted ribbon-like morphology. Detailed structural analyses identify a letter G-like conformation as the basic building block within these fibrils. Phospholipids at submicellar concentrations accelerate apoC-II fibril formation by promoting the formation of a discrete tetrameric intermediate. Conversely, several small molecule lipid-mimetics inhibit apoC-II fibril formation at submicellar concentrations, inducing well-defined dimers unable to further aggregate. Finally, low concentrations of phospholipid micelles and bilayers induce the slow formation of amyloid fibrils with distinct rod-like fibril morphology. These studies highlight the diversity of lipid effects on apolipoprotein amyloid formation and reveal a conformational adaptability that could underlie the widespread occurrence of apolipoproteins in amyloid deposits and atheroma.",

Here, we investigate how ganglioside lipids, present in high amounts in neurons and exosomes, influence the aggregation kinetics of \u03b1-synuclein. Gangliosides, as well as, other anionic lipid species with small or large headgroups were found to induce conformational changes of \u03b1-synuclein monomers and catalyse their aggregation at mildly acidic conditions. Although the extent of this catalytic effect was slightly higher for gangliosides, the results imply that charge interactions are more important than headgroup chemistry in triggering aggregation. In support of this idea, uncharged lipids with large headgroups were not found to induce any conformational change and only weakly catalyse aggregation. Intriguingly, aggregation was also triggered by free ganglioside headgroups, while these caused no conformational change of \u03b1-synuclein monomers. Our data reveal that partially folded \u03b1-synuclein helical intermediates are not required species in triggering of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation.",

     "abstract": "Lipids often play an important role in the initial steps of fibrillation. The melanosomal protein Pmel17 forms amyloid in vivo and contains a highly amyloidogenic Repeat domain (RPT), important for melanin biosynthesis. RPT fibrillation is influenced by two lysolipids, the anionic lysophosphatidylglycerol (LPG) and zwitterionic lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), both present in vivo at elevated concentrations in melanosomes, organelles in which Pmel17 aggregate. Here we investigate the interaction of RPT with both LPG and LPC using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), electron microscopy, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Under non-shaking conditions, both lipids promote fibrillation but this is driven by different interactions with RPT. Each RPT binds >40 LPG molecules but only weak interactions are seen with LPC. Above LPG's criticial micelle concentration (cmc), LPG and RPT form connected micelles where RPT binds to the surface as beads on a string with core-shell structures. Binding to LPG only induces \u03b1-helical structure well above the cmc, while LPC has no measurable effect on the protein structure. While low (but still super-cmc) concentrations of LPG strongly promote aggregation, at higher LPG concentrations (10\u202fmM), only ~ one RPT binds per micelle, inhibiting amyloid formation. ITC and SAXS reveal some interactions between the zwitterionic lipid LPC and RPT below the cmc but little above the cmc. Nevertheless, LPC only promotes aggregation above the cmc and this process is not inhibited by high LPC concentrations, suggesting that monomers and micelles cooperate to influence amyloid formation.",

Previous studies have shown that zinc (Zn(II)) and insulin, co-secreted with hIAPP, have an inhibition effect on hIAPP aggregation. Lipid membranes have also been shown to significantly influence the aggregation kinetics of hIAPP. An increasing number of studies report the importance of developing small molecule inhibitors to suppress the hIAPP's aggregation and subsequent toxicity. The ability of epigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG) to inhibit aggregation of a variety of amyloid peptide/proteins initiated numerous studies as well as the development of derivative compounds to potentially treat amyloid diseases. In this study, a combination of Thioflavin-T fluorescence kinetics, transmission electron microscopy, isothermal titration calorimetery, circular dicrosim and nucelar magnetic resonance experiments were used to demonstrate a significant enhancement in EGCG's efficiency when complexed with Zn(II). We demonstrate that the Zn-EGCG complex is able to significantly suppress hIAPP's amyloid aggregation both in presence and absence of lipid membrane. Circular dichroism experiments indicate the formation and stabilization of a helical structure of hIAPP in presence of the EGCG:Zn(II) complex. Our results also reveal the ability of EGCG or EGCG:Zn(II) to efficiently suppress hIAPP's cellular toxicity. We believe that the reported results could be useful to develop strategies to trap hIAPP intermediates for further biophysical and structural studies, and also to devise approaches to abolish amyloid aggregation and cellular toxicity.",

PriB-DnaT interaction is considered a significant step in the replication restart. In this study, we examined the contribution of the residues Ser20, His26 and Ser55, which are located on the PriB dimer interface. These residues are proximal to Glu39 and Arg44, which are important for PriB-DnaT interaction. Mutational analyses revealed that His26 and Ser20 of PriB are important for the interaction with DnaT, and that the Ser55 residue of PriB might have a role in negatively regulating the DnaT binding. These residues are involved in not only the interaction between PriB and DnaT but also the dissociation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from the PriB\u2212ssDNA complex due to DnaT binding. Moreover, NMR study indicates that the region Asp66\u2212Glu76 on the linker between DnaT domains is involved in the interaction with wild-type PriB.

     "abstract": "Sphingolipids are diverse lipids with essential, and occasionally opposing, functions in the cell and therefore tight control over biosynthesis is vital. Mechanisms governing this regulation are not understood. Initial steps in sphingolipid biosynthesis take place on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) is an ER-resident enzyme catalyzing the first-committed step in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Not surprisingly, SPT activity is tightly regulated. ORMDLs are ER-resident proteins recently identified as regulators of SPT activity. ORMDL proteins interact directly with SPT but the nature of this interaction is unknown. ORMDL protein sequences contain hydrophobic regions, yet algorithm-based predictions of transmembrane segments are highly ambiguous, making topology of this key regulator unclear. Here we report use of substituted cysteine accessibility to analyze topology of mammalian ORMDLs. We constructed multiple mutant ORMDLs, each containing a single cysteine strategically placed along the protein length. Combined use of selective membrane permeabilization with an impermeant cysteine modification reagent allowed us to assign transmembrane and cytosolic segments of ORMDL. We confirmed that mammalian ORMDL proteins transit the membrane four times, with amino- and carboxy termini facing the cytosol along with a large cytosolic loop. This model will allow us to determine details of the ORMDL-SPT interaction and identify regions acting as the \u201clipid sensor\u201d to detect changes in cellular sphingolipid levels. We also observe that SPT and ORMDL are substantially resistant to extraction from membranes with non-ionic detergent, indirectly suggesting that both proteins reside in a specialized subdomain of the ER.",

Alpha-synuclein is a protein involved in the development of synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease. In the present work, alpha-synuclein was for the first time modified by the intermediate product of glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA-3-P). The resulting product was compared with the alpha-synuclein modified by methylglyoxal (MGO). The efficiency of the modification by the aldehydes was evaluated by decrease in free amino group content. The modification products were detected using fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of modification by two glycating agents on the amyloid transformation of alpha-synuclein was investigated. Transmission electron microscopy analysis of the aggregates produced by the native alpha-synuclein under fibrillation conditions revealed the presence of 355\u2013441-nm fibrils. In the aggregates produced by the modified alpha-synuclein, short fibrils of 65\u2013230\u202fnm or 85\u2013260\u202fnm were detected in the case of the protein treated with MGO and GA-3-P, respectively. Investigation of the aggregates by the fluorescence assay with Thioflavin T and CD spectroscopy showed that, in contrast to native alpha-synuclein, alpha-synuclein treated with GA-3-P does not produce real amyloid structures. Consequently, modification of alpha-synuclein by GA-3-P, the metabolite whose concentration is determined by the activity of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, prevents its amyloid transformation.",

Aggregation of silk fibroin resulted in the formation of fibrils with a diameter of ~3.2\u202fnm. However, addition of the optimized concentration of curcumin and \u03b2-cyclodextrin to silk fibroin inhibited aggregation and preserved the random coil conformation even under aggregation inducing conditions, as demonstrated by CD and FTIR spectroscopy.

In this study, Thermosipho africanus, a thermophilic eubacterium, Trx1 (TaTrx1) was successfully cloned, overexpressed and purified, to greater than 95% purity. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of TaTrx1 categorized the protein as a putative Trx. Its ability to reduce the interchain disulfides of insulin, in the presence of dithiothreitol, provided further evidence to suggest that it was a Trx. The three dimensional structure of the protein, determined using X-ray crystallography, provided additional evidence for this. The crystal structure was solved in space group P212121 to 1.8 \u0102 resolution and showed the characteristic thioredoxin fold; four \u03b2-strands surrounded by three \u03b1-helices. The active site of TaTrx1 contained two cysteines that formed a disulfide bridge, and was structurally similar to the active site of EcTrx1. Further studies indicated that TaTrx1 was far more stable than Trx1 of E. coli (EcTrx1). The protein could withstand both higher temperatures and higher concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride before denaturing.

Mass spectrometry (MS) facilitates the identification and quantification of a large amount of secreted proteins (secretome), but can be hampered by the false-positive identification of contaminating proteins released from dead cells or derived from cell medium. To reduce the likelihood of contaminations we applied an approach combining secretome and proteome analysis to characterize the physiological secretome of BM derived human MSC. Our analysis revealed a secretome consisting of 315 proteins. Pathway analyses of these proteins revealed a high abundance of proteins related to cell growth and/or maintenance, signal transduction and cell communication thereby representing key biological functions of BM derived MSC on protein level. Within the MSC secretome we identified several cytokines and growth factors such as VEGFC, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22 and GDF6 which are known to be involved in the physiological regulation of hematopoiesis. By comparing the peptide patterns of secretomes and cell lysates 17 proteins were identified as candidates for proteolytic processing. Taken together, our combined MS work-flow reduced the likelihood of contaminations and enabled us to carve out a specific overview about the composition of the secretome from human BM derived MSC. This methodological approach and the specific secretome signature of BM derived MSC may serve as basis for future comparative analyses of the interplay of MSC and HSPC in patients with hematological malignancies.",

HspA was successfully crystallized only in the presence of 2\u202fM urea. The crystal structure of HspA shows urea-induced loss of about 30% of the secondary structure without major alteration in the tertiary structure of the protein.

Here we report the crystal structures of apo-LmACP (wild-type and S37A mutant) at 2.0\u202f\u00c5 resolution and compare their key features with the structures of holo-LmACP (wild-type) and other type II ACPs from Escherichia coli and Plasmodium falciparum.

Contrary to holo-form, which exists predominantly as a monomer, the apo-form exists as a mixture of monomeric and dimeric population in solution. In contrast to the closed structure of apo-LmACP, holo-LmACP structure was observed in an open conformation as a result of reorganization of specific helices and loops. We propose that the structural changes exhibited by LmACP occur due to the attachment of the phosphopantetheine arm and may be a prerequisite for the initiation of fatty acid synthesis. The movement of helix 3 may also play a role in the dissociation of holo-LmACP from its cognate enzymes of the FAS II pathway.",

The difference between the heat capacity of the native and the unfolded state strongly suggests that interactions between protein domains also contribute to the heat uptake in a calorimetry experiment. We found that once unfolded at high temperature the process is reversible and the native state can be recovered upon cooling only in the absence of Ca2+. We also propose a new simple method to obtain pure CRT oligomers.",

     "abstract": "To achieve a good understanding of the characteristics of a protein, it is important to study its stability and folding kinetics. Investigations of protein stability have been recently applied to drug-target identification, drug screening, and proteomic studies. The efficiency of the experiments performed to study protein stability and folding kinetics is now a crucial factor that needs to be optimized for these potential applications. However, the standard procedures used to carry out these experiments are usually complicated and time consuming. Large number of measurements is the bottleneck that limits the application of protein folding to large-scale experiments. To overcome this limitation, we developed a method denoted as \u201cone-pot analysis\u201d which is based on taking a single measurement from a mixture of samples rather than from every sample. We combined one-pot analysis with pulse proteolysis to determine the effects of the binding of maltose to maltose-binding protein on the protein folding properties. After carrying out a simple optimization, we demonstrated that protein stability or unfolding kinetics could be measured accurately with just one detection measurement. We then further applied the optimized conditions to cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). Combining one-pot analysis with CETSA led to a successful determination of the effects of the binding of methotrexate to dihydrofolate reductase in HCT116 cancer cells. Our results demonstrated the applicability of one-pot analysis to energetics-based methods for studying protein folding. We expect the combination of one-pot analysis and energetics-based methods to significantly benefit studies such as drug-target identification, proteomic investigations, and drug screening.",

Escherichia coli DsbA catalyzes disulfide bond formation in extracellular proteins and in multicomponent architectures on the cell surface. The present study assessed the significance of the redox properties of DsbA by exploiting the plaque-forming ability of bacteriophage M13, which specifically recognizes F-pili during infection of the host cell. A library of mutant dsbA genes was constructed by randomizing the dipeptide XX sequence in the active-site redox motif CXXC and then screened for mutants that altered plaque yield and appearance. In total, 24 dsbA mutant alleles produced substantially different degrees of complementation, and one mutant dsbA gene that encodes a CDIC sequence produced over 40-fold more clear plaques than wild type dsbA. The redox potential of purified DsbA [CDIC] was \u2212172\u202fmV, representing a less-oxidizing catalysis than the wild type DsbA (\u2212122\u202fmV), but one that is closer to yeast protein disulfide isomerase (\u2212175\u202fmV). DsbA [CDIC] exhibited a greater ability to refold fully denatured glutathionylated ribonuclease A than the wild type enzyme and a DsbA [CRIC] mutant, which has the same redox potential of \u2212172\u202fmV. Homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulation suggest that the CDIC mutant may have an enlarged substrate-binding cleft near the redox center, which confers kinetic advantages when acting on protein substrates.",

Our iTRAQ analysis revealed a total of 665 phosphoproteins, among which the significantly regulated phosphoproteins in different between-group comparisons were further analyzed. Functional analysis of these significantly regulated phosphoproteins suggested that T. gondii modulated host cell processes through phosphorylation including cell cycle regulation, inducing apoptosis, blocking the synthesis of some inflammatory factors, mediating metabolism to support its proliferation at the infection phase prior to egress, and utilizing membrane and energy from host cell, reorganizing cytoskeleton to favor its invasion and PV formation at the phase of invasion. The phosphorylation level of Smad2, CTNNA1, and HSPB1 identified with western blot revealed a consistent trend of change with iTRAQ result.

We hypothesized that somatic cancer-associated GCK variations include in part those with activating and/or stabilizing effects. We analyzed the enzyme kinetics and thermostability of recombinant proteins possessing the likely activating variations and the variations present in the connecting loop I and provided the first experimental evidence of the effects of somatic cancer-associated GCK variations. Activating and/or stabilizing variations were common among the analyzed cancer-associated variations, which was in strong contrast to their low frequency among germinal variations. The activating and stabilizing variations displayed focal distribution with respect to the tertiary structure, and were present in the surroundings of the heterotropic allosteric activator site, including but not limited to the connecting loop I and in the active site region subject to extensive rearrangements upon glucose binding. Activating somatic cancer-associated variations induced a reduction of GCK's cooperativity and an increase in the affinity to glucose (a decline in the S0.5 values). The hotspot-associated variations, which decreased cooperativity, also increased the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of the competitive GCK inhibitor, N-acetylglucosamine. Concluded, we have provided the first convincing biochemical evidence establishing GCK as a previously unrecognized enzyme that contributes to the reprogramming of energy metabolism in cancer cells. Activating GCK variations substantially increase affinity of GCK to glucose, disrupt the otherwise characteristic sigmoidal response to glucose and/or prolong the enzyme half-life. This, combined, facilitates glucose phosphorylation, thus supporting glycolysis and associated pathways.",

This work aimed to study the changes in metabolic pathways of rice under drought and submergence stress during the panicle differentiation stage. The identification and analysis of differential metabolites and differentially expressed proteins functions indicate that drought and submergence mainly promoted the energy metabolism pathway, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organism pathway, carbohydrate metabolic process, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic process functions. Under drought stress, the inhibition of photosynthetic rate is mainly through stomatal conductance restriction, and flavonoid pathway regulates the metabolic process of ROS. Under submergence stress, the electron transfer chain was destroyed to inhibit the photosynthetic rate, and the antioxidant system was activated to regulate the metabolism of ROS. The changes in related enzymes or proteins in metabolic regulatory networks are analyzed, which will be conducive to understanding the response mechanism of rice drought and submergence more deeply and provide a scientific basis for rice drought and submergence prevention and mitigation, and the breeding of drought- and submergence-resistant varieties.",

The experimental part of the study focused on the effect of rottlerin on fibrillation of three distinct amyloidogenic proteins, namely insulin, lysozyme and A\u03b21\u201340 peptide. Different experimental protocols such as fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy, demonstrated that amyloid fibril formation of any of the three proteins is inhibited by low micromolar rottlerin concentrations. Most likely, the inhibition of amyloid formation proceeded via interaction of rottlerin with amyloidogenic regions of the studied proteins. Moreover, rottlerin was also effective in pre-formed fibrils disassembly, suggesting that interactions of rottlerin with fibrils were capable to interrupt the fibril-stabilizing bonds of \u03b2-sheets.

Hypothetical proteins are often an overlooked pool though half the genome encodes for such proteins of unknown function that could potentially play vital roles in mycobacterial biology. In this context, we report the structural and functional characterization of the hypothetical protein Rv3272. Sequence analysis classifies Rv3272 as a Family III CoA transferase with the classical two domain structure and conserved Aspartate residue (D175). The crystal structure of the wild type protein (2.2\u202f\u00c5) demonstrated the associated inter-locked dimer while that of the D175A mutant co-crystallized with octanoyl-CoA demonstrated relative movement between the two domains. Isothermal titration calorimetry studies indicate that Rv3272 binds to fatty acyl-CoAs of varying carbon chain lengths, with palmitoyl-CoA (C16:0) exhibiting maximum affinity. To determine the functional relevance of Rv3272 in mycobacterial biology, we ectopically expressed Rv3272 in M. smegmatis and assessed that its expression encodes significant alteration in cell surface with marked differences in triacylglycerol accumulation. Additionally, Rv3272 expression protects mycobacteria from acidic, oxidative and antibiotic stress under in vitro conditions.

Under mildly acidic conditions (pH\u202f4.4), tetrameric native TTR appears to dissociate to monomers that maintain most of the native-like \u03b2-sheet structures. The amyloidogenic protein undergoes a conformational transition to largely unfolded states at more acidic conditions (pH\u202f2.4), leading to amyloid with distinct molecular structures. Aggregation kinetics is also highly dependent upon the acidic conditions. TTR quickly forms moderately ordered amyloids at pH\u202f4.4, while the aggregation kinetics is dramatically reduced at a lower pH of 2.4. The effect of the pathogenic mutations on aggregation kinetics is also markedly different under the two different acidic conditions. Pathogenic TTR variants (V30M and L55P) aggregate more aggressively than WT TTR at pH\u202f4.4. In contrast, the single-point mutations do not affect the aggregation kinetics at the more acidic condition of pH\u202f2.4. Given that the pathogenic mutations lead to more aggressive forms of TTR amyloidoses, the mildly acidic condition might be more suitable for mechanistic studies of TTR misfolding and aggregation.",

     "abstract": "The recent emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) has caused global concern as a result of the association with neurological disorders, and brain development dysfunction in fetuses of mothers who become infected with ZIKV during pregnancy. The NS2B-NS3 protease is important for viral replication and offers an attractive drug target. In addition to processing the viral polypeptide, evidence has shown that the NS2B-NS3 protease also targets cellular proteins as part of the viral replication process. This study sought to determine new host cell protein targets of ZIKV NS2B-NS3 (zNS2B-NS3). Plasmids encoding the protease domains of zNS2B-NS3pro and an inactive zNS2B-NS3(S135A) were transfected into HEK293T/17 cells and differentially expressed proteins were detected by 2D gel electrophoresis. A total of 18 protein spots were observed as differentially expressed between zNS2B-NS3pro and zNS2B-NS3(S135A), of which 7 were selected for identification by mass spectrometry. Four proteins (protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNP A2/B1), voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC) and aldolase A (ALDOA)) were selected for validation by independent transient expression and western blot analysis. Three proteins (PDIA3, hnRNP A2/B1 and ALDOA) were successfully validated, but only two proteins (PDIA3 and ALDOA) were shown to be regulated in ZIKV infection in agreement with the results of the transfection experiments. This study has identified two proteins, PDIA3 an ALDOA whose expression is modulated by the ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease, and these proteins are involved in the ER stress response and glycolysis respectively, two critical cellular processes in ZIKV infection.",

     "abstract": "Human butyrylcholinesterase is a nonspecific enzyme of clinical, pharmacological and toxicological significance. Although the enzyme is relatively stable, its activity is affected by numerous factors, including pressure. In this work, hydrostatic pressure dependence of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence in native and salted human butyrylcholinesterase was studied up to the maximum pressure at ambient temperature of about 1200\u202fMPa. A correlated large shift toward long wavelengths and broadening observed at pressures between 200 and 700\u202fMPa was interpreted as due to high pressure-induced denaturation of the protein, leading to an enhanced exposure of tryptophan residues into polar solvent environment. This transient process in native butyrylcholinesterase presumably involves conformational changes of the enzyme at both tertiary and secondary structure levels. Pressure-induced mixing of emitting local indole electronic transitions with quenching charge transfer states likely describes the accompanying fluorescence quenching that reveals different course from spectral changes. All the pressure-induced changes turned irreversible after passing a mid-point pressure of about 400\u202f\u00b1\u202f50\u202fMPa.

Knowledge of the metabolic regulation mechanisms in Mtb is still limited. Pyruvate kinase, involved in the late stage of glycolysis, helps link various metabolic routes together. Here, we demonstrate that Mtb pyruvate kinase (Mtb PYK) predominantly catalyzes the reaction leading to the production of pyruvate, but its activity is influenced by multiple metabolites from closely interlinked pathways that act as allosteric regulators (activators and inhibitors). We identified allosteric activators and inhibitors of Mtb PYK originating from glycolysis, citrate cycle, nucleotide/nucleoside inter-conversion related pathways that had not been described so far. Enzyme was found to be activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, adenine, adenosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, L-2-phosphoglycerate, l-aspartate, glycerol-2-phosphate, glycerol-3-phosphate. On the other hand thiamine pyrophosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and L-malate were identified as inhibitors of Mtb PYK.

While the mechanism is known for many bacteria, it is elusive yet for diarrhea causing pathogenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae or the other Vibrio species. Sequence analysis using genome databases delineated that majority of the Vibrio species including V. cholerae contain genes required for salvaging cobalamin/cobinamide in aerobic pathway while lack the genes required for de novo synthesis of B12. Fluorescence quenching study showed that VcBtuF, the PBP of putative ABC transporter BtuF-CD of V. cholerae O395 binds cyanocobalamin and dicyanocobinamide with micromolar dissociation constants (Kd). Productive internalization of these nutrients has been established through growth assay. The crystal structure of cyanocobalamin bound VcBtuF has shown that although interactions between cyanocobalamin and VcBtuF are largely similar to E. coli BtuF, VcBtuF possesses a wider binding pocket. MD simulations indicated that in contrast to EcBtuF that executes \u2018open-close\u2019 movement, inter-lobe twisting is prevalent in VcBtuF. Although H70, located at the entrance of the substrate binding cleft of VcBtuF, executes swinging motion, it cannot act as \u2018closed gate\u2019 to retain cyanocobalamin or cobinamide in the pocket like corresponding residue W66 of EcBtuF. Rather, VcBtuF shows a distinctive phenomenon of heme binding with comparable affinity to B12. Soret shift of heme upon binding with VcBtuF pointed towards involvement of H70 in heme recognition. This may lead to a restricted B12 or cobinamide binding during abundance of heme in the periplasmic space.",

     "abstract": "Mucins are heavily glycosylated proteins with high molecular mass, and are involved in various diseases including infection, inflammation, and cancer. As easy separation method, such as gel electrophoresis, however, does not exist for mucins, due to their large molecular sizes and heterogeneities. In 2009, we published a supported molecular matrix electrophoresis (SMME) method that can be used to characterize mucins. For SMME analysis, mucins have been enriched by ultrafiltration of trypsin digests using a 100\u202fKDa cutoff filter. However, this enrichment results in a loss of protein identification capability using proteomic approaches. In this study, we describe a simple enrichment of mucins without trypsinization for SMME analysis. The enrichment was developed using a porcine submandibular gland and then was applied to study and compare mouse submandibular glands between young and aged mice. From mouse submandibular glands, hyaluronic acid and some mucins were observed by SMME. One of the mucins was identified as MUC10 by proteomic analysis of the band on the SMME membrane and immunostaining using anti-MUC10 antibody. A major O-glycan of MUC10 was determined to be NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that the concentrations of these molecules were lower in aged mice than in young mice, and that an unknown mucin-like molecule was detected only from the aged mouse submandibular gland.",

The existing hand-made system has some disadvantages, and here we describe the development and validation of an improved cutter-plate system that enables simple, reliable and reproducible DEG assay in a 384-well plate-based format with signal readout using fluorometric or LC-MS-based reaction monitoring. To illustrate the usefulness of this system, we describe its application to profile esterase activities in ovarian adenocarcinoma SKOV3 cell lysate and mouse liver lysate that activate a fluorogenic substrate, fluorescein dibutyrate (FDBu), as well as esterase activities in mouse liver lysate that activate S-bromobenzylglutathione dicyclopentyl ester (BBGDC), a prodrug of anti-tumor agent S-bromobenzylglutathione. The activity spot patterns detected for FDBu and BBGDC were completely different, indicating that different metabolic systems are involved in hydrolysis of these substrates. The major detected spot in each case was identified. The developed system provides a highly reproducible general assay platform that should be useful for characterizing novel protein functions in complex bio-samples, as well as enzymomics studies.",

It was shown that 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (Dxr) is a critical enzyme in the viability of V. vulnificus, and many other bacteria, as it catalyzes the rearrangement of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (Dxp) to 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) within the MEP pathway, found in plants and bacteria.

The enzyme forms a dimeric assembly and contains a metal ion in the active site.

The PII proteins play an important role in this system by modulating the cellular metabolism through physical interaction with protein partners. Herbaspirillum seropedicae, a nitrogen-fixing bacterium, has two PII proteins paralogues, GlnB and GlnK. The interaction of H. seropedicae PII proteins with its targets is regulated by allosteric ligands and by reversible post-translational uridylylation. Both uridylylation and deuridylylation reactions are catalyzed by the same bifunctional enzyme, GlnD. The mechanism of regulation of GlnD activity is still not fully understood. Here, we characterized the regulation of deuridylylation activity of H. seropedicae GlnD in vitro. To this purpose, fully modified PII proteins were submitted to kinetics analysis of its deuridylylation catalyzed by purified GlnD. The deuridylylation activity was strongly stimulated by glutamine and repressed by 2-oxoglutarate and this repression was strong enough to overcome the glutamine stimulus of enzymatic activity. We also constructed and analyzed a truncated version of GlnD, lacking the C-terminal regulatory ACT domains. The GlnD\u0394ACT protein catalyzed the futile cycle of uridylylation and deuridylylation of PII, regardless of glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate levels. The results presented here suggest that GlnD can sense the glutamine:2-oxoglutarate ratio and confirm that the ACT domains of GlnD are the protein sensors of environment clues of nitrogen availability.",

To elucidate the contribution of the triphosphate group attached to adenosine, we examined the enzymatic activity of heavy meromyosin (HMM) with actin filaments for inorganic tripolyphosphate (3PP) using a Malachite green method and evaluated using fluorescence microscopy the effects of 3PP on actin filament motility on HMM-coated glass slides. In the presence of MgCl2, HMM hydrolyzed 3PP at a maximum rate of 0.016\u202fs\u22121 HMM\u22121, which was four times lower than the hydrolysis rate of ATP. Tetrapolyphosphate (4PP) was hydrolyzed at a rate similar to that of 3PP hydrolysis. The hydrolysis rates of 3PP and 4PP were enhanced by roughly 10-fold in the presence of actin filaments. In motility assays, the presence of polyphosphates did not lead to the sliding movement of actin filaments. Moreover, in the presence of ATP at low concentrations, the sliding velocity of actin filaments decreased as the concentration of added polyphosphate increased, indicating a competitive binding of polyphosphate to myosin heads with ATP. These results suggested that the energy produced by standalone triphosphate hydrolysis did not induce the unidirectional motion of actomyosin and that the link between triphosphate and adenosine was crucial for motility.",

The protein maintains the same secondary structure both at p2H 7.0 and at p2H 4.5, but at p2H 7.0 a higher 1H/2H exchange was observed, indicating a greater solvent accessibility. The difference in Tm and TD1/2 of the protein at the abovementioned p2H's has been calculated around 20\u202f\u00b0C. Infrared measurements have been then performed in the presence of DMPG and DOPA at p2H 4.5. DMPG showed a little destabilizing effect while DOPA exerted a great stabilizing effect, increasing the Tm of \u03b3-conglutin at p2H 4.5 of more than 20\u202f\u00b0C. Since \u03b3-conglutin at p2H 4.5 is in the monomeric form, the interaction with DOPA likely promotes the oligomerization even at p2H 4.5.

     "abstract": "Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) are eukaryote-specific proteins that bind to DNA as a homodimer or heterodimer and regulate gene expression. They are involved in several biological processes in plants; therefore inhibiting bZIP-DNA binding activity by targeting protein-protein interface is an attractive proposition with aspects of both basic and applied biology. Here, we describe the equilibrium and kinetic interactions studies of a designed peptide inhibitor A-ZIP53 and its four variants with the bZIP53 protein, a key regulator of seed maturation phase and stress response in Arabidopsis. Five designed peptide inhibitors were primed to preferentially interact with bZIP53 and inhibit its DNA binding activity. Isothermal circular dichroism (CD) studies were used to quantify the structural changes accompanying heterodimers formation between bZIP53 and five A-ZIP53s. Equilibrium studies using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and fluorescence polarization (FP) assays suggest that A-ZIP53s and bZIP53 mixture form heterodimers, incapable of binding to DNA. Four A-ZIP53 derivatives were designed with additional interactions that drive heterodimerization with bZIP53. A-ZIP53s dose-dependent FP studies show that peptide inhibitors displaced the DNA bound bZIP53 with nM half-maximal inhibitory (IC50) concentrations. Using FP, time-dependent displacement kinetic studies were used to rank five A-ZIP53s for their abilities to displace DNA-bound bZIP53 with a rank order of A-ZIP53\u202f<\u202fA-ZIP53(A\u202f\u2192\u202fE)\u202f<\u202fA-ZIP53(N\u202f\u2192\u202fA)\u202f<\u202fA-ZIP53(R\u202f\u2192\u202fE)\u202f<\u202fA-ZIP53(A\u202f\u2192\u202fE,N\u202f\u2192\u202fA).

Methionine \u03b3-lyase (MGL), an enzyme that degrades methionine, has been exploited to selectively remove the amino acid from cancer cell environment. In order to increase MGL catalytic activity, we performed sequence and structure conservation analysis of MGLs from various microorganisms. Whereas most of the residues in the active site and at the dimer interface were found to be conserved, residues located in the C-terminal flexible loop, forming a wall of the active site entry channel, were found to be variable. Therefore, we carried out site-saturation mutagenesis at four independent positions of the C-terminal flexible loop, P357, V358, P360 and A366 of MGL from Citrobacter freundii, generating libraries that were screened for activity. Among the active variants, V358Y exhibits a 1.9-fold increase in the catalytic rate and a 3-fold increase in KM, resulting in a catalytic efficiency similar to wild type MGL. V358Y cytotoxic activity was assessed towards a panel of cancer and nonmalignant cell lines and found to exhibit IC50 lower than the wild type. The comparison of the 3D-structure of V358Y MGL with other MGL available structures indicates that the C-terminal loop is either in an open or closed conformation that does not depend on the amino acid at position 358. Nevertheless, mutations at this position allosterically affects catalysis.",

Cyt c possesses also peroxidase-like activity in the native state despite its six-coordinated heme iron. In this work, we studied the effect of increasing urea concentration in the range from 0\u202fM to 6\u202fM at pH\u202f7 (pH value of the bulk solvent) and pH\u202f5 (pH value close to negatively charged membrane) on peroxidase-like activity of cyt c. We show that peroxidase-like activity, measured by guaiacol oxidation and the ferrous oxidation in xylenol orange methods, correlates with the accessibility of the heme iron, which was assessed from the association rate constant of cyanide binding to cyt c. Cyt c peroxidase-like activity linearly increases in the pre-denaturational urea concentrations (0\u20134\u202fM) at both studied pHs without an apparent formation of penta-coordinated state of the heme iron. Our results suggest that dynamic equilibrium among the denaturant-induced non-native coordination states of cyt c, very likely due to reversible unfolding of the least stable foldons, is pre-requisite for enhanced peroxidase-like activity of cyt c in its compact state. Dynamic replacement of the native sixth coordination bond of methionine-80 by lysines (72, 73, and 79) and partially also by histidines (26 and 33) provides an efficient way how to increase peroxidase-like activity of cyt c without significant conformational change at physiological conditions.",

In identified LMPs, Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit gamma-12 (GNG12) was a markedly up-regulated protein in Leu+ group. CMECs were treated with Leu+ or Leu\u2212, expression and lysosomal localization of GNG12 were decreased in response to Leu absence. Overexpressing or inhibiting GNG12 demonstrated that cell growth, casein synthesis and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway were all up-regulated by GNG12. Cell growth, casein synthesis and mTORC1 signaling pathway were decreased in response to Leu absence, but these decreases were partially restored by GNG12 overexpression, and those effects were partially reversed by inhibiting GNG12. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that GNG12 activates the mTORC1 pathway via interaction with Ragulator. Taken together, these results suggest that GNG12 is a positive regulator of the Leu-mediated mTORC1 signaling pathway in CMECs that promotes cell growth and casein synthesis.",

Some bacteria, including Lactobacillus casei, contain more than one apparent mIDH-encoding gene in the iol operon, but such redundant enzymes have not been investigated. scyllo-Inositol, a stereoisomer of myo-inositol, is not a substrate for mIDH, but scyllo-inositol dehydrogenase (sIDH) enzymes have been reported, though never observed to be encoded within the iol operon.

MLP from grape (Vitis vinifera; vvMLP) exhibits significant homology to miraculin (61% identity), suggesting that vvMLP possesses miraculin-like properties. The results of size-exclusion chromatography and sensory analysis illustrated that vvMLP exists as a monomer in solution with no detectable taste-modifying activity. Crystal structure determination revealed that vvMLP exists as a \u03b2-trefoil fold, similarly as other MLPs and Kunitz-type protein inhibitors. The conformation of the loops, including the so-called reactive loop in the STI family, was substantially different between vvMLP and STI.

     "abstract": "The fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS II) is a vital process in bacteria and regarded as an attractive pathway for the development of potential antimicrobial agents. In this study, we report 1,4-naphthoquinone (NPQ) as a dual inhibitor of two key enzymes of FAS II pathway, namely FabD (Malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase) and FabZ (\u03b2-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase). Mode of inhibition of NPQ was found to be non-competitive for both enzymes with IC50 of 26.67\u202f\u03bc\u039c and 23.18\u202f\u03bc\u039c against McFabZ and McFabD respectively. Conformational changes in secondary and tertiary structures marked by the loss of helical contents were observed in both enzymes upon NPQ binding. The fluorescence quenching was found to be static with a stable ground state complex formation. ITC based studies have shown that NPQ is binding to McFabZ with a stronger affinity (~1.5\u00d7) as compared to McFabD. Molecular docking studies have found that NPQ interacts with key residues of both McFabD (Ser209, Arg126, and Leu102) and McFabZ (His74 and Tyr112) enzymes. Both complexes have shown the structural stability during the 20\u202fns run of molecular dynamics based simulations. Altogether, the present study suggests that NPQ scaffold can be exploited as a multi-targeted inhibitor of FAS II pathway, and these biochemical and biophysical findings will further help in the development of potent antibacterial agents targeting FAS II pathway.",

The study revealed a binding site with an overall polarity similar to that of dichloromethane and an internal phase comparable to that of phospholipid membranes with coexisting solid-ordered and liquid-crystalline states. The fluorescence properties of bound Laurdan also revealed that the binding site of SCP2 can accommodate competitively more than one ligand, with micro and nanomolar dissociation constants. The much higher affinity for the second than for the first ligand implies that the most prominent SCP2 species in the cellular context are those occupied by two ligands. Thus SCP2 may carry a highly populated lipid in the background and a second one, specific for the functional purpose of SCP2. Our findings are important for the characterization of SCP2 biological functions and the design of specific inhibitors.",

The longer retention of catalytic activity of the Co2+-enzyme than that of the Mn2+ in human serum is associated with its enhanced therapeutic potential. To understand the basis of this and also to explore the role of a bimetallic center as well as the role of individual metal ions in the stability, we performed a detailed biochemical and biophysical investigation. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of both the holo proteins are found to be significantly higher than the apo form, indicating that an intact bimetallic centre is vital for the enhanced stability of the holo proteins. The Co2+-protein is found to be more stable than that of the Mn2+, which might explain its longer retention of activity observed in the serum. Mutational studies demonstrated that the metal ions are individually crucial for both the enhanced stability and catalytic activity. Furthermore, we investigated the underlying mechanism for the effect of heat activation on the holo protein for higher catalytic activity, which is not yet known for arginases. Our data reveal that heat activation significantly increases the stability of the holo protein through a metal-induced increase in the helical content leading to the formation of a kinetically competent enzyme. Thus, the present study provides an in-depth insight into the significance of heat activation and the role of metal ions in human arginase, which may be useful for better understanding of its therapeutic use.",

     "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E3 (apoE3) is an exchangeable apolipoprotein that plays a critical role in cholesterol homeostasis. The N-terminal (NT) domain of apoE3 (residues 1\u2013191) is folded into a helix bundle comprised of 4 amphipathic \u03b1-helices: H1, H2, H3 and H4, flanked by flexible helices N1 and N2, and Hinge Helix 1 (Hinge H1), at the N-and C-terminal sides of the helix bundle, respectively. The NT domain plays a critical role in binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which eventually leads to lowering of plasma cholesterol levels. In order to be recognized by the LDLR, the helix bundle has to open and undergo a conformational change. The objective of the study was to understand the mechanism of opening of the helix bundle. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) revealed that apoE3 NT domain adopts several disordered and unfolded regions, with H2 exhibiting relatively little protection against exchange-in compared to H1, H3, and H4. Site-directed fluorescence labeling indicated that H2 not only has the highest degree of solvent exposure but also the most flexibility in the helix bundle. It also indicated that the lipoprotein behavior of H1 was significnatly different from that of H2, H3 and H4. These results suggest that the opening of the helix bundle is likely initiated at the flexible end of H2 and the loop linking H2/H3, and involves movement of H2/H3 away from H1/H4. Together, these observations offer mechanistic insight suggesting a regulated helix bundle opening of apoE3 NT domain can be triggered by lipid binding.",

The prion agent contains a pathologically aggregated form of the host prion protein that can transmit infectivity without any bacterial or viral component and is thus difficult to inactivate using disinfection protocols designed for infectious microorganisms. Methods for prion inactivation include treatment with acids, bases, detergents, bleach, prolonged autoclaving and incineration. During these procedures, the sample is often either destroyed or damaged such that further analysis for research purposes is compromised. In this study we show that a straightforward denaturation and in-gel protease digestion protocol used to prepare prion-infected samples for mass spectroscopy leads to the loss of at least 7 logs of prion infectivity, yielding a final product that fails to transmit prion disease in vivo. We further show that the resultant sample remains suitable for mass spectrometry-based protein identifications. Thus, the procedure described can be used to prepare prion-infected samples for mass spectrometry analysis with greatly reduced biosafety concerns.",

     "abstract": "In Brazil, the mucocutaneous form of leishmaniasis, caused by the parasite Leishmania braziliensis, is a widespread and very challenging disease responsible for disfiguration and, in the most severe cases, death. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a ubiquitous molecular chaperone playing a pivotal role in the folding process of client proteins, and therefore its activity is fundamental for cell survival and proliferation. Since the chaperone activity requires ATP hydrolysis, molecules able to occupy the ATP binding pocket in the protein N-terminal domain (NTD) act as Hsp90 inhibitors. The development of selective molecules targeting the ATPase site of protozoan Hsp90 is tricky for the high homology with the human Hsp90 NTD (hNTD). Notably, only the human Lys112 is replaced by Arg97 in the L. braziliensis enzyme. Recently, this difference has been probed to design selective inhibitors targeting parasite Hsp90s. Here, a reliable protocol for expression and purification of LbHsp90-NTD (LbNTD) was developed but its structural characterization was unsuccessful. The role of Arg97 in LbNTD was hence probed by means of the \u201cleishmanized\u201d K112R variant of hNTD\u03b1. To deeply investigate the role of this residue, also the hNTD\u03b1 K112A variant was generated. Structural studies performed on hNTD\u03b1 and its variants using various ADP and ATP analogues and cAMP revealed that this residue is not crucial for nucleotide binding. This finding strongly suggests that Arg97 in LbNTD and more generally the conserved arginine residue in parasite Hsp90s are not exploitable for the development of selective inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "The stoichiometry of a ligand binding reaction to a protein is given by a parameter (n). The value of this parameter may indicate the presence of protein monomer or dimers in the binding complex. Members of the lipocalin superfamily show variation in the stoichiometry of binding to ligands. In some cases the stoichiometry parameter (n) has been variously reported for the same protein as mono- and multimerization of the complex. Prime examples include retinol binding protein, \u03b2 lactoglobulin and tear lipocalin, also called lipocalin-1(LCN1). Recent work demonstrated the stoichiometric ratio for ceramide:tear lipocalin varied (range n\u202f=\u202f0.3\u20130.75) by several different methods. The structure of ceramide raises the intriguing possibility of a lipocalin dimer complex with each lipocalin molecule attached to one of the two alkyl chains of ceramide. The stoichiometry of the ceramide-tear lipocalin binding complex was explored in detail using size exclusion chromatography and time resolved fluorescence anisotropy. Both methods showed consistent results that tear lipocalin remains monomeric when bound to ceramide. Delipidation experiments suggest the most likely explanation is that the low \u2018n\u2019 values result from prior occupancy of the binding sites by native ligands. Lipocalins such as tear lipocalin that have numerous binding partners are particularly prone to an underestimated apparent stoichiometry parameter.",

Although the solution NMR structure of human TGIF1-HD has been reported previously, little is known about its DNA binding mechanism. NMR titrations have been extensively used to study mechanisms of ligand binding to target proteins; however, an intermediate exchange occurred predominantly between TGIF1-HD in the free and bound states when titrated with the consensus DNA, which resulted in poor-quality NMR spectra and precluded further exploration of its interaction interface and conformational dynamics. Here, the helix \u03b13 of TGIF1-HD was speculated as the specific DNA binding interface by hydrogen\u2013deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments, and subsequently confirmed by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) spectroscopy. In addition, simultaneous conformational changes in other regions, including \u03b11 and \u03b12, were induced by DNA binding, explaining the observation of chemical shift perturbations from extensive residues besides those located in \u03b13.

The lack of a natively folded structure in intrinsically disordered proteins under physiological conditions results in their aggregation and fibrillation that gives rise to a number of diseases. We have investigated the effect of a series of polyols, ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol, erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol on the fibrillation pathway of recombinant human \u03b3-Synuclein, used as a model, for an IDP known to form fibrils that play a role in neurodegeneration and cancer. With an increase in the number of \u2013OH groups in polyols except EG, we observe a decrease in lag time for fibrillation at equimolar concentrations, suggesting stronger preferential exclusion of polyols that promotes \u03b3-Syn self-association and oligomerization. The polyols act early during nucleation and their diverse effect on the rate of fibrillation suggests the role of favourable solvent-side chain interactions. With increasing \u2013OH group, polyols stabilize the natively unfolded conformation of \u03b3-Syn under non-fibrillating conditions and delay the structural transition to characteristic \u03b2-sheet structure by forming an \u03b1-helical intermediate during fibrillation. The results, overall suggest that the effect of osmolytes on IDPs is much more complex than their effect on globular protein stability and aggregation and a fine balance between the dominant unfavourable osmolyte-peptide backbone and favourable osmolyte-charged side chain interactions would govern their stability and aggregation properties.",

We applied this method to follow heat-induced aggregation of bovine \u03b1- and \u03b3B-crystallin between 60 and 200\u202fmg/ml. We find that at 60\u202f\u00b0C, a temperature where both crystallins still comprise a native tertiary structure, \u03b3B-crystallin aggregated at these high protein concentrations with a time constant of about 30\u201340\u202fh. \u03b1-crystallin remained soluble at 60\u202fmg/ml but formed a transparent gel at 200\u202fmg/ml. This quantitative NMR method can be applied to investigations of other proteins and their mixtures under various aggregation conditions.",

Here, we investigate how ganglioside lipids, present in high amounts in neurons and exosomes, influence the aggregation kinetics of \u03b1-synuclein. Gangliosides, as well as, other anionic lipid species with small or large headgroups were found to induce conformational changes of \u03b1-synuclein monomers and catalyse their aggregation at mildly acidic conditions. Although the extent of this catalytic effect was slightly higher for gangliosides, the results imply that charge interactions are more important than headgroup chemistry in triggering aggregation. In support of this idea, uncharged lipids with large headgroups were not found to induce any conformational change and only weakly catalyse aggregation. Intriguingly, aggregation was also triggered by free ganglioside headgroups, while these caused no conformational change of \u03b1-synuclein monomers. Our data reveal that partially folded \u03b1-synuclein helical intermediates are not required species in triggering of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation.",

     "abstract": "The bacterial acyl protein thioesterase (APT) homologue FTT258 from the gram-negative pathogen Francisella tularensis exists in equilibrium between a closed and open state. Interconversion between these two states is dependent on structural rearrangement of a dynamic loop overlapping its active site. The dynamics and structural properties of this loop provide a simple model for how the catalytic activity of FTT258 could be spatiotemporally regulated within the cell. Herein, we characterized the dual roles of this dynamic loop in controlling its catalytic and membrane binding activity. Using a comprehensive library of loop variants, we determined the relative importance of each residue in the loop to these two biological functions. For the catalytic activity, a centrally located tryptophan residue (Trp66) was essential, with the resulting alanine variant showing complete ablation of enzyme activity. Detailed analysis of Trp66 showed that its hydrophobicity in combination with spatial arrangement defined its essential role in catalysis. Substitution of other loop residues congregated along the N-terminal side of the loop also significantly impacted catalytic activity, indicating a critical role for this loop in controlling catalytic activity. For membrane binding, the centrally located hydrophobic residues played a surprising minor role in membrane binding. Instead general electrostatic interactions regulated membrane binding with positively charged residues bracketing the dynamic loop controlling membrane binding. Overall for FTT258, this dynamic loop dually controlled its biological activities through distinct residues within the loop and this regulation provides a new model for the spatiotemporal control over FTT258 and potentially homologous APT function.",

Siroheme does not work alone but is covalently coupled to a Fe4S4 cluster through one of the cluster's ligands. One long-standing hypothesis predicted from this observation is that the environment of one iron-containing cofactor influences the properties of the other. We tested this hypothesis by identifying three amino acids (F437, M444, and T477) that interact with the Fe4S4 cluster and probing the effect of altering them to alanine on the function and structure of the resulting enzymes by use of activity assays, X-ray crystallographic analysis, and EPR spectroscopy.

In order to probe into the matter, we have examined minichaperone-mediated folding of a large aggregation prone protein Maltodextrin-glucosidase (MalZ). The key objective was to identify whether MalZ exists free in solution, or remains bound to, or cycling on and off the minichaperone during the refolding process. When GroES was introduced during refolding process, production of the native MalZ was inhibited. We also observed the same findings with a trap mutant of GroEL, which stably captures a predominantly non-native MalZ released from minichaperone during refolding process, but does not release it. Tryptophan and ANS fluorescence measurements indicated that refolded MalZ has the same structure as the native MalZ, but that its structure when bound to minichaperone is different. Surface plasmon resonance measurements provide an estimate for the equilibrium dissociation constant KD for the MalZ-minichaperone complex of 0.21\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04\u202f\u03bcM, which are significantly higher than for most GroEL clients. This showed that minichaperone interacts loosely with MalZ to allow the protein to change its conformation and fold while bound during the refolding process. These observations suggest that the minichaperone works by carrying out repeated cycles of binding aggregation-prone protein MalZ in a relatively compact conformation and in a partially folded but active state, and releasing them to attempt to fold in solution.",

     "abstract": "Thermotoga maritima Arginine Binding Protein (TmArgBP) is a valuable candidate for arginine biosensing in diagnostics. This protein is endowed with unusual structural properties that include an extraordinary thermal/chemical stability, a domain swapped structure that undergoes large tertiary and quaternary structural transition, and the ability to form non-canonical oligomeric species. As the intrinsic stability of TmArgBP allows for extensive protein manipulations, we here dissected its structure in two parts: its main body deprived of the swapping fragment (TmArgBP20-233) and the C-terminal peptide corresponding to the helical swapping element. Both elements have been characterized independently or in combination using a repertoire of biophysical/structural techniques. Present investigations clearly indicate that TmArgBP20-233 represents a better scaffold for arginine sensing compared to the wild-type protein. Moreover, our data demonstrate that the ligand-free and the ligand-bound forms respond very differently to this helix deletion. This drastic perturbation has an important impact on the ligand-bound form of TmArgBP20-233 stability whereas it barely affects its ligand-free state. The crystallographic structures of these forms provide a rationale to this puzzling observation. Indeed, the arginine-bound state is very rigid and virtually unchanged upon protein truncation. On the other hand, the flexible ligand-free TmArgBP20-233 is able to adopt a novel state as a consequence of the helix deletion. Therefore, the flexibility of the ligand-free form endows this state with a remarkable robustness upon severe perturbations. In this scenario, TmArgBP dissection highlights an intriguing connection between destabilizing/stabilizing effects and the overall flexibility that could operate also in other proteins.",

     "abstract": "Protein engineering by directed evolution can alter proteins' structures, properties, and functions. However, membrane proteins, despite their importance to living organisms, remain relatively unexplored as targets for protein engineering and directed evolution. This gap in capabilities likely results from the tendency of membrane proteins to aggregate and fail to overexpress in bacteria cells. For example, the membrane protein caveolin-1 has been implicated in many cell signaling pathways and diseases, yet the full-length protein is too aggregation-prone for detailed mutagenesis, directed evolution, and biophysical characterization. Using a phage-displayed library of full-length caveolin-1 variants, directed evolution with alternating subtractive and functional selections isolated a full-length, soluble variant, termed cavsol, for expression in E. coli. Cavsol folds correctly and binds to its known protein ligands HIV gp41, the catalytic domain of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, and the polymerase I and transcript release factor. As expected, cavsol does not bind off-target proteins. Cellular studies show that cavsol retains the parent protein's ability to localize at the cellular membrane. Unlike truncated versions of caveolin, cavsol forms large, oligomeric complexes consisting of approximately >50 monomeric units without requiring additional cellular components. Cavsol's secondary structure is a mixture of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that cavsol binds to gp41 and PKA with low micromolar binding affinity (KD). In addition to the insights into caveolin structure and function, the approach applied here could be generalized to other membrane proteins.",

Formation of synthetic or in vitro PrPSc can occur through on-pathway toxic oligomers. Similarly, toxic and infectious oligomers identified in cell and animal models of prion disease indicate that soluble oligomers are likely intermediates in the formation of insoluble PrPSc. Despite the critical role of prion oligomers in disease progression, little is known about their structure. In order, to obtain structural insight into prion oligomers, we generated oligomers by shaking-induced conversion of recombinant, monomeric prion protein PrPc (spanning residues 90\u2013231). We then obtained two-dimensional solution NMR spectra of the PrPc monomer, a 40% converted oligomer, and a 94% converted oligomer. Heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (1H\u201315N) studies revealed that, in comparison to monomeric PrPc, the oligomer has intense amide peak signals in the N-terminal (residues 90\u2013114) and C-terminal regions (residues 226\u2013231). Furthermore, a core region with decreased mobility is revealed from residues ~127 to 225. Within this core oligomer region with decreased mobility, there is a pocket of increased amide peak signal corresponding to the middle of \u03b1-helix 2 and the loop between \u03b1-helices 2 and 3 in the PrPc monomer structure. Using high-resolution solution-state NMR, this work reveals detailed and divergent residue-specific changes in soluble oligomeric models of PrP.",

Several structural intermediates were formed during the incubation of CPC with glucose (day 4, 8, 12, & 16) as revealed by circular dichroism (CD), altered intrinsic fluorescence, and high ANS binding. Further incubation of CPC with glucose (day 21) formed abundant \u03b2 structures as revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CD analysis which may be due to the aggregation of protein. High thioflavin T fluorescence intensity and increased Congo red absorbance together with enhanced turbidity and Rayleigh scattering by this modified form confirmed the aggregation. Electron microscopy finally provided the valid physical authentication about the presence of aggregate structures. Functional inactivation of glucose incubated CPC was also observed with time. Single cell electrophoresis of lymphocytes and plasmid nicking assays in the presence of modified CPC showed the DNA damage which confirmed its biological toxicity.

In this context, proteins that are secreted, in vitro during parasite growth under defined conditions, can be explored as potential tool for studying their roles in parasite survival inside host and disease pathogenesis. From the last few years, various approaches have been exploited to identify the proteins secreted out by the parasites under defined conditions at particular stage or time.

It shows mild F-actin depolymerizing activity and stable interaction with F-actin with a Kd of ~5.0\u202f\u03bcM. It inhibits the rate of the nucleotide exchange in a dose dependent manner.On the basis of structure, dynamics, and biochemical activity, Twinstar can be taken to execute its biochemical role by facilitating directional growth and maintenance of length of actin filaments.This study characterizes the structure, backbone dynamics, and biochemical activities of Twinstar of Drosophila, which provides an insight into the regulation of actin dynamics in the member of phylum insecta.",

     "abstract": "Allosteric interactions of the Hsp90 chaperones with cochaperones and diverse protein clients can often exhibit distinct asymmetric features that determine regulatory mechanisms and cellular functions in many signaling networks. The recent crystal structures of the mitochondrial Hsp90 isoform TRAP1 in complexes with ATP analogs have provided first evidence of significant asymmetry in the closed dimerized state that triggers independent activity of the chaperone protomers, whereby preferential hydrolysis of the buckled protomer is followed by conformational flipping between protomers and hydrolysis of the second protomer. Despite significant insights in structural characterizations of the TRAP1 chaperone, the atomistic details and mechanics of allosteric interactions that couple sequential ATP hydrolysis with asymmetric conformational switching in the TRAP1 protomers remain largely unknown. In this work, we explored atomistic and coarse-grained simulations of the TRAP1 dimer structures in combination with the ensemble-based network modeling and perturbation response scanning of residue interaction networks to probe salient features underlying allosteric signaling mechanism. This study has revealed that key effector sites that orchestrate allosteric interactions occupy the ATP binding region and N-terminal interface of the buckled protomer, whereas the main sensors of allosteric signals that drive functional conformational changes during ATPase cycle are consolidated near the client binding region of the straight protomer, channeling the energy of ATP hydrolysis for client remodeling. The community decomposition analysis of the interaction networks and reconstruction of allosteric communication pathways in the TRAP1 structures have quantified mechanism of allosteric regulation, revealing control points and interactions that coordinate asymmetric switching during ATP hydrolysis.",

     "abstract": "Living organisms on the Earth almost exclusively use l-amino acids for the molecular architecture of proteins. The biological occurrence of d-amino acids is rare, although their functions in various organisms are being gradually understood. A possible explanation for the origin of biomolecular homochirality is the delivery of enantioenriched molecules via extraterrestrial bodies, such as asteroids and comets on early Earth. For the asymmetric formation of amino acids and their precursor molecules in interstellar environments, the interaction with circularly polarized photons is considered to have played a potential role in causing chiral asymmetry. In this review, we summarize recent progress in the investigation of chirality transfer from chiral photons to amino acids involving the two major processes of asymmetric photolysis and asymmetric synthesis. We will discuss analytical data on cometary and meteoritic amino acids and their potential impact delivery to the early Earth. The ongoing and future ambitious space missions, Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx, ExoMars 2020, and MMX, are scheduled to provide new insights into the chirality of extraterrestrial organic molecules and their potential relation to the terrestrial homochirality.

From these three types of isomerized aspartic acid residues, particularly d-\u03b2-Asp has been widely detected in aging tissue. In this study, we computationally investigated the cyclization of \u03b1- and \u03b2-Asp residues to form succinimide with dihydrogen phosphate ion as a catalyst (H2PO4\u2212). We performed the study using B3LYP/6-31\u00a0+\u00a0G(d,p) density functional theory calculations. The comparison of the activation barriers of both residues is discussed. All the calculations were performed using model compounds in which an \u03b1/\u03b2-Asp-Gly sequence is capped with acetyl and methylamino groups on the N- and C-termini, respectively. Moreover, H2PO4\u2212 catalyzes all the steps of the succinimide formation (cyclization-dehydration) acting as a proton-relay mediator. The calculated activation energy barriers for succinimide formation of \u03b1- and \u03b2-Asp residues are 26.9 and 26.0\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01, respectively. Although it was experimentally confirmed that \u03b2-Asp has higher stability than \u03b1-Asp, there was no clear difference between the activation barriers. Therefore, the higher stability of \u03b2-Asp residue than \u03b1-Asp residue may be caused by an entropic effect associated with the succinimide formation.",

     "abstract": "Many post-translational modifications such as oxidation, deamidation and isomerization of amino acid residues occur in lens proteins with aging. One such modification, isomerization of aspartate in lens \u03b1-crystallin, has been well studied by amino acid enantiomer analysis and LC-MS/MS. LC-MS/MS can quickly and easily identify D- and L-amino acid-containing peptides without purification of lens protein mixtures. However, this method has a weak point in that isomeric peptides of major components are detected predominantly, while those from minor proteins such as \u03b2- and \u03b3-crystallins have not been fully determined. Therefore, the isomerization of amino acid residues in \u03b2- and \u03b3-crystallin families has been little studied. To solve those problems and detect the isomerization of Asp residues in lens \u03b2B2-crystallin, the main component of the \u03b2-crystallin family, here we have developed steps for sample fractionation before d/l analysis based on either LC-MS/MS or amino acid derivatization to diastereoisomers followed by RP-HPLC. To capture a small amount of peptide, a multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method based on quadrupole MS/MS (Q-MS) was applied to the water-soluble fraction of whole lens. The d/l analysis based on both LC-MS/MS and diastereoisomer formation showed the presence of multiple isomerization sites, including Asp4, Asp83, Asp92 and Asp192, in \u03b2B2-crystallin in aged lens. These isomerization sites were confirmed to exist in an age-dependent manner by Q-MS. Synthetic peptides of \u03b2B2-crystallin containing different isomers of Asp showed differential elution profiles during RP-HPLC, indicating differences in the local structure or hydrophobicity of Asp-isomer-containing peptides. These results suggest that the isomerization sites are distributed on exposed regions of \u03b2B2-crystallin and thus likely to have an impact on crystallin subunit\u2013subunit interactions, induce abnormal crystallin aggregation, and contribute to senile cataract formation in aged lens.",

     "abstract": "Recently, non-enzymatic stereoinversions of aspartic acid (Asp) residues in proteins and peptides have been reported. Here, we performed replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations of model peptides (exon 6, 26A-1, and 26A-2) extracted from elastin to investigate their structural features, thereby revealing the factor that influences stereoinversions. For REMD trajectories, we calculated distances between carboxyl carbon in Asp and amide nitrogen in the (n\u202f+\u202f1) residue (CN distances). Because bond formation between carbon and nitrogen is indispensable to the formation of a succinimide intermediate the distance between them seems to play an important role in stereoinversion. Moreover, we calculated polar surface areas (PSAs) for the trajectories, finding that CN distances and PSA were different for each peptide, with the longest CN distance and smallest PSA observed for exon 6 peptide, where stereoinversion of Asp is the slowest. Although the average CN distance was shorter for exon 26A-1 peptide than for exon 26A-2 peptide, the number of conformations with CN distances <3.0\u202f\u00c5 was greater for exon 26A-2 peptide than for exon 26A-1 peptide. Furthermore, PSA for amide nitrogen of the (n\u202f+\u202f1) residue was larger for exon 26A-2 peptide than for exon 26A-1 peptide. These results indicated that the flexibility of Asp and (n\u202f+\u202f1) residues and hydrophilicity of peptides, especially in the (n\u202f+\u202f1) residue, play important roles in the stereoinversion of Asp.

     "abstract": "Bombinin H4 is an antimicrobial peptide that was isolated from the toad Bombina variegata. Bombinin H family peptides are active against gram-positive, gram-negative bacteria, and fungi as well as the parasite Leishmania. Among them, bombinin H4 (H4), which contains d-allo-isoleucine (d-allo-Ile) as the second residue in its sequence, is the most active, and its l-isomer is bombinin H2 (H2). H4 has a significantly lower LC50 than H2 against Leishmania. However, the atomic-level mechanism of the membrane interaction and higher activity of H4 has not been clarified. In this work, we investigated the behavior of the conformations and interactions of H2 and H4 with the Leishmania membrane using 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The generation of isotropic 31P NMR signals depending on the peptide concentration indicated the abilities of H2 and H4 to exert antimicrobial activity via membrane disruption. The VCD experiment and density functional theory calculation confirmed the different stability and conformations of the N-termini of H2 and H4. MD simulations revealed that the N-terminus of H4 is more stable than that of H2 in the membrane, in line with the VCD experiment data. VCD and MD analyses demonstrated that the first l-Ile and second d-allo-Ile of H4 tend to take a cis conformation. These residues function as an anchor and facilitate the easy winding of the helical conformation of H4 in the membrane. It may assist to quickly reach to the threshold concentration of H4 on the Leishmania membrane.

     "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium utilizes a wide range of growth substrates, some of which are relatively novel. One of these unusual substrates is d-glucosaminate, which is metabolized by the enzymes encoded in the dga operon. d-Glucosaminate is transported and converted to d-glucosaminate-6-phosphate (G6P) by a phosphotransferase system, composed of DgaABCD. The protein product of dgaE, d-glucosaminate-6-phosphate ammonia lyase (DGL), converts G6P to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate, which undergoes a retroaldol reaction catalyzed by the DgaF protein to give d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate. We have now developed an improved synthesis of G6P which gives a higher yield. The DGL reaction is of mechanistic interest because it is one of only a few enzymes in the pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP) dependent aminotransferase superfamily known to catalyze reaction of a d-amino acid substrate. The pH dependence of DGL shows an optimum at 7.5\u20138.5, suggesting a requirement for a catalytic base. \u03b1-Glycerophosphate and inorganic phosphate are weak competitive inhibitors, with Ki values near 30\u00a0mM, and d-serine is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor. We have found in rapid-scanning stopped-flow experiments that DGL reacts rapidly with its substrate to form a quinonoid intermediate with \u03bbmax\u00a0=\u00a0480\u00a0nm, within the dead time (ca. 2\u00a0msec), which then rapidly decays (k\u00a0=\u00a0279\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) to an intermediate with absorption between 330 and 350\u00a0nm, probably an aminoacrylate complex. We suggest a mechanism for DGL and propose that the unusual stereochemistry of the DGL reaction requires a catalytic base poised on the opposite face of the PLP-substrate complex from the other members of the aminotransferase superfamily.",

Thus, appropriate regulation of d-aspartate is believed to be important for maintaining proper neural activity in the nervous system. Accordingly, much attention has been paid to the role(s) of DDO in the metabolism of d-aspartate in vivo, and the physiological functions of DDO have been actively investigated using experimental rats and mice.

Its activity is modulated by several ligands, including ATP, divalent cations and protein interactors. The murine orthologue is inhibited by S-nitrosylation at Cys113, a residue adjacent to the ATP binding site. We found that the time course of inhibition of human serine racemase by S-nitrosylation is markedly biphasic, with a fast phase associated with the reaction of Cys113. Unlike the murine enzyme, two additional cysteine residues, Cys269, unique to the human orthologue, and Cys128 were also recognized as S-nitrosylation sites through mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis.

     "abstract": "In the brain, the enzyme d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO) catalyzes the oxidative deamination of d-serine, a main positive modulator of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDAR). Dysregulation in d-serine signaling is implicated in the NMDAR dysfunctions observed in various brain diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia. A strain of ddY mice lacking DAAO activity due to the G181R substitution (DAAOG181R mice) and exhibiting increased d-serine concentration as compared to wild-type mice shows altered pain response, improved adaptative learning and cognitive functions, and larger hippocampal long-term potentiation. In past years, this mice line has been used to shed light on physiological and pathological brain functions related to NMDAR. Here, we decided to introduce the corresponding substitution in human DAAO (hDAAO). The recombinant G183R hDAAO is produced as an inactive apoprotein: the substitution alters the protein conformation that negatively affects the ability to bind the flavin cofactor in the orientation required for hydride-transfer during catalysis. At the cellular level, the overexpressed G183R hDAAO is not fully targeted to peroxisomes, forms protein aggregates showing a strong colocalization with ubiquitin, and significantly (7-fold) increases both the d-serine cellular concentration and the D/(D\u00a0+\u00a0L)-serine ratio. Taken together, our investigation warrants caution in using DAAOG181R mice: the abolition of enzymatic activity is coupled to DAAO aggregation, a central process in different pathological conditions. The effect due to G181R substitution in DAAO could be misleading: the effects due to impairment of d-serine degradation overlap with those related to aggregates accumulation.",

     "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and debilitating condition that is often refractory to standard frontline antidepressant therapy. A promising new approach to PTSD therapy is administration of a single sub-anesthetic dose of (R,S)-ketamine (Ket). The treatment produces rapid and significant therapeutic response, which lasts for only 4\u20137\u202fdays. In one of our studies, the mean duration of response was increased to 33\u202fdays when Ket administration was combined with a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, Trauma Interventions using Mindfulness Based Extinction and Reconsolidation (TIMBER). We now report the results from a 20-patient study, which examined the duration of sustained response with combined TIMBER-Ket therapy, TIMBER-K arm, relative to the response observed in a placebo-controlled arm, TIMBER-P. A significant difference in the duration of response was observed between TIMBER-K and TIMBER-P arms: 34.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f19.12\u202fdays and 16.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.39\u202fdays, respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.022). Previous studies identified a negative correlation between antidepressant response to Ket and basal plasma concentrations of d-serine (DSR). In this study, the basal DSR levels positively correlated with the pre-treatment severity of PTSD symptoms (Pearson's r\u202f=\u202f0.42, p\u202f=\u202f0.07) and patients with basal DSR level\u202f\u2265\u202f3.5\u202f\u03bcM displayed not only higher PTSD severity but also shorter duration of response. The data indicate that basal DSR levels may serve as a biomarker of the severity of PTSD symptoms and as a predictor of clinical response.

     "abstract": "Proteins are composed exclusively of l-amino acids. Among elderly individuals, however, d-aspartic acid (d-Asp) residues have been found in eye lens and brain, as well as in other tissues. The presence of d-Asp may change the higher-order structure of a protein, which in turn may have a role in age-related disorders such as cataract and Alzheimer's disease. d-Asp results from the spontaneous racemization of Asp residues in susceptible proteins. During aging, natural l\u03b1-Asp residues in proteins are non-enzymatically isomerized via a succinimidyl intermediate to l-\u03b2-, d-\u03b1- and d-\u03b2-isomers. This isomerization does not happen uniformly, but instead occurs at specific residues that are susceptible to isomerization due to their sequence or structural context. Thus, it is necessary to establish the nature of each individual Asp residue in susceptible proteins. Recently, a new method based on LC-MS/MS for the analysis of Asp isomerization at specific protein sites has been described. In this review, we first show that the homochirality of amino acids in proteins is not guaranteed throughout life. We then describe the development of a new method for protein-bound d-amino acid analysis, and discuss the negative influence that d-Asp has on protein structure and function.",

NgGAPDH residue Met35 presents an extended side chain, closer to the cofactor adenine ring than corresponding (different) residues and conformations found in some parasitic protozoa and the human GAPDHs.

Herein, we describe the separation and characterization of MTs differentially modified with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The full-length recombinant MT isoform 1a as well as is isolated domain fragments were first alkylated, then separated on column with subsequent detection by ultra-high resolution ESI-MS. Different behavior was observed for the three peptides with the full-length protein and the isolated \u03b1-domain exhibiting similar separation characteristics. For the isolated \u03b2-domain, the smallest peptide with 9 cysteines in the sequence, each alkylated species was well separated, indicating large changes in protein conformation. For the full-length (20 cysteines in the sequence) and \u03b1-domain (11 cysteiens in the sequence) peptides, the apo- and lightly alkylated species co-eluted, indicating similar structural properties. However, the more extensively alkylated species were well separated from each other, indicating the sequential unfolding of the apo-MT peptides and providing evidence for the mechanistic explanation for the cooperative alkylation reaction observed for NEM and other bulky and hydrophobic alkylation reagents. We show for the first time clear separation of highly similar MTs, differing by only +125\u202fDa, and can infer structural properties from the LC-MS data, analogous to more complicated and less ubiquitous ion-mobility experiments. The data suggest a compact globular structure for each of the apo-MTs, but where the \u03b2-domain is more easily unfolded. This differential folding stability may have biological implications in terms of domain-specific participation of MT in cellular redox chemistry and resulting metal release.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells consume more glucose than normal human cells and convert most glucose into lactate. It has been proposed that deregulated glycolysis is triggered by the posttranslational modification of 85\u202fkDa muscle-type 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-M) which is cleaved by a specific protease to form shorter, highly active, feedback-inhibition-resistant PFK-M fragments.To find the protease involved in PFK-M modification, analyses of the protease target sites on the human PFK-M enzyme yielding 45\u201347\u202fkDa fragments were performed in silico. The results suggested that an enzyme in the kallikrein (KLK) family may be involved. Kallikreins can be self-activated in the cytosol and are often overexpressed in cancer cells. After incubating the internally quenched FRET peptide with a sequence characteristic of the target site, along with the active KLK6, the cleavage of the peptide was observed. The ability of KLK6 to cleave native PFK-M and form highly active citrate-resistant 45\u202fkDa fragments was further confirmed by enzymatic tests and SDS-PAGE. A role of KLK6 in the posttranslational modification of native PFK-M was ultimately confirmed in vivo. A yeast strain that encoded native human PFK-M as the only PFK1 enzyme was additionally transformed with proKLK6 or KLK6 genes under the control of an inducible promoter. The transformants growth rate was found to increase after the induction of proKLK6 gene expression as compared to the strain with the native PFK-M enzyme.KLK6 may be the key protease involved in the modification of PFK-M and trigger deregulated glycolytic flux in cancer cells.",

LC20 is phosphorylated canonically by myosin light chain kinase in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner at S19. The diphosphorylation of LC20 at T18 and S19 has been observed in smooth muscle tissues. Given that the phosphorylation of LC20 is positively correlated with tension development, the molar stoichiometry of LC20 phosphorylation is commonly profiled as a measure of smooth muscle contractility. Herein, we describe a novel multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-mass spectrometry (MS) approach for the quantification of LC20 phosphorylation at T18 and S19. Unique precursor as well as y- and b-ion transitions were identified for unphosphorylated LC20-(TS), monophosphorylated LC20-(TpS) and diphosphorylated LC20-(pTpS) peptides. The MRM-MS assay could accurately define molar phosphorylation stoichiometries of S19 and T18 over a broad range (i.e., 0\u20132\u202fmol\u202fP/mol LC20). Correlations of the results for two quantification techniques indicate that the MRM-MS assay performs equally to Phos-tag SDS-PAGE for the determination of LC20 phosphorylation stoichiometry in arterial tissue samples. The MRM-MS technique provides a robust alternative to antibody-based detection systems for the quantification of LC20 phosphorylation.",

     "abstract": "We compare the binding of an inhibitor with that of a natural peptide to Ca2+ saturated calmodulin (holo-CaM). As inhibitor we have chosen trifluoperazine (TFP) that is inducing a huge conformational change of holo-CaM from the open dumbbell-shaped to the closed globular conformation upon binding. On the other hand, melittin is used as model peptide, which is a well-known natural binding partner of holo-CaM. The experiments are carried out as a function of pressure to reveal the contribution of volume or packing effects to the stability of the calmodulin-ligand complexes. From high-pressure Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, we find that the holo-CaM/TFP complex has a much higher pressure stability than the holo-CaM/melittin complex. Although the analysis of the secondary structure of holo-CaM (without and with ligand) indicates no major changes up to several kbar, pressure-induced exposure of \u03b1-helices to water is most pronounced for holo-CaM without ligand, followed by holo-CaM/melittin and then holo-CaM/TFP. Moreover, structural pressure resistance of the holo-CaM/TFP complex in comparison with the holo-CaM/melittin complex is also clearly visible by higher Ca2+ affinity. F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the Tyr residues of holo-CaM to the Trp residue of melittin even suggests some partial dissociation of the complex under pressure which points to void volumes at the protein-ligand interface and to electrostatic binding. Thus, all results of this study show that the inhibitor TFP binds to holo-CaM with higher packing density than the peptide melittin enabling a favorable volume contribution to the inhibitor efficiency.",

     "publication date": "06-2018",
     "abstract": "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) are enriched in charged and polar residues; and, therefore, electrostatic interactions play a predominant role in their dynamics. In order to remain multi-functional and exhibit their characteristic binding promiscuity, they need to retain considerable dynamic flexibility. At the same time, they also need to accommodate a large number of oppositely charged residues, which eventually lead to the formation of salt-bridges, imparting local rigidity. The formation of salt-bridges therefore opposes the desired dynamic flexibility. Hence, there appears to be a meticulous trade-off between the two mechanisms which the current study attempts to unravel. With this objective, we identify and analyze salt-bridges, both as isolated as well as composite ionic bond motifs, in the molecular dynamic trajectories of a set of appropriately chosen IDPs. Time evolved structural properties of these salt-bridges like persistence, associated secondary structural \u2018order-disorder\u2019 transitions, correlated atomic movements, contribution in the overall electrostatic balance of the proteins have been studied in necessary detail. The results suggest that the key to maintain such a trade-off over time is the continuous formation and dissolution of salt-bridges with a wide range of persistence. Also, the continuous dynamic interchange of charged-atom-pairs (coming from a variety of oppositely charged side-chains) in the transient ionic bonds supports a model of dynamic flexibility concomitant with the well characterized stochastic conformational switching in these proteins. The results and conclusions should facilitate the future design of salt-bridges as a mean to further explore the disordered-globular interface in proteins.",

Here, we explored the behavior of the exogenous ribosomal protein eS26 modified at the C-terminus in the events related to translation in human cells using a doxycycline-inducible HEK293-derived cell line enabling the stable production of C-terminal FLAG-tagged eS26 (eS26FLAG). The production of eS26FLAG in cells was accompanied by a decrease in the endogenous eS26 content although its mRNA level did not change. Exogenous eS26FLAG was able to replace endogenous eS26 in 40S ribosomal subunits, without affecting the assembly and translational activity of 80S ribosomes. However, eS26FLAG-containing ribosome fractions from the respective polysome profile displayed a reduced content of nucleophosmin, a multifunctional protein, which, as is known, is involved in the formation and nuclear export of ribosomal subunits. In general, our data showed that although the appearance of the FLAG tag at the C-terminus of eS26 does not affect translation, it interferes with nucleophosmin incorporation into the 40S subunit, pointing out the importance of the C-terminus integrity of eS26 for nucleophosmin binding. In addition, with the recombinant protein, we demonstrated the binding of nucleophosmin to both isolated eS26 and 40S subunits in the presence of HeLa nuclear extract that phosphorylated the recombinant nucleophosmin. These findings suggest that for nuclear export, nucleophosmin could directly bind to pre-40S subunits in the mRNA exit site region where the C-terminus of eS26 is located.",

Subcellular localization studies confirmed the presence of ARDp in the cytosol, as is the case for ENO and TcMCP-1. Analysis of the ARDp sequence showed that this protein has two domains, an N-terminal ARD and a C-terminal TRP14 (thioredoxin-related protein) domain. The interactions between ENO, TcMCP-1 and ARDp were confirmed for the natural proteins from the trypanosome (using size-exclusion chromatography and co-immunoprecipitation from a cytosolic fraction) and recombinant forms (using ELISA ligand-binding assay and ENO activity assays). The ELISA ligand-binding assays permitted to verify the optimal physicochemical conditions for the interactions (representative for the physiological conditions) and to determine the affinity constants (Kd): ENO/ARDp: 9.54\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.82\u202fnM, ARDp/ENO 10.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.11\u202fnM, and ENO/TcMCP-1: 5.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.61\u202fnM.

Silk fibroin aggregation state as a function of concentration, pH and aging has been characterized employing NMR ordered diffusion spectroscopy. The change of silk fibroin diffusion coefficient over time, which reflects the progress of oligomerization, has been monitored for silk fibroin alone and in the presence of a polycondensed aromatic dye, namely rhodamine 6G. NMR, UV and DLS measurements indicated that rhodamine specifically binds to silk fibroin with a micromolar KD. The reported data reveal, for the first time, that RHD is capable of inhibiting fibroin self-association, thus controlling \u03b2-conformational transition at the basis of fibril formation. The described approach could be extended to further protein systems, allowing better control of the oligomerisation process.",

     "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered protein tau plays a central role in maintaining neuronal network by stabilizing microtubules in axon. Tau reportedly possesses random coil architecture, which is largely inert to alteration in solution conditions. However, the presence of transient compact conformers and residual structure has been evident from previous reports. Also, during Alzheimer's disease, misfolded tau detaches from microtubule and forms ordered filaments, which is the hallmark of the disease. Despite its fundamental role in neuronal physiology and in pathological cascade of several fatal neurodegenerative diseases, tau conformational dynamics remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have explored the effect of ionic strength, temperature and solvent polarity on tau40 conformational preferences using ion mobility mass spectrometry. Investigation of collision cross section revealed that while low ionic strength, elevated temperature and reduced solvent polarity mostly induced partial collapse in tau40 conformers, higher ionic strength led to an expansion of the molecule. Limited proteolysis identified segments of tau40 projection domain and proline-rich region having high order propensity and a C-terminal region having vulnerability for further expansion at altered solution conditions. The high susceptibility for disorder-to-order transition in the above region of the protein might have crucial implication on its role as microtubule spacers, and in cellular signaling cascade.

     "abstract": "We previously found that the enzymatic activity of 3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase from the obligatory piezophilic bacterium Shewanella benthica strain DB21MT-2 (SbIPMDH) was pressure-tolerant up to 100\u202fMPa, but that from its atmospheric congener S. oneidensis strain MR-1 (SoIPMDH) was pressure-sensitive. Such characteristics were determined by only one amino acid residue at position 266, serine (SoIPMDH) or alanine (SbIPMDH) [Y. Hamajima et al. Extremophiles 20: 177, 2016]. In this study, we investigated the structural stability of these enzymes. At pH\u202f7.6, SoIPMDH was slightly more stable against hydrostatic pressure than SbIPMDH, contrary to the physiological pressures of their normal environments. Pressure unfolding of these IPMDHs followed a two-state unfolding model between a native dimer and two unfolded monomers, and the dimer structure was pressure-tolerant up to 200\u202fMPa, employing a midpoint pressure of 245.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1\u202fMPa and a volume change of \u2212225\u202f\u00b1\u202f24\u202fmL\u202fmol\u22121 for the most unstable mutant, SbIPMDH A266S. Thus, their pressure-dependent activity did not originate from structural perturbations such as unfolding or dimer dissociation. Conversely, urea-induced unfolding of these IPMDHs followed a three-state unfolding model, including a dimer intermediate. Interestingly, the first transition was strongly pH-dependent but pressure-independent; however, the second transition showed the opposite pattern. Obtained volume changes due to urea-induced unfolding were almost equal for both IPMDHs, approximately +10 and\u202f\u221230\u202fmL\u202fmol\u22121 for intermediate formation and dimer dissociation, respectively. These results indicated that both IPMDHs have similar structural stability, and a pressure-adaptation mechanism was provided for only the enzymatic activity of SbIPMDH.",

     "abstract": "Small heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is an essential element of the proteostasis network in human cells. The HSP27 monomer coexists with the dimer, which can bind unfolded client proteins. Here, we evaluated the in-cell dimer-monomer equilibrium and its relevance to the binding of client proteins in a normal human vascular endothelial cell line. When cells were treated with a membrane-permeable crosslinker, the protein existed primarily as a free monomer (27\u202fkDa) with a markedly smaller percentage of dimer (54\u202fkDa), hetero-conjugates, and minor smear-like bands. When the protein was crosslinked in a cell-free lysate, two of the hetero-conjugates that were crosslinked in live cells were also detected, but the dimer and other complexes were absent. However, when cells were pretreated with fatty acid (FA) and/or heat (42.5\u202f\u00b0C), dissociation of the dimer was selectively prevented and two types of covalently linked dimers were increased. These changes occurred most prominently in cells treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and heat, which appeared to intensify the heat resistance of the cell. Both the formation of covalently linked dimers and heat resistance were prevented by N-acetylcysteine. By contrast, nearly all of the free monomers in the lysate converted to disulfide bond-linked dimers by a simple, long incubation at 4\u202f\u00b0C. These results strongly suggest that the monomer-dimer equilibrium of HSP27 was inversed between the in-cell and cell-free systems. Temperature- and amphiphile-regulated dimerization was restricted probably due to the low hydration of the in-cell crowding environment.",

Each subunit consists of four domains: the N-terminal heme-nitric oxide oxygen binding (HNOX) domain, a PAS domain, a coiled-coil domain and the C-terminal catalytic domain. Upon activation by the endogenous ligand NO or activating drugs, NOsGC catalyses the conversion of GTP to cGMP. Although several crystal structures of the isolated domains are known, the structure of the full-length enzyme and the interdomain conformational changes during activation remain unsolved to date. In the current study, we performed protein thermal shift assays of purified NOsGC to identify discrete conformational states amenable to further analysis e.g. by crystallisation. A non-hydrolysable substrate analogue binding to the catalytic domain led to a subtle change in melting temperature. An activator drug binding to the HNOX domain led to a small increase. However, the combination of substrate analogue and activator drug led to a marked synergistic increase from 51\u202f\u00b0C to 60\u202f\u00b0C.

Our proteomic approach using high-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis of Triton X-114 fractions of Leptospira interrogans resulted in the identification of 104 proteases out of 130 proteases predicted by MEROPS. In Leptospira approximately 3.5% of the genome complements for proteases, which include catalytic types of metallo-, serine-, cysteine-, aspartic-, threonine- and asparagine- peptidases. Comparison of proteases from different serovars revealed that M04, M09B, M14A, M75, M28A, A01 and U73 protease families are exclusively present in pathogenic form. The M23 and S33 protease families are represented with >14 members in Leptospira. The differential expression under physiological temperature (37\u202f\u00b0C) and osmolarity (300\u202fmOsM) showed that proteases belonging to the catalytic type of Metallo-peptidases are upregulated significantly in pathogenic conditions. In silico prediction and characterization of the proteases revealed that several proteases are membrane anchored and secretory, classical as well as non-classical system. The study demonstrates the diversity and complexity of proteases, while maintaining conservation across the serovars in Leptospira and their differential expression under pathogenic conditions.",

     "abstract": "Retromer complex plays a crucial role in intracellular protein trafficking and is conserved throughout the eukaryotes including malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, where it is partially conserved. The assembly of retromer complex in RBC stages of malarial parasite is extremely difficult to explore because of its complicated physiology, small size, and intra-erythrocytic location. Nonetheless, understanding of retromer assembly may pave new ways for the development of novel antimalarials targeting parasite-specific protein trafficking pathways. Here, we investigated the assembly of retromer complex in P. falciparum, by an immunosensing method through highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique. After taking leads from the bioinformatics search and literature, different interacting proteins were identified and specific antibodies were raised against them. The sensor chip was prepared by covalently linking antibody specific to one component and the whole cell lysate was passed through it in order to trap the interacting complex. Antibodies raised against other interacting components were used to detect them in the trapped complex on the SPR chip. We were able to detect three different components in the retromer complex trapped by the immobilized antibody specific against a different component on a sensor chip. The assay was reproduced and validated in a different two-component CD74-MIF system in mammalian cells. We, thus, illustrate the assembly of retromer complex in P. falciparum through a bio-sensing approach that combines SPR with immunosensing requiring a very small amount of sample from the native source.",

     "abstract": "Ilimaquinone (IQ), a marine sponge metabolite, has been considered as a potential therapeutic agent for various diseases due to its broad range of biological activities. We show that IQ irreversibly inactivates Mycobacterium tuberculosis shikimate kinase (MtSK) through covalent modification of the protein. Inactivation occurred with an apparent second-order rate constant of about 60\u202fM\u22121\u202fs\u22121. Following reaction with IQ, LC-MS analyses of intact MtSK revealed covalent modification of MtSK by IQ, with the concomitant loss of a methoxy group, suggesting a Michael-addition mechanism. Evaluation of tryptic fragments of IQ-derivatized MtSK by MS/MS demonstrated that Ser and Thr residues were most frequently modified with lesser involvement of Lys and Tyr. In or near the MtSK active site, three residues of the P-loop (K15, S16, and T17) as well as S77, T111, and S44 showed evidence of IQ-dependent derivatization. Accordingly, inclusion of ATP in IQ reactions with MtSK partially protected the enzyme from inactivation and limited IQ-based derivatization of K15 and S16. Additionally, molecular docking models for MtSK-IQ were generated for IQ-derivatized S77 and T111. In the latter, ATP was observed to sterically clash with the IQ moiety. Out of three other enzymes evaluated, lactate dehydrogenase was derivatized and inactivated by IQ, but pyruvate kinase and catalase-peroxidase (KatG) were unaffected. Together, these data suggest that IQ is promiscuous (though not entirely indiscriminant) in its reactivity. As such, the potential of IQ as a lead in the development of antitubercular agents directed against MtSK or other targets is questionable.",

We report the three-dimensional structure of a BSH enzyme from the Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecalis (EfBSH) which has manifold higher hydrolase activity compared to other known BSHs and displays unique allosteric catalytic property. The structural analysis revealed reduced secondary structure content compared to other known BSH structures, particularly devoid of an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet in the assembly loop and part of a \u03b2-strand is converted to increase the length of a substrate binding loop 2. The analysis of the substrate binding pocket showed reduced volume owing to altered loop conformations and increased hydrophobicity contributed by a higher ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups present. The aromatic residues F18, Y20 and F65 participate in substrate binding. Thus, their mutation affects enzyme activity. Docking and Molecular Dynamics simulation studies showed effective polar complementarity present for the three hydroxyl (\u2013OH) groups of GCA substrate in the binding site contributing to higher substrate specificity and efficient catalysis. These are unique features characteristics of this BSH enzyme and thought to contribute to its higher activity and specificity towards bile salts as well as allosteric effects. Further, mechanism of autocatalytic processing of Cholylglycine Hydrolases by the excision of an N-terminal Pre-peptide was examined by inserting different N-terminal pre-peptides in EfBSH sequence. The results suggest that two serine residues next to nucleophile cysteine are essential for autocalytic processing to remove precursor peptide. Since pre-peptide is absent in EfBSH the mutation of these serines is tolerated. This suggests that an evolution-mediated subordination of the pre-peptide excision site resulted in loss of pre-peptide in EfBSH and other related Cholylglycine hydrolases.",

     "abstract": "The type II chaperonin CCT is involved in the prevention of the pathogenesis of numerous human misfolding disorders, as it sequesters misfolded proteins, blocks their aggregation and helps them to achieve their native state. In addition, it has been reported that CCT can prevent the toxicity of non-client amyloidogenic proteins by the induction of non-toxic aggregates, leading to new insight in chaperonin function as an aggregate remodeling factor. Here we add experimental evidence to this alternative mechanism by which CCT actively promotes the formation of conformationally different aggregates of \u03b3-tubulin, a non-amyloidogenic CCT client protein, which are mediated by specific CCT-\u03b3-tubulin interactions. The in vitro-induced aggregates were in some cases long fiber polymers, which compete with the amorphous aggregates. Direct injection of unfolded purified \u03b3-tubulin into single-cell zebra fish embryos allowed us to relate this in vitro activity with the in vivo formation of intracellular aggregates. Injection of a CCT-binding deficient \u03b3-tubulin mutant dramatically diminished the size of the intracellular aggregates, increasing the toxicity of the misfolded protein. These results point to CCT having a role in the remodeling of aggregates, constituting one of its many functions in cellular proteostasis.",

Therefore, a molecule that can inhibit the amyloid fibrillation and potentially clear amyloid fibrils is of great therapeutic value. In this manuscript, we investigated the antiamyloidogenic, fibril disaggregating, as well as cell protective effect of an anti-tuberculosis drug, Capreomycin (CN). Aggregation kinetics data, as monitored by ThT fluorescence, inferred that CN retards the insulin amyloid fibrillation by primarily targeting the fibril elongation step with little effect on lag time. Increasing the dose of CN boosted its inhibitory potency. Strikingly, CN arrested the growth of fibrils when added during the elongation phase, and disaggregated mature insulin fibrils. Our Circular Dichroism (CD) results showed that, although CN is not able to maintain the alpha helical structure of protein during fibrillation, reduces the formation of beta sheet rich structure. Furthermore, Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Transmission Electronic Microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed that CN treated samples exhibited different size distribution and morphology, respectively. In addition, molecular docking results revealed that CN interacts with insulin through hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding, and the Hemolytic assay confirmed the non-hemolytic activity of CN on human RBCs.

Actin-binding periods are homologous residues, which repeat along tropomyosin sequence, form tropomyosin-actin interface and determine regulatory functions. To learn how period 3 is involved in tropomyosin functions we examined effects of two mutations in Tpm1.1, I92T and V95A, which have been linked to dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathies characterized respectively by hyper- and hypocontractile phenotypes. In this work the functional consequences of both mutations were studied in vitro by using actin thin filaments reconstituted in the presence of mutant Tpm1.1 homodimers carrying the substitutions in both tropomyosin chains, Tpm1.1 heterodimers with substitution only in one Tpm1.1 chain, and Tpm1.1/Tpm2.2 heterodimers with substitution in Tpm1.1 chain and wild type Tpm2.2 in the second chain. The presence of the substitution I92T decreased the tropomyosin affinity for actin, abolished Ca2+-dependent activation of the actomyosin ATPase, decreased the sensitivity of the tropomyosin-troponin complex to subsaturating Ca2+ concentrations and reduced the cooperativity of the myosin-induced transition of the thin filament to a fully active state. The substitution V95A had opposite effects: increased actin affinity, increased the actomyosin ATPase activity above the level observed for wild type Tpm and increased cooperativity of myosin-induced activation of the thin filaments reconstructed with homo- and heterodimers of tropomyosin. Substitutions I92T and V95A were dominant, but the formation of heterodimers modified the effects observed for homodimers.",

Despite their ecological and biotechnological importance, studies related to microorganisms from this region are limited. Metagenomics leads to exciting discoveries, mainly regarding non-cultivable microorganisms. Herein, we report the discovery of a novel \u03b2-glucosidase (glycoside hydrolase family 1) gene from a metagenome from Lake Poraqu\u00ea in the Amazon region. The gene encodes a protein of 52.9\u202fkDa, named AmBgl-LP, which was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and biochemically and structurally characterized. Although AmBgl-LP hydrolyzed the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (pNP\u03b2G) and the natural substrate cellobiose, it showed higher specificity for pNP\u03b2G (kcat/Km\u202f=\u202f6\u202fs\u22121\u00b7mM\u22121) than cellobiose (kcat/Km\u202f=\u202f0.6\u202fs\u22121\u00b7mM\u22121). AmBgl-LP showed maximum activity at 40\u202f\u00b0C and pH\u202f6.0 when pNP\u03b2G was used as the substrate. Glucose is a competitive inhibitor of AmBgl-LP, presenting a Ki of 14\u202fmM. X-ray crystallography and Small Angle X-ray Scattering were used to determine the AmBgl-LP three-dimensional structure and its oligomeric state. Interestingly, despite sharing similar active site architecture with other structurally characterized GH1 family members which are monomeric, AmBgl-LP forms stable dimers in solution. The identification of new GH1 members by metagenomics might extend our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and diversity of these enzymes, besides enabling us to survey their industrial applications.",

Here, we present the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurB (MtbMurB) with FAD as the prosthetic group at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. There are six molecules in asymmetric unit in the form of dimers. Each protomer can be subdivided into three domains and the prosthetic group, FAD is bound in the active site between domain I and domain II. Comparison of MtbMurB structure with the structures of the Escherichia coli MurB (in complex with UDP-GlcNAc-EP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MurB (in complex with NADPH) showed all three structures share similar domain architecture and residues in the active site. The nicotinamide and the enol pyruvyl moieties are well aligned upon superimposition, both positioned in suitable position for hydride transfer to and from FAD. The comparison studies and MD simulations demonstrate that the two lobes of domain-III become more flexible. The substrates (NADPH and UDP-GlcNAc-EP) binding responsible for open conformation of MurB, suggesting that NADPH and UDP-GlcNAc-EP interactions are conformationally stable.

     "abstract": "Transglycosylation (TG) by family 18 chitinases is of special interest due to the many biological applications of long-chain chitooligosaccharides (CHOS). In the current study, the TG activity of chitinase A from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (StmChiA) was improved through structure-guided mutations within and around the active site. Three independent mutants were created, targeting Trp residues from the \u2212\u00a03 and \u2212\u00a01 subsites and the central catalytic Asp from the DxDxE motif of StmChiA. The former was replaced with Ala and the latter with Asn. Changes in the hydrolytic and TG activities of the enzymes were assessed by monitoring the product profile of each mutant by high-performance liquid chromatography. All three mutants showed increased TG activity. Increased in the higher TG activity of mutant W306A was accompanied by increased hydrolysis. However, this mutant also accumulated substantial amounts of TG products during the first 15\u201330\u00a0min of the reaction. In contrast, mutants D464N and W679A showed reduced hydrolysis, which was accompanied by the gradual accumulation of TG products up to 12\u00a0h. Molecular docking studies with chitohexaose showed that the side chains of Trp residues mediate stacking interactions with sugar residues from the \u2212\u00a03 and \u2212\u00a01 subsites, indicating the importance of these residues in the enzymatic activity of StmChiA. Overall, mutants of the glycon-binding site (W306A and W679A) appear to produce long-chain CHOS more efficiently than the catalytic mutant D464N.",

We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain at a high resolution of 1.66\u00a0\u00c5. The overall fold is a sandwich-like \u03b2-jelly roll architecture like the enzymes in the glycoside hydrolase family 16. The substrate-binding cleft has a length and a width of ~\u00a028 and ~\u00a015\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, which is thought to be capable of accommodating at least six glucopyranose units. Laminarihexaose was placed into the substrate-binding cleft, namely at the subsites +\u00a02 to \u2212\u00a04 from the reducing end, and the complex structure was analyzed using molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and using a rotamer search of the pocket. During the MD simulations, the substrate fluctuated more than the enzyme, where the residues at the subsites toward the non-reducing end fluctuated more than those toward the reducing end. Little conformational change of the protein was observed for the subsites +\u00a01 and +\u00a02, indicating that the glucose's position could be tightly restricted inside the pocket. Substrate binding experiments using isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the binding affinity of laminaritriose was higher than that of laminaribiose and similar to those of other longer laminarioligosaccharides. Taken together, the substrates mainly bind to the subsites \u2212\u00a01 to \u2212\u00a03 with the highest affinity, while the part bound to the reducing end would be hydrolyzed.",

It is an interesting protein not only for drug designing but also to understand the molecular determinants of its substrate specificity. Analysis of the 3D model of L. donovani XPRT (Ld-XPRT) revealed that Ile 209, Glu 215 and Tyr 208 may be responsible for the altered substrate specificity of Ld-XPRT. Comparisons with it's nearest homologue in humans, revealed significant differences between the two. A 28 residue long unique motif was identified in Ld-XPRT, which showed highest fluctuation upon substrate binding during MD simulations. In kinetic analysis, Ld-XPRT could phosphoribosylate xanthine, hypoxanthine and guanine with Km values of 7.27, 8.13, 8.48\u00a0\u03bcM and kcat values of 2.24, 1.82, 1.19\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01 respectively. Out of 159 compounds from docking studies, six compounds were characterized further by fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy and enzyme inhibition studies. Fluorescence quenching experiment was performed to study the binding of inhibitors with Ld-XPRT and dissociation constants were calculated. Four compounds are bi-substrate analogues and show competitive inhibition with both the substrates (Xanthine and PRPP) of Ld-XPRT. The CD spectral analysis revealed that the binding of inhibitors to Ld-XPRT induce change in its tertiary structure, where as its secondary structure pattern remains unchanged. Two Ld-XPRT inhibitors (dGDP and cGMP), which also have ability to inhibit Leishmanial HGPRT, are predicted as potential drug candidates as it can inhibit both the important enzymes of the purine salvage pathway.",

Alanine or serine is typically preferred, which usually do not alter the overall protein stability, when the original cysteine was surface exposed. However, selecting the optimal mutation for cysteines in the hydrophobic core of the protein is more challenging. In this work, the stability of selected Cys mutants of 14-3-3\u03b6 was predicted by free-energy calculations and the obtained data were compared with experimentally determined stabilities. Both the computational predictions as well as the experimental validation point at a significant destabilization of mutants C94A and C94S. This destabilization could be attributed to the formation of hydrophobic cavities and a polar solvation of a hydrophilic side chain. A L12E, M78K double mutant was further studied in terms of its reduced dimerization propensity. In contrast to na\u00efve expectations, this double mutant did not lead to the formation of strong salt bridges, which was rationalized in terms of a preferred solvation of the ionic species. Again, experiments agreed with the calculations by confirming the monomerization of the double mutants. Overall, the simulation data is in good agreement with experiments and offers additional insight into the stability and dimerization of this important family of regulatory proteins.",

Seven distinguished motifs were detected flanking acetylated lysines. Functional annotation analyses indicated diverse biological processes and pathways engaged in lysine acetylation. Remarkably, we found that several key enzymes in storage starch synthesis pathway and the main storage proteins were heavily acetylated. A comprehensive comparison of the rice acetylome, succinylome, ubiquitome and phosphorylome with available published data was conducted. A large number of proteins carrying multiple kinds of modifications were identified and many of these proteins are known to be key enzymes of vital metabolic pathways.

     "abstract": "Environmental stresses are important factors causing male infertility which attracts broad attention. Protein acetylation is a pivotal post-translational modification and modulates diverse physiological processes including spermatogenesis. In this study, we employed quantitative proteomic techniques and bioinformatics tools to analyze the alterations of acetylome profile of mouse testis after heat shock and X-irradiation. Overall, we identified 1139 lysine acetylation sites in 587 proteins in which 1020 lysine acetylation sites were quantified. The Gene Ontology analysis showed that the major acetylated protein groups were involved in generation of precursor metabolites and metabolic processes, and were localized predominantly in cytosolic and mitochondrial. Compared to the control group, 36 sites of 28 acetylated proteins have changed after heat shock, and 49 sites of 43 acetylated proteins for X-ray exposure. Some of the differentially acetylated proteins have been reported to be associated with the progression of spermatogenesis and male fertility. We observed the up-regulated acetylation level change on testis specific histone 2B and heat shock protein upon heat treatment and a sharp decline of acetylation level on histone H2AX under X-ray treatment, suggesting their roles in male germ cells. Notably, the acetylation level on K279 of histone acetyltransferase (Kat7) was down-regulated in both heat and X-ray treatments, indicating that K279 may be a key acetylated site and affect its functions in spermatogenesis. Our results reveal that protein acetylation might add another layer of complexity to the regulation for spermatogenesis, and further functional studies of these proteins will help us elucidate the mechanisms of abnormal spermatogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The myotoxic mechanism for PLA2-like toxins has been proposed recently to be initiated by an allosteric change induced by a fatty acid binding to the protein, leading to the alignment of the membrane docking site (MDoS) and membrane disrupting site (MDiS). Previous structural studies performed by us demonstrated that MjTX-II, a PLA2-like toxin isolated from Bothrops moojeni, presents a different mode of ligand-interaction caused by natural amino acid substitutions and an insertion. Herein, we present four crystal structures of MjTX-II, in its apo state and complexed with fatty acids of different lengths. Analyses of these structures revealed slightly different oligomeric conformations but with both MDoSs in an arrangement that resembles an active-state PLA2-like structure. To explore the structural transitions between apo protein and fatty-acid complexes, we performed Normal Mode Molecular Dynamics simulations, revealing that oligomeric conformations of MjTX-II/fatty acid complexes may be reached in solution by the apo structure. Similar simulations with typical PLA2-like structures demonstrated that this transition is not possible without the presence of fatty acids. Thus, we hypothesize that MjTX-II does not require fatty acids to be active, although these ligands may eventually help in its stabilization by the formation of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, these results complement previous findings for MjTX-II and help us understand its particular ligand-binding properties and, more importantly, its particular mechanism of action, with a possible impact on the design of structure-based inhibitors for PLA2-like toxins in general.",

We performed fluorimetric titrations of the enzyme with PGH inhibitor under osmotic stress conditions, using various concentrations of either osmolyte: sucrose, ethylene glycol or glycine betaine. We also analyze the binding processes under various stressor concentrations using a novel calorimetric methodology that allows \u0394Cp,b determinations in single experiments: Multithermal Titration Calorimetry. The binding constant of the TIM\u2013PGH complex decreased gradually with the concentration of all osmolytes, but at diverse extents depending on the osmolyte nature. According to the osmotic stress theory, this decrease indicates that the number of water molecules associated with the enzyme increases with inhibitor binding, i.e. some solvent molecules became trapped. Additionally, the binding heat capacities became less negative at higher osmolyte concentrations, their final values depending on the osmolyte. These effects were also observed in the TIM\u20132PG complex using sucrose as stressor. Our results strongly suggest that some water molecules became immobilized when the TIM-inhibitor complexes were formed. A computational analysis of the hydration state of the binding site of TIM in both its free state and its complexed form with 2PG or PGH, based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit solvent, showed that the binding site effectively immobilized additional water molecules after binding these inhibitors.",

The dimeric BtGmhB structure was induced by triggering the loss of Zn2\u00a0+via the protonation of cysteine residues at pH 4.8 of the crystallization condition. Similarly, the addition of EDTA also causes the dimerization of BtGmhB. It appears there are two dimeric forms in solution with and without the disulfide bridge mediated by Cys95. The disulfide-free dimer produced by the loss of Zn2\u00a0+ in the short zinc-binding loop is further converted to a stable disulfide-bonded dimer in vitro. Though the two dimeric forms are reversible, both of them are inactive due to a deformation of the active site. Single and triple mutant experiments confirmed the presence of two dimeric forms in vitro. Phosphatase assay results showed that only a zinc-bound monomeric form contains catalytic activity in contrast to the inactive zinc-free dimeric forms. The monomer-to-dimer transition caused by the loss of Zn2\u00a0+ observed in this study is an example of reversal phenomenon caused by artificial proteins containing protein engineered zinc-finger motifs where the monomer-to-dimer transitions occurred in the presence of Zn2\u00a0+. Therefore, this unusual dimerization process may be applicable to designing proteins possessing a short zinc-binding loop with a novel regulatory role.",

The link between this proteinopathy and TDP-43\u2032s intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain is well known, but recently also, this domain has been shown to be involved in the formation of the membraneless organelles that mediate TDP-43\u2032s functions. The mechanisms that underpin the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of these membraneless organelles undergo remain elusive. Crucially though, these factors may be the key to understanding the delicate balance between TDP-43\u2032s physiological and pathological functions. In this study, we used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical methods to demonstrate that an \u03b1-helical component in the centre (residues 320\u2013340) of the C-terminal domain is related to the protein's self-association and LLPS. Systematically analysing ALS-related TDP-43 mutants (G298S, M337V, and Q331K) in different buffer conditions at different temperatures, we prove that this phase separation is driven by hydrophobic interactions but is inhibited by electrostatic repulsion. Based on these findings, we rationally introduced a mutant, W334G, and demonstrate that this mutant disrupts LLPS without disturbing this \u03b1-helical propensity. This tryptophan may serve as a key residue in this protein's LLPS.",

     "abstract": "The coelomic hemoglobin of Amphitrite ornata, termed dehaloperoxidase (DHP), is the first known multifunctional catalytic globin to possess biologically-relevant peroxidase and peroxygenase activities. Although the two isoenzymes of DHP, A and B, differ in sequence by only 5 amino acids out of 137 residues, DHP B consistently exhibits a greater activity than isoenzyme A. To delineate the contributions of each amino acid substitution to the activity of either isoenzyme, the substitutions of the five amino acids were systematically investigated, individually and in combination, using 22 mutants. Biochemical assays and mechanistic studies demonstrated that the mutants that only contained the I9L substitution showed increased i) kcat values (peroxidase activity), ii) 5-Br-indole conversion and binding affinity (peroxygenase activity), and iii) rate of Compound ES formation (enzyme activation). Whereas the X-ray structures of the oxyferrous forms of DHP B (L9I) (1.96\u00a0\u00c5), DHP A (I9L) (1.20\u00a0\u00c5), and WT DHP B (1.81\u00a0\u00c5) showed no significant differences, UV\u2013visible spectroscopy (ASoret/A380 ratio) revealed that the I9L substitution increased the 5-coordinate high-spin heme population characterized by the \u201copen\u201d conformation (i.e., distal histidine swung out of the pocket), which likely favors substrate binding. The positioning of the distal histidine closer to the heme cofactor in the solution state also appears to facilitate activation of DHP via the Compound ES intermediate. Taken together, the studies undertaken here shed light on the structure-function relationship in dehaloperoxidase, but also help to establish the foundation for understanding how enzymatic activity can be tuned in isoenzymes of a multifunctional catalytic globin.",

Its gate loop, located between the proximal and the distal pockets, have been reported to play important role in the export of many antibiotics. This loop location, rigidity and interactions with substrates have led recent reports to suggest that AcrB export mechanism operates in a sequential manner. First the substrate binds the proximal pocket in the access monomer, then it moves to bind the distal pocket in the binding monomer and subsequently it is extruded in the extrusion monomer. Recently, we have demonstrated that the gate loop is not required for the binding of Erythromycin but the integrity of this loop is important for an efficient export of this substrate. However, here we show that the antibiotic susceptibilities of the same AcrB gate loop mutants for Doxorubicin were unaffected, suggesting that this loop is not required for its export, and we demonstrate that this substrate may use principally the tunnel-1, located between transmembranes 8 and 9, more often than previously reported. To further explain our findings, here we address the gate loop mutations effects on AcrB solution energetics (fold, stability, molecular dynamics) and on the in vivo efflux of Erythromycin and Doxorubicin. Finally, we discuss the efflux and the discrepancy between the structural and the functional experiments for Erythromycin in these gate loop mutants.",

Within this work we used a combination of site-directed and truncation mutants of ATIC to independently investigate the binding at these two sites using calorimetry. A single S10W mutation is sufficient to block the IMPCH active site allowing investigation of the effects of mutation on ligand binding in the AICARFT active site. The majority of nucleotide ligands bind selectively at one of the two active sites with the exception of xanthosine monophosphate, XMP, which, in addition to binding in both AICARFT and IMPCH active sites, shows evidence for cooperative binding with communication between symmetrically-related active sites in the two IMPCH domains.

Anthranilate PRT (AnPRT) is a promiscuous PRT that can phosphoribosylate both anthranilate and alternative substrates, and is the only example of a type III PRT. Comparison of the PRPP binding mode in type I, II and III PRTs indicates that AnPRT does not bind PRPP, or nearby metals, in the same conformation as other PRTs. A structure with a stereoisomer of PRPP bound to AnPRT from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) suggests a catalytic or post-catalytic state that links PRib movement to metal movement. Crystal structures of Mtb-AnPRT in complex with PRPP and with varying occupancies of the two metal binding sites, complemented by activity assay data, indicate that this type III PRT binds a single metal-coordinated species of PRPP, while an adjacent second metal site can be occupied due to a separate binding event. A series of compounds were synthesized that included a phosphonate group to probe PRPP binding site. Compounds containing a \u201cbianthranilate\u201d-like moiety are inhibitors with IC50 values of 10\u201360\u00a0\u03bcM, and Ki values of 1.3\u201315\u00a0\u03bcM. Structures of Mtb-AnPRT in complex with these compounds indicate that their phosphonate moieties are unable to mimic the binding modes of the PRib or pyrophosphate moieties of PRPP.

It is increasingly apparent that these play an important role in regulating copper transport in a Cu(I)-responsive manner, but how they do this is unknown. CopA, a Cu(I)-transporter from Bacillus subtilis, contains two N-terminal soluble domains that are closely packed, with inter-domain interactions at two principal regions. Here, we sought to determine the extent to which the domains interact in the absence of their inter-domain covalent linker, and how their Cu(I)-binding properties are affected. Studies of a 1:1 mixture of separate CopAa and CopAb domains showed that the domains do not form a stable complex, with only indirect evidence of a weak interaction between them. Their Cu(I)-binding behaviour was distinct from that of the two domain protein and consistent with a lack of interaction between the domains. Cu(I)-mediated protein association was observed, but this occurred only between domains of the same type. Thus, the inter-domain covalent link between CopAa and CopAb is essential for inter-domain interactions and for Cu(I)-binding behaviour.",

     "abstract": "Agnathans have a globin repertoire that markedly differs from that of jawed (gnathostome) vertebrates. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) harbors at least 18 hemoglobin, two myoglobin, two globin X, and one cytoglobin genes. However, agnathan hemoglobins and myoglobins are not orthologous to their cognates in jawed vertebrates. Thus, blood-based O2 transport and muscle-based O2 storage proteins emerged twice in vertebrates from a tissue-globin ancestor. Notably, the sea lamprey displays three switches in hemoglobin expression in its life cycle, analogous to hemoglobin switching in vertebrates. To study the functional changes associated with the evolution and ontogenesis of distinct globin types, we determined O2 binding equilibria, type of quaternary assembly, and nitrite reductase enzymatic activities of one adult (aHb5a) and one embryonic/larval hemoglobin (aHb6), myoglobin (aMb1) and cytoglobin (Cygb) of the sea lamprey. We found clear functional differentiation among globin types expressed at different developmental stages and in different tissues. Cygb and aMb1 have high O2 affinity and nitrite reductase activity, while the two hemoglobins display low O2 affinity and nitrite reductase activity. Cygb and aHb6 but not aHb5a show cooperative O2 binding, correlating with increased stability of dimers, as shown by gel filtration and molecular modeling. The high O2-affinity and the lack of cooperativity confirm the identity of the sea lamprey aMb1 as O2 storage protein of the muscle. The dimeric structure and O2-binding properties of sea lamprey and mammalian Cygb were very similar, suggesting a conservation of function since their divergence around 500\u00a0million years ago.",

The thermostable GH10 xylanase RmXyn10A has shown great potential to produce (A)XOS. In this study, the structure of RmXyn10A was investigated, the catalytic module by homology modelling and site-directed mutagenesis and the arrangement of its five domains by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Substrate specificity was explored in silico by manual docking and molecular dynamic simulations. It has been shown in the literature that the glycone subsites of GH10 xylanases are well conserved and our results suggest that RmXyn10A is no exception. The aglycone subsites are less investigated, and the modelled structure of RmXyn10A suggests that loop \u03b26\u03b16 in the aglycone part of the active site contains a non-conserved \u03b1-helix, which blocks the otherwise conserved space of subsite +2. This structural feature has only been observed for one other GH10 xylanase. In RmXyn10A, docking revealed two alternative binding regions, one on either side of the \u03b1-helix. However, only one was able to accommodate arabinose-substitutions and the mutation study suggests that the same region is responsible for binding XOS. Several non-conserved structural features are most likely to be responsible for providing affinity for arabinose-substitutions in subsites +1 and +2. The SAXS rigid model of the modular arrangement of RmXyn10A displays the catalytic module close to the cell-anchoring domain while the carbohydrate binding modules are further away, likely explaining the observed lack of contribution of the CBMs to activity.",

These motions are associated with rotations of the N-lobe, predominantly around the \u2018hinge region\u2019. We conducted an analysis of 28 crystal structures of the serine-threonine kinase, p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4), including three newly determined structures in complex with staurosporine, FRAX486, and fasudil (HA-1077). We find an unusual motion between the N-lobe and C-lobe of PAK4 that manifests as a partial unwinding of helix \u03b1C. Principal component analysis of the crystal structures rationalizes these movements into three major states, and analysis of the kinase hydrophobic spines indicates concerted movements that create an accessible back pocket cavity. The conformational changes that we observe for PAK4 differ from previous descriptions of kinase motions, and although we observe these differences in crystal structures there is the possibility that the movements observed may suggest a diversity of kinase conformational changes associated with regulation.Protein kinases are key signaling proteins, and are important drug targets, therefore understanding their regulation is important for both basic research and clinical points of view. In this study, we observe unusual conformational \u2018hinging\u2019 for protein kinases. Hinging, the opening and closing of the kinase sub-domains to allow nucleotide binding and release, is critical for proper kinase regulation and for targeted drug discovery. We determine new crystal structures of PAK4, an important Rho-effector kinase, and conduct analyses of these and previously determined structures. We find that PAK4 crystal structures can be classified into specific conformational groups, and that these groups are associated with previously unobserved hinging motions and an unusual conformation for the kinase hydrophobic core. Our findings therefore indicate that there may be a diversity of kinase hinging motions, and that these may indicate different mechanisms of regulation.",

     "abstract": "Careful analysis of sub-visible amorphous aggregates, where proteins associate non-covalently in either native or denatured states without forming a specific quaternary structure, may shed insight into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and solubility. Here we report a biophysical and biochemical analysis of our model protein, a bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor variant (BPTI-19A), whose oligomerization were controlled by attaching solubility controlling peptide tags (SCP tags) to its C terminus, which are short peptides composed of a single type of amino acid that modulate protein solubility. The dynamic light scattering and static light scattering at 25\u00a0\u00b0C indicated that 11 out of 15 SCP tags merely affected the hydrodynamic radius and light scattering intensity of our reference variants BPTI-19A and BPTI-C2G. On the other hand, hydrophobic SCP tags composed of 5 Ile (C5I) or 5 Leu (C5L) were associated into sub-visible aggregates. Circular dichroism indicated that all tagged BPTI variants had the same secondary structure contents as the reference BPTI-19A at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, suggesting that BPTI-C5I and C5L kept their native structure upon association. Furthermore, the thermal denaturation of all of the BPTI variants was fully reversible and typical of natively folded small globular proteins, as monitored by CD at 222 nm. However, the thermal stability of BPTI-19A tagged with hydrophobic residues decreased with increasing protein concentration and tag's hydrophobicity, and BPTI-C5I and C5L were partially denatured at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Biochemical stability assessed by limited proteolysis with pepsin correlated with the extent of the variants' aggregation, and the large sub-visible aggregates formed by BPTI-C5I and C5L significantly increased their resistance to pepsin proteolysis. Altogether, these observations indicated that hydrophobic SCP tags led to the reversible association of native-like proteins into sub-visible soluble amorphous aggregates resistant to pepsin digestion.",

     "abstract": "Functional and biophysical constraints can cause different levels of sequence conservation in proteins. Previously, structural properties, e.g., relative solvent accessibility (RSA) and packing density of the weighted contact number (WCN), have been found to be related to protein sequence conservation (CS). The Voronoi volume has recently been recognized as a new structural property of the local protein structural environment reflecting CS. However, for surface residues, it is sensitive to water molecules surrounding the protein structure. Herein, we present a simple structural determinant termed the relative space of Voronoi volume (RSV); it uses the Voronoi volume and the van der Waals volume of particular residues to quantify the local structural environment.RSV (range, 0\u20131) is defined as (Voronoi volume\u00a0\u2212\u00a0van der Waals volume)/Voronoi volume of the target residue. The concept of RSV describes the extent of available space for every protein residue.RSV and Voronoi profiles with and without water molecules (RSVw, RSV, VOw, and VO) were compared for 554 non-homologous proteins. RSV (without water) showed better Pearson's correlations with CS than did RSVw, VO, or VOw values. The mean correlation coefficient between RSV and CS was 0.51, which is comparable to the correlation between RSA and CS (0.49) and that between WCN and CS (0.56).RSV is a robust structural descriptor with and without water molecules and can quantitatively reflect evolutionary information in a single protein structure. Therefore, it may represent a practical structural determinant to study protein sequence, structure, and function relationships.",

Here, we aim to probe the FGD reaction mechanism using dead-end inhibition experiments, as well as solvent and substrate deuterium isotope effects studies. The dead-end inhibition studies performed using citrate as the inhibitor revealed competitive and uncompetitive inhibition patterns for G6P and F420 respectively, thus suggesting a mechanism of ordered addition of substrates in which the F420 cofactor must first bind to FGD before G6P binding. The solvent deuterium isotope effects studies yielded normal solvent kinetic isotope effects (SKIE) on kcat and kcat/Km for both G6P and F420. The proton inventory data yielded a fractionation factor of 0.37, suggesting that the single proton responsible for the observed SKIE is likely donated by Glu109 and protonates the cofactor at position N1. The steady state substrate deuterium isotope effects studies using G6P and G6P-d1 yielded KIE of 1.1 for both kcat and kcat/Km, while the pre-steady state KIE on kobs was 1.4. Because the hydride transferred to C5 of F420 was the one targeted for isotopic substitution, these KIE values provide further evidence to support our previous findings that hydride transfer is likely not rate-limiting in the FGD reaction.",

Previous investigations of A. thaliana have revealed that CYP71A16 catalyzes marneral oxidation, while it also can accept marnerol as substrate. The aim of the present study was to investigate functional properties of CYP71A16 in vitro. For this purpose, heterologous expression of a N-terminally modified version of CYP71A16 was established in Escherichia coli, which yielded up to 50\u00a0mg\u00a0L\u2212\u00a01 recombinant enzyme. The enzyme was purified and activity was reconstituted in vitro with different redox partners. A heterologous bacterial redox partner system consisting of the flavodoxin YkuN from Bacillus subtilis and the flavodoxin reductase Fpr from E. coli clearly outperformed the cytochrome P450 reductase ATR2 from A. thaliana in supporting the CYP71A16-mediated hydroxylation of marnerol. Substrate binding experiments with CYP71A16 revealed a dissociation constant KD of 225\u00a0\u03bcM for marnerol. CYP71A16 catalyzed the hydroxylation of marnerol to 23-hydroxymarnerol with a KM of 142\u00a0\u03bcM and a kcat of 3.9\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01.

     "abstract": "CYP106A2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC13368, was identified in the 1970s as one of the first bacterial steroid hydroxylases responsible for the conversion of progesterone to 15\u03b2-hydroxyprogesterone. Later on it has been proven to be a potent hydroxylase of numerous 3-oxo-\u03944 as well as 3-hydroxy-\u03945-steroids and has recently also been characterized as a regioselective allylic bacterial diterpene hydroxylase. The main hydroxylation position of CYP106A2 is thought to be influenced by the functional groups at C3 position in the steroid core leading to a favored 15\u03b2-hydroxylation of 3-oxo-\u03944-steroids and 7\u03b2-hydroxylation of 3-hydroxy-\u03945-steroids. However, in some cases the hydroxylation is not strictly selective, resulting in the formation of undesired side-products. To overcome the unspecific hydroxylations or, on the contrary, to gain more of these products in case they are of industrial interest, rational protein design and directed evolution have been successfully performed to shift the stereoselectivity of hydroxylation by CYP106A2. The subsequently obtained hydroxylated steroid and terpene derivatives are especially useful as drug metabolites and drug precursors for the pharmaceutical industry, due to their diverse biological properties and hardship of their chemical synthesis. As a soluble prokaryotic P450 with broad substrate spectrum and hydroxylating capacity, CYP106A2 is an outstanding candidate to establish bioconversion processes. It has been expressed with respectable yields in Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium and was applied for the preparative hydroxylation of several steroids and terpenes. Recently, the application of the enzyme was assessed under process conditions as well, depicting a successfully optimized process development and getting us closer to industrial scale process requirements and a future large scale application.

In this review, we focused on the protein engineering of P450s belonging to the CYP105 family for industrial use. Two Arg substitutions to Ala of CYP105A1 enhanced its vitamin D3 25- and 1\u03b1-hydroxylation activities by 400 and 100-fold, respectively. The coupling efficiency between product formation and NADPH oxidation was largely improved by the R84A mutation. The quintuple mutant Q87W/T115A/H132L/R194W/G294D of CYP105AB3 showed a 20-fold higher activity than the wild-type enzyme. Amino acids at positions 87 and 191 were located at the substrate entrance channel, and that at position 294 was located close to the heme group. Semi-rational engineering of CYP105A3 selected the best performing mutant, T85F/T119S/V194N/N363Y, for producing pravastatin. The T119S and N363Y mutations synergistically had remarkable effects on the interaction between CYP105A3 and putidaredoxin. Although wild-type CYP105AS1 hydroxylated compactin to 6-epi-pravastatin, the quintuple mutant I95T/Q127R/A180V/L236I/A265N converted almost all compactin to pravastatin. Five amino acid substitutions by two rounds of mutagenesis almost completely changed the stereo-selectivity of CYP105AS1.

     "abstract": "Cytochromes P450 play a key role in the drug and steroid metabolism in the human body. This leads to a high interest in this class of proteins. Mammalian cytochromes P450 are rather delicate. Due to their localization in the mitochondrial or microsomal membrane, they tend to aggregate during expression and purification and to convert to an inactive form so that they have to be purified and stored in complex buffers. The complex buffers and low storage temperatures, however, limit the feasibility of fast, automated screening of the corresponding cytochrome P450-effector interactions, which are necessary to study substrate-protein and inhibitor-protein interactions. Here, we present the production and isolation of functionalized poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) granules (PHB bodies) from Bacillus megaterium MS941 strain. In contrast to the expression in Escherichia coli, where mammalian cytochromes P450 are associated to the cell membrane, when CYP11A1 is heterologously expressed in Bacillus megaterium, it is located on the PHB bodies. The surface of these particles provides a matrix for immobilization and stabilization of the CYP11A1 during the storage of the protein and substrate conversion. It was demonstrated that the PHB polymer basis is inert concerning the performed conversion. Immobilization of the CYP11A1 onto the PHB bodies allows freeze-drying of the complex without significant decrease of the CYP11A1 activity. This is the first lyophilization of a mammalian cytochrome P450, which allows storage over more than 18\u00a0days at 4\u00a0\u00b0C instead of storage at \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C. In addition, we were able to immobilize the cytochrome P450 on the PHB bodies in vitro. In this case the expression of the protein is separated from the production of the immobilization matrix, which widens the application of this method.

In this study, only one self-sufficient cytochrome P450 from Streptomyces cattleya was renamed from CYP102A_scat to CYP102G4, purified and characterized. UV\u2013Vis spectrometry pattern, FAD/FMN analysis, and protein sequence comparison among CYP102s have shown that CYP102 from Streptomyces cattleya belongs to CYP102G subfamily. It showed hydroxylation activity toward fatty acids generating \u03c9-1, \u03c9-2, and \u03c9-3-hydroxyfatty acids, which is similar to the general substrate specificity of CYP102 family. Unexpectedly, however, expression of CYP102G4 showed indigo production in LB medium batch flask culture, and high catalytic activity (kcat/Km) for indole was measured as 6.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01. Besides indole, CYP102G4 was able to hydroxylate aromatic compounds such as flavone, benzophenone, and chloroindoles. Homology model has shown such ability to accept aromatic compounds is due to its bigger active site cavity. Unlike other CYP102s, CYP102G4 did not have biased cofactor dependency, which was possibly determined by difference in NAD(P)H binding residues (Ala984, Val990, and Tyr1064) compared to CYP102A1 (Arg966, Lys972 and Trp1046). Overall, a self-sufficient CYP within CYP102G subfamily was characterized using purified enzymes, which appears to possess unique properties such as an only prokaryotic CYP naturally producing indigo.",

     "abstract": "Human aromatase is the cytochrome P450 catalysing the conversion of androgens into estrogens playing a key role in the endocrine system. Due to this role, it is likely to be a target of the so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals, a series of compounds able to interfere with the hormone system with toxic effects. If on one side the toxicity of some compounds such as bisphenol A is well known, on the other side the toxic concentrations of such compounds as well as the effect of the many other molecules that are in contact with us in everyday life still need a deep investigation. The availability of biological assays able to detect the interaction of chemicals with key molecular targets of the endocrine system represents a possible solution to identify potential endocrine disrupting chemicals.Here the so-called alkali assay previously developed in our laboratory is applied to test the effect of different compounds on the activity of human aromatase. The assay is based on the detection of the alkali product that forms upon strong alkali treatment of the NADP+ released upon enzyme turnover. Here it is applied on human aromatase and validated using anastrozole and sildenafil as known aromatase inhibitors. Out of the small library of compounds tested, resveratrol and ketoconazole resulted to inhibit aromatase activity, while bisphenol A and nicotine were found to exert an inhibitory effect at relatively high concentrations (100\u00a0\u03bcM), and other molecules such as lindane and four plasticizers did not show any significant effect. These data are confirmed by quantification of the product estrone in the same reaction mixtures through ELISA.Overall, the results show that the alkali assay is suitable to screen for molecules that interfere with aromatase activity. As a consequence it can also be applied to other molecular targets of EDCs that use NAD(P)H for catalysis in a high throughput format for the fast screening of many different compounds as endocrine disrupting chemicals.

     "abstract": "Cytochromes P450 are found throughout the biosphere in a wide range of environments, serving a multitude of physiological functions. The ubiquity of the P450 fold suggests that it has been co-opted by evolution many times, and likely presents a useful compromise between structural stability and conformational flexibility. The diversity of substrates metabolized and reactions catalyzed by P450s makes them attractive starting materials for use as biocatalysts of commercially useful reactions. However, process conditions impose different requirements on enzymes to those in which they have evolved naturally. Most natural environments are relatively mild, and therefore most P450s have not been selected in Nature for the ability to withstand temperatures above ~\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C, yet industrial processes frequently require extended incubations at much higher temperatures. Thus, there has been considerable interest and effort invested in finding or engineering thermostable P450 systems. Numerous P450s have now been identified in thermophilic organisms and analysis of their structures provides information as to mechanisms by which the P450 fold can be stabilized. In addition, protein engineering, particularly by directed or artificial evolution, has revealed mutations that serve to stabilize particular mesophilic enzymes of interest. Here we review the current understanding of thermostability as it applies to the P450 fold, gleaned from the analysis of P450s characterized from thermophilic organisms and the parallel engineering of mesophilic forms for greater thermostability. We then present a perspective on how this information might be used to design stable P450 enzymes for industrial application.

     "abstract": "Chimerogenesis involving cytochromes P450 is a successful approach to generate catalytically self-sufficient enzymes. However, the connection between the different functional modules should allow a certain degree of flexibility in order to obtain functional and catalytically efficient proteins.We previously applied the molecular Lego approach to develop a chimeric P450 3A4 enzyme linked to the reductase domain of P450 BM3 (BMR). Three constructs were designed with the connecting loop containing no glycine, 3 glycine or 5 glycine residues and showed a different catalytic activity and coupling efficiency. Here we investigate how the linker affects the ability of P450 3A4 to bind substrates and inhibitors. We measure the electron transfer rates and the catalytic properties of the enzyme also in the presence of ketoconazole as inhibitor.The data show that the construct 3A4-5GLY-BMR with the longest loop better retains the binding ability and cooperativity for testosterone, compared to P450 3A4. In both 3A4-3GLY-BMR and 3A4-5GLY-BMR, the substrate induces an increase in the first electron transfer rate and a shorter lag phase related to a domain rearrangements, when compared to the construct without Gly. These data are consistent with docking results and secondary structure predictions showing a propensity to form helical structures in the loop of the 3A4-BMR and 3A4-3GLY-BMR.All three chimeras retain the ability to bind the inhibitor ketoconazole and show an IC50 comparable with those reported for the wild type protein.

A series of mutations that strongly perturb the spin state equilibrium in the camphor hydroxylase CYP101A1 were recently described (Colthart et al., Sci. Rep. 6, 22035 (2016)). Wild type CYP101A1 as well as some CYP101A1 mutants are herein shown to be capable of catalyzing the reduction of nitroacetophenones by NADH to the corresponding anilino compounds (nitroreductase or NRase activity). The distinguishing characteristic between those mutants that catalyze the reduction and those that cannot appears to be the extent to which residual high spin form exists in the absence of the native substrate d-camphor, with those showing the largest spin state shifts upon camphor binding also exhibiting NRase activity. Optical and EPR spectroscopy was used to further examine these phenomena. These results suggest that reduction of nitroaromatics may provide a useful probe of residual high spin states in the CYP superfamily.

     "abstract": "Limited knowledge of the molecular evolution of deep-sea fish proteomes so far suggests that a few widespread residue substitutions in cytosolic proteins binding hydrophilic ligands contribute to resistance to the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HP). Structure-function studies with additional protein systems, including membrane bound proteins, are essential to provide a more general picture of adaptation in these extremophiles. We explored molecular features of HP adaptation in proteins binding hydrophobic ligands, either in lipid bilayers (cytochrome P450 1A - CYP1A) or in the cytosol (the aryl hydrocarbon receptor - AHR), and their partners P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT), respectively. Cloning studies identified the full-length coding sequence of AHR, CYP1A and POR, and a partial sequence of ARNT from Coryphaenoides armatus, an abyssal gadiform fish thriving down to 5000\u00a0m depth. Inferred protein sequences were aligned with many non-deep-sea homologs to identify unique amino acid substitutions of possible relevance in HP adaptation. Positionally unique substitutions of various physicochemical properties were found in all four proteins, usually at sites of strong-to-absolute residue conservation. Some were in domains deemed important for protein-protein interaction or ligand binding. In addition, some involved removal or addition of beta-branched residues; local modifications of beta-branched residue patterns could be important to HP adaptation. In silico predictions further suggested that some unique substitutions might substantially modulate the flexibility of the polypeptide segment in which they are found. Repetitive motifs unique to the abyssal fish AHR were predicted to be rich in glycosylation sites, suggesting that post-translational changes could be involved in adaptation as well. Recombinant CYP1A and AHR showed functional properties (spectral characteristics, catalytic activity and ligand binding) that demonstrate proper folding at 1\u00a0atm, indicating that they could be used as deep-sea fish protein models to further evaluate protein function under pressure.

     "abstract": "Sporotrichosis is an emerging chronic, granulomatous, subcutaneous, mycotic infection caused by Sporothrix species. Sporotrichosis is treated with the azole drug itraconazole as ketoconazole is ineffective. It is a well-known fact that azole drugs act by inhibiting cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), heme-thiolate proteins. To date, nothing is known about P450s in Sporothrix schenckii and the molecular basis of its resistance to ketoconazole. Here we present genome-wide identification, annotation, phylogenetic analysis and comprehensive P450 family-level comparative analysis of S. schenckii P450s with pathogenic fungi P450s, along with a rationale for ketoconazole resistance by S. schenckii based on in silico structural analysis of CYP51. Genome data-mining of S. schenckii revealed 40 P450s in its genome that can be grouped into 32 P450 families and 39 P450 subfamilies. Comprehensive comparative analysis of P450s revealed that S. schenckii shares 11 P450 families with plant pathogenic fungi and has three unique P450 families: CYP5077, CYP5386 and CYP5696 (novel family). Among P450s, CYP51, the main target of azole drugs was also found in S. schenckii. 3D modeling of S. schenckii CYP51 revealed the presence of characteristic P450 motifs with exceptionally large reductase interaction site 2. In silico analysis revealed number of mutations that can be associated with ketoconazole resistance, especially at the channel entrance to the active site. One of possible reason for better stabilization of itraconazole, compared to ketoconazole, is that the more extended molecule of itraconazole may form a hydrogen bond with ASN-230. This in turn may explain its effectiveness against S. schenckii vis-a-vis resistant to ketoconazole.

     "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) are thiolate heme proteins that can, often under physiological conditions, catalyze many distinct oxidative transformations on a wide variety of molecules, including relatively simple alkanes or fatty acids, as well as more complex compounds such as steroids and exogenous pollutants. They perform such impressive chemistry utilizing a sophisticated catalytic cycle that involves a series of consecutive chemical transformations of heme prosthetic group. Each of these steps provides a unique spectral signature that reflects changes in oxidation or spin states, deformation of the porphyrin ring or alteration of dioxygen moieties. For a long time, the focus of cytochrome P450 research was to understand the underlying reaction mechanism of each enzymatic step, with the biggest challenge being identification and characterization of the powerful oxidizing intermediates. Spectroscopic methods, such as electronic absorption (UV\u2013Vis), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR), M\u00f6ssbauer, X-ray absorption (XAS), and resonance Raman (rR), have been useful tools in providing multifaceted and detailed mechanistic insights into the biophysics and biochemistry of these fascinating enzymes. The combination of spectroscopic techniques with novel approaches, such as cryoreduction and Nanodisc technology, allowed for generation, trapping and characterizing long sought transient intermediates, a task that has been difficult to achieve using other methods. Results obtained from the UV\u2013Vis, rR and EPR spectroscopies are the main focus of this review, while the remaining spectroscopic techniques are briefly summarized.

Advanced scientific and medical research technologies throughout last three decades have arrived to the point where lots of key molecular determinants affect human disorders can be examined thoroughly. In this study, we designed and executed an approach to prioritize drugs that may target multiple age related disorders.

The two CBHs differ in catalytic mechanism, attack different ends, belong to different families, but are both processive multi-domain enzymes that are essential in the hydrolysis of cellulose. Here we present a direct kinetic comparison of these two enzymes acting on insoluble cellulose. We used both continuous- and end-point assays under either enzyme- or substrate excess, and found distinct kinetic differences between the two CBHs. Cel6A was catalytically superior with a maximal rate over four times higher than Cel7A. Conversely, the ability of Cel6A to attack diverse structures on the cellulose surface was inferior to Cel7A. This latter difference was pronounced as the density of attack sites for Cel7A was almost an order of magnitude higher compared to Cel6A. We conclude that Cel6A is a fast but selective enzyme and that Cel7A is slower, but promiscuous. One consequence of this is that Cel6A is more effective when substrate is plentiful, while Cel7A excels when substrate is limiting. These diverse kinetic properties of Cel6A and Cel7A might elucidate why both cellobiohydrolases are prominent in cellulolytic degrading fungi.",

Here, we studied the oxygen-binding cooperativity and affinity of Concholepas concholepas hemocyanin (CCH) and its two isolated subunits over a wide range of temperatures and pH values. Considering the differences in the quaternary structures of CCH and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), we hypothesized that the heterodidecameric CCH has different oxygen-binding parameters than the homodidecameric KLH. A novel modification of the polarographic method was applied in which rat liver submitochondrial particles containing cytochrome c oxidase were introduced to totally deplete oxygen of the test solution using ascorbate as the electron donor. This method was both sensitive and reproducible. The results showed that CCH, like other hemocyanins, exhibits cooperativity, showing an inverse relationship between the oxygen-binding parameters and temperature. According to their Hill coefficients, KLH has greater cooperativity than CCH at physiological pH; however, CCH is less sensitive to pH changes than KLH. Appreciable differences in binding behavior were found between the CCH subunits: the cooperativity of CCH-A was not only almost double that of CCH-B, but it was also slightly superior to that of CCH, thus suggesting that the oxygen-binding domains of the CCH subunits are different in their primary structure. Collectively, these data suggest that CCH-A is the main oxygen-binding domain in CCH; CCH-B may play a more structural role, perhaps utilizing its surprising predisposition to form tubular polymers, unlike CCH-A, as demonstrated here using electron microscopy.",

In this work, we identified a GH62 \u03b1-l-arabinofuranosidase (AnAbf62Awt) that was highly secreted when Aspergillus nidulans was cultivated on sugarcane bagasse. The gene AN7908 was cloned and transformed in A. nidulans for homologous production of AnAbf62Awt, and we confirmed that the enzyme is N-glycosylated at asparagine 83 by mass spectrometry analysis. The enzyme was also expressed in Escherichia coli and the studies of circular dichroism showed that the melting temperature and structural profile of AnAbf62Awt and the non-glycosylated enzyme from E. coli (AnAbf62Adeglyc) were highly similar. In addition, the designed glycomutant AnAbf62AN83Q presented similar patterns of secretion and activity to the AnAbf62Awt, indicating that the N-glycan does not influence the properties of this enzyme. The crystallographic structure of AnAbf62Adeglyc was obtained and the 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 resolution model showed a five-bladed \u03b2-propeller fold, which is conserved in family GH62. Mutants AnAbf62AY312F and AnAbf62AY312S showed that Y312 was an important substrate-binding residue. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the loop containing Y312 could access different conformations separated by moderately low energy barriers. One of these conformations, comprising a local minimum, is responsible for placing Y312 in the vicinity of the arabinose glycosidic bond, and thus, may be important for catalytic efficiency.",

The FADH2 co-substrate of the epoxidase component (StyA) is supplied by an NADH-dependent flavin reductase (StyB). The genome of Rhodococcus opacus 1CP encodes two SMO systems. One system, which we define as E1-type, displays homology to the SMO from Pseudomonas taiwanensis VLB120. The other system, originally reported as a fused system (RoStyA2B), is defined as E2-type. Here we found that E1-type RoStyB is inhibited by FMN, while RoStyA2B is known to be active with FMN. To rationalize the observed specificity of RoStyB for FAD, we generated an artificial reductase, designated as RoStyBart, in which the first 22 amino acid residues of RoStyB were joined to the reductase part of RoStyA2B, while the oxygenase part (A2) was removed. RoStyBart mainly purified as apo-protein and mimicked RoStyB in being inhibited by FMN.

It was found that Ca2+-binding to the wtTn-CD decreases the residence time of atomic motions in the Tn-CD with slight changes in amplitudes, suggesting that the regulatory function mainly requires modulation of frequency of atomic motions. On the other hand, the K247R-Tn-CD shows different dynamic behavior from that of the wtTn-CD both in the absence and presence of Ca2+. In particular, the K247R-Tn-CD exhibits a larger amplitude than the wtTn-CD in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that the mutant can explore larger conformational space than the wild-type.

Furthermore, the mutant tropomyosin disrupted the major function of troponin to alter the distribution of the different functional states of thin filaments. At low Ca2\u00a0+ troponin did not effectively switch thin filament off and the myosin head lost the ability to drive the spatial arrangement of the mutant tropomyosin. The information about tropomyosin flexibility obtained from the fluorescent probes at Cys190 indicates that this tropomyosin is generally more rigid, that obviously prevents tropomyosin to bend and adopt the appropriate conformation required for proper regulation.",

     "abstract": "l-arginine is used as a source of both carbon and nitrogen in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and its biosynthesis is essential for the pathogen's survival. MtbArgA (Rv2747) catalyzes the initial step in l-arginine biosynthesis by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) to l-glutamate. MtbArgA is a class III N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS) with no structural information. Here, we solved the crystal structure of MtbArgA complexed with AcCoA and l-glutamate. The overall structure adopts a classic fold of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family, characterized by a \u201cV\u201d-shaped cleft and \u03b2-bulge, but uses distinct residues for the binding and reaction of AcCoA. In particular, its activity depends on dimerization to form a deep, vast pocket for l-glutamate binding. Interestingly, in the structure, l-glutamate binds at a site far away from AcCoA, implying a mechanism of separate capture and catalysis. Additionally, based on a docking model of l-glutamate at the catalytic site, a one-step sequential mechanism was proposed for enzymatic catalysis. Important sites for substrate binding and catalysis were also evaluated by site-directed mutagenesis study and activity analysis. The unique features of the MtbArgA structure will provide useful insights for inhibitor design and anti-tuberculosis drug discovery.",

This technique is a method of choice for the study of the structure and dynamics of lipid bilayers; bilayer interactions with a variety of molecules such as membrane peptides, membrane proteins and drugs; and to investigate membrane peptide and protein structure, dynamics, and topology. Canada has a long tradition in this field of research, starting with pioneering work on natural and model membranes in the 1970s in a context of emergence of biophysics in the country. The 1980s and 1990s saw an emphasis on studying lipid structures and dynamics, and peptide-lipid and protein-lipid interactions. The study of bicelles began in the 1990s, and in the 2000s there was a rise in the study of membrane protein structures. Novel perspectives include using dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) for membrane studies and using NMR in live cells.

     "abstract": "Daptomycin, sold under the trade name CUBICIN, is the first lipopeptide antibiotic to be approved for use against Gram-positive organisms, including a number of highly resistant species. Over the last few decades, a number of studies have tried to pinpoint the mechanism of action of daptomycin. These proposed modes of action often have points in common (e.g. the requirement for Ca2\u00a0+ and lipid membranes containing a high proportion of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) headgroups), but also points of divergence (e.g. oligomerization in solution and in membranes, membrane perturbation vs. inhibition of cell envelope synthesis). In this study, we investigate how concentration effects may have an impact on the interpretation of the biophysical data used to support a given mechanism of action. Results obtained from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that daptomycin oligomerizes at high concentrations (both with and without Ca2\u00a0+) in solution, but that this oligomer readily falls apart. Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) experiments demonstrate that daptomycin causes fusion more readily in DMPC/PG membranes than in POPC/PG, suggesting that the latter may be a better model system. Finally, fluorescence and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments reveal that daptomycin binds strongly to the lipid membrane and that oligomerization occurs in a concentration-dependent manner. The combined experiments provide an improved framework for more general and rigorous biophysical studies toward understanding the elusive mechanism of action of daptomycin.

The mechanisms by which AMPs interact with, and ultimately disrupt, bacterial cell membranes is still, to a large extent, incompletely understood. Up until recently, this mechanism was studied using model lipid membranes that failed to reproduce the complexity of molecular interactions present in real cells comprising lipids but also membrane proteins, a cell wall containing peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharides, and other molecules. In this review, we focus on recent attempts to study, at the molecular level, the interaction between cationic AMPs and intact bacteria, by 2H solid-state NMR. Specifically-labeled lipids allow us to focus on the interaction of AMPs with the heart of the bacterial membrane, and measure the lipid order and its variation upon interaction with various peptides. We will review the important parameters to consider in such a study, and summarize the results obtained in the past 5\u00a0years on various peptides, in particular aurein 1.2, caerin 1.1, MSI-78 and CA(1-8)M(1-10).

     "abstract": "It is now established that understanding the molecular basis of biological function requires atomic resolution maps of both structure and dynamics. Here, we review several illustrative examples of functional dynamics selected from our work on cyclic nucleotide signaling and amyloid inhibition. Although fundamentally diverse, a central aspect common to both fields is that function can only be rationalized by considering dynamic equilibria between distinct states of the accessible free energy landscape. The dynamic exchange between ground and excited states of signaling proteins is essential to explain auto-inhibition and allosteric activation. The dynamic exchange between non-toxic monomeric species and toxic oligomers of amyloidogenic proteins provides a foundation to understand amyloid inhibition. NMR ideally probes both types of dynamic exchange at atomic resolution. Specifically, we will show how NMR was utilized to reveal the dynamical basis of cyclic nucleotide affinity, selectivity, agonism and antagonism in multiple eukaryotic cAMP and cGMP receptors. We will also illustrate how NMR revealed the mechanism of action of plasma proteins that act as extracellular chaperones and inhibit the self-association of the prototypical amyloidogenic A\u03b2 peptide. The examples outlined in this review illustrate the widespread implications of functional dynamics and the power of NMR as an indispensable tool in molecular pharmacology and pathology.",

It is becoming increasingly clear that cellular processes including gene expression and mRNA translation are regulated by GQs. GQ structures have been extensively characterized, however little attention to date has been paid to their conformational dynamics, despite the fact that many biological GQ sequences populate multiple structures of similar free energies, leading to an ensemble of exchanging conformations. The impact of these dynamics on biological function is currently not well understood. Recently, structural dynamics have been demonstrated to entropically stabilize GQ ensembles, potentially modulating gene expression. Transient, low-populated states in GQ ensembles may additionally regulate nucleic acid interactions and function. This review will underscore the interplay of GQ dynamics and biological function, focusing on several dynamic processes for biological GQs and the characterization of GQ dynamics by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in conjunction with other biophysical techniques.

     "abstract": "Calmodulin is a ubiquitous calcium sensor protein, known to serve as a critical interaction hub with a wide range of signaling partners. While the holo form of calmodulin (CaM-4Ca2\u00a0+) has a well-defined ground state structure, it has been shown to undergo exchange, on a millisecond timescale, to a conformation resembling that of the peptide bound state. Tagged paramagnetic relaxation agents have been previously used to identify long-range dipolar interactions through relaxation effects on nuclear spins of interest. In the case of calmodulin, this lead to the determination of the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains and the presence of a weakly populated peptide bound like state. Here, we make use of pseudocontact shifts from a tagged paramagnetic shift reagent which allows us to define minor states both in 13C and 15N NMR spectra and through 13C- and 15N-edited 1H-CPMG relaxation dispersion measurements. This is validated by pulsed EPR (DEER) spectroscopy which reveals an ensemble consisting of a compact peptide-bound like conformer, an intermediate peptide-bound like conformer, and a (dumbbell-like) extended ground state conformer of CaM-4Ca2\u00a0+, where addition of the MLCK peptide increases the population of the peptide-bound conformers.

During synthesis, peptide elongation is performed by the condensation (C) domain, as it catalyzes amide bond formation between the nascent peptide and the amino acid it adds to the chain. Since their discovery more than two decades ago, C domains have been subject to extensive biochemical, bioinformatic, mutagenic, and structural analyses. They are composed of two lobes, each with homology to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, have two binding sites for their two peptidyl carrier protein-bound ligands, and have an active site with conserved motif HHxxxDG located between the two lobes. This review discusses some of the important insights into the structure, catalytic mechanism, specificity, and gatekeeping functions of C domains revealed since their discovery. In addition, C domains are the archetypal members of the C domain superfamily, which includes several other members that also function as NRPS domains. The other family members can replace the C domain in NRP synthesis, can work in concert with a C domain, or can fulfill diverse and novel functions. These domains include the epimerization (E) domain, the heterocyclization (Cy) domain, the ester-bond forming C domain, the fungal NRPS terminal C domain (CT), the \u03b2-lactam ring forming C domain, and the X domain. We also discuss structural and function insight into C, E, Cy, CT and X domains, to present a holistic overview of historical and current knowledge of the C domain superfamily.

This organization not only condenses the genome to fit within the confines of the nucleus, but also provides a platform for a cell to regulate accessibility to different gene sequences. The basic packaging element of chromatin is the nucleosome, which consists of 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped around histone proteins. One major means that a cell regulates chromatin structure is by depositing post-translational modifications on nucleosomal histone proteins, and thereby altering internucleosomal interactions and/or binding to different chromatin associated factors. These chromatin modifications are often catalyzed by multi-subunit enzyme complexes, whose large size, sophisticated composition, and inherent conformational flexibility pose significant technical challenges to their biochemical and structural characterization. Multiple structural approaches including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, single-particle electron microscopy, and crosslinking coupled to mass spectrometry are often used synergistically to probe the overall architecture, subunit organization, and catalytic mechanisms of these macromolecular assemblies.

Here we review how small-angle X-ray scattering can be combined with other structural biology techniques to study protein dynamics.

     "abstract": "Mechanical unfolding of mutated apo, disulfide-reduced, monomeric superoxide dismutase 1 protein (SOD1) has been simulated via force spectroscopy techniques, using both an all-atom (AA), explicit solvent model and a coarse-grained heavy-atom G\u014d (HA-G\u014d) model. The HA-G\u014d model was implemented at two different pulling speeds for comparison. The most-common sequence of unfolding in the AA model agrees well with the most-common unfolding sequence of the HA-G\u014d model, when the same normalized pulling rate was used. Clustering of partially-native structures as the protein unfolds shows that the AA and HA-G\u014d models both exhibit a dominant pathway for early unfolding, which eventually bifurcates repeatedly to multiple branches after the protein is about half-unfolded. The force-extension curve exhibits multiple force drops, which are concomitant with jumps in the local interaction potential energy between specific \u03b2-strands in the protein. These sudden jumps in the potential energy coincide with the dissociation of specific pairs of \u03b2-strands, and thus intermediate unfolding events. The most common sequence of \u03b2-strand dissociation in the unfolding pathway of the AA model is \u03b2-strands 5, 4, 8, 7, 1, 2, then finally \u03b2-strands 3 and 6. The observation that \u03b2-strand 5 is among the first to unfold here, but the last to unfold in simulations of loop-truncated SOD1, could imply the existence of an evolutionary compensation mechanism, which would stabilize \u03b2-strands flanking long loops against their entropic penalty by strengthening intramolecular interactions.

     "abstract": "The rapid development of experimental and computational techniques has changed fundamentally our understanding of cellular-membrane transport. The advent of powerful computers and refined force-fields for proteins, ions, and lipids has expanded the applicability of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. A myriad of cellular responses is modulated through the binding of endogenous and exogenous ligands (e.g. neurotransmitters and drugs, respectively) to ion channels. Deciphering the thermodynamics and kinetics of the ligand binding processes to these membrane proteins is at the heart of modern drug development. The ever-increasing computational power has already provided insightful data on the thermodynamics and kinetics of drug-target interactions, free energies of solvation, and partitioning into lipid bilayers for drugs. This review aims to provide a brief summary about modeling approaches to map out crucial binding pathways with intermediate conformations and free-energy surfaces for drug-ion channel binding mechanisms that are responsible for multiple effects on cellular functions. We will discuss post-processing analysis of simulation-generated data, which are then transformed to kinetic models to better understand the molecular underpinning of the experimental observables under the influence of drugs or mutations in ion channels. This review highlights crucial mathematical frameworks and perspectives on bridging different well-established computational techniques to connect the dynamics and timescales from all-atom MD and free energy simulations of ion channels to the physiology of action potentials in cellular models.

These restraints can be incorporated in computer modeling algorithms that can accurately translate the sparse experimental data into full 3D atomic structures.

     "abstract": "In this review, we present a summary of how computer modeling has been used in the development of covalent-modifier drugs. Covalent-modifier drugs bind by forming a chemical bond with their target. This covalent binding can improve the selectivity of the drug for a target with complementary reactivity and result in increased binding affinities due to the strength of the covalent bond formed. In some cases, this results in irreversible inhibition of the target, but some targeted covalent inhibitor (TCI) drugs bind covalently but reversibly. Computer modeling is widely used in drug discovery, but different computational methods must be used to model covalent modifiers because of the chemical bonds formed. Structural and bioinformatic analysis has identified sites of modification that could yield selectivity for a chosen target. Docking methods, which are used to rank binding poses of large sets of inhibitors, have been augmented to support the formation of protein\u2013ligand bonds and are now capable of predicting the binding pose of covalent modifiers accurately. The pKa\u2019s of amino acids can be calculated in order to assess their reactivity towards electrophiles. QM/MM methods have been used to model the reaction mechanisms of covalent modification. The continued development of these tools will allow computation to aid in the development of new covalent-modifier drugs.

Bicoid was the first discovered morphogen, and remains one of the most studied. It regulates segmentation in flies, forming a striking exponential gradient along the anterior-posterior axis of early Drosophila embryos, and activating the transcription of multiple target genes in a concentration-dependent manner. In this review, the work done by us and by others to characterize the mobility of Bicoid in D. melanogaster embryos is presented. The central role played by the diffusion of Bicoid in both the establishment of the gradient and the activation of target genes is discussed, and placed in the context of the need for these processes to be all at once rapid, precise and robust. The Bicoid system, and morphogen gradients in general, remain amongst the most amazing examples of the coexistence, often observed in living systems, of small-scale disorder and large-scale spatial order.

With recent advances in high-resolution imaging techniques, from the development of new molecular labels to technical advances in imaging methodologies and platforms, researchers are now reaping the benefits of being able to directly characterize and quantify local dynamics, structures, and conformations in live cells and tissues. These capabilities are providing unique insights into association stoichiometries, interactions, and structures on sub-micron length scales. We previously examined the role of lipid headgroup chemistry and phase state in guiding the formation of pseudoisocyanine (PIC) dye J-aggregates on supported planar bilayers [Langmuir, 25, 10719]. We describe here how these same J-aggregates can report on the in situ formation of organellar membrane domains in live cells. Live cell hyperspectral confocal microscopy using GFP-conjugated GTPase markers of early (Rab5) and late (Rab7) endosomes revealed that the PIC J-aggregates were confined to domains on either the limiting membrane or intralumenal vesicles (ILV) of late endosomes, known to be enriched in the anionic lipid bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP). Correlated confocal fluorescence - atomic force microscopy performed on endosomal membrane-mimetic supported planar lipid bilayers confirmed BMP-specific templating of the PIC J-aggregates. These data provide strong evidence for the formation of BMP-rich lipid domains during multivesicular body formation and portend the application of structured dye aggregates as markers of cellular membrane domain structure, size, and formation.",

An entire spectrum of structural disorder exists in proteins and obtaining a satisfactory quantitative description of these states remains a challenge.

In this paper we review some of the recent successes in applying single-molecule fluorescence to different disordered protein systems, including interactions with their cellular targets and self-aggregation processes. We also discuss the implementation of computational methods and polymer physics models that are essential for inferring global dimension parameters for these proteins from smFRET data. Regarding future directions; 3- or 4-color FRET methods can provide multiple distances within a disordered ensemble simultaneously. In addition, integrating complementary experimental data from smFRET, NMR and SAXS will provide meaningful constraints for molecular simulations and will lead to more accurate structural representations of disordered proteins.

Machine learning techniques are ideally suited for the (semi-)automated analysis of multidimensional image data.

Here, we discuss the use of SVMs to analyze in vivo microscopy data. We introduce the mathematical framework behind SVMs, and we describe the metrics used by SVMs and other machine learning approaches to classify image data. We discuss the influence of different SVM parameters in the context of an algorithm for cell segmentation and tracking. Finally, we describe how the application of SVMs has been critical to study protein localization in yeast screens, for lineage tracing in C. elegans, or to determine the developmental stage of Drosophila embryos to investigate gene expression dynamics.

Extensive evidence on the flexibility of PDI in solution is not matched by any detailed picture of the scope of its motion.

Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are a family of the plant intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Despite their important roles in plant stress response, there is currently limited knowledge on the presence and functional and structural effects of phosphorylation on LEA proteins. In this study, we identified three phosphorylation sites (Ser90, Tyr136, and Thr266) in the soybean PM18 protein that belongs to the group-3 LEA proteins. In yeast expression system, PM18 protein increased the salt tolerance of yeast, and the phosphorylation of this protein further enhanced its protective function. Further analysis revealed that Ser90 and Tyr136 are more important than Thr266, and these two sites might work cooperatively in regulating the salt resistance function of PM18. The circular dichroism analysis showed that PM18 protein was disordered in aqueous media, and phosphorylation did not affect the disordered status of this protein. However, phosphorylation promoted formation of more helical structure in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or trifluoroethanol (TFE). Furthermore, in dedicated in vitro experiments, phosphorylated PM18 protein was able to better protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from the inactivation induced by the freeze-thaw cycles than its un- or dephosphorylated forms. All these data indicate that phosphorylation may have regulatory effects on the stress-tolerance-related function of LEA proteins. Therefore, further studies are needed to shed more light on functional and structural roles of phosphorylation in LEA proteins.",

In summary, 512 proteins constituting different cell wall fractions were identified, including 7 predicted GPI-dependent cell wall proteins that are potentially involved in cell wall metabolism. Adhesins previously described in Paracoccidioides spp. such as enolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were identified.

Consequently, small molecule-induced dissociation of fibrils under physiological conditions is really challenging. Here, we report kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of hemin-induced dissociation of hen egg white lysozyme amyloid fibrils. We examined the effect of hemin on the kinetics of dissociation of lysozyme fibrils. We observed that the hemin binding dissociates fibrils in a concentration dependent manner within a reasonable time. Studies of structural, morphological properties and gel filtration chromatography indicate that fibrils dissociate mainly into monomeric species. The conformational, hydrodynamic, unfolding and stability studies of the resolubilized proteins show that dissociated monomers possess characteristics of partially folded intermediate state of the protein.

At time point 120\u00a0min the enzyme catalysed conversion of the sugar 1-phosphate into the corresponding UDP-sugar reached 74% for N-acetyl-\u03b1-d-glucosamine 1-phosphate, 28% for \u03b1-d-galactose 1-phosphate, 0% for \u03b1-d-galactosamine 1-phosphate, 100% for \u03b1-d-xylose 1-phosphate, 100% for \u03b1-d-glucosamine 1-phosphate, 70% for \u03b1-d-mannose 1-phosphate, and 0% for \u03b1-d-galacturonic acid 1-phosphate. To explain our results we obtained the crystal structure of EaGalU and augmented our study by docking the different sugar 1-phosphates into EaGalU active site, providing both reliable models for substrate binding and enzyme specificity, and a rationale that explains the different activity of EaGalU on the sugar 1-phosphates used. These data demonstrate EaGalU potential as a biocatalyst for biotechnological purposes, as an alternative to the enzyme from Escherichia coli, besides playing an important role in E. amylovora pathogenicity.",

Otolith matrix macromolecule-64 (OMM-64) is a highly acidic, calcium-binding protein (CBP) found in rainbow trout otoliths. It is a component of high-molecular-weight aggregates, which influence the size, shape and polymorph of calcium carbonate in vitro. In this study, a protocol for the efficient expression and purification of OMM-64 was developed. For the first time, the complete structural characteristics of OMM-64 were described. Various biophysical methods were combined to show that OMM-64 occurs as an intrinsically disordered monomer. Under denaturing conditions (pH, temperature) OMM-64 exhibits folding propensity. It was determined that OMM-64 binds approximately 61 calcium ions with millimolar affinity. The folding-unfolding experiments showed that calcium ions induced the collapse of OMM-64. The effect of other counter ions present in trout endolymph on OMM-64 conformational changes was studied. The significance of disordered properties of OMM-64 and the possible function of this protein is discussed.",

TRF2 helps the folding of telomere to form T-loop structure and the suppression of ATM-dependent DNA damage response activation. TRF2 has been recognized as a potentially new therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In our routine screening of small molecule libraries, we found that Curcusone C had significant effect in disrupting the binding between TRF2 and telomeric DNA, with potent antitumor activity against cancer cells. Our result showed that Curcusone C could bind with TRF2 without binding interaction with TRF1 (telomeric repeat factor 1) although these two proteins share high sequence homology, indicating that their binding conformations and biological functions in telomere could be different. Our mechanistic studies showed that Curcusone C bound with TRF2 possibly through its DNA binding site causing blockage of its interaction with telomeric DNA. Further in cellular studies indicated that the interaction of TRF2 with Curcusone C could activate DNA-damage response, inhibit tumor cell proliferation, and cause cell cycle arrest, resulting in tumor cell apoptosis. Our studies showed that Curcusone C could become a promising lead compound for further development for cancer treatment. Here, TRF2 was firstly identified as a target of Curcusone C. It is likely that the anti-cancer activity of some other terpenes and terpenoids are related with their possible effect for telomere protection proteins.",

The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37\u00a0\u00c5. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42\u00b0 about the pore axis and shifted by 7\u00a0\u00c5 and tilted by 16\u00b0 along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32\u00a0\u00c5. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg-Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins.

In this study, the active-site gate of M32 carboxypeptidases (M32CP) is illuminated. Only a handful of members of this family have been structurally and functionally characterized and various aspects of their activity and mechanism are yet not clarified. Here, crystal structure of putative M32CP from Deinococcus radiodurans (M32dr) was solved to 2.4\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Enzymatic assays confirmed its identity as a carboxypeptidase. Open and relatively closed conformations observed in the structure provided supporting evidence for previously hypothesized hinge motion in this family of enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations of 1.5\u00a0\u03bcs displayed distinct open and closed conformations revealing amplitude of the motion to be beyond what was observed in the crystal structure. Hinge region and anchoring region of this shell-type gate were identified. A small displacement of 3\u00a0\u00c5 and a helical tilt of 9\u00b0 propagated by the hinge region translates into a 10\u00a0\u00c5 motion at the top of the gate. The dynamics of the gate was supported by our mutagenesis experiment involving formation of disulphide bond across helices of the gate. The nearly inactive mutant enzyme showed 65-fold increase in the enzymatic activity in presence of reducing agent. Further, while a previously proposed structural basis would have led to its classification in subfamily II, experimentally observed substrate length restriction places M32dr in subfamily I of M32CPs.",

Herein, we compare the role of the \u201cball and socket\u201d and loop 3 interactions in substrate assisted dimer assembly in both TvTIMs. We found that point mutants at the \u201cball\u201d are only 39 and 29-fold less catalytically active than their corresponding wild-type counterparts, whereas \u0394loop 3 deletions are 1502 and 9400-fold less active. Point and deletion mutants dissociate into stable monomers. However, point mutants assemble as catalytic competent dimers upon binding of the transition state substrate analog PGH, whereas loop 3 deletions remain monomeric. A comparison between crystal structures of point and loop 3 deletion monomeric mutants illustrates that the catalytic residues in point mutants and wild-type TvTIMs are maintained in the same orientation, whereas the catalytic residues in deletion mutants show an increase in thermal mobility and present structural disorder that may hamper their catalytic role. The high enzymatic activity present in monomeric point mutants correlates with the formation of dimeric TvTIMs upon substrate binding. In contrast, the low activity and lack of dimer assembly in deletion mutants suggests a role of loop 3 in promoting the formation of the active site as well as dimer assembly. Our results suggest that in TvTIMs the active site is assembled during dimerization and that the integrity of loop 3 and ball and socket residues is crucial to stabilize the dimer.",

The relative water and proline contents were decreased and increased in sensitive genotypes, respectively; however, they were not a big change in tolerant genotypes. Photosynthesis was decreased in the sensitive genotypes under drought; however, it was increased in the tolerant genotype.

The abundance of phosphoribulokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase enzymes were decreased and increased in drought-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes, respectively; however, the abundance of RuBisCO and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes were increased and decreased in drought-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes, respectively. Under drought stress, the abundance of glycolysis-related proteins was decreased in sensitive genotypes; however, they were increased in tolerance genotypes. Commonly changed proteins with polyethylene glycol fractionation such as cobalamin-independent methionine synthase were decreased and increased in drought-sensitive and -tolerant genotypes, respectively.

Twenty four proteins were identified of which eighteen proteins showed downregulation while six proteins were upregulated in the victims in comparison to the normal individuals. Also, six protein spots were confirmed by western-blot analysis. In conclusion, all the twenty-four identified proteins are involved in pathways which their up- or down-regulation leads to the accumulation of undesired substrates, cell death and apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are a diverse group of anaerobic microorganisms that obtain their energy from dissimilatory sulfate reduction. Some SRB species have high respiratory versatility due to the possible use of alternative electron acceptors. A good example is Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ATCC 27774, which grows in the presence of nitrate (end product: ammonium) with higher rates and yields to those observed in sulfate containing medium (end product: sulfide). In this work, the mechanisms supporting the respiratory versatility of D. desulfuricans were unraveled through the analysis of the proteome of the bacterium under different experimental conditions. The most remarkable difference in the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps is the high number of spots exclusively represented in the nitrate medium. Most of the proteins with increase abundance are involved in the energy metabolism and the biosynthesis of amino acids (or proteins), especially those participating in ammonium assimilation processes. qPCR analysis performed during different stages of the bacterium's growth showed that the genes involved in nitrate and nitrite reduction (napA and nrfA, respectively) have different expressions profiles: while napA did not vary significantly, nrfA was highly expressed at a 6\u00a0h time point. Nitrite levels measured along the growth curve revealed a peak at 3\u00a0h. Thus, the initial consumption of nitrate and concomitant production of nitrite must induce nrfA expression. The activation of alternative mechanisms for energy production, aside several N-assimilation metabolisms and detoxification processes, solves potential survival problems in adapting to different environments and contributes to higher bacterial growth rates.",

Anaerobic enzyme reduction in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer was biphasic using either choline or 1,2-[2H4]-choline as a substrate. The limiting rate constants klim1 and klim2 at saturating substrate were well separated (klim1/klim2\u00a0>\u00a09), and were >\u00a015-fold slower than for wild-type choline oxidase. Solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) ~\u00a04 established that klim1 probes the proton transfer from the substrate hydroxyl to a catalytic base. Primary substrate deuterium KIEs \u2265\u00a07 demonstrated that klim2 reports on hydride transfer from the choline alkoxide to the flavin. Between 15\u00a0\u00b0C and 39\u00a0\u00b0C the klim1 and klim2 values increased with increasing temperature, allowing for the analyses of H+ and H\u2013 transfers using Eyring and Arrhenius formalisms. Temperature-independent KIE on the klim1 value (H2Oklim1/D2Oklim1) suggests that proton transfer occurs within a highly reorganized tunneling-ready-state with a narrow distribution of donor-acceptor distances. Eyring analysis of the klim2 value gave lines with the slope(choline)\u00a0>\u00a0slope(D-choline), suggesting kinetic complexity. Spectral evidence for the transient occurrence of a covalent flavin-substrate adduct during the first phase of the anaerobic reaction of S101A CHO with choline is presented, supporting the notion that an important role of amino acid residues in the active site of flavin-dependent enzymes is to eliminate alternative reactions of the versatile enzyme-bound flavin for the reaction that needs to be catalyzed.",

Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 748T produces an aggregation-prone glycosidase (LpBgl) that we crystallized previously. However, this result could not be reproduced due to protein instability and therefore further high-resolution structural analyses of LpBgl were impeded. The obtained crystals of LpBgl diffracted up to 2.48\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and permitted to solve the structure of the enzyme. Analysis of the active site revealed a pocket for phosphate-binding with an uncommon architecture, where a phosphate molecule is tightly bound suggesting the recognition of 6-phosphoryl sugars. In agreement with this observation, we showed that LpBgl exhibited 6-phospho-\u03b2-glucosidase activity. Combination of structural and mass spectrometry results revealed the formation of dimethyl arsenic adducts on the solvent exposed cysteine residues Cys211 and Cys292. Remarkably, the double mutant Cys211Ser/Cys292Ser resulted stable in solution at high concentrations indicating that the marginal solubility of LpBgl can be ascribed specifically to these two cysteine residues. The 2.30\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of this double mutant showed no disorder around the newly incorporated serine residues and also loop rearrangements within the phosphate-binding site. Notably, LpBgl could be prepared at high yield by proteolytic digestion of the fusion protein LSLt-LpBgl, which raises important questions about potential hysteretic processes upon its initial production as an enzyme fused to a solubility enhancer.",

Thrombin also activates Factor XIII by cleaving the R37-G38 peptide bond of the Activation Peptide (AP) segment. The resultant transglutaminase introduces covalent crosslinks into the fibrin clot. A strategy to modify clot architecture would be to design FXIII AP sequences that are easier or more difficult to be thrombin-cleaved thus controlling initiation of crosslinking. To aid in this design process, FXIII V34X (28\u201341) Activation Peptides were kinetically ranked for cleavage by wild-type thrombin and several anticoagulant mutants. Thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of aromatic FXIII F34, W34, and Y34 APs was compared with V34 and L34. Cardioprotective FXIII L34 remained the variant most readily cleaved by wild-type thrombin. The potent anticoagulant thrombins W215A and W215A/E217A (missing a key substrate platform for binding fibrinogen) were best able to hydrolyze FXIII F34 and W34 APs. Thrombin I174A and L99A could effectively accommodate FXIII W34 and Y34 APs yielding kinetic parameters comparable to FXIII AP L34 with wild-type thrombin. None of the aromatic FXIII V34X APs could be hydrolyzed by thrombin Y60aA. FXIII F34 and W34 are promising candidates for FXIII \u2013 anticoagulant thrombin systems that could permit FXIII-catalyzed crosslinking in the presence of reduced fibrin formation. By contrast, FXIII Y34 with thrombin (Y60aA or W215A/E217A) could help assure that both fibrin clot formation and protein crosslinking are hindered. Regulating the activation of FXIII is predicted to be a strategy for helping to control fibrin clot architecture and its neighboring environments.",

     "abstract": "Preparation of modified and hybrid ferritin provides a great opportunity to understand the mechanisms of iron loading/unloading, protein self-assembly, size constrained nanomaterial synthesis and targeted drug delivery. However, the large size (M.W.\u00a0=\u00a0490\u00a0kDa) has been limiting the separation of different modified and/or hybrid ferritin nanocages from each other in their intact assembled form and further characterization. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) separates proteins on the basis of both charge and mass, while maintaining their overall native structure and activity. Altering surface charge distribution by substitution of amino acid residues located at the external surface of ferritin (K104E & D40A) affected the migration rate in native PAGE while internal modification had little effect. Crystal structures confirmed that ferritin nanocages made up of subunits with single amino acid substitutions retain the overall structure of ferritin nanocage. Taking advantage of K104E migration behavior, formation of hybrid ferritins with subunits of wild type (WT) and K104E were confirmed and separated in native PAGE. Cage integrity and iron loading ability (ferritin activity) were also tested. The migration pattern of hybrid ferritins in native PAGE depends on the subunit ratio (WT: K104E) in the ferritin cage. Our work shows that native PAGE can be exploited in nanobiotechnology, by analyzing modifications of large proteins like ferritin.Native PAGE, a simple, straight-forward technique, can be used to analyze small modification (by altering external surface charge) in large proteins like ferritin, without disintegrating its self-assembled nanocage structure. In doing so, native PAGE can complement the information obtained from mass spectrometry. The confirmation and separation of modified and hybrid ferritin protein nanocages in native PAGE, opens up various prospects of bio-conjugation, which can be useful in targeted drug delivery, nanobiotechnology and in understanding nature's idea of synthesizing hybrid ferritins in different human tissues.",

     "abstract": "Three NPXY motifs and one FERM domain in CCM1 makes it a versatile scaffold protein for tethering the signaling components together within the CCM signaling complex (CSC). The cellular role of CCM1 protein remains inadequately expounded. Both phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains were recognized as structurally related but functionally distinct domains.By utilizing molecular cloning, protein binding assays and RT-qPCR to identify novel cellular partners of CCM1 and its cellular expression patterns; by screening candidate PTB/PH proteins and subsequently structurally simulation in combining with current X-ray crystallography and NMR data to defined the essential structure of PTB/PH domain for NPXY-binding and the relationship among PTB, PH and FERM domain(s).We identified a group of 28 novel cellular partners of CCM1, all of which contain either PTB or PH domain(s), and developed a novel classification system for these PTB/PH proteins based on their relationship with different NPXY motifs of CCM1. Our results demonstrated that CCM1 has a wide spectrum of binding to different PTB/PH proteins and perpetuates their specificity to interact with certain PTB/PH domains through selective combination of three NPXY motifs. We also demonstrated that CCM1 can be assembled into oligomers through intermolecular interaction between its F3 lobe in FERM domain and one of the three NPXY motifs. Despite being embedded in FERM domain as F3 lobe, F3 module acts as a fully functional PH domain to interact with NPXY motif. The most salient feature of the study was that both PTB and PH domains are structurally and functionally comparable, suggesting that PTB domain is likely evolved from PH domain with polymorphic structural additions at its N-terminus.A new \u03b21A-strand of the PTB domain was discovered and new minimum structural requirement of PTB/PH domain for NPXY motif-binding was determined. Based on our data, a novel theory of structure, function and relationship of PTB, PH and FERM domains has been proposed, which extends the importance of the NPXY-PTB/PH interaction on the CSC signaling and/or other cell receptors with great potential pointing to new therapeutic strategies.The study provides new insight into the structural characteristics of PTB/PH domains, essential structural elements of PTB/PH domain required for NPXY motif-binding, and function and relationship among PTB, PH and FERM domains.",

     "abstract": "Ephrin A2 receptor (EphA2) plays a key role in cancer, it is up-regulated in several types of tumors and the process of ligand-induced receptor endocytosis, followed by degradation, is considered as a potential path to diminish tumor malignancy. Protein modulators of this mechanism are recruited at the cytosolic Sterile alpha motif (Sam) domain of EphA2 (EphA2-Sam) through heterotypic Sam-Sam associations. These interactions engage the C-terminal helix of EphA2 and close loop regions (the so called End Helix side). In addition, several studies report on destabilizing mutations in EphA2 related to cataract formation and located in/or close to the Sam domain. Herein, we analyzed from a structural point of view, one of these mutants characterized by the insertion of a novel 39 residue long polypeptide at the C-terminus of EphA2-Sam. A 3D structural model was built by computational methods and revealed partial disorder in the acquired C-terminal tail and a few residues participating in an \u03b1-helix and two short \u03b2-strands. We investigated by CD and NMR studies the conformational properties in solution of two peptides encompassing the whole C-terminal tail and its predicted helical region, respectively. NMR binding experiments demonstrated that these peptides do not interact relevantly with either EphA2-Sam or its interactor Ship2-Sam. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further indicated that the EphA2 mutant could be represented only through a conformational ensemble and that the C-terminal tail should not largely wrap the EphA2-Sam End-Helix interface and affect binding to other Sam domains.",

Lipases/acyltransferases share the phenotypic characteristic of a high acyltransfer activity even in aqueous media with very high water thermodynamic activity. Previous mutagenesis and evolution strategies have given insights into the role of key residues and protein subdomains in the reaction and substrate specificities of these enzymes. However, multiple mutations are often deleterious for the activity and the identification of all the residues that historically led to the function is complicated. A new complementary approach to elucidate structural determinant was conducted in this study, based on the resurrection of ancestral proteins to understand how the evolution led to the present properties of the biocatalysts. By doing so, the comparison with the extant proteins can lead to the identification of key residues involved in the enzymes' specialization. Using Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction, we have generated a putative ancestral lipases/acyltransferases, PaleoLAc. This enzyme shares a high level of identity with CpLIP2 but has a different catalytic behavior. PaleoLAc allowed the identification of putative key residues involved in acyltransfer ability and supports the hypothesis that this exceptional property within the lipases/acyltransferases family is linked to a cluster of residues in the vicinity of the active site. As a representative of the ancestral origin of the diversity of the catalytic behaviors observed in modern lipases/acyltransferases, PaleoLAc constitutes a powerful tool for further engineering toward targeted specialization.",

To better understand the molecular mechanisms of HCC metastasis, we analyzed the proteome of three HCC cell lines with different metastasis potentials by quantitative proteomics and bioinformatics analysis. As a result, we identified 378 cellular proteins potentially associated to HCC metastasis, and constructed a highly connected protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network. Functional annotation of the network uncovered prominent pathways and key roles of these proteins, suggesting that the metabolism and cytoskeleton biological processes are greatly involved with HCC metastasis. Furthermore, the integrative network analysis revealed a rich-club organization within the PPI network, indicating a hub center of connections. The rich-club nodes include several well-known cancer-related proteins, such as proto-oncogene non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). Moreover, the differential expressions of two identified proteins, including PKM2 and actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), were validated using Western blotting. These two proteins were revealed as potential prognostic markers for HCC as shown by survival rate analysis.",

     "abstract": "d-Aspartate oxidase (DDO) is a degradative enzyme that is stereospecific for the acidic amino acid d-aspartate, an endogenous agonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Dysregulation of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission has been implicated in the onset of various neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and in chronic pain. Thus, appropriate regulation of the amount of d-aspartate is believed to be important for maintaining proper neural activity in the nervous system. Herein, the effects of the non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) R216Q and S308N on several properties of human DDO were examined. Analysis of the purified recombinant enzyme showed that the R216Q and S308N substitutions reduce enzyme activity towards acidic d-amino acids, decrease the binding affinity for the coenzyme flavin adenine dinucleotide and decrease the temperature stability. Consistent with these findings, further experiments using cultured mammalian cells revealed elevated d-aspartate in cultures of R216Q and S308N cells compared with cells expressing wild-type DDO. Furthermore, accumulation of several amino acids other than d-aspartate also differed between these cultures. Thus, expression of DDO genes carrying the R216Q or S308N SNP substitutions may increase the d-aspartate content in humans and alter homeostasis of several other amino acids. This work may aid in understanding the correlation between DDO activity and the risk of onset of NMDA receptor-related diseases.",

The activated form, \u0394N-HtrA3L is a homotrimer composed of the protease (PD) and PDZ domains. The LB structural loop of the PD is longer by six amino acid residues than its counterparts of other human HtrA proteins and interacts with the PDZ in a way not observed in other known HtrA structures. By size exclusion chromatography of the \u0394N-HtrA3L mutated variants we found that removal of the additional LB loop residues caused a complete loss of the proper trimeric structure while impairing their interactions with the PDZ domain decreased the amount of the trimers. This indicates that the LB loop participates in stabilization of the \u0394N-HtrA3L oligomer structure and suggests involvement of the LB-PDZ interactions in the stabilization. Removal of the additional LB loop residues impaired the \u0394N-HtrA3L activity against the peptide and protein substrates, including the antiapoptotic XIAP protein, while a decrease in the LB-PDZ interaction caused a diminished efficiency of the peptide cleavage. These results indicate that the additional LB residues are important for the \u0394N-HtrA3L proteolytic activity. Furthermore, a monomeric form of the \u0394N-HtrA3L is proteolytically inactive. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expanded LB loop promotes the \u0394N-HtrA3L activity by stabilizing the protease native trimeric structure.",

We collected residue-resolved NMR spectral fingerprints of the two variants, and compared secondary structures, backbone dynamics, side chain arrangements, binding site occupation, and intermolecular contacts. We found that threonine to alanine replacement did not result in strongly perturbed structural and dynamic features, although differences in oleic acid binding by the two variants were detected. Based on chemical shift perturbations at sites distant from position 94 and on differences in intermolecular contacts, we suggest that long-range communication networks in L-FABP propagate the effect of amino acid substitution at sites relevant for ligand binding or biomolecular recognition.",

Protein expression profiles were compared between invasive and non-invasive tumors surgically resected from 11 patients. Among the 3453 protein spots observed, 59 demonstrated statistically significant difference in intensity (\u2265\u00a02-fold) between invasive and non-invasive tumors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 by Wilkoxon test), and were identified by mass spectrometry as 47 individual proteins. Among them, we further focused on discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain-containing protein 2 (DCBLD2), a receptor tyrosine kinase with aberrant expression in malignant tumors. Immunohistochemistry analysis of 21 additional MFS cases revealed that higher DCBLD2 expression was significantly associated with invasive properties of tumor cells.

Attenuated photosynthesis by waterlogging stress in the leaf of soybean seedlings was indicated from proteomic results. Defensive mechanisms such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging was also recognized. Cluster analysis revealed that proteins that exhibit characteristic dynamics in response to waterlogging were mainly related to photosynthesis. Among the identified photorespiration-related proteins, the protein abundance and enzyme activity of hydroxypyruvate reductase were transiently increased in control plants, but were clearly decreased in response to waterlogging stress. These results suggest that waterlogging directly impairs photosynthesis and photorespiration.

Within the RAR genomic pathways, binding of RARs to coregulators is a key intermediate regulatory phase. However, ligand-dependent interactions between the wide variety of coregulators that may be present in a cell and the different RAR subtypes are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to characterize the coregulator binding profiles of RARs in the presence of the pan-agonist all-trans-Retinoic Acid (AtRA); the subtype-selective agonists Am80 (RAR\u03b1), CD2314 (RAR\u03b2) and BMS961 (RAR\u03b3); and the antagonist Ro415253. To this end, we used a microarray assay for coregulator-nuclear receptor interactions to assess RAR binding to 154 motifs belonging to >\u00a060 coregulators. The results revealed a high number of ligand-dependent RAR-coregulator interactions among all RAR variants, including many binding events not yet described in literature. Next, this work confirmed a greater ligand-independent activity of RAR\u03b2 compared to the other RAR subtypes based on both higher basal and lower ligand-driven coregulator binding. Further, several coregulator motifs showed selective binding to a specific RAR subtype. Next, this work showed that subtype-selective agonists can be successfully discriminated by using coregulator binding assays. Finally this study demonstrated the possible applications of a coregulator binding assay as a tool to discriminate between agonistic/antagonistic actions of ligands.

Desiccated cells of D. radiodurans entered 6\u00a0h of growth arrest during post-desiccation recovery (PDR). Proteome dynamics during PDR were mapped by resolving cellular proteins by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. At least 41 proteins, represented by 51 spots on proteome profiles, were differentially expressed throughout PDR. High upregulation in expression was observed for DNA repair proteins involved in single strand annealing (DdrA and DdrB), nucleotide excision repair (UvrA and UvrB), homologous recombination (RecA) and other vital proteins that contribute to DNA replication, recombination and repair (Ssb, GyrA and GyrB). Expression of CRP/FNR family transcriptional regulator (Crp) remained high throughout PDR. Other pathways such as cellular detoxification, protein homeostasis and metabolism displayed both, moderately induced and repressed proteins. Functional relevance of proteomic modulations to surviving desiccation stress is discussed in detail. Comparison of our data with the published literature revealed convergence of radiation and desiccation stress responses of D. radiodurans. This is the first report that substantiates the hypothesis that the radiation stress resistance of D. radiodurans is incidental to its desiccation stress resistance.",

We recently reported that N-acethyl-l-methionine (N-AcMet) is an antioxidant for HSA, which is superior to N-AcTrp when it is especially exposed to light during storage. The objective of the present study is to clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for the HSA protective effect of Oct and N-AcMet based on their ternary complex structure. Crystal structure of the HSA\u2013Oct\u2013N-AcMet complex showed that one N-AcMet molecule is bound to the entrance of drug site 1 of HSA, and its side chain, which is susceptible to the oxidation, is exposed to the solvent. At the same time, two Oct binding sites are observed in drug sites 1 and 2 of HSA, respectively, and each Oct molecule occupies the hydrophobic cavity in them. These results indicate the molecular mechanism responsible for the HSA stabilization by these small molecules as follows. N-AcMet seals the entrance of drug site 1 while it acts as an antioxidant for HSA. Oct is chiefly bound to drug site 2 of HSA and it increases the thermal stability of HSA because of the occupying the largest intra-cavity of sub-domain IIIA in HSA. These findings suggest that N-AcMet acts positively as useful stabilizer for albumin formulated products such as functionalized HSA and HSA fusion proteins.",

Hence, novel ways of generating such engineered antibodies for use in affinity proteomics could have a major impact on array performance. In this study, we have further tailored the design of human recombinant scFv antibodies for site-specific photocoupling through the use of an unnatural amino acid (UAA) and the Dock'n'Flash technology. In more detail, we have generated the 2nd generation of scFvs carrying the photoreactive UAA p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (pBpa). Based on key properties, such as expression levels, activity, and affinity, a preferred choice of site for pBpa, located in the beginning of the C-terminal affinity-tag, was for the first time pin-pointed. Further, the results showed that pBpa mutated antibody could be site-specifically photocoupled to free and surface immobilized \u03b2-cyclodextrin (an affinity ligand to pBpa).

We performed the Phe mutations at the four amino acids, Tyr69, Cys138, Trp139, and Tyr496 located in the outer-sphere of TNC in CueO at the aim of studying whether they play a role as the fourth electron donor to dioxygen or not. Spectral properties and enzymatic activities of CueO were sparingly affected or not affected by the mutations at these putative electron donors. Of the targeted four amino acids Trp139 is in a d-\u03c0 interaction distance with one of T3Cus and drives stepwise formation and release of water molecules by making two T3Cus non-equivalent. However, contribution of a radical species derived from Trp139 has not been observed in the formation and decay processes of the reaction intermediates. The present study strongly suggests that the amino acids located in the outer-sphere of TNC are not utilized as electron donor in the reduction of dioxygen to water by the three-domain MCO, CueO, differing from cytochrome oxidase and SLAC, a two-domain MCO, in which reaction participation of an uncoordinated Tyr residue has been proposed.We performed the Phe mutations at the four amino acids, Tyr69, Cys138, Trp139 and Tyr496 located in the outer-coordination sphere of the trinuclear copper center in a three-domain multicopper oxidase, CueO to ascertain whether they function as an electron donor or not in the four-electron reduction of dioxygen.

In this study, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bat brain proteins were fractionated, and their abundance in active and torpid states was compared. Results of 2D gel-based proteomics showed that 38% of identified proteins with a significant change in abundance are involved in synaptic vesicle recycling and cytoskeletal integrity. Changes in the abundance of proteins related to RNA splicing, proteostasis, redox homeostasis, mitochondrial function, and energy metabolism were also detected. In addition, the levels of GNAO1 (guanine nucleotide-binding protein G\u03b1o subunit), an important modulator of neuronal transmembrane signaling, were significantly increased in the insoluble protein fraction of torpid bats; this may be due to GNAO1 palmitoylation making it insoluble. Our data provide molecular evidence for the maintenance of neuronal activities in torpid bats and suggest that a reversible palmitoylation of the G protein plays a role in the regulation of neuronal activities during bat hibernation.",

Five channels have been identified, and the thermodynamic and dynamic characterizations for the two most favorable channels have been determined and analyzed. The free energy barrier for the most beneficial pathway is about 13\u00a0kcal/mol and mainly results from the cleavage of hydrogen bonds between the ligand uracil and surrounding residues Asn51, Glu64, and Asp155.

These enzymes are functionally very well studied, but only few members have three-dimensional structures characterised. Recently, a new EH from the filamentous fungi Trichoderma reseei (TrEH) has been discovered and functionally studied. This enzyme does not have high homology to any other EH structure and have an enatiopreference for (S)-(\u2212) isomers. Herein we described the crystallographic structure of TrEH at 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, which reveals features of its tertiary structure and active site. TrEH has a similar fold to the other soluble epoxide hydrolases and has the two characteristic hydrolase and cap domains. The enzyme is predominantly monomeric in solution and has also been crystallised as a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Although the catalytic residues are conserved, several other residues of the catalytic groove are not, and might be involved in the specificity for substrates and in the enantioselectivy of this enzyme. In addition, the determination of the crystallographic structure of TrEH might contribute to the rational site direct mutagenesis to generate an even more stable enzyme with higher efficiency to be used in biotechnological purposes.",

In the present study, we heterologously expressed PST2 in Escherichia coli and purified the produced protein to conduct a detailed biochemical and structural characterization. Determination of the three-dimensional structure by X-ray crystallography revealed that Pst2p adopts the flavodoxin-like fold and forms tetramers independent of cofactor binding. The lack of electron density for FMN indicated weak binding, which was confirmed by further biochemical analysis yielding a dissociation constant of 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcM. The redox potential of FMN bound to Pst2p was determined to \u2212\u00a089\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mV and is thus 119\u00a0mV more positive than that of free FMN indicating that reduced FMN binds ca. five orders of magnitude tighter to Pst2p than oxidized FMN. Due to this rather positive redox potential Pst2p is unable to reduce free FMN or azo dyes as reported for other members of the flavodoxin-like protein family. On the other hand, Pst2p efficiently catalyzes the NAD(P)H dependent two-electron reduction of natural and artificial quinones. The kinetic mechanism follows a ping-pong bi-bi reaction scheme. In vivo experiments with a PST2 knock out and overexpressing strain demonstrated that Pst2p enables yeast cells to cope with quinone-induced damage suggesting a role of the enzyme in managing oxidative stress.",

The allergen, named Sal k 6, exhibits a pI of 7.14 and a molecular mass of 39,554.2\u00a0Da. It presents similarities to Platanaceae, Poaceae, and Cupressaceae allergenic polygalacturonases. cDNA-encoding sequence was subcloned into the pET41b vector and produced in bacteria as a His-tag fusion recombinant protein. The far-UV CD spectrum determined that rSal k 6 was folded. Immunostaining of the S. kali pollen protein extract with a rSal k 6-specific pAb and LC-MS/MS proteomic analyses confirmed the co-existence of the 28\u00a0kDa band together with an allergenic band of about 47\u00a0kDa in the pollen extract. Therefore, the 28\u00a0kDa was assigned as a natural degradation product of the 47\u00a0kDa integral polygalacturonase. The IgE-binding inhibition to S. kali pollen extract using rSal k 6 as inhibitor showed that signals directed to both protein bands of 28 and 47\u00a0kDa were completely abrogated.

The reaction occurs via a radical-based mechanism whereby a PLP-bound substrate radical undergoes intramolecular isomerization via an azacyclopropylcarbinyl radical intermediate. Herein, we investigated the catalytic role of active site residues that form non-covalent interactions with PLP and/or substrate, d-ornithine. Kinetic analyses revealed that residues that form salt bridges to the \u03b1-carboxylate (R297) or the \u03b1-amine (E81) of d-ornithine are most critical for OAM activity as conservative substitutions of these residues results in a 300\u2013600-fold reduction in catalytic turnover and a more pronounced 1000- to 14,000-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency. In contrast, mutating residues that solely interact with the PLP cofactor led to more modest decreases (10\u201360-fold) in kcat and kcat/Km. All but one variant (S162A) elicited an increase in the kinetic isotope effect on kcat and kcat/Km with d,l-ornithine-3,3,4,4,5,5-d6 as the substrate, which indicates that hydrogen atom abstraction is more rate determining. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the variants reveal that while the substitutions decrease the extent of CoC bond homolysis, they do not affect the structural integrity of the active site. Our experimental results, discussed in context with published computational work, suggests that the protonation state of the PLP cofactor has less of a role in radical-mediated chemistry compared to electrostatic interactions between the substrate and protein.",

However, in gymnosperms, only antifungal activity of defensins has been described thus far. Here, we report antibacterial and insect \u03b1-amylase inhibition activities for defensin PsDef1 from P. sylvestris, the first defensin from gymnosperms with a broad range of biological activities described. We also report the solution NMR structure of PsDef1 and its dynamics properties assessed by a combination of experimental NMR and computational techniques. Collectively, our data provide an insight into structure, dynamics, and functional properties of PsDef1 that could be common between defensins from this taxonomic group.",

     "abstract": "Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) permits label-free in situ analysis of chemical compounds directly from the surface of two-dimensional biological tissue slices. It links qualitative molecular information of compounds to their spatial coordinates and distribution within the investigated tissue. MALDI-MSI can also provide the quantitative amounts of target compounds in the tissue, if proper calibration techniques are performed. Obviously, as the target molecules are embedded within the biological tissue environment and analysis must be performed at their precise locations, there is no possibility for extensive sample clean-up routines or chromatographic separations as usually performed with homogenized biological materials; ion suppression phenomena therefore become a critical side effect of MALDI-MSI. Absolute quantification by MALDI-MSI should provide an accurate value of the concentration/amount of the compound of interest in relatively small, well-defined region of interest of the examined tissue, ideally in a single pixel. This goal is extremely challenging and will not only depend on the technical possibilities and limitations of the MSI instrument hardware, but equally on the chosen calibration/standardization strategy. These strategies are the main focus of this article and are discussed and contrasted in detail in this tutorial review.

     "abstract": "The environmental toxin \u03b2-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been proposed to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that neonatal exposure to BMAA results in dose-dependent cognitive impairments, proteomic alterations and progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of adult rats. A high BMAA dose (460\u00a0mg/kg) also induced intracellular fibril formation, increased protein ubiquitination and enrichment of proteins important for lipid transport and metabolism. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate the role of neuronal lipids in BMAA-induced neurodegeneration. By using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS), we characterized the spatial lipid profile in the hippocampus of six month-old rats that were treated neonatally (postnatal days 9\u201310) with 460\u00a0mg/kg BMAA. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed long-term changes in distinct ganglioside species (GM, GD, GT) in the dentate gyrus. These changes could be a consequence of direct effects on ganglioside biosynthesis through the b-series (GM3-GD3-GD2-GD1b-GT1b) and may be linked to astrogliosis. Complementary immunohistochemistry experiments towards GFAP and S100\u03b2 further verified the role of increased astrocyte activity in BMAA-induced brain damage. This highlights the potential of imaging MS for probing chemical changes associated with neuropathological mechanisms in situ.

Using different sample preparation strategies, proteins and metabolites have been profiled to study the molecular changes in a 3\u00d7Tg mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. In comparison with wild-type (WT) control mice MALDI-MSI revealed Alzheimer's disease-specific protein profiles, highlighting dramatic reductions of a protein with m/z 7560, which was assigned to neurogranin and validated by immunohistochemistry. The analysis also revealed substantial metabolite changes, especially in metabolites related to the purine metabolic pathway, with a shift towards an increase in hypoxanthine/xanthine/uric acid in the 3\u00d7Tg AD mice accompanied by a decrease in AMP and adenine. Interestingly these changes were also associated with a decrease in ascorbic acid, consistent with oxidative stress. Furthermore, the metabolite N-arachidonyl taurine was increased in the diseased mouse brain sections, being highly abundant in the hippocampus. Overall, we describe an interesting shift towards pro-inflammatory molecules (uric acid) in the purinergic pathway associated with a decrease in anti-oxidant level (ascorbic acid). Together, these observations fit well with the increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation commonly observed in AD.

After three rounds of imaging data acquisitions (i.e., quercetin for positive and negative ion detection and 9-aminoacridine for negative ion detection), and metabolite identification, a total of 1091 metabolites including 1032 lipids and 59 other metabolites were routinely detected and successfully localized. Of these compounds, 250 and 217 were only detected in either the cancerous or the non-cancerous regions respectively, although we cannot rule out the presence of these metabolites at concentrations below the detection limit. In addition, 152 of the other 624 metabolites showed differential distributions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, t-test) between the two regions of the tissues. Further studies on a larger number of clinical specimens will need to be carried out to confirm this large number of apparently cancer-related metabolites. The successful determination of the spatial locations and abundances of these endogenous biomolecules indicated significant metabolism abnormalities \u2013 e.g., increased energy charge and under-expression of neutral acyl glycerides, in the prostate cancer samples.

However, in some cases appropriate classification is not possible based on histopathological features only, and it might be supported by molecular biomarkers. Here we aimed to characterize molecular profiles of different thyroid malignancies using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) which enables the direct annotation of molecular features with morphological pictures of an analyzed tissue. Fifteen formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens corresponding to five major types of thyroid cancer were analyzed by MALDI-MSI after in-situ trypsin digestion, and the possibility of classification based on the results of unsupervised segmentation of MALDI images was tested. Novel method of semi-supervised detection of the cancer region of interest (ROI) was implemented. We found strong separation of medullary cancer from malignancies derived from thyroid epithelium, and separation of anaplastic cancer from differentiated cancers. Reliable classification of medullary and anaplastic cancers using an approach based on automated detection of cancer ROI was validated with independent samples. Moreover, extraction of spectra from tumor areas allowed the detection of molecular components that differentiated follicular cancer and two variants of papillary cancer (classical and follicular). We concluded that MALDI-MSI approach is a promising strategy in the search for biomarkers supporting classification of thyroid malignant tumors.

Using data dependent acquisition LC-ESI-MS/MS we were able to detect 23 of these proteins in endometrial cancers, and using data independent LC-ESI-MS/MS the differential abundance of five of those proteins was observed. The localization of the differentially expressed proteins, was visualized using peptide MALDI MSI in whole tissue sections as well as tissue microarrays of 43 patients.

Our data indicate that annexin A2 protein level is upregulated, whereas annexin A1 and \u03b1 actinin 4 expression are downregulated in tumours with lymph node metastasis compared to those without lymphatic spread. Moreover, our analysis confirmed the potential of these markers, to be included in a statistical model for prediction of lymph node metastasis.

     "abstract": "Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is an immunocomplex mediated renal disease that represents one of the most frequent glomerulopathies worldwide. This glomerular disease can manifest as primary (idiopathic) or secondary and this distinction is crucial when choosing the most appropriate course of treatment. In secondary cases, the best strategy involves treating the underlying disease, whereas in primary forms, the identification of confirmatory markers of the idiopathic etiology underlining the process is requested by clinicians. Among those currently reported, the positivity to circulating antigens (PLA2R, IgG4 and THSD7A) was demonstrated in approximately 75% of iMN patients, while approximately 1 in 4 patients with iMN still lack a putative diagnostic marker. Ultimately, the discovery of biomarkers to help further stratify these two different forms of glomerulopathy seems mandatory.Here, MALDI-MSI was applied to FFPE renal biopsies from histologically diagnosed primary and secondary MN patients (n\u00a0=\u00a020) in order to detect alterations in their tissue proteome. MALDI-MSI was able to generate molecular signatures of primary and secondary MN, with one particular signal (m/z 1459), identified as Serine/threonine-protein kinase MRCK gamma, being over-expressed in the glomeruli of primary MN patients with respect to secondary MN. Furthermore, a number of signals that could differentiate the different forms of iMN that were positive to PLA2R or IgG4 were detected, as well as a further set of signals (m/z 1094, 1116, 1381 and 1459) that could distinguish these patients from those who were negative to both. These signals could potentially represent future targets for the further stratification of iMN patients.

     "abstract": "An integrated diagnosis using molecular features is recommended in the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Our aim was to explore non-targeted molecular classification using MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) associated to microproteomics in order to classify anaplastic glioma by integration of clinical data. We used fresh-frozen tissue sections to perform MALDI MSI of proteins based on their digestion peptides after in-situ trypsin digestion of the tissue sections and matrix deposition by micro-spraying. The generated 70\u00a0\u03bcm spatial resolution image datasets were further processed by individual or global segmentation in order to cluster the tissues according to their molecular protein signature. The clustering gives 3 main distinct groups. Within the tissues the ROIs (regions of interest) defined by these groups were used for microproteomics by micro-extraction of the tryptic peptides after on-tissue enzymatic digestion. More than 2500 proteins including 22 alternative proteins (AltProt) are identified by the Shotgun microproteomics. Statistical analysis on the basis of the label free quantification of the proteins shows a similar classification to the MALDI MSI segmentation into 3 groups. Functional analysis performed on each group reveals sub-networks related to neoplasia for group 1, glioma with inflammation for group 2 and neurogenesis for group 3. This demonstrates the interest on these new non-targeted large molecular data combining both MALDI MSI and microproteomics data, for tumor classification. This analysis provides new insights into grade III glioma organization. This specific information could allow a more accurate classification of the biopsies according to the prognosis and the identification of potential new targeted therapeutic options.

The development of such applications requires the extraction of spectral fingerprints that are relevant for the given tissue and the identification of biomarkers associated with these spectral patterns. We propose a novel data analysis method based on the extraction of characteristic spectral patterns (CSPs) that allow automated generation of classification models for spectral data.Formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from N\u00a0=\u00a0445 patients assembled on 12 tissue microarrays were analyzed. The method was applied to discriminate primary lung and pancreatic cancer, as well as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.A classification accuracy of 100% and 82.8%, resp., could be achieved on core level, assessed by cross-validation. The method outperformed the more conventional classification method based on the extraction of individual m/z values in the first application, while achieving a comparable accuracy in the second.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing this switch are largely unknown. We employed MALDI MS imaging (MSI) to screen for changes in expression of small proteins in brain structures implicated in the different learning phases. We compared mice trained for 3\u00a0days and 30\u00a0days in the MWM, reflecting an early and a late learning phase in relation to the acquisition of a spatial learning task. An ion with m/z of 6724, identified as PEP-19/pcp4 by top-down tandem MS, was detected at higher intensity in the dorsal striatum of the late learning phase group compared with the early learning phase group. In addition, mass spectrometric analysis of synaptosomes confirmed the presence of PEP-19/pcp4 at the synapse. PEP-19/pcp4 has previously been identified as a critical determinant of synaptic plasticity in locomotor learning. Our findings extend PEP-19/pcp4 function to spatial learning in the forebrain and put MSI forward as a valid and unbiased research strategy for the discovery and identification of the molecular machinery involved in learning, memory and synaptic plasticity.

To demonstrate these facets here we describe a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MSI biomarker discovery investigation of high-grade, complex karyotype sarcomas, which often have histological overlap and moderate response to chemo-/radio-therapy.

     "abstract": "Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is a molecular imaging technology that can measure thousands of biomolecules concurrently without prior tagging, making it particularly suitable for exploratory research. However, the data size and dimensionality often makes thorough extraction of relevant information impractical. To help guide and accelerate IMS data analysis, we recently developed a framework that integrates IMS measurements with anatomical atlases, opening up opportunities for anatomy-driven exploration of IMS data. One example is the automated anatomical interpretation of ion images, where empirically measured ion distributions are automatically decomposed into their underlying anatomical structures.While offering significant potential, IMS-atlas integration has thus far been restricted to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (AMBA) and mouse brain samples. Here, we expand the applicability of this framework by extending towards new animal species and a new set of anatomical atlases retrieved from the Scalable Brain Atlas (SBA). Furthermore, as many SBA atlases are based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, a new registration pipeline was developed that enables direct non-rigid IMS-to-MRI registration. These developments are demonstrated on protein-focused FTICR IMS measurements from coronal brain sections of a Parkinson's disease (PD) rat model. The measurements are integrated with an MRI-based rat brain atlas from the SBA. The new rat-focused IMS-atlas integration is used to perform automated anatomical interpretation and to find differential ions between healthy and diseased tissue. IMS-atlas integration can serve as an important accelerator in IMS data exploration, and with these new developments it can now be applied to a wider variety of animal species and modalities.

To further investigate the solvation effects on the structure, Ca2+ binding affinity and conformational dynamics of this N-Cam double mutant in the Ca2+ saturated state, we solved its X-ray structure. Surprisingly, the structure revealed an open conformation of the domain which contradicts its closed conformation in solution. Here we provide evidence that crystallization conditions were responsible for this Ca2+-saturated domain open conformation in the crystal. Importantly, we demonstrate that the presence of the crystallization co-precipitant and alcohols were able to induce a progressive opening of the closed form of this domain, in Ca2+ saturated state, in solution. However, in the Ca2+ depleted state, addition of alcohols was unable to induce any opening of this domain in solution. In addition, in the Ca2+ saturated state, the molecular dynamics simulations show that while N-Cam can populate the open and closed conformation, the N-Cam double mutant exclusively populates the closed conformation. Our results provide experimental evidence of intermediate conformations of Ca2+-saturated N-Cam in solution. We propose that conformational change of Ca2+ sensor EF-hand domains depends on solvation energetics, Ca2+ binding to promote the full open form, Ca2+ depleted state conformational dynamics, and the chemical properties of the molecules nearby key residues such as those at positions 41 and 75 in N-Cam.",

Processes mediating RNA sorting into exosomes are currently poorly understood. Using bioinformatics approaches, three structural motifs ACCAGCCU, CAGUGAGC and UAAUCCCA have been discovered as enriched in exosomal mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Here, utilizing short RNA hairpins, each containing one of the motifs, in a pull-down assay of cytosolic extract of human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, we prove that multifunctional RNA-binding protein YB-1 specifically interacts with all three motifs, whereas methyltransferase NSUN2 recognizes only the motif CAGUGAGC. RNA hairpins other than those mentioned above pull out neither YB-1 nor NSUN2. Both these proteins are found in exosomes secreted by HEK293 cells. YB-1 for all that is detected as a form having a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility than that of YB-1 associated with the above RNA hairpins, assuming changes in posttranslational modifications of the protein during its transfer from cytoplasm into exosomes. Next generation sequencing of total exosomal RNA (eRNA) reveals a large representative set of RNA species, including mRNAs containing the above-mentioned motifs. The degree of enrichment in exosomes with this kind of mRNAs strongly depends on the locations of eRNA-specific motifs within the mRNA sequences. Altogether, our findings point to YB-1 and NSUN2 as possible mediators of the process of transfer of specific mRNAs into exosomes, allowing us to speculate on an involvement of these proteins in the mRNA sorting via the recognition of the above motifs.",

More recently, an alternate ligand-binding site was identified in PPAR\u03b3 LBD; it is located beside the \u03a9 loop between the helices H2\u2032 and H3. We reported previously that the chirality of two optimized enantiomeric PPAR\u03b3 ligands (S35 and R35) differentiates their PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity, binding affinity, and inhibitory activity toward Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5)-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser245 (in PPAR\u03b31 numbering; Ser273 in PPAR\u03b32 numbering). S35 is a PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation inhibitor with promising glucose uptake potential, whereas R35 behaves as a potent conventional PPAR\u03b3 agonist. To provide a structural basis for understanding the differential activities of these enantiomeric ligands, we have determined crystal structures of the PPAR\u03b3 LBD in complex with either S35 or R35. S35 and R35 bind to the PPAR\u03b3 LBD in significantly different manners. The partial agonist S35 occupies the alternate site near the \u03a9 loop, whereas the full agonist R35 binds entirely to the canonical LBP. Alternate site binding of S35 affects the PPAR\u03b3 transactivation and the inhibitory effect on PPAR\u03b3 Ser245 phosphorylation. This study provides a useful platform for the development of a new generation of PPAR\u03b3 ligands as anti-diabetic drug candidates.",

     "abstract": "Liprotides are protein-lipid complexes in which the fatty acids form a micelle-like core surrounded by a shell of partially unfolded protein molecules. These complexes can be formed in different ways. The simplest approach is a thermal treatment where protein and fatty acid are mixed and then incubated at elevated temperatures. Using this approach we here demonstrate that we can monitor liprotide formation in real time using Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). Optimal conditions for liprotide formation, i.e. temperature and incubation times, as well as liprotide stability and structure, vary for different proteins. The apo form of \u03b1-lactalbumin (aLA) forms liprotides at room temperature, however, Ovalbumin (Ova) and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) require elevated temperatures (\u2265\u00a060\u00a0\u00b0C) to form liprotides, and in addition, they need to be returned to lower temperatures to remain stable; repeated cycles of heating and cooling gradually dissociate the liprotides in parallel with the formation of disulfide-bonded aggregates. Real-time tracking of the formation of liprotides of BSA or Ova with OA at 60\u201365\u00a0\u00b0C showed that liprotide formation takes place within a period of 12\u201318\u00a0min and is preceded by a loss of secondary structure of the protein and binding of OA to the protein. Our SAXS-based approach provides a straightforward strategy to optimize liprotide formation for a wide range of different proteins.",

     "abstract": "Spectrin, a major component of the eukaryotic membrane skeleton, has been shown to have chaperone like activity. Here we investigate the pH induced changes in the structure and stability of erythroid and brain spectrin by spectroscopic methods. We also correlate these changes with modulations of chaperone potential at different pH. We have followed the pH induced structural changes by circular dichroism spectroscopy and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. It is seen that lowering the pH from 9 has little effect on structure of the proteins till about pH\u00a06. At pH\u00a04, there is significant change of the secondary structure of the proteins, along with a 5\u00a0nm hypsochromic shift of the emission maxima. Below pH\u00a04 the proteins undergo acid denaturation. Probing exposed hydrophobic patches on the proteins using protein-bound 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate fluorescence demonstrates that there is higher solvent accessibility of hydrophobic surfaces in both forms of spectrin at around pH\u00a04. Dynamic light scattering and 90\u00b0 light scattering studies show that the both forms of spectrin forms oligomers at pH\u00a0~\u00a04. Chemical unfolding data shows that these oligomers are less stable than the tetrameric form. Aggregation studies with BSA show that at pH\u00a04, both spectrins exhibit better chaperone activity. This enhancement of chaperone like activity appears to result from an increase in regions of solvent-exposed hydrophobicity and oligomeric state of the spectrins which in turn are induced by moderately acid pH. This may have in-vivo implications in cells facing stress conditions where cytoplasmic pH is lowered.",

EccA3 is a thermostable ATPase with a molecular weight of ~\u00a068\u00a0kDa. It exists as a dodecamer in the apo form and associates as a hexamer in the presence of ATP. Its C-terminal region consists of a CbbX-like AAA-domain while the N-terminal region contains a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain with lower homology to other EccA-type proteins. Further, the C-terminal domain functions as the oligomerization domain and also exhibits ATPase activity. Mutational analysis, steady state kinetics and molecular docking studies identify R573 as the important \u2018sensor arginine\u2019 and R505 as an \u2018arginine finger\u2019 in EccA3. Dynamic fluorescence quenching experiments suggest that the N-terminal domain moves closer to the C-terminal domain upon ATP-binding. The ATP-dependent \u2018open-close\u2019 relative movements of the two domains might help EccA3 interaction and secretion of essential virulence factors.",

     "abstract": "Enzymes of the enolase superfamily (ENS) are mechanistically diverse, yet share a common partial reaction (abstraction of the \u03b1-proton from a carboxylate substrate). While the catalytic machinery responsible for the deprotonation reaction has been conserved, divergent evolution has led to numerous ENS members that catalyze different overall reactions. This rich functional diversity has made the ENS an excellent model system for developing the approaches necessary to validate enzyme function. However, enzymes of the ENS also share a common bidomain structure ((\u03b2/\u03b1)7\u03b2-barrel domain and \u03b1\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2 capping domain) which makes validation of function from structural information challenging.This review presents a comparative survey of the structural data obtained over the past decade for enzymes from all seven subgroups that comprise the ENS.Of the seven ENS subgroups (enolase, mandelate racemase (MR), muconate lactonizing enzyme, \u03b2-methylaspartate ammonia lyase, d-glucarate dehydratase, d-mannonate dehydratase (ManD), and galactarate dehydratase 2), only enzymes of the MR and ManD subgroups exhibit an additional feature of structural complexity\u2014an interdigitating loop. This loop emanates from one protomer of a homodimeric pair and penetrates into the adjacent, symmetry-related protomer to either contribute a binding determinant to the active site of the adjacent protomer, or act as a \u2018flying buttress\u2019 to support residues of the active site.The analysis presented in this review suggests that the interdigitating loop is the only gross structural element that permits functional distinction between ENS subgroups at the tertiary level of protein structure.",

We have previously shown several critical residues for these characteristics using site-directed mutagenesis and amino acid sequence-based models. In this present study, the three-dimensional structure of recombinant L. lactis prolidase was determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.25\u00a0\u00c5 resolution in order to provide evidences of the proposed mechanism. Three molecules are located in the crystal asymmetric unit where molecule A forms a dimer with molecule B, while molecule C forms a dimer with molecule C' in the adjacent asymmetric unit. Of all the three molecules, molecule C is less defined and incomplete. While this fact compromises the overall quality of the refined model, the functional interpretation of the structure is not compromised since the biologically-functional homodimeric configuration of L. lactis prolidase is represented by well-defined molecules A and B. The refined model confirmed that there is a twelve-residue (residues 32\u201343) loop structure from one subunit over the active site of the other subunit, proving the existence of the putative loop structure in our previous study. This loop is three amino acids longer than the loops of prolidases of Pyrococcus furious (1pv9) and Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (1wy2). The crystal structure shows the loop structure can form two states (\u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d states) through interaction between the loop and active site proximity.

     "abstract": "Electrostatic interactions between proteins are key factors that govern the association and reaction rate. We spectroscopically determine the second-order reaction rate constant (k) of electron transfer from [NiFe] hydrogenase (H2ase) to cytochrome (cyt) c3 at various ionic strengths (I). The k value decreases with I. To analyze the results, we develop a semi-analytical formula for I dependence of k based on the assumptions that molecules are spherical and the reaction proceeds via a transition state. Fitting of the formula to the experimental data reveals that the interaction occurs in limited regions with opposite charges and with radii much smaller than those estimated from crystal structures. This suggests that local charges in H2ase and cyt c3 play important roles in the reaction. Although the crystallographic data indicate a positive electrostatic potential over almost the entire surface of the proteins, there exists a small region with negative potential on H2ase at which the electron transfer from H2ase to cyt c3 may occur. This local negative potential region is identical to the hypothetical interaction sphere predicted by the analysis. Furthermore, I dependence of k is predicted by the Adaptive Poisson\u2013Boltzmann Solver considering all charges of the amino acids in the proteins and the configuration of H2ase/cyt c3 complex. The calculation reproduces the experimental results except at extremely low I. These results indicate that the stabilization derived from the local electrostatic interaction in the H2ase/cyt c3 complex overcomes the destabilization derived from the electrostatic repulsion of the overall positive charge of both proteins.",

Mbs are intensely investigated as archetype to investigate structure/function relationship in globular proteins.In this work, the myoglobin from Sciurus vulgaris meridionalis has been for the first time isolated and purified with a high yield and homogeneity. The primary structure characterization has been performed by applying a strategy based on high resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Proximal (position 93, \u03b1-helix F8) and distal (position 64, \u03b1-helix E7) histidinyl residues as well as most of the amino acid residues (i.e., Leu29, Lys45, Thr67, Val68) involved in the autoxidation mechanism are conserved in the squirrel Mb. The structural and dynamical properties of the squirrel Mb have been also deeply investigated by CD, NMR. Furthermore, molecular dynamics studies of Mbs from different species have been performed. In addition, the functional properties of squirrel Mb have been characterized by determining its autoxidation kinetic and thermal stability in comparison with crested porcupine and reindeer Mbs. Interestingly, a higher autoxidation rate was revealed for squirrel Mb with respect to reindeer and crested porcupine Mbs. Even considering the very similar structural fold, molecular dynamics data show a higher conformational mobility of squirrel Mb with respect to reindeer and crested porcupine.",

Plant mutases belong to a small gene family called Reversibly Glycosylated Proteins (RGPs). So far, UAM has been identified in Oryza sativa (Rice), Arabidopsis thaliana and Hordeum vulgare (Barley). The enzyme requires divalent metal ions for catalytic activity. Here, the divalent metal ion dependency of UAMs from O. sativa (rice) and A. thaliana have been studied using HPLC-based kinetic assays. It was determined that UAM from these species had the highest relative activity in a range of 40\u201380\u00a0\u03bcM Mn2\u00a0+. Excess Mn2\u00a0+ ion concentration decreased the enzyme activity. This trend was observed when other divalent metal ions were used to test activity. To gain a perspective of the role played by the metal ion in activity, an ab initio structural model was generated based on the UAM amino acid sequence and a potential metal binding region was identified. Based on our results, we propose that the probable role of the metal in UAM is stabilizing the diphosphate of the substrate, UDP-Arap.",

In analogy with findings on the Drosophila NuRD complex, we find that also the human MTA-RBBP can be isolated in vitro. Taken together with previous findings this suggests, that MTA-RBBP is a stable complex, with a central role in the initial assembly of the human NuRD complex.

     "abstract": "Cytochrome c (cyt c) is a mitochondrial protein responsible for transferring electrons between electron transport chain complexes III and IV. The release of cyt c from the mitochondria has been considered as a commitment step in intrinsic apoptosis. Transfer RNA (tRNA) has recently been found to interact with the released cyt c to prevent the formation of the apoptosome complex, thus preventing cell apoptosis. To understand the molecular basis of tRNA\u2013cyt c interactions, we applied hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS) to analyze the interactions between tRNA and cyt c. tRNAPhe binding to cyt c reduced the deuteration level of cyt c in all analyzed regions, indicating that tRNA binding blocks the solvent-accessible regions and results in the formation of a more compact conformation. Substitution of the tRNAPhe with the total tRNA from brewer's yeast in the HDXMS experiment significantly reduced deuteration in the N-terminus and the region 18\u201332 residue of cyt c, where all tRNAs are bound. To clarify the cause of binding, we used synthesized single-stranded oligonucleotides of 12-mer dA and dT to form complexes with cyt c. The exchange of the nucleotide bases between adenine and thymine did not affect the deuteration level of cyt c. However, the regions 1\u201310 and 65\u201382 showed minor decreases after unstructured dA or dT DNA binding. Collectively, these results reveal that cyt c maintains its globular structure to interact with tRNA. The region 18\u201332 selectively interacts with tRNA, and N-terminal 1\u201310 interacts with oligonucleotides electrostatically.",

KLK6 has a very restricted specificity for arginine (R) and hydrolyses myelin basic protein, protein activator receptors and human ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits. Here we report a previously unreported activity of KLK6 on peptides containing clusters of basic amino acids, as in synthetic fluorogenic peptidyl-Arg-7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (peptidyl-ACC) peptides and FRET peptides in the format of Abz-peptidyl-Q-EDDnp (where Abz\u00a0=\u00a0ortho-aminobenzoic acid and Q-EDDnp\u00a0=\u00a0glutaminyl-N-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) ethylenediamine), in which pairs or sequences of basic amino acids (R or K) were introduced. Surprisingly, KLK6 hydrolyzed the fluorogenic peptides Bz-A-R \u2193 R-ACC and Z-R \u2193 R-MCA between the two R groups, resulting in non-fluorescent products. FRET peptides containing furin processing sequences of human MMP-14, nerve growth factor (NGF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) were cleaved by KLK6 at the same position expected by furin. Finally, KLK6 cleaved FRET peptides derived from human proenkephalin after the KR, the more frequent basic residues flanking enkephalins in human proenkephalin sequence. This result suggests the ability of KLK6 to release enkephalin from proenkephalin precursors and resembles furin a canonical processing proteolytic enzyme. Molecular models of peptides were built into the KLK6 structure and the marked preference of the cut between the two R of the examined peptides was related to the extended conformation of the substrates.",

With current treatments limited to expensive, high-risk surgery and minimally efficacious pharmacotherapy, new therapeutic options are urgently needed to fight against this alarming trend. Though brain dysfunction has been studied linked to high fat diet (HFD) and grape seed and skin extract (GSSE) correction, the proteomic modifications linking the two effects on brain lipotoxicity are not well understood. To this end rats were exposed for 8 weeks to HFD treatment, to GSSE (500\u00a0mg/kg BW) and to binary mixture of HFD and GSSE to gain insight into the potential pathways altered with metabolic disease and the protection afforded by GSSE. Significant modifications of brain proteins were detected using mass spectrometry-based differential proteomics. These proteins were mainly related to oxidative stress, glycolysis and calcium signaling. Additionally, proteins involved in the cytoskeleton were also affected by HFD treatment. Interestingly, whether up- or down regulated protein abundances, GSSE corrected most of the disturbances of HFD treatment. These findings provide impetus for future therapeutic investigation on GSSE against other metabolic disorders.",

In this study we have examined the effects of four naturally occurring polyphenols in combination with \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2-CD) on the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein in the presence of macromolecular crowding agents. Our results reveal that even at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of the individual components, the polyphenol\u2013\u03b2-CD combination(s) not only inhibited the aggregation of the proteins but was also effective in disaggregating preformed fibrils. Curcumin was found to be the most efficient, followed by baicalein with (\u2212)-epigallocatechin gallate and resveratrol coming in next, the latter two exhibiting very similar effects. Our results suggest that the efficiency of curcumin results from a balanced composition of the phenolic OH groups, benzene rings and flexibility. The latter ensures proper positioning of the functional groups to maximize the underlying interactions with both the monomeric form of \u03b1-synuclein and its aggregates. The uniqueness of \u03b2-CD was reinforced by the observation that none of the other cyclodextrin variants [\u03b1-CD and HP-\u03b2-CD] used was as effective, in spite of these possessing better water solubility. Moreover, the fact that the combinations remained effective under conditions of macromolecular crowding suggests that these have the potential to be developed into viable drug compositions in the near future. MTT assays on cell viability independently confirmed this hypothesis wherein these combinations (and the polyphenols alone too) appreciably impeded the toxicity of the prefibrillar \u03b1-synuclein aggregates on the mouse neuroblastoma cell lines (N2a cells).",

While Arg54 is highly conserved within different species, the cataractogenic mutations R54L, R54P and R54C have been recently identified in CRYAA gene, encoding human \u03b1A-Cry. The detailed structural and functional aspects, stability and amyloidogenic properties of \u03b1A-Cry were determined upon the above-mentioned missense mutations, using various spectroscopic techniques, gel electrophoresis, electron microscopy, size exclusion chromatography analyses, and chaperone-like activity assay. The different mutations at Arg54 result in diverse structural alterations among mutant proteins. In addition, the mutant proteins displayed reduced thermal stability, increased amyloidogenic properties and attenuated chaperone-like activity against aggregation of \u03b3-Cry, catalase and lysozyme. The mutant proteins were also capable of forming larger oligomeric complexes with \u03b3-Cry which is the natural partner of \u03b1-Cry in the eye lenses. The most significant structural and functional damages were observed upon R54L mutation which was also accompanied with increased oligomeric size distribution of the mutant protein. The cataractogenic nature of R54P mutation can be explained with its detrimental effect on chaperone-like activity, conformational stability and proteolytic digestibility of the mutant protein. Also, R54C \u03b1A-Cry displayed an important intrinsic propensity for disulfide protein cross-linking with significantly reduced chaperone-like activity against all client proteins. These mutations revealed a range of detrimental effects on the structure, stability and functional properties of \u03b1A-Cry which all together can explain the pathomechanisms underlying development of the associated congenital cataract disorders.",

Appropriating haem, either direct from host haemoproteins or by secreting haem-scavenging haemophores, is one way pathogenic bacteria can overcome this challenge. After capturing their target, haem appropriation systems must remove haem from a high-affinity binding site (on the host haemoprotein or bacterial haemophore) and transfer it to a binding site of lower affinity on a bacterial receptor. Structural information is now available to show how, using a combination of induced structural changes and steric clashes, bacteria are able to extract haem from haemophores, haemopexin and haemoglobin. This review focuses on structural descriptions of these bacterial haem acquisition systems, summarising how they bind haem and their target haemoproteins with particularly emphasis on the mechanism of haem extraction.",

Mg2\u00a0+, or, alternatively, Ca2\u00a0+, activate human serine racemase by binding both at a specific site and \u2013 as ATP-metal complexes \u2013 at a distinct ATP binding site. We show that Mg2\u00a0+ and Ca2\u00a0+ bind at the metal binding site with a 4.5-fold difference in affinity, producing a similar thermal stabilization and partially shifting the dimer-tetramer equilibrium in favour of the latter. The ATP-Ca2\u00a0+ complex produces a 2-fold lower maximal activation in comparison to the ATP-Mg2\u00a0+ complex and exhibits a 3-fold higher EC50. The co-presence of ATP and metals further stabilizes the tetramer. In consideration of the cellular concentrations of Mg2\u00a0+ and Ca2\u00a0+, even taking into account the fluctuations of the latter, these results point to Mg2\u00a0+ as the sole physiologically relevant ligand both at the metal binding site and at the ATP binding site. The stabilization of the tetramer by both metals and ATP-metal complexes suggests a quaternary activation mechanism mediated by 5\u2032-phosphonucleotides similar to that observed in the distantly related prokaryotic threonine deaminases.

These proteases exhibit calcium-dependent activity and specificity for arginine residues at P1. In contrast to caspases, they do not require processing or dimerization for activity. Indeed, unprocessed metacaspase-2 of Trypanosoma brucei (TbMCA2) is active; however, it has been shown that cleavages at Lys55 and Lys268 increase TbMCA2 hydrolytic activity on synthetic substrates. The processed TbMCA2 comprises 3 polypeptide chains that remain attached by non-covalent bonds.

To investigate the importance of this processing for the activity and specificity of TbMCA2, we performed activity assays comparing the non-processed mutant (TbMCA2 K55/268G) with the processed TbMCA2 form. Significant differences between TbMCA2 WT (processed form) and TbMCA2 K55/268G (non-processed form) were observed. Specifically, we verified that although non-processed TbMCA2 is active when assayed with small synthetic substrates, the TbMCA2 form does not exhibit hydrolytic activity on large substrates such as azocasein, while processed TbMCA2 is able to readily digest this protein. Such differences can be relevant for understanding the physiological regulation and function of TbMCA2.",

The antioxidant activity was performed using a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay, which revealed that L. japonica buds had more activity than the UV irradiated flowers. This suggests that UV-B radiation induces production of endogenous ethylene in L. japonica buds, thus facilitating blossoming of the buds and activating the antioxidant system.

Using label-free quantification (LFQ) proteomics and a recently developed plate-method for assessing secretomes during growth on solid substrates, we find that, as expected, the chitin-active enzymes (ChiA, B, C, and CBP21) are produced in high amounts when the bacterium grows on chitin. Other proteins produced in high amounts after bacterial growth on chitin provide interesting targets for further exploration of the proteins involved in degradation of chitin-rich biomasses. The genome encodes a fourth chitinase (ChiD), which is produced in low amounts during growth on chitin. Studies of chitin degradation with mixtures of recombinantly produced chitin-degrading enzymes showed that ChiD does not contribute to the overall efficiency of the process. ChiD is capable of converting N,N\u2032-diacetyl chitobiose to N-acetyl glucosamine, but is less efficient than another enzyme produced for this purpose, the Chitobiase.

In order to determine the proteomic backgrounds of HCC carcinogenesis and vascular invasion, we employed a novel modified aptamer-based array (SOMAscan) platform. SOMAscan is based on the Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamers (SOMAmers), which rely on the natural 3D folding of single-stranded DNA-based protein affinity reagents. Currently, the expression level of 1129 proteins can be assessed quantitatively. Correlation matrix analysis showed that the overall proteomic features captured by SOMAscan differ between tumor and non-tumor tissues. Non-tumor tissues were shown to have more homogeneous proteome backgrounds than tumor tissues. A comparative study identified 68 proteins with differential expression between tumor and non-tumor tissues, together with eight proteins associated with vascular invasion. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the extracellular space and extracellular region proteins were predominantly detected. Network analysis revealed the linkage of seven proteins, AKT1, MDM2, PTEN, FGF1, MAPK8, PRKCB, and FN1, which were categorized as the components of \u201cPathways in cancer\u201d in pathway analysis. The results of SOMAscan analysis were not concordant with those obtained by western blotting; only the determined FN1 levels were concordant between the two platforms. We demonstrated that the proteome captured by SOMAscan includes the proteins relevant to carcinogenesis and vascular invasion in HCC. The identified proteins may serve as candidates for the future studies of disease mechanisms and clinical applications.",

     "abstract": "The tobacco-related plant Nicotiana benthamiana is gaining interest as a versatile host for the production of monoclonal antibodies and other protein therapeutics. However, the susceptibility of plant-derived recombinant proteins to endogenous proteolytic enzymes limits their use as biopharmaceuticals. We have now identified two previously uncharacterized N. benthamiana proteases with high antibody-degrading activity, the papain-like cysteine proteinases NbCysP6 and NbCysP7. Both enzymes are capable of hydrolysing a wide range of synthetic substrates, although only NbCysP6 tolerates basic amino acids in its specificity-determining S2 subsite. The overlapping substrate specificities of NbCysP6 and NbCysP7 are also documented by the closely related properties of their other subsites as deduced from the action of the enzymes on proteome-derived peptide libraries. Notable differences were observed to the substrate preferences of N. benthamiana cathepsin B, another antibody-degrading papain-like cysteine proteinase. The complementary activities of NbCysP6, NbCysP7 and N. benthamiana cathepsin B indicate synergistic roles of these proteases in the turnover of recombinant and endogenous proteins in planta, thus representing a paradigm for the shaping of plant proteomes by the combined action of papain-like cysteine proteinases.",

     "abstract": "Human indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (hIDO1) is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of the L-tryptophan indole ring. As increased levels of hIDO1 expression in tumor cells correlate with a poor prognosis for surviving several cancer types, hIDO1 has become an appealing drug target for cancer therapy. However, detailed structural knowledge of the catalytically active complex is necessary to eb able to design de novo inhibitors selective for hIDO1. Here we have applied Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and nanosecond time-resolved optical spectroscopy to hIDO1 variants with modified heme pocket structures to identify important amino acid residues that stabilize the substrate in the active site. A cluster of small side chain residues at positions 260\u2013265 ensures structural flexibility of the binding site. Thr379 and Arg231 are key residues acting in concert to bind the substrate. Thr379 is the final residue of a disordered loop; the neighboring Gly380, however, is still visible in the X-ray structure of the substrate-free protein, 20\u00a0\u00c5 away from the heme iron. Therefore, large-scale conformational changes are necessary to bring Thr379 close to the substrate. The use of substrate analogs further reveals that an indole-like side chain with two aromatic rings and L-stereoisomery at the C\u03b1 are required for high affinity binding.",

Recently, we characterized sheep with Gaucher disease and since GBA1 mutations represent the highest genetic risk factor for PD, we have investigated \u03b1-synuclein fibrillation in the sheep. Here we demonstrate that differences in six amino acid residues between sheep and human \u03b1-synuclein significantly alter in vitro fibril formation. Circular dichroism of recombinant human and sheep \u03b1-synuclein show that both proteins adopt the same secondary structure. Fibrils from human and sheep \u03b1-synuclein formed at pH\u00a07.0 or 4.5 were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Unexpectedly, sheep \u03b1-synuclein form fibrils much less readily than human \u03b1-synuclein and this difference was more pronounced at the lysosomal pH of 4.5. Aggregation-propensity and intrinsic-solubility analysis revealed that sheep \u03b1-synuclein had lower aggregation-propensity and higher solubility. As a result of these observations, TEM was used to analyze fibrils formed at pH\u00a04.5 of various \u201csheep-like\u201d human or \u201chuman-like\u201d sheep mutant \u03b1-synucleins, together with their wild-type forms. Thioflavin T was used to monitor in situ \u03b1-synuclein fibril formation at pH\u00a07.0 and 4.5.

Seeding with WT human \u03b1-synuclein showed that \u201csheep-like\u201d human \u03b1-synuclein could not be seeded, providing further evidence that sheep sequence is resistant to fibrillation.

     "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved enzyme encoded by the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 gene, LRRK2, harbors both a Rab-like GTPase domain and a serine/threonine protein kinase domain. Pathogenic mutations in either the GTPase or kinase domain can cause neurodegeneration and Parkinson disease. No high-resolution structure of the human LRRK2 kinase domain is available but the most common mutation, G2019S in the kinase domain, is predicted to alter the ATP-binding pocket structure and interaction with divalent cations. Here we find that the manganese-bound kinase domain acquires a robust ability to utilize both GTP as well as ATP in autophosphorylation of the GTPase domain and phosphorylation of peptide substrates in vitro. The G2019S LRRK2 mutation increases the efficiency of GTP-mediated kinase activity ten-fold compared to WT LRRK2 activity. Moreover, GTP-dependent phosphorylation alters autophosphorylation-site preference in vitro. While additional studies are required to determine the physiological relevance of these observations, LRRK2 is one of the only known kinases to be able to utilize GTP as a phospho-donor at physiological levels in vitro, and thus one of the only known proteins to be able to hydrolyze GTP in two distinct domains within the same protein.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic activity and stability of lysozyme in the presence of salts have been studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, respectively. The effect of sodium salts of sulfate, acetate, chloride, bromide, thiocyanate, and perchlorate on lysozyme properties depends on anion concentration as well as on position of anion in the Hofmeister series. Kosmotropic anions (sulfate and acetate) increase stability and activate the enzyme while chaotropic anions (bromide, thiocyanate and perchlorate) including chloride decrease stability and inhibits the enzyme activity. Strong correlation between stability and activity of lysozyme suggest the interdependence of these enzyme properties in the presence of salts. The fact that the properties of lysozyme correlate with partition coefficients of anions at hydrocarbon surface clearly indicates that Hofmeister effect of anions is mediated by their interactions with nonpolar parts of the enzyme surface despite its high positive net charge at studied conditions. The efficiency of the anions in affecting both activity and stability of lysozyme also correlates with other anion-related parameters most notably with polarizability of monovalent anions. The presented work points to a critical role of interaction of anions with nonpolar protein surface for the Hofmeister effect. Moreover, the simultaneous investigation of protein stability and activity, in the relation with the Hofmeister effect, provides important information regarding stability/rigidity of enzyme structure for its catalytic activity.",

     "abstract": "EngA consists of two tandem GTPase-domains\u2014GD1 and GD2\u2014followed by a KH-domain. EngA was considered to be a 50S assembly factor since it was shown to bind 50S and its deletion leads to the accumulation of immature 45S ribosomal subunits. Subsequently, we demonstrated an additional ribosome bound state of EngA bound to 50S, 30S, and 70S. While the former (50S binding) is achieved upon GTP binding at both GD1 and GD2, the latter is formed upon GTP hydrolysis at GD1, which is believed to trigger a large conformational change in the protein. The present study brings out two key aspects of EngA regulation: First, that distinctly stabilized GD1-KH interfaces allows EngA to exist in different ribosome bound states, and second is the importance of these states to ribosome assembly. Our analyses suggest that distinct inter-domain (GD-KH) interfaces are stabilized by interactions arising from unique sets of motifs, conserved across EngA homologues, and seem to be mechanistically linked to GTP/GDP binding. By experimentally measuring binding affinities for several interface mutants, we show that disrupting the interface interactions is necessary to realize EngA-ribosome binding. These findings are also supported by a recent cryo-EM structure of EngA bound to 50S, wherein the GD1-KH interface is completely disrupted leading to an \u2018extended\u2019 or \u2018open state\u2019 of the protein. Overall, it appears that the transition of EngA from a \u2018closed state\u2019 with GD1-KH forming a tight interface, to an \u2018open state\u2019 mediates interaction with ribosomal subunits.",

This work reports the first characterization of the independently expressed PD domain of bifunctional CM-PD from the crenarchaeon Ignicoccus hospitalis and the first functional studies of both full-length CM-PD and the PD domain from the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. All proteins were hexa-histidine tagged, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Expression and purification of I. hospitalis CM-PD generated a degradation product identified as a PD fragment lacking the protein's first 80 residues, \u039480CM-PD. A comparable stable PD domain could also be generated by limited tryptic digestion of this bifunctional enzyme. Thus, \u039480CM-PD constructs were prepared in both organisms. CM-PD and \u039480CM-PD from both organisms were dimeric and displayed the predicted enzymatic activities and thermal stabilities in accord with their hyperthermophilic and mesophilic origins. In contrast with H. influenzae PD activity which was NAD+-specific and displayed >\u00a075% inhibition with 50\u00a0\u03bcM l-Tyr, I. hospitalis PD demonstrated dual cofactor specificity with a preference for NADP+ and an insensitivity to l-Tyr. These properties are consistent with a model of the I. hospitalis PD domain based on the previously reported structure of the H. influenzae homolog. Our results highlight the similarities and differences between the archaeal and bacterial TyrA proteins and reveal that the PD activity of both prokaryotes can be successfully mapped to a functionally independent unit.",

The mechanism of the enzyme is not fully elucidated. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of galactokinase with the active site residues Arg-37 and Asp-186 altered predicted that two regions (residues 174\u2013179 and 231\u2013240) had different dynamics as a consequence. Interestingly, the same two regions were also affected by alterations in Arg-105, Glu-174 and Arg-228. These three residues were identified as important in catalysis in previous computational studies on human galactokinase. Alteration of Arg-105 to methionine resulted in a modest reduction in activity with little change in stability. When Arg-228 was changed to methionine, the enzyme's interaction with both ATP and galactose was affected. This variant was significantly less stable than the wild-type protein. Changing Glu-174 to glutamine (but not to aspartate) resulted in no detectable activity and a less stable enzyme. Overall, these combined in silico and in vitro studies demonstrate the importance of a negative charge at position 174 and highlight the critical role of the dynamics in to key regions of the protein. We postulate that these regions may be critical for mediating the enzyme's structure and function.",

In these enzymes, the heme moiety is linked to protein through two or three covalent bonds. In the mature LPO, the heme moiety is linked to protein through two ester bonds with highly conserved glutamate and aspartate residues. The previously reported structures of LPO have confirmed the formation of two covalent linkages involving Glu258 and Asp108 with 1-methyl and 5-methyl groups of pyrrole rings A and C respectively. We report here a new form of structure of LPO where the covalent bond between Glu258 and 1-methyl group of pyrrole ring A is present only in a fraction of protein molecules. In this case, the side chain of Glu258 occupies two distinct positions, each of which has a 0.5 occupancy. In one position, it forms a normal ester covalent linkage while in the second position, the side chain of Glu258 is located in the middle of the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. In this position, the atom of the side chain of Glu258 forms several contacts with atoms of other residues and heme moiety. Out of the two observed positions of the side chain of Glu258, the former contributes to the stabilization of heme position and improved catalytic action of LPO while the latter is responsible for the reduced stability of the heme position as well as it blocks the substrate binding site.",

However, its binding site on the MOR remains unknown. To investigate the binding interfaces necessary for naloxone and MOR, available structural information was combined with a cell-based photocrosslinking approach. Computer prediction revealed that four binding sites on MOR were required for naloxone binding. In addition, in the photocrosslinking approach, an amber stop codon was used to replace the sense codon of the MOR at 266 selected individual positions, in order to introduce the photoreactive amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine (BzF) into MOR to evaluate the results of the computer analysis. The BzF-incorporated MOR mutant genes were expressed in CHO cells, in which MOR retained the ability to interact with its ligands, such as morphine, and exhibited MOR-dependent activation of ERK signaling following morphine stimulation. Notably, after treatment with tritium-labeled naloxone and exposure to UV light, we observed naloxone crosslinking with BzF replacement at hydrophobic residues and some polar/uncharged residues in the computer-predicted sites 1 and 3, indicating that these two sites in the MOR interact with naloxone. In conclusion, these results indicate that MOR has two naloxone binding sites and that the hydrophobic and polar/uncharged residues within these sites are important for naloxone binding.",

Ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for E. coli supporting the fastest growth rates.

Here we used label free proteomics to determine the dynamics of E. coli proteins expression in response to ammonium starvation in both the short (30\u00a0min) and the longer (60\u00a0min) starvation. Protein abundances and post-translational modifications confirmed that activation of the NtrC regulon acts as the first line of defense against nitrogen starvation. The ribosome inactivating protein Rmf was induced shortly after ammonium exhaustion and this was preceded by induction of other ribosome inactivating proteins such as Hpf and RaiA supporting the hypothesis that ribosome shut-down is a key process during nitrogen limitation stress.

We report here one more example of such a problem, dealing with flavocytochrome b2 (Fcb2), a lactate dehydrogenase, member of a family of FMN-dependent L-2-hydroxy acid oxidizing enzymes. Two papers have described the properties of the Fcb2 catalytic base H373Q variant, each one using a different expression system with the same base change for the mutation. The two papers found similar apparent kinetic parameters. But the first one demonstrated the existence of a low level of histidine misincorporation, which led to an important correction of the variant residual activity (Gaume et al. (1995) Biochimie, 77, 621). The second paper did not investigate the possibility of a misincorporation (Tsai et al. (2007) Biochemistry, 46, 7844). The two papers had different mechanistic conclusions. We show here that in this case the misincorporation does not depend on the expression system. We bring the proof that Tsai et al. (2007) were led to an erroneous mechanistic conclusion for having missed the phenomenon as well as for having misinterpreted the crystal structure of the variant.

Hsp70 facilitates active refolding of misfolded client proteins, while CHIP directs ubiquitination of misfolded client proteins bound to Hsp70. The direct competition between CHIP and Hsp70 for the fate of misfolded proteins leads to the question: how does the CHIP:Hsp70 complex execute triage decisions that direct misfolded proteins for either refolding or degradation? The current body of literature points toward action of the CHIP:Hsp70 complex as an information processor that takes inputs in the form of client folding state, dynamics, and posttranslational modifications, then outputs either refolded or ubiquitinated client proteins. Herein we examine the CHIP:Hsp70 complex beginning with the structure and function of CHIP and Hsp70, followed by an examination of recent studies of the interactions and dynamics of the CHIP:Hsp70 complex.",

     "abstract": "The three-dimensional structures of proteins play an essential role in regulating binding between proteins and their partners, offering a direct relationship between structures and functions of proteins. It is widely accepted that the function of a protein can be determined if its structure is similar to other proteins whose functions are known. However, it is also observed that proteins with similar global structures do not necessarily correspond to the same function, while proteins with very different folds can share similar functions. This indicates that function similarity is originated from the local structural information of proteins instead of their global shapes. We assume that proteins with similar local environments prefer binding to similar types of molecular targets. In order to testify this assumption, we designed a new structural indicator to define the similarity of local environment between residues in different proteins. This indicator was further used to calculate the probability that a given residue binds to a specific type of structural neighbors, including DNA, RNA, small molecules and proteins. After applying the method to a large-scale non-redundant database of proteins, we show that the positive signal of binding probability calculated from the local structural indicator is statistically meaningful. In summary, our studies suggested that the local environment of residues in a protein is a good indicator to recognize specific binding partners of the protein. The new method could be a potential addition to a suite of existing template-based approaches for protein function prediction.",

To deepen the role of protein regions in its biological activities, lately we reported on the structural behavior of dissected C-terminal domain (CTD) helical fragments. Unexpectedly the H2 (residues 264\u2013277) and H3 AML-mutated regions showed a remarkable tendency to form amyloid-like assemblies with fibrillar morphology and \u03b2-sheet structure that resulted as toxic when exposed to human neuroblastoma cells. More recently NPM1 was found to be highly expressed and toxic in neurons of mouse models of Huntington's disease (HD). Here we investigate the role of each residue in the \u03b2-strand aggregation process of H2 region of NPM1 by performing a systematic alanine scan of its sequence and structural and kinetic analyses of aggregation of derived peptides by means of Circular Dichorism (CD) and Thioflavin T (Th-T) assay. These solution state investigations pointed out the crucial role exerted by the basic amyloidogenic stretch of H2 (264\u2013271) and to shed light on the initial and main interactions involved in fibril formation we performed studies on fibrils deriving from the related Ala peptides through the analysis of fibrils with birefringence of polarized optical microscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS).

Mutations either in the N-terminal myristoylation or palmitoylation sites (G2 and C5) cause relocalization of TgIMP1 to the cytosol. The first 11 amino acids are sufficient for PM targeting and the presence of lysine (K7) is critical.

However, much remains unknown about the general and specific characteristics of lysine succinylation among bacteria, and about its functions different from those of other acylations. In this study, we characterized lysine succinylation, a newly discovered widespread type of lysine acylation in five bacterial species with different characteristics such as optimal growth temperature and cell wall structure. This study is the first to demonstrate that succinylation is general phenomenon occurring not only in mesophiles but also in thermophiles. Mapping of succinylation sites on protein structures revealed that succinylation occurs at many lysine residues important for protein function. Comparison of the succinylation sites in the five bacterial species provides insights regarding common protein regulation mechanisms utilizing lysine succinylation. Many succinylation sites were conserved among five bacteria, especially between Geobacillus kaustophilus and Bacillus subtilis, some of which are functionally important sites. Furthermore, systematic comparison of the succinyl-proteome results and our previous propionyl-proteome results showed that the abundance of these two types of acylations is considerably different among the five bacteria investigated. Many succinylation and propionylation events were detected in G. kaustophilus, whereas Escherichia coli and B. subtilis exhibited high succinylation and low propionylation; low succinylation and high propionylation were identified in Thermus thermophilus, and low succinylation and propionylation were observed in Rhodothermus marinus.

Proteomic analysis was conducted followed by integration with metabolite, plant biomass and nutrient data. Out of 366 differentially expressed proteins in sorghum roots, 44 upregulated proteins overlapping among three treatment groups showed positive correlation with sorghum biomass or element uptake or both. Proteins upregulated only in B group include asparagine synthetase which showed negative correlation with biomass and uptake of elements. Phosphoribosyl amino imidazole succinocarboxamide protein with more than 50-fold change in My and My\u00a0+\u00a0B groups correlated positively with Ca, Cu, S and sucrose levels in roots. The B group showed the highest number of upregulated proteins among the three groups with negative correlation with sorghum biomass and element uptake. KEGG pathway analysis identified carbon fixation as the unique pathway associated with common upregulated proteins while biosynthesis of amino acids and fatty acid degradation were associated with common downregulated proteins. Protein-protein interaction analysis using STRING identified a major network with thirteen downregulated proteins.

The aim of this study was to improve the stability of super Renilla luciferase 8 (SRLuc 8) which is a red-emitter variety of RLuc at higher temperatures, by introduction of a disulfide bridge into its structure. In this study, the choice of the proper disulfide bond formation was based on computational methods and enzyme functionality (active site position) which is called geometric-functional method. N45 and A71 at the N-terminal of the enzyme were selected for directed evolution. The engineered luciferase was called C-SRLuc 8 and its activity and stability were assayed. The results indicated that the kinetic stability of C-SRLuc 8 increased significantly at 60\u00a0\u00b0C to 70\u00a0\u00b0C as compared to SRLuc 8; the residual activity of C-SRLuc 8 was approximately 20% after incubation at 65\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min. Moreover, the enzyme activity decreased compared with SRLuc 8. The molecular basis of the structural changes was considered using molecular dynamics simulations and the results indicated that the N45C/A71C crosslink was involved in a hotspot foldon which seemed to be the rate-limiting step of conformational collapse at higher temperatures. The present study may provide an opportunity for the development of the next-generation of thermostable RLuc-based biosensors.",

Titin is a multi-domain protein that contains regions of repeated structural elements. The N2A region sits at the boundary between the proximal Ig region of titin that is extended under low force and the PEVK region that is extended under high force. Multiple binding interactions have been associated with the N2A region and it has been proposed that this region acts as a mechanical stretch sensor. The focus of this work is a 117 amino acid portion of the N2A region (N2A-IS), which resides between the proximal Ig domains and the PEVK region. Our work has shown that the N2A-IS region is predicted to contain helical structure in the center while both termini are predicted to be disordered. Recombinantly expressed N2A-IS protein contains 13% \u03b1-helical structure, as measured via circular dichroism. Additional \u03b1-helical structure can be induced with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, suggesting that there is transient helical structure that might be stabilized in the context of the entire N2A region. The N2A-IS region does not exhibit any cooperativity in either thermal or chemical denaturation studies while size exclusion chromatography and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer demonstrates that the N2A-IS region has an extended structure.

For broader utilization of cod trypsins, further characterization of biochemical properties of the individual cod trypsin isoenzymes is of importance. For that purpose, a benzamidine purified trypsin isolate from Atlantic cod was analyzed. Anion exchange chromatography revealed eight peaks containing proteins around 24\u00a0kDa with tryptic activity. Based on mass spectrometric analysis, one isoenzyme gave the best match to cod trypsin I and six isoenzymes gave the best match to cod trypsin X. Amino terminal sequencing of two of these six trypsin isoenzymes showed identity to cod trypsin X. Three sequence variants of trypsin X were identified by cDNA analysis demonstrating that various forms of this enzyme exist.One trypsin X isoenzyme was selected for further characterization based on abundance and stability. Stepwise increase in catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of this trypsin X isoenzyme was obtained with substrates containing one to three amino acid residues. The study demonstrates that the catalytic efficiency of this trypsin X isoenzyme is comparable to that of cod trypsin I, the most abundant and highly active isoenzyme in the benzamidine cod trypsin isolate.

The closed form of the TlL mutant shows low binding to hydrophobic surfaces compared to the binding observed after activating the controlled switch inducing lid-opening. We directly show that lipid binding of this mutant is connected to an open lid conformation demonstrating the impact of the exposed amino acid residues and their participation in binding at the water-lipid interface. The switch was created by introducing two cysteine residues into the protein backbone at sites 86 and 255. The crystal structure of the mutant shows the successful formation of a disulfide bond between C86 and C255 which causes strained closure of the lid-domain. Control of enzymatic activity and binding was demonstrated on substrate emulsions and natural lipid layers. The locked form displayed low enzymatic activity (~\u00a010%) compared to wild-type. Upon release of the lock, enzymatic activity was fully restored. Only 10% binding to natural lipid substrates was observed for the locked lipase compared to wild-type, but binding was restored upon adding reducing agent. QCM-D measurements revealed a seven-fold increase in binding rate for the unlocked lipase. The TlL_locked mutant shows structural changes across the protein important for understanding the mechanism of lid-opening and closing. Our experimental results reveal sites of interest for future mutagenesis studies aimed at altering the activation mechanism of TlL and create perspectives for generating tunable lipases that activate under controlled conditions.",

The sugar content and SOD activity was increased in wheat seeds treated with Cu and Fe NPs. The Cu content was increased at 25\u00a0ppm Cu NPs exposure in seeds of wheat varieties.

We reveal that 65% of kinases have an IDR adjacent to their kinase domain (KD). These IDRs are evolutionarily more conserved than IDRs distant to KDs. Strikingly, 36 kinases have adjacent IDRs extending into their KDs, defining a unique structural and functional subset of the kinome. Functional network analysis of this subset of the kinome uncovered FAK1 as topologically the most connected hub kinase. We identify that KD-flanking IDR of FAK1 is more conserved and undergoes more post-translational modifications than other IDRs. It preferentially interacts with proteins regulating scaffolding and kinase activity, which contribute to cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, spatially and evolutionarily conserved IDRs in kinases may influence their functions, which can be exploited for targeted therapies in diseases including those that involve aberrant cytoskeletal remodeling.",

Due to their abundance in all kingdoms of life and diversity of their functions, they are implicated in many aspects of eukaryotic and prokaryotic physiology. Although numerous GNATs have been identified thus far, many remain structurally and functionally uncharacterized. The elucidation of their structures and functions is critical for broadening our knowledge of this diverse and important superfamily. In this work, we present the structural and kinetic analyses of two previously uncharacterized bacterial acetyltransferases - SACOL1063 from Staphylococcus aureus strain COL and CD1211 from Clostridium difficile strain 630. Our structures of SACOL1063 show substantial flexibility of a loop that is likely responsible for substrate recognition and binding compared to structures of other homologs. In the CoA complex structure, we found two CoA molecules bound in both the canonical AcCoA/CoA-binding site and the acceptor-substrate-binding site. Our work also provides initial clues regarding the substrate specificity of these two enzymes; however, their native function(s) remain unknown. We found both proteins act as N- rather than O-acetyltransferases and preferentially acetylate l-threonine. The combination of structural and kinetic analyses of these two previously uncharacterized GNATs provides fundamental knowledge and a framework on which future studies can be built to elucidate their native functions.",

As one of the translation initiation factors, translation initiation factor 1 (IF1) plays crucial roles not only in translation but also in many cellular processes that are important for genomic stability, such as the activity of RNA chaperones. Here, we characterize the RNA interactions and dynamics of IF1 from Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 (IF1Sa) by NMR spectroscopy. First, the NMR-derived solution structure of IF1Sa revealed that IF1Sa adopts an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold. Structural comparisons showed large deviations in the \u03b1-helix and the following loop, which are potential RNA-binding regions of the OB-fold, as well as differences in the electrostatic potential surface among bacterial IF1s. Second, the 15N NMR relaxation data for IF1Sa indicated the flexible nature of the \u03b1-helix and the following loop region of IF1Sa. Third, RNA-binding properties were studied using FP assays and NMR titrations. FP binding assays revealed that IF1Sa binds to RNAs with moderate affinity. In combination with the structural analysis, the NMR titration results revealed the RNA binding sites. Taken together, these results show that IF1Sa binds RNAs with moderate binding affinity via the residues that occupy the large surface area of its \u03b2-barrel. These findings suggest that IF1Sa is likely to bind RNA in various conformations rather than only at a specific site and indicate that the flexible RNA binding mode of IF1Sa is necessary for its interaction with various RNA substrates.",

Like the naturally domain-swapped dimeric bovine seminal variant, BS-RNase, and its glycosylated RNase B isoform, RNase A forms N- and C-terminal 3D domain-swapped oligomers after lyophilization from acid solutions, or if subjected to thermal denaturation at high protein concentration. All mentioned RNases can undergo deamidation at Asn67, forming Asp or isoAsp derivatives that modify the protein net charge and consequently its enzymatic activity. In addition, deamidation slightly affects RNase B self-association through the 3D domain swapping (3D-DS) mechanism.We report here the influence of extensive deamidation on RNase A tendency to oligomerize through 3D-DS. In particular, deamidation of Asn67 alone slightly decreases the propensity of the protein to oligomerize, with the Asp derivative being less affected than the isoAsp one. Contrarily, the additional Asp and/or isoAsp conversion of residues other than N67 almost nullifies RNase A oligomerization capability. In addition, Gln deamidation, although less kinetically favorable, may affect RNase A self-association. Using 2D and 3D NMR we identified the Asn/Gln residues most prone to undergo deamidation. Together with CD spectroscopy, NMR also indicates that poly-deamidated RNase A generally maintains its native tertiary structure. Again, we investigated in silico the effect of the residues undergoing deamidation on RNase A dimers structures. Finally, the effect of deamidation on RNase A oligomerization is discussed in comparison with studies on deamidation-prone proteins involved in amyloid formation.",

     "abstract": "Tropomyosin and cofilin are actin-binding proteins which control dynamics of actin assembly and disassembly. Tropomyosin isoforms can either inhibit or enhance cofilin activity, but the mechanism of this diverse regulation is not well understood. In this work mechanisms of actin dynamics regulation by four cytoskeletal tropomyosin isoforms and cofilin-1 were studied with the use of biochemical and fluorescent microscopy assays. The recombinant tropomyosin isoforms were products of two genes: TPM1 (Tpm1.6 and Tpm1.8) and TPM3 (Tpm3.2 and Tpm3.4). Tpm1.6/1.8 bound to F-actin with higher apparent binding constants and lower cooperativities than Tpm3.2/3.4. In consequence, subsaturating concentrations of cofilin-1 removed 50% of Tpm3.2/3.4 from F-actin. By contrast, 2 and 5.5 molar excess of cofilin-1 over actin was required to dissociate 50% of Tpm1.6/1.8. All tropomyosins inhibited the rate of spontaneous polymerization of actin, which was reversed by cofilin-1. Products of TPM1 favored longer filaments and protected them from cofilin-induced depolymerization. This was in contrast to the isoforms derived from TPM3, which facilitated depolymerization. Tpm3.4 was the only isoform, which increased frequency of the filament severing by cofilin-1. Tpm1.6/1.8 inhibited, but Tpm3.2/3.4 enhanced cofilin-induced conformational changes leading to accelerated release of rhodamine\u2013phalloidin from the filament. We concluded that the effects were executed through different actin affinities of tropomyosin isoforms and cooperativities of tropomyosin and cofilin-1 binding. The results obtained in vitro were in good agreement with localization of tropomyosin isoforms in stable or highly dynamic filaments demonstrated before in various cells.",

This reaction is the centerpiece of a recently identified biosynthetic cassette that generates 4-guanidinobutyryl thioesters to serve as starter units for polyketide synthesis. We examined the reaction of ORF7, the predicted ECO-0501 biosynthetic decarboxylase, with arginine, and saw no evidence of decarboxylation. Instead, we observed exclusive amine oxidation to generate 2-oxoarginine, with a kcat/KM,Arg of 5.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, typical of values measured for physiological amino acid decarboxylases. In contrast, when ORF7 was incubated with N\u03b4-methylarginine, we observed exclusive decarboxylation to generate 4-(N1-methylguanidino)butyramide. These differing reactive pathways provide insight into the biosyntheses of guanidinobutyryl-derived polyketides and demonstrate the biosynthetic versatility of arginine-processing decarboxylases. In addition, it suggests that ORF7 may be an incisive model system for dissecting the determinants of flavoprotein-catalyzed oxidase and monooxygenase modes of reactivity.",

The resulting enzyme expressed as a single polypeptide with fused \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits linked by a seventeen-histidine region. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated that MbNHase exists primarily as an (\u03b1\u03b2)2 homodimer in solution, analogous to the \u03b12\u03b22 homotetramer architecture observed for prokaryotic NHases. The NHase enzyme contained its full complement of Co(III) and was fully functional without the co-expression of an activator protein or E. coli GroES/EL molecular chaperones. The homology model of MbNHase was developed identifying Cys400, Cys403, and Cys405 as active site ligands. The results presented here provide the first experimental data for a mature and active eukaryotic NHase with fused subunits.

Since partition behavior of a protein dramatically depends on an ATPS composition, it would be highly beneficial to have reliable means for (even qualitative) prediction of partitioning of a target protein under different conditions. Our aim was to understand which structural features of proteins contribute to partitioning of a query protein in a given ATPS. We undertook a systematic empirical analysis of relations between 57 numerical structural descriptors derived from the corresponding amino acid sequences and crystal structures of 10 well-characterized proteins and the partition behavior of these proteins in 29 different ATPSs. This analysis revealed that just a few structural characteristics of proteins can accurately determine behavior of these proteins in a given ATPS. However, partition behavior of proteins in different ATPSs relies on different structural features. In other words, we could not find a unique set of protein structural features derived from their crystal structures that could be used for the description of the protein partition behavior of all proteins in all ATPSs analyzed in this study. We likely need to gain better insight into relationships between protein-solvent interactions and protein structure peculiarities, in particular given limitations of the used here crystal structures, to be able to construct a model that accurately predicts protein partition behavior across all ATPSs.",

The study of NAD+ has become reinvigorated by new understandings that dynamics within NAD+ metabolism trigger major signaling processes coupled to effectors (sirtuins, PARPs, and CD38) that reprogram cellular metabolism using NAD+ as an effector substrate. Cellular adaptations include stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, a process fundamental to adjusting cellular and tissue physiology to reduced nutrient availability and/or increased energy demand. Several mammalian metabolic pathways converge to NAD+, including tryptophan-derived de novo pathways, nicotinamide salvage pathways, nicotinic acid salvage and nucleoside salvage pathways incorporating nicotinamide riboside and nicotinic acid riboside. Key discoveries highlight a therapeutic potential for targeting NAD+ biosynthetic pathways for treatment of human diseases. A recent emergence of understanding that NAD+ homeostasis is vulnerable to aging and disease processes has stimulated testing to determine if replenishment or augmentation of cellular or tissue NAD+ can have ameliorative effects on aging or disease phenotypes. This experimental approach has provided several proofs of concept successes demonstrating that replenishment or augmentation of NAD+ concentrations can provide ameliorative or curative benefits. Thus NAD+ metabolic pathways can provide key biomarkers and parameters for assessing and modulating organism health.",

     "abstract": "The Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BMVOs) are a group of microbial enzymes that have garnered interest as industrial biocatalysts. While great strides have been made in recent years to understand the mechanism of these enzymes from a structural perspective, our understanding remains incomplete. In particular, the role of a twenty residue loop (residues 487\u2013504), which we refer to as the \u201cControl Loop,\u201d that is observed in either an ordered or disordered state in various crystal structures remains unclear.Using SAXS, we have made the first observations of the Loop in solution with two BVMOs, cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) and cyclopentadecanone monooxygenase. We also made a series of mutants of CHMO and analyzed them using SAXS, ITC, and an uncoupling assay.These experiments show that Control Loop ordering results in an overall more compact enzyme without altering global protein foldedness. We have also demonstrated that the Loop plays a critical and complex role on enzyme structure and catalysis. The Control Loop appears to have a direct impact on the organization of the overall structure of the protein, as well as in influencing the active site environment.The data imply that the Loop can be divided into two regions, referred to as \u201csub-loops,\u201d that coordinate overall domain movements to changes in the active site.A better understanding of the mechanistic role of the Control Loop may ultimately be helpful in designing mutants with altered specificity and improved catalytic efficiency.",

The crystal structures in metal-free, intermediate and metal-bound states, in the previous study, revealed the unusual mechanism of metal binding and release for CLas-ZnuA2. Although CLas-ZnuA2 showed maximum sequence identity to the Mn/Fe-specific SBPs, the mechanistic resemblance seems to be closer to Zn-specific SBPs of Cluster A-I family. The present study reports the binding affinity studies using SPR and CD and crystal structure of CLas-ZnuA2 in Zn2+-bound state. Despite a similar overall structure, there are noticeable differences at the metal binding site. The SPR and CD analysis confirmed our previous observation that CLas-ZnuA2 exhibits a low metal-binding affinity. The low metal-binding affinity of CLas-ZnuA2 could be attributed to the presence of a proline in linker helix resulting in relatively higher bending and rigidity of the same. This structural feature fixes the C-domain similar to metal-bound states of related SBPs. Further, the binding of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ occurs pentavalently with square pyramidal geometry not preferred by either. The site-specific positive Darwinian selection analysis showed that the proline in linker helix is under purifying selection and might have diverged long ago. Our structural and evolutionary analyses suggest that CLasZnua2 might have evolved, particularly for plant pathogens, to facilitate transport of both Mn2+ and Zn2+, with reversible binding to Zn2+, unlike other Mn-binding SBPs (PsaA).",

Studying Xanthomonas genes related to the invasive capacity may improve the knowledge on how this works and ultimately use the information to avoid the disease. Some annotated genes from Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri published genome are addressed to an interesting class of genes named \u201cpathogenicity, virulence and adaptation\u201d. One of them is xanA, which encodes a predicted phosphoglucomutase. Phosphoglucomutases are ubiquitous enzymes among the living kingdoms that play roles in carbohydrate metabolism, catalyzing the reversible conversion of 1- to 6-phosphoglucose. In Xanthomonas, phosphoglucomutase activity is required to synthesize precursors of the pathogenesis-related polysaccharide xanthan. In this work, a characterization of this gene product is presented by structural and functional studies. Molecular cloning was used for heterologous expression and deletion of xanA. A Michaelis-Menten kinetics model was obtained using the recombinant protein. The protein structure was also determined by X-ray diffraction on the recombinant enzyme substrate-free, bound to glucose-1,6-biphosphate and to glucose-1-phosphate. Deletion of xanA was done with a suicide plasmid construct and the obtained mutant was tested for pathogenic capacity.

     "abstract": "We report on the molecular interactions of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) with prenylflavonoids, an emerging class of FXR modulators. FXR is an attractive therapeutic target for mitigating metabolic syndromes (MetS) because FXR activates the inhibitory nuclear receptor, small heterodimer partner (SHP), thereby inhibiting both gluconeogenesis and de novo lipogenesis. We and others have shown that xanthohumol (XN), the principal prenylflavonoid of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), is a FXR agonist based on its ability to affect lipid and glucose metabolism in vivo and to induces FXR target genes in biliary carcinoma cells and HEK293 cells. However, studies are currently lacking to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of FXR modulation by prenylflavonoids. We addressed this deficiency and report the first systematic study of FXR prenylflavonoid interactions. We combined hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) with computational studies for dissecting molecular recognition and conformational impact of prenylflavonoid interactions on the ligand binding domain (LBD) of human FXR. Four prenylflavonoids were tested: xanthohumol, a prenylated chalcone, two prenylated flavonones, namely isoxanthohumol (IX) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN), and a semisynthetic prenylflavonoid derivative, tetrahydroxanthohumol (TX). Enhancement of the HDX protection profile data by in silico predicted models of FXR prenylflavonoid complexes resulted in mapping of the prenylflavonoid interactions within the canonical ligand binding pocket. Our findings provide a foundation for the exploration of the chemical scaffolds of prenylated chalcones and flavanones as leads for future structure activity studies of this important nuclear receptor with potential relevance for ameliorating lipid metabolic disorders associated with obesity and MetS.",

Recombinant fragments corresponding to both BoNT/A HN and HC regions were prepared (HN519\u2013845 and HC967\u20131296) and their binding to synaptic proteins was verified. The binding behaviors of these heavy-chain domains were analyzed by treating the Neuro 2a, a murine neuroblastoma cell line, with compounds known to alter membrane properties. Cholesterol depletion and lipid raft inhibition increased the binding of HN519\u2013845 to Neuro 2a cells without affecting HC967\u20131296-cell interaction. Sphingolipid depletion decreased the binding of cells to both HC967\u20131296 and HN519\u2013845 whereas, loading exogenous GD1a, on to the Neuro 2a cells, increased the binding of both the peptides to cells. Microtubule disruption of the Neuro 2a cells by nocodazole decreased the binding of both HC967\u20131296 and HN519\u2013845 to the treated cells. Inhibition of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis using dynasore, chlorpromazine or potassium (K+) depletion buffer lowered the binding of both HC967\u20131296 and HN519\u2013845 to the cells, but seemed to exert a more pronounced effect on the binding of HC967\u20131296 than on the binding of HN519\u2013845. Results indicate that while both the HN and HC domains are involved in the binding of the toxin to neuronal cells there are differences in their behavior which probably stem from their respective amino acid composition and structural location in the toxin three-dimensional structure along with their intended role in translocation and internalization into the cells.",

By comparing the proteomic profile from a wild-type strain to that from a \u0394rstB strain or a \u0394phoPQ strain under a condition known to activate these TCSs, we found that the levels of 159 proteins representing 6.92% of the 2297 proteins identified from the \u0394rstB strain and 341 proteins representing 14.9% of the 2288 proteins identified from the \u0394phoPQ strain were significantly changed, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the RstA/RstB system and the PhoP/PhoQ system coordinated with regard to the regulation of specific proteins as well as metabolic processes. Our observations suggested that the regulatory networks controlled by the PhoP/PhoQ system were much more extensive than those by the RstA/RstB system, whereas the RstA/RstB system specifically regulated expression of the constituents participating in pyrimidine metabolism and iron acquisition. Additional results also suggested that the RstA/RstB system was required for regulation of Salmonella motility and invasion.",

     "abstract": "Triosephosphate isomerase (TIM; EC 5.3.1.1) is a key enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis is one of the most regulated metabolic pathways, however little is known about the structural mechanisms for its regulation in non-model organisms, like crustaceans. To understand the structure and function of this enzyme in invertebrates, we obtained the crystal structure of triosephosphate isomerase from the marine Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei, LvTIM) in complex with its inhibitor 2-phosphogyceric acid (2-PG) at 1.7\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. LvTIM assembles as a homodimer with residues 166\u2013176 covering the active site and residue Glu166 interacting with the inhibitor. We found that LvTIM is the least stable TIM characterized to date, with the lowest range of melting temperatures, and with the lowest activation enthalpy associated with the thermal unfolding process reported. In TIMs dimer stabilization is maintained by an interaction of loop 3 by a set of hydrophobic contacts between subunits. Within these contacts, the side chain of a hydrophobic residue of one subunit fits into a cavity created by a set of hydrophobic residues in the neighboring subunit, via a \u201cball and socket\u201d interaction. LvTIM presents a Cys47 at the \u201cball\u201d inter-subunit contact indicating that the character of this residue is responsible for the decrease in dimer stability. Mutational studies show that this residue plays a role in dimer stability but is not a solely determinant for dimer formation.",

Several mutations of these residues (F393A, F393W or Q403W) were introduced to probe their roles in the overall reaction. Transient absorption measurements confirm rapid electron transfer as heme reduction is observed in all four hybrid enzymes. Compared to the parent sL407C-1, photocatalytic activity was negligible in the dF393A-1 enzyme while 60% increase in activity with total turnover numbers of 420 and 90% product conversion was observed with the dQ403W-1 mutant.In the sL407C-1 enzyme, the photosensitizer is ideally located to rapidly deliver electrons, using the naturally occurring electron transfer pathway, to the heme center in order to activate molecular dioxygen and sustain photocatalytic activity.The results shed light on the design of efficient light-driven biocatalysts and the approach can be generalized to other members of the P450 superfamily.",

Typical plant defensins are small, basic peptides that possess a characteristic three-dimensional fold stabilized by three or four disulfide bridges.

One of such genes encodes for AtPDFL2.1, a putative antifungal peptide of 55 amino acids, with six cysteine residues in its primary sequence. To understand the functional role of AtPDFL2.1, we carried out antifungal activity assays and determined its high-resolution three-dimensional structure using multidimensional solution NMR spectroscopy. We found that AtPDFL2.1 displays a strong inhibitory effect against Fusarium graminearum (IC50\u00a0\u2248\u00a04\u00a0\u03bcM). This peptide folds in the canonical cysteine-stabilized \u03b1\u03b2 (CS\u03b1\u03b2) motif, consisting of one \u03b1-helix and one triple-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet stabilized by three disulfide bridges and a hydrophobic cluster of residues within its core where the \u03b1-helix packs tightly against the \u03b2-sheets. Nuclear spin relaxation measurements show that the structure of AtPDFL2.1 is essentially rigid, with the L3 loop located between \u03b2-strands 2 and 3 being more flexible and displaying conformational exchange. Interestingly, the dynamic features of loop L3 are conserved among defensins and are probably correlated to the antifungal and receptor binding activities.",

Mutational studies including calcium mobilization, receptor internalization and ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays were performed.Stimulation of APJR and its mutants with apelin-13 led to mutation-dependent variation in receptor activation, intracellular Ca2+\u00a0rise, and its subsequent downstream signaling.

Although the peptide-based bottom-up HDX approach and the protein-based top-down HDX approach have complementary advantages, the work done so far on biosimilars has involved only one or the other approach. Herein we have characterized the structures of two bevacizumab (BEV) biosimilars and compared them to the reference BEV using both methods. A sequence coverage of 87% was obtained for the heavy chain and 74% for the light chain in the bottom-up approach. The deuterium incorporation behavior of the peptic peptides from the three BEVs were compared side by side and showed no differences at various HDX time points. Top-down experiments were carried out using subzero temperature LC-MS, and the deuterium incorporation of the intact light chain and heavy chain were obtained. Top-down ETD was also performed to obtain amino acid-level HDX information that covered 100% of the light chain, but only 50% coverage is possible for the heavy chain. Consistent with the intact subunit level data, no differences were observed in the amino acid level HDX data. All these results indicate that there are no differences between the three BEV samples with respect to their high-order structures. The peptide level information from the bottom-up approach, and the residue level and intact subunit level information from the top-down approach were complementary and covered the entire antibody.",

Herein we attempt to establish such a \u201crule\u201d. To this end, a hypothesis is proposed on the effects of substitutions of hydrophobic residues with large number of contacts on free energies of different states of a globular protein. The hypothesis states: Substitutions of hydrophobic residues engaged in a large number of residue-residue contacts would not change the folding rate of a protein but could affect its unfolding rate. This hypothesis was verified by both theoretical and experimental analyses, generating a general rule that can facilitate the work of experimentalists on constructing mutant forms of proteins.",

We constructed the model structures of the enzyme in three known conformations (open, adenylation, and oxidation conformation). The structural analysis and experimental data provided no evidences that these residues participate in structure-forming interactions in the open or oxidation conformation or that their mutations alter the overall structure of the enzyme. Given that the bioluminescence spectra reflect the microenvironment of the emitter (oxyluciferin in an electronically excited state), we concluded that the mutated residues affect the active site during the emission of light via short-range interactions. We found that it is only in the adenylation conformation that the residues Phe467 and Glu490 approach the N-domain, whereas the domain rotation associated with the oxidation conformation completely removes them from the active site. Therefore, the emission most likely occurs from the adenylation conformation.",

     "abstract": "The oxoglutarate carrier (OGC) belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family and plays a key role in important metabolic pathways. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was used to conservatively replace lysine 122 by arginine, in order to investigate new structural rearrangements required for substrate translocation. K122R mutant was kinetically characterized, exhibiting a significant Vmax reduction with respect to the wild-type (WT) OGC, whereas Km value was unaffected, implying that this substitution does not interfere with 2-oxoglutarate binding site. Moreover, K122R mutant was more inhibited by several sulfhydryl reagents with respect to the WT OGC, suggesting that the reactivity of some cysteine residues towards these Cys-specific reagents is increased in this mutant. Different sulfhydryl reagents were employed in transport assays to test the effect of the cysteine modifications on single-cysteine OGC mutants named C184, C221, C224 (constructed in the WT background) and K122R/C184, K122R/C221, K122R/C224 (constructed in the K122R background). Cysteines 221 and 224 were more deeply influenced by some sulfhydryl reagents in the K122R background. Furthermore, the presence of 2-oxoglutarate significantly enhanced the degree of inhibition of K122R/C221, K122R/C224 and C224 activity by the sulfhydryl reagent 2-Aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA), suggesting that cysteines 221 and 224, together with K122, take part to structural rearrangements required for the transition from the c- to the m-state during substrate translocation.Our results are interpreted in the light of the homology model of BtOGC, built by using as a template the X-ray structure of the bovine ADP/ATP carrier isoform 1 (AAC1).",

The purpose of this study was to characterize purified human PRCP, to investigate its substrate specificity and to discover novel substrates linked to obesity. Pyroglutamated apelin-13, ghrelin, enterostatin and obestatin were investigated since these are feeding-regulating peptides with potential cleaving sites for PRCP.PRCP was purified from human placenta and identified using western blotting and mass spectrometry. The kinetic parameters of purified and commercially available PRCP for known and potential peptide substrates were determined and compared using a RP-HPLC activity assay, isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry.PRCP was purified 575-fold from human placenta and succesfully identified as human lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase. Purified and recombinant PRCP had similar substrate specificity with angiotensin III as the substrate of preference. Pyroglutamated apelin-13 was observed to be a novel substrate for human PRCP in vitro and PRCP-dependent cleavage was shown in a human umbilical vein endothelial cell culture experiment. Other potential substrates e.g. obestatin, ghrelin and enterostatin were not hydrolyzed by PRCP.These results show that placenta is a good source of human PRCP and that PRCP removes the C-terminal phenylalanine from pyroglutamated apelin-13. For the first time, PRCP is identified as an apelin-cleaving enzyme. This finding adds evidence to the hypothesis that PRCP plays a role in energy homeostasis.",

Peptide AspNB (residues 166\u2013175) corresponded to the predicted amyloidogenic region of the protein glucantransferase Bgl2 from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell wall. The process of amyloid formation was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy (FS), electron microscopy (EM), tandem mass spectrometry (TMS), and X-ray diffraction (XD) methods. The experimental study at pH\u00a03.0 revealed formation of amyloid fibrils with similar morphology for both peptides. Moreover, we found that the morphology of fibrils made of untreated ammonia peptide is not mentioned in the literature. This morphology resembles snakes lying side by side in the form of a wave without intertwining. Irrespective of the way of the peptide preparation, the rate of fibril formation is higher for AspNB than for GluNB. However, preliminary treatment with ammonia highly affected fibril morphology especially for AspNB. Such treatment allowed us to obtain a lag period during the process of amyloid formation. It showed that the process was nucleation-dependent. With or without treatment, amyloid fibrils consisted of ring-like oligomers with the diameter of about 6\u00a0nm packed either directly ring-to-ring or ring-on-ring with a slight shift.

     "abstract": "The cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 and SHMT2, respectively) are well-recognized targets of cancer research, since their activity is critical for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis and because of their prominent role in the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells. Here we show that 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), a potent novel anti-tumour agent believed to function primarily by blocking energy metabolism, differentially inactivates human SHMT1 and SHMT2. SHMT1 is completely inhibited by 3BP, whereas SHMT2 retains a significant fraction of activity. Site directed mutagenesis experiments on SHMT1 demonstrate that selective inhibition relies on the presence of a cysteine residue at the active site of SHMT1 (Cys204) that is absent in SHMT2. Our results show that 3BP binds to SHMT1 active site, forming an enzyme-3BP complex, before reacting with Cys204. The physiological substrate l-serine is still able to bind at the active site of the inhibited enzyme, although catalysis does not occur. Modelling studies suggest that alkylation of Cys204 prevents a productive binding of l-serine, hampering interaction between substrate and Arg402. Conversely, the partial inactivation of SHMT2 takes place without the formation of a 3BP-enzyme complex. The introduction of a cysteine residue in the active site of SHMT2 by site directed mutagenesis (A206C mutation), at a location corresponding to that of Cys204 in SHMT1, yields an enzyme that forms a 3BP-enzyme complex and is completely inactivated. This work sets the basis for the development of selective SHMT1 inhibitors that target Cys204, starting from the structure and reactivity of 3BP.",

     "abstract": "The AMP-activated protein kinase is a metabolic regulator that transduces information about energy and nutrient availability. In yeast, the AMP-activated protein kinase, called Snf1, is activated when energy and nutrients are scarce. Earlier studies have demonstrated that activation of Snf1 requires the phosphorylation of the activation loop on threonine 210. Here we examined the regulation of Snf1 kinase activity in response to phosphorylation at other sites. Phosphoproteomic studies have identified numerous phosphorylation sites within the Snf1 kinase enzyme. We made amino acid substitutions in the Snf1 protein that were either non-phosphorylatable (serine to alanine) or phospho-mimetic (serine to glutamate) and examined the effects of these changes on Snf1 kinase function in vivo and on its catalytic activity in vitro. We found that changes to most of the phosphorylation sites had no effect on Snf1 kinase function. However, changes to serine 214, a site within the kinase activation loop, inhibited Snf1 kinase activity. Snf1-activating kinase 1 still phosphorylates Snf1-S214E on threonine 210 but the S214E enzyme is non-functional in vivo and catalytically inactive in vitro. We conclude that yeast have developed two distinct pathways for down-regulating Snf1 activity. The first is through direct dephosphorylation of the conserved activation loop threonine. The second is through phosphorylation of serine 214.",

Both mutant proteins when expressed in E. coli formed inclusion bodies, and on solubilizing and refolding, they exhibited similar structural properties, with a 2- to 3-fold increase in molar mass compared to the molar mass of wild-type protein. The deletion mutants were less stable than the wild-type \u03b1A-crystallin. Functionally \u03b1A\u039470\u201388 was completely inactive as a chaperone, while \u03b1A\u039470\u201376 demonstrated a 40\u201350% reduction in anti-aggregation activity against alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Deletion of residues 70\u201388 abolished the ADH binding sites in \u03b1A-crystallin at physiological temperature. At 45\u00a0\u00b0C, cryptic ADH binding site(s) became exposed, which contributed subtly to the chaperone-like activity of \u03b1A\u039470\u201388.

Expression analysis of eugenol synthase (EGS) gene showed higher transcript levels especially in young leaves and inflorescence; and were positively correlated with eugenol contents. Additionally, transcript levels of coniferyl alcohol acyl transferase, a key enzyme diverting pool of substrate to phenylpropanoids, were in accordance with their abundance in respective species. In particular, eugenol methyl transferase expression positively correlated with higher levels of eugenol methyl ether in Ocimum tenuiflorum. Further, EGSs were functionally characterized from four Ocimum species varying in their eugenol contents. Kinetic and expression analyses indicated, higher enzyme turnover and transcripts levels, in species accumulating more eugenol. Moreover, biochemical and bioinformatics studies demonstrated that coniferyl acetate was the preferred substrate over coumaryl acetate when used, individually or together, in the enzyme assay.

RAGE binds to a hydrophobic surface on S100A9. Interactions between these proteins trigger signal transduction cascades, promoting cell growth, proliferation, and tumorigenesis.

We further characterize the solution interactions between mS100A9 and the RAGE V domain via NMR spectroscopy. CHAPS is a zwitterionic and non-denaturing molecule widely used for protein solubilizing and stabilization. We found out that CHAPS and RAGE V domain would interact with mS100A9 by using 1H-15N HSQC NMR titrations. Therefore, using the HADDOCK program, we superimpose two binary complex models mS100A9-RAGE V domain and mS100A9-CHAPS and demonstrate that CHAPS molecules could play a crucial role in blocking the interaction between mS100A9 and the RAGE V domain.

Endocytosis is a cellular function which is likely to take part in this development due to its important role in regulating the abundances of vital signaling receptors. Here, we aimed to investigate the abundance of endocytosis-associated proteins in HCCs with various differentiation grades. Therefore, we analyzed 36 tissue specimens from HCC patients via LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics including 19 HCC tissue samples with different degrees of histological grades and corresponding non-tumorous tissue controls. As a result, 277 proteins were differentially regulated between well-differentiated tumors and controls. In moderately and poorly differentiated tumors, 278 and 1181 proteins, respectively, were significantly differentially regulated compared to non-tumorous tissue. We explored the regulated proteins based on their functions and identified thirty endocytosis-associated proteins, mostly overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors. These included proteins that have been shown to be up-regulated in HCC like clathrin heavy chain-1 (CLTC) as well as unknown proteins, such as secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 3 (SCAMP3). The abundances of SCAMP3 and CLTC were immunohistochemically examined in tissue sections of 84 HCC patients. We demonstrate the novel association of several endocytosis-associated proteins, in particular, SCAMP3 with HCC progression.",

The weights/lengths of seedling, shoot, and root of wheat varieties were increased on 5\u00a0ppm Fe NPs exposure. The number of proteins related to photosynthesis and protein metabolism was decreased and increased in drought tolerant variety and salt tolerant variety, respectively, treated with Fe NPs compared to untreated plants.

Out of photosynthesis related proteins, light reaction was enhanced in salt tolerant variety compared to drought tolerant variety on Fe NPs exposure. The abundance of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small chain in drought tolerant variety was higher than that in salt tolerant variety; however, in salt tolerant variety, it was increased 3 fold by Fe NPs exposure compared to untreated plant.

Computational prediction of kinase targets \u2013 assigning kinases to putative substrates, and selecting from protein sequence the sites that kinases can phosphorylate \u2013 requires the consideration of both the cellular context that kinases operate in, as well as their binding affinity. This consideration enables investigation of how phosphorylation influences a range of biological processes.We report here a novel probabilistic model for classifying kinase-specific phosphorylation sites from sequence across three model organisms: human, mouse and yeast. The model incorporates position-specific amino acid frequencies, and counts of co-occurring amino acids from kinase binding sites. We show how this model can be seamlessly integrated with protein interactions and cell-cycle abundance profiles. When evaluating the prediction accuracy of our method, PhosphoPICK, on an independent hold-out set of kinase-specific phosphorylation sites, it achieved an average specificity of 97%, with 32% sensitivity. We compared PhosphoPICK's ability, through cross-validation, to predict kinase-specific phosphorylation sites with alternative methods, and show that at high levels of specificity PhosphoPICK obtains greater sensitivity for most comparisons made.We investigated the relationship between kinase-specific phosphorylation sites and nuclear localisation signals. We show that kinases PKA, Akt1 and AurB have an over-representation of predicted binding sites at particular positions downstream from predicted nuclear localisation signals, demonstrating an important role for these kinases in regulating the nuclear import of proteins.PhosphoPICK is freely available as a web-service at http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/phosphopick.",

However, how macromolecular crowding affects amyloid formation of \u03b22M remains elusive. Here we study the effects of macromolecular crowding on amyloid formation and fibril disassembly of wild-type human \u03b22M and its pathogenic mutant \u0394N6. At strongly acidic pH\u00a02.5, the presence of a strong crowding agent (Ficoll 70 or dextran 70) not only dramatically accelerates the fibrillization of both wild-type \u03b22M and its \u0394N6 variant by reducing the lag time to a large extent, indicating the acceleration of the nucleation phase, but also remarkably increases the amount of \u03b22M fibrils. At weakly acidic pH\u00a06.2, such an enhancing effect of macromolecular crowding on fibril formation is only observed for pathogenic mutant \u0394N6, but not for wild-type \u03b22M which does not form amyloid fibrils in the absence and presence of a crowding agent. Thus, we propose that the monomers of \u03b22M form the nuclei, which is enhanced by macromolecular crowding, followed by the step of fibril elongation. Furthermore, at physiological pH, macromolecular crowding remarkably inhibits \u03b22M fibril disassembly by decreasing rate constants corresponding to fast and slow stages of fibril disaggregation. Our data demonstrate that macromolecular crowding favors the fibrillization of \u03b22M by accelerating the nucleation step and inhibiting fibril disassembly. Our findings provide clear evidence for the pathology of HAA that macromolecular crowding should be taken into account.",

     "abstract": "HMGB1 triggers proinflammatory reactions by interacting extracellularly with various receptors. HMGB1 also acts in the nucleus by interacting with DNA and controlling DNA transcription, a process which involves its self-association. The self-association of HMGB1 was characterized using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A dimer/tetramer binding model was developed that provided a good fit to the SPR sensorgrams and enabled the kinetics of self-association of different HMGB1 oligomers to be evaluated under a variety of physicochemical conditions. The formation of HMGB1 tetramers, and not dimers, was strongly influenced by ionic strength. HMGB1 self-association increased as the pH was decreased from 7.4 to 4.8 but was abolished at pH\u00a04.0, suggesting the involvement of acidic amino acids of HMGB1 in its self-association. HMGB1 dimers were found to predominate in the absence of zinc, but addition of zinc promoted the formation of HMGB1 tetramers. More reducing conditions favored dimerization but diminished tetramer formation. In contrast, oxidizing conditions favored tetramer formation. Physicochemical factors modulate the extent of self-association of HMGB1. We speculate that HMGB1 dimers may preferentially bind DNA, whereas HMGB1 tetramers may promote inflammatory responses by binding to RAGE and TLRs. The self-association of HMGB1, regulated by variations of physicochemical factors, may influence its roles in DNA rearrangement and regulation of pathophysiological diseases.",

In fact, during evolution, the LMW-PTP structure adapted to perform different catalytic actions depending on the organism type. In bacteria, this enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of group 1 and 4 capsules, but it is also a virulence factor in pathogenic strains.

These reactions are catalyzed by various N-terminal and lysine acetyltransferases.

The interplay between acetylation and deacetylation is crucial for many important cellular processes.

To avoid complications associated with this high aggregation propensity of the retro protein, we compared EndoT5 and R-EndoT5 in the presence of strong denaturants. This analysis revealed that these two proteins possess different internal dynamics in solutions containing 8\u00a0M urea, with the retro-form being characterized by larger dimensions and slower internal dynamics. We also show that in the absence of denaturant, both forms of the bacteriophage T5 endolysin are able to interact with micelles formed by the zwitterionic detergent dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), and that the formation of the protein-micelle complexes leads to the significant structural rearrangement of polypeptide chain and to the formation of stable hydrophobic core in the R-Endo T5.",

Here, we compare the molecular basis of Dm eIF4E's interactions with cap and eIF4G peptide by using homology modelling and fluorescence binding assays with various cap analogues. We found that despite the presence of conserved key residues responsible for cap recognition, the differences in binding different cap analogues among Class I Dm eIF4E isoforms are up to 14-fold. The highest affinity for cap analogues was observed for Dm eIF4E-3.

The active site of KSI is formed by several hydrophobic residues and three catalytic residues (Tyr14, Asp38, and Asp99). In this study, we investigated the role of a hydrophobic Met112 residue near the active site in the catalysis, steroid binding, and stability of KSI. Replacing Met112 with alanine (yields M112A) or leucine (M112L) decreased the kcat by 20- and 4-fold, respectively. Compared with the wild type (WT), M112A and M112L KSIs showed increased KD values for equilenin, an intermediate analogue; these changes suggest that loss of packing at position 112 might lead to unfavorable steroid binding, thereby resulting in decreased catalytic activity. Furthermore, M112A and M112L mutations reduced melting temperature (Tm) by 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C and 2.5\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. These changes suggest that favorable packing in the core is important for the maintenance of stability in KSI. The M112K mutation decreased kcat by 2000-fold, compared with the WT. In M112K KSI structure, a new salt bridge was formed between Asp38 and Lys112. This bridge could change the electrostatic potential of Asp38, and thereby contribute to the decreased catalytic activity. The M112K mutation also decreased the stability by reducing Tm by 4.1\u00a0\u00b0C.

In particular, we examined the accessibility of rp uS3 for binding of unstructured RNAs and of riboses in h16 towards attack with benzoyl cyanide (BzCN) in complexes assembled in rabbit reticulocyte lysate utilizing synthetic oligoribonucleotides as well as full-length and truncated up to the initiation AUG codon hepatitis C virus IRES as model mRNAs. With both mRNA types, the rp uS3 peptide recognizing single-stranded RNAs was shown to become shielded only in those 48S preinitiation complexes (PICs) that contained eIF3j bound to 40S subunit in the area between the decoding site and the mRNA entry channel. Chemical probing with BzCN revealed that h16 in the 48S PICs containing eIF3j or scanning factor DHX29 is strongly shielded; the effect was observed with all the mRNAs used, and h16 remained protected as well in 80S post-initiation complexes lacking these factors. Altogether, the obtained results allowed us to suggest that eIF3j bound at the 48S PICs makes the rp uS3 inaccessible for binding of RNAs and this factor subunit is responsible for the decrease of h16 conformational flexibility; the latter is manifested as reduced accessibility of h16 to BzCN. Thus, our findings provide new insights into how eIF3j is implicated in ensuring the proper conformation of the mRNA entry channel, thereby facilitating mRNA loading.",

     "abstract": "Plasmepsin II is a malarial pepsin-like aspartic protease produced as a zymogen containing an N-terminal prosegment domain that is removed during activation. Despite structural similarities between active plasmepsin II and pepsin, their prosegments adopt different conformations in the respective zymogens. In contrast to pepsinogen, the proplasmepsin II prosegment is 80 residues longer, contains a transmembrane region and is non-essential for recombinant expression in an active form, thus calling into question the prosegment's precise function. The present study examines the role of the prosegment in the folding mechanism of plasmepsin II. Both a shorter (residues 77\u2013124) and a longer (residues 65\u2013124) prosegment catalyze plasmepsin II folding at rates more than four orders of magnitude faster compared to folding without prosegment. Native plasmepsin II is kinetically trapped and requires the prosegment both to catalyze folding and to shift the folding equilibrium towards the native conformation. Thus, despite low sequence identity and distinct zymogen conformations, the folding landscapes of plasmepsin II and pepsin, both with and without prosegment, are qualitatively identical. These results imply a conserved and unusual feature of the pepsin-like protease topology that necessitates prosegment-assisted folding.",

Since laboratory yeast strains are typically leucine auxotroph, metabolic labelling with trideuterated leucine (d3-leucine) is a straightforward, cost-effective, and ubiquitously applicable strategy for quantitative proteomic studies, similar to the widely used arginine/lysine metabolic labelling method for mammalian cells. We showcase the usage of advanced peptide quantification using the FeatureFinderMultiplex algorithm (part of the OpenMS software package) for robust and reliable quantification. Furthermore, we present an OpenMS bioinformatics data analysis workflow that combines accurate quantification with high proteome coverage. In order to enable visualization, peptide-mapping, and sharing of quantitative proteomic data, especially for membrane-spanning and cell-surface proteins, we further developed the web-application Proteator (http://proteator.appspot.com). Due to its simplicity and robustness, we expect metabolic leucine labelling in yeast to be of great interest to the research community. As an exemplary application, we show the identification of the copper transporter Ctr1 as a putative substrate of the ER-intramembrane protease Ypf1 by yeast membrane proteomics using d3-leucine isotopic labelling.",

     "abstract": "Nuclear aggregates of polyamines (NAPs) are supramolecular compounds generated by the self-assembly of protonated nuclear polyamines (spermine, spermidine and putrescine) and phosphate ions. In the presence of genomic DNA, the hierarchical process of self-structuring ultimately produces nanotube-like polymers that envelop the double helix. Because of their modular nature and their aggregation-disaggregation dynamics, NAPs confer plasticity and flexibility to DNA. Through the disposition of charges, NAPs also enable a bidirectional stream of information between the genome and interacting moieties.High mobility group (HMG) B1 is a non-histone chromosomal protein that binds to DNA and that influences multiple nuclear processes. Because genomic DNA binds to either NAPs or HMGB1 protein, we explored the ability of in vitro self-assembled NAPs (ivNAPs) to mediate the DNA-HMGB1 interaction. To this end, we structured DNA-NAPs-HMGB1 and DNA-HMGB1-NAPs ternary complexes in vitro through opportune sequential incubations. Mobility shift electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy showed that the DNA-ivNAPs-HGMB1 complex had conformational assets supposedly more suitable those of the DNA-HGMB1-ivNAPs to comply with the physiological and functional requirements of DNA. Our findings indicated that ivNAPs act as mediators of the DNA-HMGB1 interaction.",

However, the mechanism of \u03b1-syn aggregation into amyloid fibrils and their morphology are not well understood. To elucidate the aggregation kinetics and the morphology of aggregates by the use of fluorescent techniques the protein needs to be suitably labeled. In this study, using atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate a significant effect of fluorescent labels on the \u03b1-syn fibrillization process. We studied in detail the morphology of \u03b1-syn aggregates as a function of the composition of mixtures of labeled and wild type (WT) \u03b1-syn in solution using different types of fluorescent dyes. Although the overall charge of the fluorophores we used and their chemical structure varied significantly, the morphology of \u03b1-syn fibrils changed in a similar way in all cases. The increase in the fraction of labeled \u03b1-syn in solution led to shortening of the fibrils as compared to those from WT-only \u03b1-syn, whereas the height of the fibrils remained mainly unaffected. The twisted fibril morphology observed in the WT and A140C \u03b1-syn mutant completely disappeared when the A140C \u03b1-syn mutant was 100% fluorescently labeled.",

Thus, the identification of novel selective anticancer drugs that also have antithrombotic properties is of enormous significance. Amblyomin-X is an anticancer protein derived from the salivary glands of the Amblyomma cajennense tick.In this work, we determined the inhibition profile of Amblyomin-X and its effect on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT), using various approaches such as, kinetic analyses, amidolytic assays, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry.Amblyomin-X inhibited factor Xa, prothrombinase and tenase activities. It was hydrolyzed by trypsin and plasmin. MS/MS data of tryptic hydrolysate of Amblyomin-X suggested the presence of Cys8-Cys59 and Cys19-Cys42 but not Cys34-Cys55 disulfide bond. Instead of Cys34-Cys55, two noncanonical Cys34-Cys74 and Cys55-Cys74 disulfide bonds were identified. Furthermore, when Amblyomin-X (1\u00a0mg/kg) injected in rabbits, it prolonged aPTT and PT.Amblyomin-X is a noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki\u00a0=\u00a03.9\u00a0\u03bcM) of factor Xa. It is a substrate for plasmin and trypsin, but not for factor Xa and thrombin. The disulfide Cys34-Cys55 bond probably scrambles with interchain seventh free cysteine residues (Cys74) of Amblyomin-X. The prolongation of PT and aPTT is reversible.General Significance.In term of anticoagulant property, this is structural and functional characterization of Amblyomin-X.

Few of those appear to contribute significantly to thermal stability of AQUI. This includes a putative salt bridge between residues Lys142 and Glu172 as its deletion did not have any significant effect on its stability or activity (J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir et al. (2014)). Insertion of this putative salt bridge into the structure of VPR, in a double mutant (VPR\u0394C_Q142K/S172E), however was detrimental to the stability of the enzyme. Incorporation of either the Q142K or S172E mutations into VPR, were found to significantly affect the catalytic properties of the enzyme. The single mutation Q142K was highly effective, as it increased the kcat and kcat/Km more than twofold. When the Q142K mutation was inserted into a thermostabilized, but a low activity mutant of VPR (VPR\u0394C_N3P/I5P), the activity increased about tenfold in terms of kcat and kcat/Km, while retaining the stability of the mutant. Molecular dynamics simulations of the single mutants were carried out to provide structural rationale for these experimental observations. Based on root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles, the two mutants were more flexible in certain regions of the structure and the Q142K mutant had the highest overall flexibility of the three enzymes. The results suggest that weakening of specific H-bonds resulting from the mutations may be propagated over some distance giving rise to higher flexibility in the active site regions of the enzyme, causing higher catalytic activity in the mutants.",

     "abstract": "Many proteins contain i ntrinsically d isordered r egions (IDRs) lacking stable secondary and ordered tertiary structure. IDRs are often implicated in macromolecular interactions, and may undergo structural transitions upon binding to interaction partners. However, as binding partners of many protein IDRs are unknown, these structural transitions are difficult to verify and often are poorly understood. In this study we describe a method to identify IDRs that are likely to undergo helical transitions upon binding. This method combines bioinformatics analyses followed by circular dichroism spectroscopy to monitor 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)-induced changes in secondary structure content of these IDRs. Our results demonstrate that there is no significant change in the helicity of IDRs that are not predicted to fold upon binding. IDRs that are predicted to fold fall into two groups: one group does not become helical in the presence of TFE and includes examples of IDRs that form \u03b2-strands upon binding, while the other group becomes more helical and includes examples that are known to fold into helices upon binding. Therefore, we propose that bioinformatics analyses combined with experimental evaluation using TFE may provide a general method to identify IDRs that undergo binding-induced disorder-to-helix transitions.",

Here, we analyzed the structural properties of the unfolded state of the starch-binding domain of glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger (SBD) formed in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride (GuHCl). Although far-UV CD and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra as well as small angle X-ray scattering suggested that SBD assumes highly unfolded structures in the presence of GuHCl, near-UV circular dichroism of wild-type SBD suggested the presence of residual structures in the unfolded state. Analyses of the unfolded states of tryptophan mutants (W543L, W563A, W590A and W615L) using Similarity Parameter, a modified version of root mean square deviation as a measure of similarity between two spectra, suggested that W543 and W563 have preferences to form native-like residual structures in the GuHCl-unfolded state. In contrast, W615 was entirely unstructured, while W590 tended to form non-native ordered structures in the unfolded state.

Lipid vesicles having negative head groups, such as DMPG, interact with reduced HEWL to induce formation of more helical structure than in native HEWL, but no stable tertiary structure was evident. Changes in tertiary structure, as evidenced by local environment of the tryptophan residues, were monitored by fluorescence. Spectra for oxidized HEWL, reduced HEWL and mutants with no or just one disulfide bond developed variable degrees of increased helicity when added to negatively charged lipid vesicles, mostly depending on packing of tails. When mixed with zwitterionic lipid vesicles, reduced HEWL developed \u03b2-sheet structure with no change in helicity, indicating an altered interaction mechanism. Stopped flow CD and fluorescence dynamics, were fit to multi-exponential forms, consistent with refolding to metastable intermediates of increasing helicity for HEWL interacting with lipid vesicles. Formation of an intermediate after rapid interaction of the lipid vesicles and the protein is supported by the correlation of faster steps in CD and fluorescence kinetics, and largely appears driven by electrostatic interaction. In subsequent slower steps, the partially refolded intermediate further alters structure, gaining helicity and modifying tryptophan packing, as driven by hydrophobic interactions.",

Though attempts have been made to predict unfolding rates using protein sequence-structure information there is no available method for predicting the unfolding rates of proteins upon specific point mutations. In this work, we have systematically analyzed a set of 790 single mutants and developed a robust method for predicting protein unfolding rates upon mutations (\u0394lnku) in two-state proteins by combining amino acid properties and knowledge-based classification of mutants with multiple linear regression technique. We obtain a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.79/s and a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.71 between predicted unfolding rates and experimental observations using jack-knife test. We have developed a web server for predicting protein unfolding rates upon mutation and it is freely available at https://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/proteinunfolding/unfoldingrace.html. Prominent features that determine unfolding kinetics as well as plausible reasons for the observed outliers are also discussed.",

The present experimental data support the idea that O2 molecule escapes from the \u03b2 subunits mainly through the His(E7) gate, and show unambiguously that, in the \u03b1 subunits, in addition to the direct E7 channel, there is at least one alternative escape route leading to the exterior via the xenon docking sites.",

The objective of the present work was to develop a simple and rapid quantification method for simultaneous determination of \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b2-casein in human milk using signature peptides according to a modified quantitative proteomics strategy. The internal standards containing the signature peptide sequences were synthesized with isotope-labeled amino acids. The purity of synthesized peptides as standards was determined by amino acid analysis method and area normalization method. The contents of \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b2-casein in human milk were measured according to the equimolar relationship between the two proteins and their corresponding signature peptides. The method validation results showed a satisfied linearity (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.99) and recoveries (97.2\u2013102.5% for \u03b1-lactalbumin and 99.5\u2013100.3% for \u03b2-casein).

These data provide further evidence for the intrinsically disordered nature of the N-terminal region of Beclin 1 and support the view that the helical conformation adopted by the Beclin 1 BH3 domain upon interaction with binding partners such as BCL-2 pro-survival proteins is likely induced rather than pre-existing.",

MalZ is a highly aggregation prone protein and molecular chaperonins GroEL and GroES assist in the folding of this protein to a substantial level. The N-terminal region of this enzyme appears to be a unique domain as seen in sequence comparison studies with other amylases as well as through homology modelling. The sequence and homology model analysis show a probability of disorder in the N-Terminal region of MalZ. The crystal structure of this enzyme has been reported in the present communication. Based on the crystallographic structure, it has been interpreted that the N-terminal region of the enzyme (Met1\u2013Phe131) might be unstructured or flexible. To understand the role of the N-terminal region of MalZ in its enzymatic activity, and overall stability, a truncated version (Ala111-His616) of MalZ was created. The truncated version failed to fold into an active enzyme both in E. coli cytosol and in vitro even with the assistance of chaperonins GroEL and GroES. Furthermore, the refolding effort of N-truncated MalZ in the presence of isolated N-terminal domain didn't succeed. Our studies suggest that while the structural rigidity or orientation of the N-terminal region of the MalZ protein may not be essential for its stability and function, but the said domain is likely to play an important role in the formation of the native structure of the protein when present as an integral part of the protein.",

Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites primarily consist of fibrillated \u03b1-Synuclein; yet, there is no treatment available targeting stabilization of \u03b1-Synuclein in its native state. The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory activity of an ethanolic extract of Geum urbanum against \u03b1-Synuclein fibrillation and examine the structural changes of \u03b1-Synuclein in the presence of the extract. The anti-fibrillation and anti-aggregation activities of the plant extract were monitored by thioflavin T fibrillation assays and size exclusion chromatography, while structural changes were followed by circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, intrinsic fluorescence, small angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy. Since the extract is a complex mixture, structure-function relationships could not be determined. Under the experimental conditions investigated, Geum urbanum was found to inhibit \u03b1-Synuclein fibrillation in a concentration dependent way, and to partly disintegrate preformed \u03b1-Synuclein fibrils. Based on the structural changes of \u03b1-Synuclein in the presence of extract, we propose that Geum urbanum delays \u03b1-Synuclein fibrillation either by reducing the fibrillation ability of one or more of the aggregation prone intermediates or by directing \u03b1-Synuclein aggregation towards a non-fibrillar state.

Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed to decipher the role of the active site arginine-292.Ar-BVMO was found to oxidize ethionamide as well as linear ketones. Mechanistic studies on the wild type enzyme using stopped-flow spectroscopy allowed for the detection of the characteristic oxygenating C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate, which decayed rapidly in the presence of the substrate. Replacement of arginine 292 in Ar-BVMO by glycine or alanine resulted in greatly reduced or no Baeyer-Villiger activity, respectively, demonstrating the crucial role of this residue in catalysis of ketone substrates. However, both the R292A and R292G mutants are capable of carrying out N- and S-oxidation reactions.Substrate profiling of Ar-BVMO confirms its close relationship to EtaA; ethionamide is one of its substrates. The active site Arginine 292 is required for its Baeyer-Villiger activity but not for heteroatom oxidation.A single mutation converts Ar-BVMO to a unique S- or N-monooxygenase, a useful biocatalyst for the production of oxidized metabolites of human drug metabolizing enzymes.",

Thus, it is critical to characterize disulfide bonds to ensure the quality and function of protein pharmaceuticals. There are, however, problems associated with maintaining disulfide linkages in the conventional procedures that are used to digest a protein. In order to preserve enzyme activity during the digestion of a protein, it is commonly carried out at neutral to basic environment which increases the possibilities of disulfide bond scrambling. However, it is not easy to differentiate whether the scrambled disulfide linkages are initiated by the sample itself or whether they are induced during the protease digestion process. In this study, the optimum pH for minimizing disulfide bond rearrangements during the digestion process was determined. Three sets of proteases, trypsin plus Glu-C, Lys-C and thermolysin were used, followed by dimethyl labeling and mass spectrometry for a bevacizumab (Avastin) disulfide linkage analysis. No disulfide linkage scrambling was detected at pH\u00a06 when Lys-C or trypsin plus Glu-C were used as enzymes. When thermolysin was applied, some scrambled disulfide bonds were identified at pH\u00a05, 6 and 7. Nevertheless, there was less disulfide bond scrambling at a lower pH. All correct disulfide bonds on bevacizumab could be identified using this approach. The results demonstrated that by choosing the proper enzymes, using a lower pH environment for the digestion could reduce the degree of artifact disulfide scrambling.",

Mutations in peroxisomal alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (hAGT1) cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), which results in glyoxylate accumulation that is converted to toxic oxalate. In contrast, glyoxylate is used by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans through a glyoxylate cycle to by-pass the decarboxylation steps of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and thus contributing to energy production and gluconeogenesis from stored lipids. To investigate the differences in glyoxylate metabolism between humans and C. elegans and to determine whether the nematode might be a suitable model for PH1, we have characterized here the predicted nematode ortholog of hAGT1 (AGXT-1) and compared its molecular properties with those of the human enzyme. Both enzymes form active PLP-dependent dimers with high specificity towards alanine and glyoxylate, and display similar three-dimensional structures. Interestingly, AGXT-1 shows 5-fold higher activity towards the alanine/glyoxylate pair than hAGT1. Thermal and chemical stability of AGXT-1 is lower than that of hAGT1, suggesting temperature-adaptation of the nematode enzyme linked to the lower optimal growth temperature of C. elegans. Remarkably, in vivo experiments demonstrate the mitochondrial localization of AGXT-1 in contrast to the peroxisomal compartmentalization of hAGT1. Our results support the view that the different glyoxylate metabolism in the nematode is associated with the divergent molecular properties and subcellular localization of the alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase activity.",

The alpha-helical conformation of the proteins in the membrane-bound state is assessed by circular dichroism thermal scans. wt and mutated aSN upon binding to fluid DMPG vesicles progressively increase chain order. Lipid:protein molar binding stoichiometries correspond to 50 for A30P, 35\u201336 for aSN and A53T, 30 for E46K. The temperature range over which the variants assume the \u03b1-helical fold correlates directly with the density of proteins on vesicle surfaces. All variants preserve the characteristic chain flexibility gradient and impart motional restriction in the lipid chain. This is evident at the first CH2 segments and is markedly reduced at the chain termini, disappearing completely for A30P. The proteins slightly reduce DMPG main transition temperature, revealing preferential affinity for the fluid phase, and broaden the transition, promoting gel-fluid phase coexistence. The overall results are consistent with protein surface association in which the degree of binding correlates with the degree of folding and perturbation of the membrane bilayer.

     "abstract": "A controversy exists with respect to the mechanism of l-2-hydroxy acid oxidation by members of a family of FMN-dependent enzymes. A so-called carbanion mechanism was initially proposed, in which the active site histidine abstracts the substrate \u03b1-hydrogen as a proton, followed by electron transfer from the carbanion to the flavin. But an alternative mechanism was not incompatible with some results, a mechanism in which the active site histidine instead picks up the substrate hydroxyl proton and a hydride transfer occurs. Even though more recent experiments ruling out such a mechanism were published (Rao & Lederer (1999) Protein Science 7, 1531\u20131537), a few authors have subsequently interpreted their results with variant enzymes in terms of a hydride transfer. In the present work, we analyse the reactivity of trifluorolactate, a substrate analogue, with the flavocytochrome b2 (Fcb2) flavodehydrogenase domain, compared to its reactivity with an NAD-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), for which this compound is known to be an inhibitor (Pogolotti & Rupley (1973) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun, 55, 1214\u20131219). Indeed, electron attraction by the three fluorine atoms should make difficult the removal of the \u03b1-H as a hydride. We also analyse the reactivity of trifluoropyruvate with the FMN- and NAD-dependent enzymes. The results substantiate a different effect of the fluorine substituents on the two enzymes compared to their normal substrates. In the discussion we analyse the conclusions of recent papers advocating a hydride transfer mechanism for the family of l-2-hydroxy acid oxidizing FMN-dependent enzymes.",

Cluster analysis of canola cultivars based on a stress tolerance index of several morphological parameters was used to confirm that Sarigol and Hyola308 were salt-sensitive and -tolerant cultivars, respectively. Using a gel-free proteomic technique, 154 and 94 proteins in Hyola308 and 100 and 144 proteins in Sarigol were uniquely identified in non-inoculated and bacterial-inoculated cultivars, respectively. By PEG fractionation, a total of 132 and 207 proteins were identified in non-inoculated and inoculated Hyola308, respectively. Notably, the abundance of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase 1 was significantly increased in inoculated Hyola308 under severe salt stress and decreased under moderate salt stress. In addition, the enzyme activity of delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase was significantly increased non-inoculated Hyola308 and the activity of succinate dehydrogenase was increased in inoculated Hyola308 leaves exposed to salt stress. Taken together, these results suggest that the bacterial inoculation of canola increases salt tolerance by inducing an increase in the abundance of proteins related to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism.",

     "abstract": "We tested whether model peptides for group 3 late embryogenesis abundant (G3LEA) proteins, which we developed previously, are capable of maintaining the catalytic activities of enzymes dried in their presence. Three different peptides were compared: 1) PvLEA-22, which consists of two tandem repeats of the 11-mer motif found in G3LEA proteins from an African sleeping chironomid; 2) PvLEA-44, which is made of four tandem repeats of the same 11-mer motif; and 3) a peptide whose amino acid composition is the same as that of PvLEA-22, but whose sequence is scrambled. We selected two enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and \u03b2-d-galactosidase (BDG), as targets because they have different isoelectric point (pI) values, in the alkaline and acidic range, respectively. While these enzymes were almost inactivated when dried alone, their catalytic activity was preserved at \u2265\u00a070% of native levels in the presence of any of the above three peptides. This degree of protection is comparable to that conferred by several full-length G3LEA proteins, as reported previously for LDH. Interestingly, the protective activity of the peptides was enhanced slightly when they were mixed with trehalose, especially when the molar content of the peptides was low. On the basis of these results, the G3LEA model peptides show promise as protectants for the dry preservation of enzymes/proteins with a wide range of pI values.",

     "abstract": "In the search for proteins reactive to apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, it has been earlier found that proteins of human cell extracts formed the Schiff-base-dependent covalent adduct with an apparent molecular mass of 100\u00a0kDa with a partial DNA duplex containing an AP site and 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-protruding ends (DDE-AP DNA). The adduct of such electrophoretic mobility was characteristic of only DDE-AP DNA (Ilina et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1784 (2008) 1777\u20131785). The protein in this unusual adduct was identified as the Ku80 subunit of Ku antigen by peptide mass mapping based on MALDI-TOF MS data (Kosova et al., Biopolym. Cell 30 (2014) 42\u201346). Here we studied the interaction of Ku with DDE-AP DNA in details. Purified Ku (the Ku80 subunit) was shown to form the 100-kDa adduct highly specific for AP DNA with a certain length of protruding ends, base opposite the AP site and AP site location. Ku is capable of AP site cleavage in DDE-AP DNA unlike in analogous AP DNA with blunt ends. Ku cleaves AP sites via \u03b2-elimination and prefers apurinic sites over apyrimidinic ones. The AP site in DDE-DNA can be repaired in an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-independent manner via the successive action of Ku (cleavage of the AP site), tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (removal of the 3\u02b9-deoxyribose residue), polynucleotide kinase 3\u02b9-phosphatase (removal of the 3\u02b9-phosphate), DNA polymerase \u03b2 (incorporation of dNMP), and DNA ligase (sealing the nick).

However, despite the presence of putative chitinase genes in its genome, T. fusca has not been reported to grow on chitin as sole carbon source. In this study, a gene encoding a putative membrane-anchored GH18 chitinase (Tfu0868) from T. fusca has been cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was produced as SUMO fusion protein and, upon removal of the SUMO domain, soluble pure TfChi18A was obtained with yields typically amounting to 150\u00a0mg per litre of culture. The enzyme was found to be relatively thermostable (apparent Tm\u00a0=\u00a057.5\u00a0\u00b0C) but not particularly thermoactive, the optimum temperature being 40\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C. TfChi18A bound to \u03b1- and \u03b2-chitin and degraded both these substrates. Interestingly, activity towards colloidal chitin was minimal and in this case, substrate inhibition was observed. TfChi18A also cleaved soluble chito-oligosaccharides and showed a clear preference for substrates having five sugars or more. While these results show that TfChi18A is a catalytically competent GH18 chitinase, the observed catalytic rates were low compared to those of well-studied GH18 chitinases. This suggests that TfChi18A is not a true chitinase and not likely to endow T. fusca with the ability to grow on chitin.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress and the formation of amyloid plaques containing amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides are two key hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. A proportion of methionine (Met) at position 35 within A\u03b2 is oxidized to methionine sulphoxide (MetOX) within the Alzheimer's plaques. These oxidative processes may be the key to understanding the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. In vitro oxidation of A\u03b2, by the physiological oxidant H2O2, was monitored using 1H NMR and mass spectrometry. Here we investigate the effect of A\u03b2 methionine oxidation on fiber formation kinetics and morphology using the amyloid specific fluorescence dye Thioflavin T (ThT) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Methionine oxidation reduces the total amount of fibers generated for both dominant forms of A\u03b2, however there are marked differences in the effect of MetOX between A\u03b2(1\u201340) and A\u03b2(1\u201342). Surprisingly the presence of MetOX reduces lag-times for A\u03b2(1\u201340) fiber formation but extends lag-times for A\u03b2(1\u201342). TEM indicates a change in fiber morphology with a pronounced reduction in fiber length for both methionine oxidized A\u03b2(1\u201340) and A\u03b2(1\u201342). In contrast, the morphology of preformed amyloid fibers is largely unaffected by the presence of H2O2. Our studies suggest that methionine oxidation promotes highly fragmented fiber assemblies of A\u03b2. Oxidative stress associated with Alzheimer's disease can cause oxidation of methionine within A\u03b2 and this in turn will influence the complex assembly of A\u03b2 monomer into amyloid fibers, which is likely to impact A\u03b2 toxicity.",

In this study, we used a combination of techniques (immunoprecipitation, in-solution trypsin digestion, and LC\u2013MS/MS) to identify the host cell proteins that interact with cell-associated NS1 in an in vitro model of DENV infection in the human hepatocyte HepG2 cell line. Thirty-six novel host cell proteins were identified as potential DENV NS1-interacting partners.

Two main approaches are generally used: the first is based on spectral data generated during the process of identification (e.g. peptide counting, spectral counting), while the second makes use of extracted ion currents to quantify chromatographic peaks and infer protein abundances based on peptide quantification. These two approaches actually refer to multiple methods which have been developed during the last decade, but were submitted to deep evaluations only recently. In this paper, we compiled these different methods as exhaustively as possible. We also summarized the way they address the different problems raised by bottom-up protein quantification such as normalization, the presence of shared peptides, unequal peptide measurability and missing data.

     "abstract": "Although major advances have been made during the past 20\u00a0years in our understanding of the genetic and genomic consequences of polyploidy, our knowledge of polyploidy and the proteome is in its infancy. One of our goals is to stimulate additional study, particularly broad-scale proteomic analyses of polyploids and their progenitors. Although it may be too early to generalize regarding the extent to which transcriptomic data are predictive of the proteome of polyploids, it is clear that the proteome does not always reflect the transcriptome. Despite limited data, important observations on the proteomes of polyploids are emerging. In some cases, proteomic profiles show qualitatively and/or quantitatively non-additive patterns, and proteomic novelty has been observed. Allopolyploids generally combine the parental contributions, but there is evidence of parental dominance of one contributing genome in some allopolyploids. Autopolyploids are typically qualitatively identical to but quantitatively different from their parents. There is also evidence of parental legacy at the proteomic level. Proteomes clearly provide insights into the consequences of genomic merger and doubling beyond what is obtained from genomic and/or transcriptomic data. Translating proteomic changes in polyploids to differences in morphology and physiology remains the holy grail of polyploidy \u2014 this daunting task of linking genotype to proteome to phenotype should emerge as a focus of polyploidy research in the next decade.

Despite extensive investigation of heterosis and its wide application in crops such as maize, rice, wheat and sorghum, its molecular basis is still enigmatic. In the past century, some pioneers have proposed multigene models referring to the complementation of allelic and gene expression variation, which is likely to be an important contributor to heterosis. In addition, there are potential interactions of epigenetic variation involved in heterosis via novel mechanisms. At the level of gene expression, many recent studies have revealed that the heterosis phenomenon can be deciphered not only at the transcriptional level but also at the proteomic level. This review presents an update on the information supporting the involvement of proteomic patterns in heterosis and a possible future direction of the field.

Recently, developments in analytical techniques, e.g. mass spectrometry, have led to great advances towards understanding how plants respond to environmental stresses. These processes are mediated by many molecular pathways and, at least partially, via proteome-environment interactions.This review focuses on the current state of knowledge about interactions between the plant proteome and the environment, with a special focus on drought and temperature responses of plant proteome dynamics, and subcellular and organ-specific compartmentalization, in Arabidopsis thaliana and crop species.Correct plant development under non-optimal conditions requires complex self-protection mechanisms, many of them common to different abiotic stresses. Proteome analyses of plant responses to temperature and drought stresses have revealed an intriguing interplay of modifications, mainly affecting the photosynthetic machinery, carbohydrate metabolism, and ROS activation and scavenging. Imbalances between transcript-level and protein-level regulation observed during adaptation to abiotic stresses suggest that many of the regulatory processes are controlled at translational and post-translational levels; proteomics is thus essential in revealing important regulatory networks.Because information from proteomic data extends far beyond what can be deduced from transcriptome analysis, the results of proteome studies have substantially deepened our understanding of stress adaptation in plants; this is clearly a prerequisite for designing strategies to improve the yield and quality of crops grown under unfavorable conditions brought about by ongoing climatic change.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Plant Proteomics \u2014 a bridge between fundamental processes and crop production, edited by Dr. Hans-Peter Mock.",

The use of proteomic techniques is an effective approach to investigate and identify the biological mechanisms and pathways affected by heavy metals and metal-containing nanoparticles. The present review focuses on recent advances and summarizes the results from proteomic studies aimed at understanding the response mechanisms of plants under heavy metal and metal-containing nanoparticle stress. Transport of heavy metal ions is regulated through the cell wall and plasma membrane and then sequestered in the vacuole. In addition, the role of different metal chelators involved in the detoxification and sequestration of heavy metals is critically reviewed, and changes in protein profiles of plants exposed to metal-containing nanoparticles are discussed in detail. Finally, strategies for gaining new insights into plant tolerance mechanisms to heavy metal and metal-containing nanoparticle stress are presented.

Since the rise of proteomics technologies at the beginning of the 2000's, the knowledge of CWPs has greatly increased leading to the discovery of new CWP families and to the description of the cell wall proteomes of different organs of many plants. Conversely, cell wall peptidomics data are still lacking. In addition to the identification of CWPs and peptides by mass spectrometry (MS) and bioinformatics, proteomics has allowed to describe their post-translational modifications (PTMs). At present, the best known PTMs consist in proteolytic cleavage, N-glycosylation, hydroxylation of P residues into hydroxyproline residues (O), O-glycosylation and glypiation. In this review, the methods allowing the capture of the modified proteins based on the specific properties of their PTMs as well as the MS technologies used for their characterization are briefly described.

Inter-species comparisons indicate that all these fluids contain the protein machinery for self-maintenance and defense, including proteins related to cell wall metabolism, pathogen defense, proteolysis, and redox response. These analyses also revealed that proteins may play more relevant roles in signaling in the phloem sap and apoplastic fluid than in the xylem sap. A comparison of the proteomes of the three fluids indicates that although functional categories are somewhat similar, proteins involved are likely to be fluid-specific, except for a small group of proteins present in the three fluids, which may have a universal role, especially in cell wall maintenance and defense.

A lot of time and effort has been invested in attempting to comprehend their complex signaling pathways but despite success in elucidating some key components, molecular mechanisms in the transduction pathways are far from being resolved. The last decade has seen a boom in the analysis of phytohormone-responsive proteins. Abscisic acid, auxin, brassinosteroids, cytokinin, ethylene, gibberellins, nitric oxide, oxylipins, strigolactones, salicylic acid \u2014 all have been analyzed to various degrees. For this review, we collected data from proteome-wide analyses resulting in a list of over 2000 annotated proteins from Arabidopsis proteomics and nearly 500 manually filtered protein families merged from all the data available from different species. We present the currently accepted model of phytohormone signaling, highlight the contributions made by proteomic-based research and describe the key nodes in phytohormone signaling networks, as revealed by proteome analysis. These include ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation, calcium ion signaling, redox homeostasis, and phosphoproteome dynamics. Finally, we discuss potential pitfalls and future perspectives in the field.

Here we present a comprehensive analysis of the protein compositions obtained from two proteomic studies of TAC fractions isolated from Arabidopsis/mustard and spinach chloroplasts, respectively, as well as nucleoid fractions from Arabidopsis, maize and pea. Interestingly, different approaches as well as the use of diverse starting materials resulted in the detection of varying protein catalogues with a number of shared proteins. Possible reasons for the discrepancies between the protein repertoires and for missing out some of the nucleoid proteins that have been identified previously by other means than mass spectrometry as well as the repeated identification of \u201cunexpected\u201d proteins indicating potential links between DNA/RNA-associated nucleoid core functions and energy metabolism as well as biosynthetic activities of plastids will be discussed.

Terpenoids can be produced both constitutively and in response to the environment. At the front line of this defense strategy are the glandular trichomes, which are organs dedicated primarily to the production of specialized metabolites. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a powerful tool, which is very useful to investigate enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as the synthesis and secretion of terpenoids in glandular trichomes. Here we review the strategies used to investigate the specific roles of these particular organs from non-model plant species, mainly belonging to the Lamiaceae, Solanaceae, and Cannabaceae families. We discuss how proteomics helps to accurately pinpoint candidate proteins to be functionally characterized, and how technological progresses create opportunities for studying low-abundance proteins, such as the ones related to the synthesis and transport of specialized metabolites.

Not only does the flower contain critical reproductive organs, but the wide variation in morphology, color, and scent has evolved to entice specialized pollinators, and arguably mankind in many cases, to ensure the successful propagation of its species. Recent proteomic approaches have identified protein candidates related to these flower traits, which has shed light on a number of previously unknown mechanisms underlying these traits. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in proteomic research in floral biology according to the order of flower structure, from corolla to male and female reproductive organs. It summarizes mainstream proteomic methods for plant research and recent improvements on two dimensional gel electrophoresis and gel-free workflows for both peptide level and protein level analysis. The recent advances in sequencing technologies provide a new paradigm for the ever-increasing genome and transcriptome information on many organisms. It is now possible to integrate genomic and transcriptomic data with proteomic results for large-scale protein characterization, so that a global understanding of the complex molecular networks in flower biology can be readily achieved.

Cold-adapted alkaline phosphatase variants have high activity at low temperatures and lower thermal stability compared with variants from mesophilic hosts. The instability, and thus inactivation, could be due to loose association of the dimers and/or loosely bound Mg2+ in the active site, but this has not been studied in detail for the cold-adapted variants. Here, we focus on using the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp in alkaline phosphatase from the marine bacterium Vibrio splendidus (VAP) to probe for dimerization. Trp\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Phe substitutions showed that two out of the five native Trp residues contributed mostly to the fluorescence emission. One residue, 15\u00a0\u00c5 away from the active site (W460) and highly solvent excluded, was phosphorescent and had a distant role in substrate binding. An additional Trp residue was introduced to the dimer interface to act as a possible probe for dimerization. Urea denaturation curves indicated that an inactive dimer intermediate, structurally equivalent to the native state, was formed before dimer dissociation took place. This is the first example of the transition of a native dimer to an inactive dimer intermediate for alkaline phosphatase without using mutagenesis, ligands, or competitive inhibition.",

In the present study we provide insights on the possible role that the dietary flavonoid (\u2212)-epicatechin plays on \u03b2-lactoglobulin fibril formation. Fibril formation is induced by keeping \u03b2-lactoglobulin solutions at pH\u00a02.0 and at a temperature of 80\u00a0\u00b0C for 24\u00a0h. Atomic Force Microscopy measurements suggest that, by adding (\u2212)-epicatechin in the solution, fibrils density is visibly lowered. This last observation is confirmed by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy experiments. With the use of Fourier Transform IR spectroscopy we monitored the relative abundances of the secondary structures components during the heating process. We observed that in the presence of (\u2212)-epicatechin the spectral-weight exchange between different secondary structures is partially inhibited. Molecular Dynamics simulations have been able to provide an atomistic explanation of this experimental observation, showing that (\u2212)-epicatechin interacts with \u03b2-lactoglobulin mainly via the residues that, normally in the absence of (\u2212)-epicatechin, are involved in \u03b2-sheet formation. Unveiling this molecular mechanism is an important step in the process of identifying suitable molecules apt at finely tuning fibril formation like it is desirable to do in food industry applications.",

So far, several structures have been solved to decipher the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.To address catalytic and inhibitory mechanisms of PPAT, structural insights from single crystal X-ray diffraction method were primarily used, followed by biophysical and biochemical analysis.We have solved the structures of PPAT from Pseudomonas aeruginosa with its substrate analogue AMP-PNP and inhibitor CoA. For the first time, a co-crystal structure of PPAT with Acetyl\u2010CoA (AcCoA) was determined. Enzymatic analysis was performed to decipher the catalytic, allosteric and inhibitory mechanisms involved in regulation of PPAT. Binding affinities of PPAT with its substrates and inhibitors were determined by SPR.Previous studies from Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis indicated the inhibitory activity of AcCoA. PPAT\u2010AcCoA structure along with some biochemical methods established AcCoA as an inhibitor to PPAT and illustrated its inhibitory mechanism. Transition from catalytic to allosteric state involves formation of ternary complex. We have studied the structural features of the ternary complex of PPAT along with its product pyrophosphate and inhibitor CoA and validated it with other biophysical and biochemical methods. Extensive analysis of all these 3D structures indicates that changes in side chains R90 and D94 are responsible for transition between catalytic and allosteric inhibitory states.These enzymatic studies provide new insights into the allosteric mechanism of PPAT.",

After fourteen days, the cornea from one eye was collected for histological staining for CNV examination, while the cornea from the other eye of the same mouse was harvested for proteomic analysis. The label-free quantitative proteomic approach was applied to analyze five normal corneal tissues (normal group mice n\u00a0=\u00a05) and five corresponding neovascularized corneal tissues (model group mice n\u00a0=\u00a05). A total of 2124 proteins were identified, and 1682 proteins were quantified from these corneal tissues. Among these quantified proteins, 290 proteins were significantly changed between normal and alkali burned corneal tissues. Of these significantly changed proteins, 35 were reported or predicted as angiogenesis-related proteins. Then, these 35 proteins were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software, resulting in 26 proteins enriched and connected to each other in the protein-protein interaction network, such as Lcn-2, \u03b1B-crystallin and Serpinf1 (PEDF). These three significantly changed proteins were selected for further Western blotting validation. Consistent with the quantitative proteomic results, Western blotting showed that Lcn-2 and \u03b1B-crystallin were significantly up-regulated in CNV model, while PEDF was down-regulated.

We scrutinized each step of amyloid progression of full length bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) and compared it with the amyloidogenic process of its critical peptide stretch 201\u2013227 (PepB). We found that under similar solution conditions amyloidogenesis of BCA followed surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation, whereas, that of PepB followed classical nucleation-dependent pathway. AFM images showed that while BCA formed short, thick and branched fibrils, PepB formed thin, long and unbranched fibrils. Structural information obtained by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy suggested parallel arrangement of intermolecular \u03b2-sheet in BCA amyloids in contrast to PepB amyloids which arranged into antiparallel \u03b2 sheets. Amyloids formed by BCA were unable to seed the fibrillation of PepB and vice versa. Even the intermediates formed during lag phase revealed contrasting FTIR and far UV CD signature, hydrophobicity, morphology and cell cytotoxicity. Thus, we propose that sequences other than critical amyloidogenic stretches may significantly influence the initiation, polymerization and final fibrillar morphology of amyloid forming protein. The results have been discussed in light of primary sequence mediated amyloid polymorphism and its importance in the rational design of amyloid nanomaterials possessing desired physico-chemical properties.",

     "abstract": "The Arginine Binding Protein isolated from Thermotoga maritima (TmArgBP) is a protein endowed with several peculiar properties. We have previously shown that TmArgBP dimerization is a consequence of the swapping of the C-terminal helix. Here we explored the structural determinants of TmArgBP domain swapping and oligomerization. In particular, we report a mutational analysis of the residue Pro235, which is located in the hinge region of the swapping dimer. This residue was either replaced with a Gly-Lys dipeptide (TmArgBPP235GK) or a Gly residue (TmArgBPP235G).Different forms of these mutants were generated and extensively characterized using biophysical techniques.For both TmArgBPP235GK and TmArgBPP235G mutants, the occurrence of multiple oligomerization states (monomers, dimers and trimers) was detected. The formation of well-folded monomeric forms for these mutants indicates that the dimerization through C-terminal domain swapping observed in wild-type TmArgBP is driven by conformational restraints imposed by the presence of Pro235 in the hinge region. Molecular dynamics studies corroborate this observation by showing that Gly235 assumes conformational states forbidden for Pro residues in the TmArgBPP235G monomer. Unexpectedly, the trimeric forms present: (a) peculiar circular dichroism spectra, (b) a great susceptibility to heating, and (c) the ability to bind the Thioflavin T dye.The present findings clearly demonstrate that single-point mutations have an important impact on the TmArgBP oligomerization process.

     "abstract": "The evolution of cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) from land to water is one of the most spectacular events in mammal evolution. It has been suggested that selection for higher myoglobin stability (\u2206\u00a0G of folding) allowed whales to conquer the deep-diving niche. The stability of multi-site protein variants, including ancient proteins, is however hard to describe theoretically. From a compilation of experimental \u2206\u2206G vs. \u2206G we first find that protein substitutions are subject to large generic protein relaxation effects. Using this discovery, we develop a simple two-parameter model that predicts multi-site \u2206\u2206\u00a0G as accurately as standard methods do for single-site mutations and reproduces trends in contemporary myoglobin stabilities. We then apply this new method to the study of the evolution of Mb stability in cetaceans: With both methods the main change in stability (about 1\u00a0kcal/mol) occurred very early, and stability was later relaxed in dolphins and porpoises, but was further increased in the sperm whales. This suggests that single proteins can affect whole organism evolution and indicates a role of Mb stability in the evolution of cetaceans. Transition to the deep-diving niche probably occurred already in the ancestor of contemporary baleen and toothed whales. In summary, we have discovered generic stability relaxation effects in proteins that, when incorporated into a simple model, improves the description of multi-site protein variants.",

Fluorescence quenching experiments showed that the accessibility of the actin bound \u03b5-ATP decreased in the presence of twinfilin-1. Temperature dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer and differential scanning calorimetry experiments revealed that the protein matrix of actin becomes more rigid and more heat resistant in the presence of twinfilin-1. The results suggest that the nucleotide binding cleft shifted into a more closed and stable conformational state of actin in the presence of twinfilin-1.",

     "abstract": "\u03b1-Lactalbumin (aLA) has been shown to form complexes with oleic acid (OA), which may target cancer cells. We recently showed that aLA and several other proteins all form protein\u2013OA complexes called liprotides with a generic structure consisting of a micellar OA core surrounded by a shell of partially denatured protein. Here we report that a heat treatment and an alkaline treatment method both allow us to prepare liprotide complexes composed of aLA and a range of unsaturated fatty acids (FA), provided the FAs contain cis (but not trans) double bonds. All liprotides containing cis-FA form both small and large species, which all consist of partially denatured aLA, though the overall shape of the species differs. Small liprotides have a simple core\u2013shell structure while the larger liprotides are multi-layered, i.e. they have an additional layer of both FA and aLA surrounding the outside of the core\u2013shell structure. All liprotides can transfer their entire FA content to vesicles, releasing aLA as monomers and softening the lipid membrane. The more similar to OA, the more efficiently the different FAs induce hemolysis. We conclude that aLA can take up and transfer a wide variety of FA to membranes, provided they contain a cis-bond. This highlights liprotides as a general class of complexes where both protein and cis-FA component can be varied without departing from a generic (though sometimes multi-layered) core\u2013shell structure.",

Methods of improving silk production by chemical approaches have reached saturation and transgenic methods are needed in further to boost silk production. An understanding of proteomic changes during silk gland development helps in designing experiments to enhance silk production by transgenic approaches. The present study reports comprehensive developmental proteomic analysis of CSR2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0CSR4, 5th instar whole silk glands. Eighty six unique protein IDs were obtained from the analysis of one hundred and twenty protein spots. Among the identified proteins, majority of the proteins were involved in metabolism (41%) followed by proteins involved in protein homeostasis (30%). Sixty percent of the identified proteins showed dynamic nature by expression analysis from day 1, day 3, day 5 and day 7 gels. In comparison to the published data till now on silk gland proteomics this study reports identification of 20 new proteins from the silk glands for the first time.The paper reports for the first time proteomic analysis of high yielding silkworm strain of India. The study analyzes whole silk glands to understand the tissue in total during 5th instar development. Lowering fibroin content made us to identify a large number of new proteins which were not reported till now in the silk gland proteome. Proteins which are involved in silk synthesis and release were found to be developmentally regulated. The study identified alanine, serine and glycine tRNA ligases for the first time and also showed their up-regulation on day 7 of 5th instar larval stage. The amino acid repeat of fibroin protein is enriched with the three amino acids, glycine, serine and alanine. The identified proteins could be studied further to understand their functional role in-depth.",

Curvularia pallescens (CP) being a dominant aerospore in India and a major sensitiser on a wide range of allergic population, pose a serious threat to human health. Therefore, we aimed to identify novel allergens from CP in our present study. A cohort of 22 CP-sensitised patients was selected by positive Skin prick grade. Individual sera exhibited elevated specific IgE level and significant histamine release on a challenge with antigenic extract of CP. First gel-based profiling of CP proteome was done by 1- and 2-dimensional gel. Parallel 1- and 2-dimensional immunoblot were performed applying individual as well as pooled patient sera. Identification of the sero-reactive spots from the 2-dimensional gel was found to be challenging as CP was not previously sequenced. Hence, mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflow consisting of conventional database search was not alone sufficient. Therefore, de novo sequencing preceded homology search was implemented for further identification. Altogether 11 allergenic proteins including Brn-1, vacuolar protease, and fructose-bis-phosphate aldolase were identified with high statistical confidence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This is the first study to report on any allergens from CP. This kind of proteome-based analysis provided a catalogue of CP allergens that would lead an improved way of diagnosis and therapy of CP-related allergy.",

Biosynthesis of this vinyl substituted pyrroline carboxylic acid intermediate requires a short, three-enzyme pathway containing two metalloenzymes: a heme-dependent l-tyrosine hydroxylase and a non-heme Fe2\u00a0+ dependent l-DOPA dioxygenase. The l-tyrosine hydroxylase is an unprecedented type of peroxidase that specifically monohydroxylates tyrosine, while the l-DOPA extradiol cleaving enzyme is a single-domain vicinal-oxygen-chelate (VOC) dioxygenase. The dioxygenase product subsequently undergoes an, as yet uncharacterized, C\u2013C bond cleavage reaction.

     "abstract": "Classical tetracyclines targeting the protein biosynthesis machinery are commonly applied in human and veterinary medicine. The development and spread of resistance seriously compromise the successful treatment of bacterial infections. The atypical tetracycline chelocardin holds promise as it retains activity against tetracycline-resistant strains. It has been suggested that chelocardin targets the bacterial membrane, thus differing in mode of action from that of classical tetracyclines. We investigated the mechanism of action of chelocardin using global proteome analysis. The proteome profiles after sublethal chelocardin stress were compared to a reference compendium containing antibiotic response profiles of Bacillus subtilis. This approach revealed a concentration-dependent dual mechanism of action. At low concentrations, like classical tetracyclines, chelocardin induces the proteomic signature for peptidyl transferase inhibition demonstrating that protein biosynthesis inhibition is the dominant physiological challenge. At higher concentrations B. subtilis mainly responds to membrane stress indicating that at clinically relevant concentrations the membrane is the main antibiotic target of chelocardin. Studying the effects on the membrane in more detail, we found that chelocardin causes membrane depolarization but does not lead to formation of large pores. We conclude that at growth inhibiting doses chelocardin not only targets protein biosynthesis but also corrupts the integrity of the bacterial membrane. This dual mechanism of action might prove beneficial in slowing the development of new resistance mechanisms against this atypical tetracycline.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase from Trypanosoma cruzi (TcHPRT) is a critical enzyme for the survival of the parasite. This work demonstrates that the full-length form in solution adopts a stable and enzymatically active tetrameric form, exhibiting large inter-subunit surfaces. Although this protein irreversibly aggregates during unfolding, oligomerization is reversible and can be modulated by low concentrations of urea. When the C-terminal region, which is predicted as a disordered stretch, is excised by proteolysis, TcHPRT adopts a dimeric state, suggesting that the C-terminal region acts as a main guide for the quaternary arrangement. These results are in agreement with X-ray crystallographic data presented in this work. On the other hand, the C-terminal region exhibits a modulatory role on the enzyme, as attested by the enhanced activity observed for the dimeric form. Bisphosphonates act as substrate-mimetics, uncovering long-range communications among the active sites. All in all, this work contributes to establish new ways applicable to the design of novel inhibitors that could eventually result in new drugs against parasitic diseases.",

     "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP199A4 can efficiently demethylate 4-methoxybenzoic acid. The substrate is positioned in the enzyme active site with the methoxy group ideally positioned for demethylation. This occurs through interactions of hydrophobic benzene ring with aromatic phenylalanine residues and the charged carboxylate group with polar and basic amino acids.In vitro substrate binding and kinetic turnover assays coupled with HPLC and GC\u2013MS analysis and whole-cell oxidation turnovers.Modification of the carboxylate group to an amide or aldehyde resulted in substrate binding, as judged by the almost total shift of the spin state to the high-spin form, but binding was three orders of magnitude weaker. Changing the carboxylate to phenol alcohol, ketone, ester and nitro groups and boronic, sulfinic and sulfonic acids resulted in a dramatic reduction in the binding affinity. Even phenylacetic acids were mediocre substrates for CYP199A4, despite maintaining a carboxylate group. The weaker binding of all of these substrates results in lower levels of turnover activity and product formation compared to 4-methoxybenzoic acid.Substrate binding to CYP199A4 is tightly regulated by interactions between the 4-methoxybenzoic acid and the amino acids in the active site. The benzoic acid carboxylate moiety is critical for optimal substrate binding and turnover activity with CYP199A4.An understanding of how the CYP199A4 enzyme has evolved to be highly selective for para-substituted benzoic acids. This provides valuable insight into how other, as yet structurally uncharacterised, monooxygenase enzymes may bind benzoic acid substrates.",

     "abstract": "We report here a clinical case of a patient with a novel mutation (Arg347\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Gly) in the gene encoding aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) that is associated with AADC deficiency. The variant R347G in the purified recombinant form exhibits, similarly to the pathogenic mutation R347Q previously studied, a 475-fold drop of kcat compared to the wild-type enzyme. In attempting to unravel the reason(s) for this catalytic defect, we have carried out bioinformatics analyses of the crystal structure of AADC-carbidopa complex with the modelled catalytic loop (residues 328\u2013339). Arg347 appears to interact with Phe103, as well as with both Leu333 and Asp345. We have then prepared and characterized the artificial F103L, R347K and D345A mutants. F103L, D345A and R347K exhibit about 13-, 97-, and 345-fold kcat decrease compared to the wild-type AADC, respectively. However, unlike F103L, the R347G, R347K and R347Q mutants as well as the D345A variant appear to be more defective in catalysis than in protein folding. Moreover, the latter mutants, unlike the wild-type protein and the F103L variant, share a peculiar binding mode of dopa methyl ester consisting of formation of a quinonoid intermediate. This finding strongly suggests that their catalytic defects are mainly due to a misplacement of the substrate at the active site. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of the Arg347-Leu333-Asp345 hydrogen-bonds network in the catalysis of AADC and reveal the molecular basis for the pathogenicity of the variants R347. Following the above results, a therapeutic treatment for patients bearing the mutation R347G is proposed.",

Spot matching and quantitative intensity analysis revealed a total 48 protein spots that had significantly differential levels among the three groups. Among these, 46 and 30 protein spots had differential levels in KD group compared to NK and LK groups, respectively. Comparison between LK and NK groups revealed only 10 protein spots that were differentially expressed. All of these differentially expressed proteins were successfully identified by Q-TOF MS and/or MS/MS analyses. The altered levels of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), ezrin, lamin A/C, tubulin, chaperonin-containing TCP1 (CCT1), and calpain 1 were confirmed by Western blot analysis. Global protein network analysis showed three main functional networks, including 1) cell growth and proliferation, 2) cell morphology, cellular assembly and organization, and 3) protein folding in which the altered proteins were involved.

Our goal was to identify the polyproline-rich peptides in CHO-cell derived human BChE tetramers. CHO cell-produced human BChE tetramers were purified from serum-free culture medium. Peptides embedded in the tetramerization domain were released from BChE tetramers by boiling and identified by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 270 proline-rich peptides were sequenced, ranging in size from 6\u201341 residues. The peptides originated from 60 different proteins that reside in multiple cell compartments including the nucleus, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum. No single protein was the source of the polyproline-rich peptides in CHO cell-expressed human BChE tetramers. In contrast, 70% of the tetramer-organizing peptides in plasma-derived BChE tetramers originate from lamellipodin. No protein source was identified for polyproline peptides containing up to 41 consecutive proline residues. In conclusion, the use of polyproline-rich peptides as a tetramerization motif is documented only for the cholinesterases, but is expected to serve other tetrameric proteins as well.

     "abstract": "Despite its critical role in maintaining glucose homeostasis, surprisingly little is known about proinsulin folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study we aimed to understand the chaperones involved in the maturation and degradation of proinsulin. We generated pancreatic beta cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged proinsulin. Several chaperones (including BiP, PDIA6, calnexin, calreticulin, GRP170, Erdj3 and ribophorin II) co-immunoprecipitated with proinsulin suggesting a role for these proteins in folding. To investigate the chaperones responsible for targeting misfolded proinsulin for degradation, we also created a beta cell line expressing FLAG-tagged proinsulin carrying the Akita mutation (Cys96Tyr). All chaperones found to be associated with wild type proinsulin also co-immunoprecipitated with Akita proinsulin. However, one additional protein, namely P58IPK, specifically precipitated with Akita proinsulin and approximately ten fold more PDIA6, but not other PDI family members, was bound to Akita proinsulin. The latter suggests that PDIA6 may act as a key reductase and target misfolded proinsulin to the ER-degradation pathway. The preferential association of PDIA6 to Akita proinsulin was also confirmed in another beta cell line (\u03b2TC-6). Furthermore, for the first time, a physiologically relevant substrate for PDIA6 has been evidenced. Thus, this study has identified several chaperones/foldases that associated with wild type proinsulin and has also provided a comprehensive interactome for Akita misfolded proinsulin.",

The RP contained homologues of 11 of RPN-type and 6 of RPT-type subunits, 2 deubiquitinating enzymes (UCH-14/UBP6 and UCH-L5/UCH37), and thioredoxin. Similar 2D-gel maps of 26S proteasomes purified from uninfected and AcMNPV-infected cells at 48\u00a0hpi confirmed the structural integrity of the 26S proteasome in insect cells during baculovirus infection. However, subtle changes in minor forms of some proteasome subunits were detected. A portion of the \u03b15(zeta) cellular pool that presumably was not associated with the proteasome underwent partial proteolysis at a late stage in infection.",

Ferrous iron and \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent dioxygenases (\u03b1KGDs) are versatile enzymes that use dioxygen as an oxidant to catalyse various reactions via CH bond activation, including hydroxylation, dealkylation, desaturation, epoxidation, epimerisation, halogenation, cyclisation, peroxide formation, and ring expansion/contraction reactions. This review updates the reported \u03b1KGDs that catalyse reactions related to microbial natural product biosynthesis in the past 10\u00a0years. We hope that the versatility of \u03b1KGDs shown here can serve as an inspiration for future engineering and catalyst design, which could provide alternative methods to meet the on-going demand for fine chemicals and pharmaceutics.",

Determining the high-resolution structures of the stable \u201ccore\u201d of this factory was among the major breakthroughs of the past decades, and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2009. Now that the mysteries of the ribosome appear to be more traceable, detailed understanding of the mechanisms that regulate protein synthesis includes not only the well-known steps of initiation, elongation, and termination but also the less comprehended features of the co-translational events associated with the maturation of the nascent chains. The ribosome is a platform for co-translational events affecting the nascent polypeptide, including protein modifications, folding, targeting to various cellular compartments for integration into membrane or translocation, and proteolysis. These events are orchestrated by ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors (RPBs), a group of a dozen or more factors that act as the \u201cwelcoming committee\u201d for the nascent chain as it emerges from the ribosome. In plants these factors have evolved to fit the specificity of different cellular compartments: cytoplasm, mitochondria and chloroplast. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge of these factors and their interaction around the exit tunnel of dedicated ribosomes. Particular attention has been accorded to the plant system, highlighting the similarities and differences with other organisms.",

This family of proteins bears the distinct features of regulation through acetylation/deacetylation, hence named as acetylation lowers binding affinity (Alba). Alba family proteins bind DNA cooperatively with no apparent sequence specificity. Besides DNA, Alba proteins also interact with diverse RNA species and associate with ribonucleo-protein complexes. Initially, Alba proteins were recognized as chromosomal proteins and supposed to be involved in the maintenance of chromatin architecture and transcription repression. However, recent studies have shown increasing evidence of functional plasticity among Alba family of proteins that widely range from genome packaging and organization, transcriptional and translational regulation, RNA metabolism, and development and differentiation processes. In recent years, Alba family proteins have attracted growing interest due to their widespread occurrence in large number of organisms. Presence in multiple copies, functional crosstalk, differential binding affinity, and posttranslational modifications are some of the key factors that might regulate the biological functions of Alba family proteins. In this review article, we present an overview of the Alba family proteins, their salient features and emphasize their functional role in different organisms reported so far.",

Included is a review of advancements in the analytical application of solute partitioning in ATPS over the last two decades, with multiple examples of experimental data providing evidence that phase-forming polymers do not interact with solutes partitioned in ATPS. The partitioning of solutes is governed by the differences in solute interactions with aqueous media in the two phases. Solvent properties of the aqueous media in these two phases may be characterized and manipulated. The solvent interaction analysis (SIA) method, based on the solute partitioning in ATPS, may be used for characterization and analysis of individual proteins and their interactions with different partners. The current state of clinical proteomics regarding the discovery and monitoring of new protein biomarkers is discussed, and it is argued that the protein expression level in a biological fluid may be not the optimal focus of clinical proteomic research. Multiple examples of application of the SIA method for discovery of changes in protein structure and protein\u2013partner interactions in biological fluids are described.

Understanding the molecular basis of phosphorus uptake and utilization in soybean may help to develop phosphorus (P) efficient cultivars. On this purpose, we conducted a comparative proteomic analysis on a high P acquisition soybean cultivar BX10 under low and high P conditions. A total of 61 unique proteins were identified as putative P deficiency responsive proteins. These proteins were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein biosynthesis/processing, energy metabolism, cellular processes, environmental defense/interaction, nucleotide metabolism, signal transduction, secondary metabolism and other metabolism related processes. Several proteins involved in energy metabolism, cellular processes, and protein biosynthesis and processing were found to be up-regulated in both shoots and roots, whereas, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism appeared to be down-regulated. These proteins are potential candidates for improving P acquisition. These findings provide a useful starting point for further research that will provide a more comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms through which soybeans adapt to P deficiency condition.",

     "abstract": "Heterotrimeric G-proteins form a major protein family, which participates in signal transduction. They are composed of three subunits, G\u03b1, G\u03b2 and G\u03b3. The G\u03b1 subunit is further divided in four distinct families Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11 and G12/13. The goal of this work was to detect and classify members of the four distinct families, plus the G\u03b2 and the G\u03b3 subunits of G-proteins from sequence alone. To achieve this purpose, six specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) were built and checked for their credibility. These models were then applied to ten (10) proteomes and were able to identify all known G-protein and classify them into the distinct families. In a separate case study, the models were applied to twenty seven (27) arthropod proteomes and were able to give more credible classification in proteins with uncertain annotation and in some cases to detect novel proteins. An online tool, GprotPRED, was developed that uses these six pHMMs. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the G\u03b2 case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%. In contrast to Pfam's pHMM which detects G\u03b1 subunits in general, our method not only detects G\u03b1 subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate G\u03b1-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes.

     "abstract": "5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent homodimeric enzyme, catalyzes the initial step of heme biosynthesis in non-plant eukaryotes. The precursor form of the enzyme is translated in the cytosol, and upon mitochondrial import, the N-terminal targeting presequence is proteolytically cleaved to generate mature ALAS. In bone marrow-derived erythroid cells, a mitochondrial- and site-specific endoprotease of yet unknown primary structure, produces a protein shorter than mature erythroid ALAS (ALAS2) found in peripheral blood erythroid cells. This truncated ALAS2 lacks the presequence and the N-terminal sequence (corresponding to ~\u00a07 KDa molecular mass) present in ALAS2 from peripheral blood erythroid cells. How the truncation affects the structural topology and catalytic properties of ALAS2 is presently not known. To address this question, we created a recombinant, truncated, murine ALAS2 (\u0394mALAS2) devoid of the cleavable N-terminal region and examined its catalytic and biophysical properties. The N-terminal truncation of mALAS2 did not significantly affect the organization of the secondary structure, but a subtle reduction in the rigidity of the tertiary structure was noted. Furthermore, thermal denaturation studies revealed a decrease of 4.3\u00a0\u00b0C in the Tm value of \u0394mALAS2, implicating lower thermal stability. While the kcat of \u0394mALAS2 is slightly increased over that of the wild-type enzyme, the slowest step in the \u0394mALAS2-catalyzed reaction remains dominated by ALA release. Importantly, intrinsic disorder algorithms imply that the N-terminal region of mALAS2 is highly disordered, and thus susceptible to proteolysis. We propose that the N-terminal truncation offers a cell-specific ALAS2 regulatory mechanism without hindering heme synthesis.",

However, evidence is scarce concerning the direct binding of LL-37 to these receptors and investigations on the associated binding kinetics is lacking. Mac-1, a member of the \u03b22 integrin family, is mainly expressed in myeloid leukocytes. Its critical functions include phagocytosis of complement-opsonized pathogens. Here, we report on interactions of LL-37 and its fragment FK-13 with the ligand-binding domain of Mac-1, the \u03b1-chain I domain. LL-37 bound the I-domain with an affinity comparable to the complement fragment C3d, one of the strongest known ligands for Mac-1. In cell adhesion assays both LL-37 and FK-13 supported binding by Mac-1 expressing cells, however, with LL-37-coupled surfaces supporting stronger cell adhesion than FK-13.

Recent advances in computational PPI design have allowed for de novo design of protein complexes, and several successful examples have been reported. In addition, a simple and easy-to-use approach has also been reported that arranges leucines on a solvent-accessible region of an \u03b1-helix and places charged residues around the leucine patch to induce interactions between the two helical peptides. For this study, we adopted this approach to de novo design a new PPI between the helical bundle proteins sulerythrin and LARFH. A non-polar patch was created on an \u03b1-helix of LARFH around which arginine residues were introduced to retain its solubility. The strongest interaction found was for the LARFH variant cysLARFH-IV-3L3R and the sulerythrin mutant 6L6D (KD\u00a0=\u00a00.16\u00a0\u03bcM). This artificial protein complex is maintained by hydrophobic and ionic interactions formed by the inter-molecular helical bundle structure. Therefore, by the simple and easy-to-use approach to create de novo interfaces on the \u03b1-helices, we successfully generated an artificial PPI. We also created a second LARFH variant with the non-polar patch surrounded by positively charged residues at each end. Upon mixing this LARFH variant with 6L6D, mesh-like fibrous nanostructures were observed by atomic force microscopy. Our method may, therefore, also be applicable to the de novo design of protein nanostructures.",

     "abstract": "Heme oxidation and loss of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) is thought to be an important contributor to the development of cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, it remains unknown why the heme loses readily in oxidized sGC. In the current study, the conformational change of sGC upon heme oxidation by ODQ was studied based on the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the heme and a fluorophore fluorescein arsenical helix binder (FlAsH-EDT2) labeled at different domains of sGC \u03b21. This study provides an opportunity to monitor the domain movement of sGC relative to the heme. The results indicated that heme oxidation by ODQ in truncated sCC induced the heme-associated \u03b1F helix moving away from the heme, the Per/Arnt/Sim domain (PAS) domain moving closer to the heme, but led the helical domain going further from the heme. We proposed that the synergistic effect of these conformational changes of the discrete region upon heme oxidation forces the heme pocket open, and subsequent heme loss readily. Furthermore, the kinetic studies suggested that the heme oxidation was a fast process and the conformational change was a relatively slow process. The kinetics of heme loss from oxidized sGC was monitored by a new method based on the heme group de-quenching the fluorescence of FlAsH-EDT2.",

Soluble oligomeric species that accumulate as intermediates in the process of fibril formation are thought to be highly cytotoxic. Recent studies indicate that oligomer-to-fibril AS transition plays a key role in cell toxicity and progression of neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that a subgroup of oligomeric AS species are ordered assemblies possessing a well-defined pattern of intermolecular contacts which are arranged into a distinctive antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure, as opposed to the parallel fibrillar fold. Recently, it was demonstrated that the physiological form of AS is N-terminally acetylated (Ac-AS). Here, we first showed that well-characterized conformational ensembles of Ac-AS, namely monomers, oligomers and fibrils, recapitulate many biophysical features of the nonacetylated protein, such as hydrodynamic, tinctorial, structural and membrane-leakage properties. Then, we relied on ATR-FTIR spectroscopy to explore the structural reorganization during Ac-AS fibrillogenesis. We found that antiparallel \u03b2-sheet transient intermediates are built-up at early stages of aggregation, which then evolve to parallel \u03b2-sheet fibrils through helix-rich/disordered species. The results are discussed in terms of regions of the protein that might participate in this structural rearrangement.

Harmful effects of some mutations might be caused by disruption of yet uncharacterized protein\u2013protein interactions. We used nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to localize the region of striated muscle \u03b1-tropomyosin (Tpm1.1) that interacts with leiomodin-2 (Lmod2), a member of tropomodulin (Tmod) family of actin-binding proteins. We found that 21 N-terminal residues of Tpm1.1 are involved in interactions with residues 7\u201341 of Lmod2. The K15N mutation in Tpm1.1, known to be associated with familial DCM, is located within the newly identified Lmod2 binding site of Tpm1.1. We studied the effect of this mutation on binding Lmod2 and Tmod1. The mutation reduced binding affinity for both Lmod2 and Tmod1, which are responsible for correct lengths of thin filaments. The effect of the K15N mutation on Tpm1.1 binding to Lmod2 and Tmod1 provides a molecular rationale for the development of familial DCM.",

     "abstract": "Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2) is a component of a pro-oncogenic signalling pathway that can promote p53 inhibition, metastatic cell migration, limb regeneration, and cancer drug-resistance. AGR2 is in the protein-disulphide isomerase superfamily containing a single cysteine (Cys-81) that forms covalent adducts with its client proteins. We have found that mutation of Cysteine-81 attenuates its biochemical activity in its sequence-specific peptide docking function, reduces binding to Reptin, and reduces its stability in cells. As such, we evaluated how chemical oxidation of its cysteine affects its biochemical properties. Recombinant AGR2 spontaneously forms covalent dimers in the absence of reductant whilst DTT promotes dimer to monomer conversion. Mutation of Cysteine-81 to alanine prevents peroxide catalysed dimerization of AGR2 in vitro, suggesting a reactive cysteine is central to covalent dimer formation. Both biochemical assays and ESI mass spectrometry were used to demonstrate that low levels of a chemical oxidant promote an intermolecular disulphide bond through formation of a labile sulfenic acid intermediate. However, higher levels of oxidant promote sulfinic or sulfonic acid formation thus preventing covalent dimerization of AGR2. These data together identify the single cysteine of AGR2 as an oxidant responsive moiety that regulates its propensity for oxidation and its monomeric-dimeric state. This has implications for redox regulation of the pro-oncogenic functions of AGR2 protein in cancer cells.",

RecQ helicase family members are essential in homologous recombination-based error-free DNA repair processes in all domains of life. RecQ helicases present in each organism differ and several homologues have been identified in various multicellular organisms. These proteins are involved in various pathways of DNA metabolism by providing duplex unwinding function. Five members of RecQ family are present in Homo sapiens but P. falciparum contains only two members of this family. Here we report the detailed biochemical and functional characterization of the Bloom (Blm) homologue (PfBlm) from P. falciparum 3D7 strain. Purified PfBlm exhibits ATPase and 3' to 5' direction specific DNA helicase activity. The calculated average reaction rate of ATPase was ~13 pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/pmol of enzyme. The immunofluorescence assay results show that PfBlm is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic development of the P. falciparum 3D7 strain. In some stages of development in addition to nucleus PfBlm also localizes in the cytoplasm. The gene disruption studies of PfBlm by dsRNA showed that it is required for the ex-vivo intraerythrocytic development of the parasite P. falciparum 3D7 strain. The dsRNA mediated inhibition of parasite growth suggests that a variety of pathways are affected resulting in curtailing of the parasite growth. This study will be helpful in unravelling the basic mechanism of DNA transaction in the malaria parasite and additionally it may provide leads to understand the parasite specific characteristics of this protein.",

     "abstract": "Mechanistic link of protein hypo-O-GlcNAcylation to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. Here, we found that S-nitrosylation of O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (SNO-OGT) was induced by \u03b2-amyloid peptide (A\u03b2) exposure to SK-N-MC and SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cells. Subsequently, A\u03b2-induced SNO-OGT led to protein hypo-O-GlcNAcylation globally including tau hypo-O-GlcNAcylation. Our results support that underlying mechanism for induction of SNO-OGT comprises the concerted action of A\u03b2-triggered Ca2\u00a0+ entry into cells and nNOS-catalyzed NO production. Intriguingly, OGT was found to be associated with nNOS and its association was enhanced during A\u03b2 treatment. In parallel with SNO-OGT-mediated tau hypo-O-GlcNAcylation, A\u03b2 led to SNO-Akt-mediated GSK3\u03b2 activation for tau phosphorylation, suggesting that tau hyperphosphorylation is established by synergistic connection between SNO-OGT and GSK3\u03b2 activation. We also observed that A\u03b2-neurotoxicity including both reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cell death was amplified with DON treatment, whereas it was restored by PUGNAc treatment, GlcNH2 treatment or OGT overexpression. Early time-course A\u03b2-monitoring assay revealed that premaintained hyper-O-GlcNAcylation inside cells blocked not only A\u03b2-triggered Ca2\u00a0+ entry into cells but also induction of SNO-OGT and SNO-Akt. Together, these findings suggest that induction of SNO-OGT by A\u03b2 exposure is a pathogenic mechanism to cause cellular hypo-O-GlcNAcylation by which A\u03b2 neurotoxicity is executed, and conversely, hyper-O-GlcNAcylation within cells can defend against A\u03b2 neurotoxicity. Furthermore, our Cys mapping demonstrates that cysteine-nitric oxide (Cys-NO) linkages in SNO-OGT occur at triple Cys845, Cys921, and Cys965 residues in C-terminal catalytic domain (C-CAT), suggesting that Cys-NO linkage triplet in SNO-OGT is associated with null OGT activity.",

Therefore, changes in CTD phosphorylation by site-specific kinases/phosphatases are critical for the accurate transmission of information during transcription. Unlike kinases, CTD phosphatases have been traditionally neglected as they are thought to act as passive negative regulators that remove all phosphate marks at the conclusion of transcription. This over-simplified view has been disputed in recent years and new data assert the active and regulatory role phosphatases play in transcription. We now know that CTD phosphatases ensure the proper transition between different stages of transcription, balance the distribution of phosphorylation for accurate termination and re-initiation, and prevent inappropriate expression of certain genes. In this review, we focus on the specific roles of CTD phosphatases in regulating transcription. In particular, we emphasize how specificity and timing of dephosphorylation are achieved for these phosphatases and consider the various regulatory factors that affect these dynamics.",

The present study was performed using mutagenesis of centrin and of Sfi1 residues involved in centrin binding and the stability of the centrin\u2013centrin complexes was assessed using thermal denaturation and CD.Calcium stabilized these complexes, as indicated by the Tm increases measured by circular dichroism.

Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a dimeric exoribonuclease that efficiently degrades mRNA 3\u2032 poly(A) tails while also simultaneously interacting with the mRNA 5\u2032 cap. The cap binding amplifies the processivity of PARN action. We used surface plasmon resonance kinetic analysis, quantitative equilibrium fluorescence titrations and circular dichroism to study the cap binding properties of PARN.The molecular mechanism of 5\u2032 cap recognition by PARN has been demonstrated to differ from interactions seen for other known cap-binding proteins in that: i) the auxiliary biological function of 5\u2032 cap binding by the 3\u2032 degrading enzyme is accomplished by negative cooperativity of PARN dimer subunits; ii) non-coulombic interactions are major factors in the complex formation; and iii) PARN has versatile activity toward alternative forms of the cap. These characteristics contribute to stabilization of the PARN\u2013cap complex needed for the deadenylation processivity.

     "abstract": "Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases caused by prion protein (PrP) conformational changes. More than 30 PRNP gene mutations have been associated with familial prion diseases. E200K-associated familial Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (fCJD) is the most common inherited prion disease. One of the hallmarks of prion diseases is the accumulation of oxidative damage. The mechanism by which oxidative modification of methionine (Met) residues influence the E200K PrP misfolding remains unclear. Here, we examined the stability, structural change, oligomerization and proteinase K resistance of unoxidized/oxidized E200K PrP and Met-to-Leu mutants. We found that oxidation of surface-exposed Met109/112/129/134/154/166 residues significantly destabilized E200K PrP but had a limited impact on the protein's structure. The oxidation of Met213 was the initial step in the conformational conversion of E200K PrP and facilitated the further oxidation of Met205/206. The oxidation of Met213/205/206 led to the exposure of the inner hydrophobic core, disrupted the overall structure of E200K PrP and induced the formation of large soluble multimers at low pH. In addition, the aggregation behavior of oxidized E200K PrP at the cellular level was investigated using E200K PrP Met-to-Ser mutants. The results showed that M109/112/129/154S or M134/166S mutants were efficiently localized on the cell membrane, whereas the M213/205/206S mutant generated many of aggregated fluorescent dots in the cytoplasm.

Here, we studied the biophysics of the interactions between the glycoprotein E2 peptide HCV421\u2013445 and four different micellar systems providing ionic, non-ionic and zwitterionic surfaces to investigate the importance of electrostatic interactions for peptide\u2013membrane binding. Circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy and calorimetry were used to characterize peptide\u2013micelle interactions and structural changes. Fluorescence quenching showed that HCV421\u2013445 interacts with SDS or CTAB ionic, n-OGP non-ionic and DPC zwitterionic micelles. The indole ring of Trp seems to anchor the peptide in micelles. Trp residues seem to be more deeply inserted in ionic and non-ionic micelles where peptide interactions are more stable than with DPC zwitterionic micelles. The interaction with zwitterionic micelles appears to occur at the surface. Both interaction types are exothermic because of peptide\u2013micelle interactions and a gain of secondary structure in the helical conformation. HCV421\u2013445 interacts with detergent monomers and micelles. Peptide\u2013micelle interaction is pH-independent.

     "abstract": "Protein palmitoylation has been shown to be an important post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells. This modification alters the localization and/or the function of the targeted protein. In recent years, protein palmitoylation has risen in importance in apicomplexan parasites as well. In Toxoplasma gondii, some proteins have been reported to be modified by palmitate. With the development of new techniques that allow the isolation of palmitoylated proteins, this significant post-translational modification has begun to be studied in more detail in T. gondii. Here we describe the palmitoylome of the tachyzoite stage of T. gondii using a combination of the acyl-biotin exchange chemistry method and mass spectrometry analysis. We identified 401 proteins found in multiple cellular compartments, with a wide range of functions that vary from metabolic processes, gliding and host-cell invasion to even regulation of transcription and translation. Besides, we found that more rhoptry proteins than the ones already described for Toxoplasma are palmitoylated, suggesting an important role for this modification in the invasion mechanism of the host-cell. This study documents that protein palmitoylation is a common modification in T. gondii that could have an impact on different cellular processes.",

The exact mechanisms of LC self-assembly and the molecular basis leading to cellular and organ failure still remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the quaternary structure, the stability and the amyloidogenecity of LC variable domain (VL) from the \u03bb6 germline. We observed that the amyloidogenic \u03bb6 Wil and its non-amyloidogenic counterpart Jto dimerize in a concentration-dependent manner and that the dimer affinity is considerably decreased in the presence of a high ionic strength. Our results showed that the dimeric state delays the structural conversion associated with amyloid formation and that the monomer is critical to initiate amyloidogenesis. Thermal and chemical unfolding studies revealed that the dimeric state of VL \u03bb6 has an equivalent stability to the monomer. This indicates that the protective effect of dimerization is not related to thermodynamic stability but, most likely, resides in specific structural features. The toxicity of monomeric Jto and Wil as well as fibrillar aggregates was evaluated on cardiomyoblasts and ThT-negative proteospecies reduced cellular viability when employed at high concentration. This study provides novel insights into the complex process of LC amyloidogenesis and suggests that dimer stabilization constitutes a promising strategy to prevent self-assembly and amyloid deposition.",

We have shown previously that the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 is inhibited by the lung surfactant-associated protein called surfactant protein A (SP-A) through direct protein-protein interaction. Docking of SPA and Prdx6 was modeled using the ZDOCK (zlab.bu.edu) program in order to predict molecular sites for binding of the two proteins.

The sequences 195EEEAKKLFPK204.in the Prdx6 helix and 83DEELQTELYEIKHQIL99 in SP-A were identified as the sites for hydrophobic interaction and H+-bonding between the 2 proteins.

     "abstract": "Oligomeric assemblies are postulated to be proximate neurotoxic species in human diseases associated with aberrant protein aggregation. Their heterogeneous and transient nature makes their structural characterization difficult. Size distributions of oligomers of several amyloidogenic proteins, including amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD), have been previously characterized in vitro by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Due to non-physiological conditions associated with the PICUP chemistry, A\u03b2 oligomers cross-linked by PICUP may not be representative of in vivo conditions. Here, we examine an alternative Copper and Hydrogen peroxide Induced Cross-linking of Unmodified Proteins (CHICUP), which utilizes naturally occurring divalent copper ions and hydrogen peroxide and does not require photo activation. Our results demonstrate that CHICUP and PICUP applied to the two predominant A\u03b2 alloforms, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, result in similar oligomer size distributions. Thioflavin T fluorescence data and atomic force microscopy images demonstrate that both CHICUP and PICUP stabilize A\u03b2 oligomers and attenuate fibril formation. Relative to noncross-linked peptides, CHICUP-treated A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 cause prolonged disruption to biomimetic lipid vesicles. CHICUP-stabilized A\u03b2 oligomers link the amyloid cascade, metal, and oxidative stress hypotheses of AD into a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of AD pathology.

Despite its reduced affinity for actin in co-sedimentation assay, the Q147P mutant incorporates into the muscle fiber. However, compared to wild-type tropomyosin, it locates closer to the center of the actin filament.

     "abstract": "Four new X-ray structures of tryptophan synthase (TS) crystallized with varying numbers of the amphipathic N-(4\u2032-trifluoromethoxybenzoyl)-2-aminoethyl phosphate (F6) molecule are presented. These structures show one of the F6 ligands threaded into the tunnel from the \u03b2-site and reveal a distinct hydrophobic region. Over this expanse, the interactions between F6 and the tunnel are primarily nonpolar, while the F6 phosphoryl group fits into a polar pocket of the \u03b2-subunit active site. Further examination of TS structures reveals that one portion of the tunnel (T1) binds clusters of water molecules, whereas waters are not observed in the nonpolar F6 binding region of the tunnel (T2). MD simulation of another TS structure with an unobstructed tunnel also indicates the T2 region of the tunnel excludes water, consistent with a dewetted state that presents a significant barrier to the transfer of water into the closed \u03b2-site. We conclude that hydrophobic molecules can freely diffuse between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-sites via the tunnel, while water does not. We propose that exclusion of water serves to inhibit reaction of water with the \u03b1-aminoacrylate intermediate to form ammonium ion and pyruvate, a deleterious side reaction in the \u03b1\u03b2-catalytic cycle. Finally, while most TS structures show \u03b2Phe280 partially blocking the tunnel between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-sites, new structures show an open tunnel, suggesting the flexibility of the \u03b2Phe280 side chain. Flexible docking studies and MD simulations confirm that the dynamic behavior of \u03b2Phe280 allows unhindered transfer of indole through the tunnel, therefore excluding a gating role for this residue.",

The protein is a homotrimer whose subunits comprise serine protease domain (PD) and PDZ regulatory domain. In the basal, inactive state, a tight interdomain interface limits access both to the PDZ peptide (carboxylate) binding site and to the PD catalytic center. The molecular mechanism of activation is not well understood. To further the knowledge of HtrA2 thermal activation we monitored the dynamics of the PDZ\u2013PD interactions during temperature increase using tryptophan-induced quenching (TrIQ) method. The TrIQ results suggested that during activation the PDZ domain changed its position versus PD inside a subunit, including a prominent change affecting the L3 regulatory loop of PD, and also changed its interactions with the PD of the adjacent subunit (PD*), specifically with its L1* regulatory loop containing the active site serine. The \u03b15 helix of PDZ was involved in both, the intra- and intersubunit changes of interactions and thus seems to play an important role in HtrA2 activation. The amino acid substitutions designed to decrease the PDZ interactions with the PD or PD* promoted protease activity at a wide range of temperatures, which supports the conclusions based on the TrIQ analysis. The model presented in this work describes PDZ movement in relation to PD and PD*, resulting in an increased access to the peptide binding and active sites, and conformational changes of the L3 and L1* loops.",

An unusual 1:2 binding mode of CaM to CaM-binding domains of GAD has long been known, however the contribution of the two CaM domains in target recognition and activation remains to be clarified. Here, we explored the coupling between physicochemical properties of Arabidopsis CaM1 (AtCaM1) and Arabidopsis GAD1 activation, focusing on each AtCaM1 lobe. We found that the four EF-loops of AtCaM1 differently contribute to the ~\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM apparent affinity for Ca2\u00a0+ and the C-lobe shows a ~\u00a06-fold higher affinity than N-lobe (Kdapp 5.6\u00a0\u03bcM and 32\u00a0\u03bcM for C- and N-lobes, respectively). AtCaM1 responds structurally to Ca2\u00a0+ in a manner similar to vertebrate CaM based on comparison of Ca2\u00a0+-induced changes in hydrophobicity exposure, secondary structure, and hydrodynamic behavior. Molecular dynamics simulations of AtCaM1 apo and Ca2\u00a0+-bound reveal that the latter state is significantly less flexible, although regions of the N-lobe remain quite flexible; this suggests the importance of N-lobe for completing the transition to the extended structure of holoprotein, consistent with data from ANS fluorescence, CD spectroscopy, and SEC analysis. Moreover, enzymatic analysis reveal that mutations in the two lobes affect GAD1 activation in similar ways and only intact AtCaM1 can fully activate GAD1. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the CaM lobes role in interactions between CaM and plant GAD.",

To verify the anti-arthritic activities of Achyranthes aspera and its possible therapy-related factors on the pathogenesis of RA, the saponins in A. aspera root were isolated and identified to treat the collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Phytochemical analysis isolated and identified methyl caffeate, 25-S-inokosterone, 25-S-inokosterone \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl 3-(O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-oleanolate, and \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl 3-(O-\u03b2-d-galactopyranosyl (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a02)(O-\u03b2-d-glucopyranosyloxy)-oleanolate as main compounds in the root of A. aspera. Proteomics was performed to determine the differentially expressed proteins in either inflamed or drug-treated synovium of CIA rats. Treatment resulted in dramatically decreased paw swelling, proliferation of inflammatory cells, and bone degradation. Fibrinogen, procollagen, protein disulfide-isomerase A3, and apolipoprotein A-I were all increased in inflamed synovial tissues and were found to decrease when administered drug therapy. Furthermore, Alpha-1-antiproteinase and manganese superoxide dismutase were both increased in drug-treated synovial tissues. The inhibition of RA progression shows that A. aspera is a promising candidate for future treatment of human arthritis. Importantly, the total saponins found within A. aspera are the active component. Finally, autoantigens such as fibrinogen and collagen could act as inducers of RA due to their aggravation of inflammation.

In this context, our group has explored for several years the high potential of the lipase/acyltransferase CpLIP2 from Candida parapsilosis and of several of its homologs, that catalyze efficiently acyltransfer reactions in lipid/water media with high water activity (aw\u00a0>\u00a00.9). The discovery of a new member of this group, CduLAc from Candida dubliniensis, with a higher acyltransferase activity than CpLIP2, has provided a new insight on structure\u2013function relationships in this group. Indeed, the comparison of sequences and 3D models, especially of CpLIP2 and CduLAc, with those of the phylogenetically related lipase A from Pseudozyma antarctica (CAL-A), allowed elucidating a key structural determinant of the acyltransferase activity: serine S369 in CpLIP2 and its equivalents E370 in CAL-A and A366 in CduLAc. Mutants obtained by rational design at this key position showed significant changes in acyltransfer activity. Whereas mutation S369E resulted in an increase in the hydrolytic activity of CpLIP2, S369A increased alcoholysis. More strikingly, the single E370A mutation in CAL-A drastically increased the acyltransferase activity of this enzyme, giving it the character of a lipase/acyltransferase. Indeed, this single mutation lowered the methanol concentration for which the initial rates of alcoholysis and hydrolysis are equal from 2\u00a0M in CAL-A down to 0.3\u00a0M in its mutant, while the exceptional stability of the parental enzyme toward alcohol and temperature was conserved.",

Data suggest that Thr417 is in a competent position to activate the catalytic threonine (Thr399) for nucleophilic attack of the scissile peptide bond and that Thr415 plays a major role in assisting the process. On the basis of these new structural results, a possible mechanism of autoprocessing is proposed. This mechanism, which guesses the existence of a six-membered transition state involving one carbonyl and two hydroxyl groups, is in agreement with all the available experimental data collected on \u03b3-GTs from different species and with our new Ala-scanning mutagenesis data.",

In this study, we employed stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics approach and identified 439 proteins that exhibit significant differential expressions in NCI-H460 lung cancer cells upon exposure to TBMS1. Gene ontology and network analysis using DAVID and STRING on-line tools revealed that several nucleolar stress (ribosomal biogenesis) response proteins were differentially regulated by TBMS1.

     "abstract": "The adduction of fumaric acid to the sulfhydryl group of certain cysteine (Cys) residues in proteins via a Michael-like reaction leads to the formation of S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC) sites. Although its role remains to be fully understood, this post-translational Cys modification (protein succination) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetes/obesity and fumarate hydratase-related diseases. In this study, theoretical approaches to address sequence- and 3D-structure-based features possibly underlying the specificity of protein succination have been applied to perform the first analysis of the available data on the succinate proteome. A total of 182 succinated proteins, 205 modifiable, and 1750 non-modifiable sites have been examined. The rate of 2SC sites per protein ranged from 1 to 3, and the overall relative abundance of modifiable sites was 10.8%. Modifiable and non-modifiable sites were not distinguishable when the hydrophobicity of the Cys-flaking peptides, the acid dissociation constant value of the sulfhydryl groups, and the secondary structure of the Cys-containing segments were compared. By contrast, significant differences were determined when the accessibility of the sulphur atoms and the amino acid composition of the Cys-flaking peptides were analysed. Based on these findings, a sequence-based score function has been evaluated as a descriptor for Cys residues. In conclusion, our results indicate that modifiable and non-modifiable sites form heterogeneous subsets when features often discussed to describe Cys reactivity are examined. However, they also suggest that some differences exist, which may constitute the baseline for further investigations aimed at the development of predictive methods for 2SC sites in proteins.",

A novel anticancer agent 2,5-diaziridinyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone (RH1) is designed to be activated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase, an enzyme expressed at high levels in many types of tumors. Here we investigated the potential mechanisms of acquired RH1 drug resistance in cancer cells by applying high-throughput differential quantitative proteomic analysis of the newly established RH1-resistant hepatoma cell lines. Over 400 proteins display significantly altered levels between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. Differentially expressed proteins were clustered into more than 14 groups according to their functional annotation and protein\u2013protein interactions. Bioinformatic analysis highlights the biological processes that might be responsible for acquired resistance to RH1. The level of several xenobiotic metabolism enzymes (total n\u00a0=\u00a017) involved in RH1 activation and detoxification is decreased (Nqo1, catalase, Gst, Gsr), corresponding with the decrease in their catalytic activity. The altered biological processes also include the decrease of cell cycle positive regulators (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and the increase of DNA repair proteins (n\u00a0=\u00a05) as well as annexin family members (n\u00a0=\u00a05) in the RH1-resistant cells. Drug-resistant hepatoma cell proteomes are also distinguished by the altered level of proteins involved in energy production and metabolism (n\u00a0=\u00a055). Our data provide the basis for in-depth study of molecular mechanisms of tumor cell resistance to the promising anticancer drug RH1 enabling the further validation of protein biomarkers for the drug insusceptibility and of potential secondary pharmacological targets of RH1 resistant cells.",

Although the clotting reaction in the chelicerate horseshoe crab (Family: Limulidae) has been described in details, the overall protein composition of the resulting clot has not been analyzed for any of the chelicerates. The largest class among the chelicerates is the arachnids, which includes spiders, ticks, mites, and scorpions. Here, we use a mass spectrometry-based approach to characterize the spider hemolymph clot proteome from the Brazilian whiteknee tarantula, Acanthoscurria geniculata. We focused on the insoluble part of the clot and demonstrated high concentrations of proteins homologous to the hemostasis-related and multimerization-prone von Willebrand factor. These proteins, which include hemolectins and vitellogenin homologous, were previously identified as essential components of the hemolymph clot in crustaceans and insects. Their presence in the spider hemolymph clot suggests that the origin of these proteins' function in coagulation predates the split between chelicerates and mandibulata. The clot proteome reveals that the major proteinaceous component is the oxygen-transporting and phenoloxidase-displaying abundant hemolymph protein hemocyanin, suggesting that this protein also plays a role in clot biology. Furthermore, quantification of the peptidome after coagulation revealed the simultaneous activation of both the innate immune system and the coagulation system. In general, many of the identified clot-proteins are related to the innate immune system, and our results support the previously suggested crosstalk between immunity and coagulation in arthropods.",

It consists of a catalytic domain with the (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 TIM barrel fold having a large area of solvent-exposed aromatic amino acids in the active site and an additional family 14 carbohydrate-binding module. To gain further insight into enzyme functionality, especially the effect of the active site aromatic residues, we expressed two variants with mutations in subsites on either side of the catalytic acid, subsite \u2212\u00a03 (W31A) and +\u00a02 (W218A), and compared their catalytic properties on chitin and high molecular weight chitosans. Exchange of Trp to Ala in subsite \u2212\u00a03 resulted in a 12-fold reduction in extent of degradation and a 20-fold reduction in kcatapp on chitin, while the values are 5-fold and 10-fold for subsite +\u00a02. Moreover, aromatic residue mutation resulted in a decrease of the rate of chitosan degradation contrasting previous observations for bacterial family 18 chitinases. Interestingly, the presence of product polymers of 40 sugar moieties and higher starts to disappear already at 8% degradation for HCHT50-W31A.

This classic approach allowed scientists to unambiguously define the intrinsic kinetic and chemical properties of that protein. The ultimate hope was to extrapolate this information toward understanding how the enzyme or receptor behaves within its native cellular context. These types of detailed in vitro analyses were necessary to reduce the innate complexities of measuring the singular activity and biochemical properties of a specific enzyme without interference from other enzymes and potential competing substrates. However, recent developments in fields encompassing cell biology, molecular imaging, and chemical biology now provide the unique chemical tools and instrumentation to study protein structure, function, and regulation in their native cellular environment. These advancements provide the foundation for a new field, coined physiological enzymology, which quantifies the function and regulation of enzymes and proteins at the cellular level.

Accordingly, modern technological developments and advances in enzymology have been geared towards analyzing protein functions within intact single cells. We discuss here how fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been employed to identify subcellular locations of proteins, detect reversible protein\u2013protein interactions, and measure protein activity and kinetics in living cells. Considering that fluorescence single-cell microscopy has been only recently recognized as a primary technique in enzymology, its potentials and outcomes in studying intracellular protein functions are projected to be immensely useful and enlightening.

The affinities for the interactions span more than ten orders of magnitude, and KD values in \u03bcM\u2013mM regimen are considered transient and are important in cell signaling. Solution NMR including diamagnetic and paramagnetic techniques has enabled atomic-resolution depictions of transient protein\u2013protein interactions. Diamagnetic NMR allows characterization of protein complexes with KD values up to several mM, whereas ultraweak and fleeting complexes can be modeled with the use of paramagnetic NMR especially paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). When tackling ever-larger protein complexes, PRE can be particularly useful in providing long-range intermolecular distance restraints. As NMR measurements are averaged over the ensemble of complex structures, structural information for dynamic protein\u2013protein interactions besides the stereospecific one can often be extracted. Herein the protein interaction dynamics are exemplified by encounter complexes, alternative binding modes, and coupled binding/folding of intrinsically disordered proteins. Further integration of NMR with other biophysical techniques should allow better visualization of transient protein\u2013protein interactions. In particular, single-molecule data may facilitate the interpretation of ensemble-averaged NMR data.

     "abstract": "Sialic acids, existing as terminal sugars of glycoconjugates, play important roles in various physiological and pathological processes, such as cell\u2013cell adhesion, immune defense, tumor cell metastasis, and inflammation. Sialyltransferases (STs) catalyze the transfer of sialic acid residues to non-reducing oligosaccharide chains of proteins and lipids, using cytidine monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) as the donor. Elevated sialyltransferase activity leads to overexpression of cell surface sialic acids and contributes to many disease developments, such as cancer and inflammation. Therefore, sialyltransferases are considered as potential drug targets for disease treatment. Inhibitors of sialyltransferases thus are of medicinal interest, especially for the cancer therapy. In addition, sialyltransferase inhibitors are useful tool to study sialyltransferase function and related mechanisms. This review highlights recent development of inhibitors of sialyltransferases reported since 2004.

The koff of D17.4/IgE complex was calculated to be (2.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0s\u22121 at 50\u00a0mM NaCl, and (1.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122\u00a0s\u22121 at 300\u00a0mM NaCl, both in 1\u00a0mM MgCl2 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The dissociation activation energy for the D17.4/IgE complex, Ea, was 16.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u22121 at 50\u00a0mM NaCl and 1\u00a0mM MgCl2. Interestingly, we found that the C19A mutant of D17.4 with stabilized stem structure showed slower dissociation kinetics compared to D17.4. Single-molecule observations of surface-immobilized D17.4/IgE showed much faster dissociation kinetics, and heterogeneity not observable by ensemble techniques.The increasing koff value with increasing salt concentration is attributed to the electrostatic interactions between D17.4/IgE. We found that both the changes in activation enthalpy and activation entropy are insignificant with increasing NaCl concentration. The slower dissociation of the mutant C19A/IgE complex is likely due to the enhanced stability of the aptamer.The activation parameters obtained by applying transition state analysis to kinetic data can provide details on mechanisms of molecular recognition and have applications in drug design. Single-molecule dissociation kinetics showed greater kinetic complexity than was observed in the ensemble in-solution systems, potentially reflecting conformational heterogeneity of the aptamer.

     "abstract": "Nucleosides and their corresponding mono-, di-, and triphosphates play important roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In addition, perturbations in this homeostasis can result in dysfunctional cellular processes that cause pathological conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. This review article discusses contemporary research areas applying nucleoside analogs to probe the mechanistic details underlying the complexities of nucleoside metabolism at the molecular and cellular levels. The first area describes classic and contemporary approaches used to quantify the activity of nucleoside transporters, an important class of membrane proteins that mediate the influx and efflux of nucleosides and nucleobases. A focal point of this section is describing how biophotonic nucleosides are replacing conventional assays employing radiolabeled substrates to study the mechanism of these proteins. The second section describes approaches to understand the utilization of nucleoside triphosphates by cellular DNA polymerases during DNA synthesis. Emphasis here is placed on describing how novel nucleoside analogs such as 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine are being used to quantify DNA synthesis during normal replication as well as during the replication of damaged DNA. In both sections, seminal research articles relevant to these areas are described to highlight how these novel probes are improving our understanding of these biological processes.

     "abstract": "Ten years after the initial identification of human renalase the first genuinely catalytic substrates have been identified. Throughout the prior decade a consensus belief that renalase is produced predominantly by the kidney and catalytically oxidizes catecholamines in order to lower blood pressure and slow the heart has prevailed. This belief was, however, based on fundamentally flawed scientific observations that did not include control reactions to account for the well-known autoxidation of catecholamines in oxygenated solutions. Nonetheless, the initial claims have served as the kernel for a rapidly expanding body of research largely predicated on the belief that catecholamines are substrates for this enzyme. The proliferation of scientific studies pertaining to renalase as a hormone has proceeded unabated despite well-reasoned expressions of dissent that have indicated the deficiencies of the initial observations and other inconsistencies.Our group has very recently identified isomeric forms of \u03b2-NAD(P)H as substrates for renalase. These substrates arise from non-specific reduction of \u03b2-NAD(P)+ that forms \u03b2-4-dihydroNAD(P) (\u03b2-NAD(P)H), \u03b2-2-dihydroNAD(P) and \u03b2-6-dihydroNAD(P); the latter two being substrates for renalase. Renalase oxidizes these substrates with rate constants that are up to 104-fold faster than any claimed for catecholamines. The electrons harvested are delivered to dioxygen via the enzyme's FAD cofactor forming both H2O2 and \u03b2-NAD(P)+ as products. It would appear that the metabolic purpose of this chemistry is to alleviate the inhibitory effect of \u03b2-2-dihydroNAD(P) and \u03b2-6-dihydroNAD(P) on primary metabolism dehydrogenase enzymes. The identification of this genuinely catalytic activity for renalase calls for re-evaluation of much of the research of this enzyme, in which definitive links between renalase catecholamine consumption and physiological responses were reported.

Homeostasis of redox metabolism in T. cruzi is achieved by the actions of several proteins that differ in many aspects from host proteins. Although extensive research has been performed examining hydroperoxide cytosolic antioxidant defense centered on trypanothione, the mechanisms of mitochondrial antioxidant defense are not yet known. The aim of this study was to elucidate the partners of TcMPx antioxidant pathway and to determine the influence of the cellular context (physiological versus oxidative stress). Through co-precipitation coupled with a mass spectrometry approach, a variety of proteins were detected under physiological and oxidative stress conditions. Interestingly, functional category analysis of the proteins identified under physiological conditions showed that they were involved in the stress response, oxidoreduction, thiol transfer, and metabolic processes; this profile is distinct under oxidative stress conditions likely due to structural alterations. Our findings help to elucidate the reactions involving TcMPx and most importantly also reveal that this protein is present throughout the cell and that its interaction partners change following oxidative stress exposure. The involvement and significance of the proteins found to interact with TcMPx and other possible functions for this protein are discussed widening our knowledge regarding T. cruzi mitochondrial antioxidant defenses.",

A1M binds heme and the crystal structure suggests that C34 and H123 participate in a heme binding site. We have investigated the involvement of these five residues in the interactions with heme.Four A1M-variants were expressed: with cysteine to serine substitution in position 34, lysine to threonine substitutions in positions (92, 118, 130), histidine to serine substitution in position 123 and a wt without mutations. Heme binding was investigated by tryptophan fluorescence quenching, UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometry, circular dichroism, SPR, electrophoretic migration shift, gel filtration, catalase-like activity and molecular simulation.All A1M-variants bound to heme. Mutations in C34, H123 or K(92, 118, 130) resulted in significant absorbance changes, CD spectral changes, and catalase-like activity, suggesting involvement of these side-groups in coordination of the heme-iron. Molecular simulation support a model with two heme-binding sites in A1M involving the mutated residues. Binding of the first heme induces allosteric stabilization of the structure predisposing for a better fit of the second heme.The results suggest that one heme-binding site is located in the lipocalin pocket and a second binding site between loops 1 and 4.

     "abstract": "Cdc42 regulates pathways related to cell division. Dysregulation of Cdc42 can lead to cancer, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. GTP induced activation mechanism plays an important role in the activity and biological functions of Cdc42. P-loop, Switch I and Switch II are critical regions modulating the enzymatic activity of Cdc42. We applied amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HDXMS) to investigate the dynamic changes of apo-Cdc42 after GDP, GTP and GMP-PCP binding. The natural substrate GTP induced significant decreases of deuteration in P-loop and Switch II, moderate changes of deuteration in Switch I and significant changes of deuteration in the \u03b17 helix, a region far away from the active site. GTP binding induced similar effects on H/D exchange to its non-hydrolysable analog, GMP-PCP. HDXMS results indicate that GTP binding blocked the solvent accessibility in the active site leading to the decrease of H/D exchange rate surrounding the active site, and further triggered a conformational change resulting in the drastic decrease of H/D exchange rate at the remote \u03b17 helix. Comparing the deuteration levels in three activation states of apo-Cdc42, Cdc42-GDP and Cdc42-GMP-PCP, the apo-Cdc42 has the most flexible structure, which can be stabilized by guanine nucleotide binding. The rates of H/D exchange of Cdc42-GDP are between the GMP-PCP-bound and the apo form, but more closely to the GMP-PCP-bound form. Our results show that the activation of Cdc42 is a process of conformational changes involved with P-loop, Switch II and \u03b17 helix for structural stabilization.",

In order to better understand how Trx1 modulates downstream protective cellular signaling events following cardiac ischemia, we conducted an expression proteomics study of left ventricles (LVs) after thoracic aortic constriction stress treatment of transgenic mice with cardiac-specific over-expression of Trx1, an animal model that has been proven to withstand more stress than its non-transgenic littermates. Although previous redox post-translational modifications proteomics studies found that several cellular protein networks are regulated by Trx1-mediated disulfide reduction and transnitrosylation, we found that Trx1 regulates the expression of a limited number of proteins. Among the proteins found to be upregulated in this study was SET and MYND domain-containing protein 1 (SMYD1), a lysine methyltransferase highly expressed in cardiac and other muscle tissues and an important regulator of cardiac development. The observation of SMYD1 induction by Trx1 following thoracic aortic constriction stress is consistent with the retrograde fetal gene cardiac protection hypothesis. The results presented here suggest for the first time that, in addition to being a master redox regulator of protein disulfide bonds and nitrosation, Trx1 may also modulate lysine methylation, a non-redox post-translational modification, via the regulation of SMYD1 expression. Such crosstalk between redox signaling and a non-redox PTM regulation may provide novel insights into the functions of Trx1 that are independent from its immediate function as a protein reductase.",

DBPs bind to the connective tissue proteoglycan decorin and facilitate tissue colonization by the bacterium. Although structural and biochemical properties of DBPA are well understood, little is known about DBPB. In current work, we determined the solution structure of DBPB from strain B31 of B. burgdorferi and characterized its interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Our structure shows that DBPB adopts the same topology as DBPA, but possesses a much shorter terminal helix, resulting in a longer unstructured C-terminal tail, which is also rich in basic amino acids. Characterization of DBPB\u2013GAG interactions reveals that, despite similar GAG affinities of DBPA and DBPB, the primary GAG-binding sites in DBPB are different from DBPA. In particular, our results indicate that lysines in the C-terminus of DBPB are vital to DBPB's ability to bind GAGs whereas C-terminal tail for DBPA from strain B31 only plays a minor role in facilitating GAG bindings. Furthermore, the traditional GAG-binding pocket important to DBPA\u2013GAG interactions is only secondary to DBPB's GAG-binding ability.",

LC\u2013MS/MS analysis of the peptides derived from in-gel proteolytic digestion of the protein subunit identifies K196 of PmoC as the site of acetylation. No evidence is obtained for chemical modification of the PmoA or PmoB subunit. The inactivation of pMMO by a single adduct in the transmembrane PmoC domain is intriguing given the complexity of the structural fold of this large membrane\u2013protein complex as well as the complicated roles played by the various metal cofactors in the enzyme catalysis. Computational studies suggest that the entry of hydrophobic substrates to, and migration of products from, the catalytic site of pMMO are controlled tightly within the transmembrane domain. Support of these conclusions is provided by parallel experiments with two related alkynes: propyne (CH3CCH) and trifluoropropyne (CF3CCH). Finally, we discuss the implication of these findings to the location of the catalytic site in pMMO.",

     "abstract": "Multicopper oxidases (MCOs) catalyze the oxidation of a diverse group of metal ions and organic substrates by successive single-electron transfers to O2 via four bound Cu ions. MnxG, which catalyzes MnO2 mineralization by oxidizing both Mn(II) and Mn(III), is unique among multicopper oxidases in that it carries out two energetically distinct electron transfers and is tightly bound to accessory proteins. There are two of these, MnxE and MnxF, both approximately 12\u00a0kDa. Although their sequences are similar to those found in the genomes of several Mn-oxidizing Bacillus species, they are dissimilar to those of proteins with known function. Here, MnxE and MnxF are co-expressed independent of MnxG and are found to oligomerize into a higher order stoichiometry, likely a hexamer. They bind copper and heme, which have been characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and UV\u2013visible (UV\u2013vis) spectrophotometry. Cu is found in two distinct type 2 (T2) copper centers, one of which appears to be novel; heme is bound as a low-spin species, implying coordination by two axial ligands. MnxE and MnxF do not oxidize Mn in the absence of MnxG and are the first accessory proteins to be required by an MCO. This may indicate that Cu and heme play roles in electron transfer and/or Cu trafficking.",

Soluble oligomers of the A\u03b2 peptide underlie a cascade of neuronal loss and dysfunction associated with Alzheimer's disease. Single particle analyses of A\u03b2 oligomers in solution by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) were used to provide real-time descriptions of how spin-labeled fluorenes (SLFs; bi-functional small molecules that block the toxicity of A\u03b2) prevent and disrupt oligomeric assemblies of A\u03b2 in solution. Furthermore, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of untreated A\u03b2 shows a continuous, progressive change over a 24-hour period, while the spectrum of A\u03b2 treated with SLF remains relatively constant following initial incubation. These findings suggest the conformation of A\u03b2 within the oligomer provides a complementary determinant of A\u03b2 toxicity in addition to oligomer growth and size. Although SLF does not produce a dominant state of secondary structure in A\u03b2, it does induce a net reduction in beta secondary content compared to untreated samples of A\u03b2. The FCS results, combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and CD spectroscopy, demonstrate SLFs can inhibit the growth of A\u03b2 oligomers and disrupt existing oligomers, while retaining A\u03b2 as a population of smaller, yet largely disordered oligomers.",

One novel 37-kDa protein seems to be associated to the IgE-binding profile of a group of patients suffering allergy to peach and olive pollen. Three previously described olive pollen allergens exhibit very similar molecular mass. Our objective was to identify this allergen by using immunoproteomic approaches. After 2D-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, peptide sequences from several IgE-binding spots, allowed identifying this new allergen, as well as cloning and DNA sequencing of the corresponding gene. The allergen, named Ole e 12, is a polymorphic isoflavone reductase-like protein of 308 amino acids showing 80% and 74% identity with birch and pear allergens, Bet v 6 and Pyr c 5, respectively. A prevalence of 33% in the selected population is in contrast to 4%\u201310% in groups of subjects suffering from pollinosis. Recombinant allergen was produced in Escherichia coli, and deeply characterised. Immunoblotting and ELISA detection as well as inhibition experiments were performed with polyclonal antisera and allergic patients' sera. The recombinant allergen retains the IgE reactivity of its natural counterpart. Close structural and immunological relationships between members of this protein family were supported by their IgG recognition in vegetable species.In summary, Ole e 12 is a minor olive pollen allergen, which gains relevance in patients allergic to peach with olive pollinosis. Proteomic approaches used to analyse this allergen provide useful tools to identify hidden allergens, relevant for several allergic populations and thus complete allergenic panels.",

We investigated the conformational changes that asyn undergoes in the presence of membrane and membrane mimetics using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). In solution, asyn is monomeric and unfolded assuming an ensemble of conformers spanning extended and compact conformations. Using the contrast variation technique and SANS, the protein scattering signal in the membrane\u2013protein complexes is selectively highlighted in order to monitor its conformational changes in this environment. We showed that in the presence of phospholipid membranes asyn transitions from a monodisperse state to aggregated structures with sizes ranging from 200 to 900\u00a0\u00c5 coexisting with the monomeric species. Detailed SANS data analysis revealed that asyn aggregates have a hierarchical organization in which clusters of smaller asyn aggregates assemble to form the larger structures. This study provides new insight into the mechanism of asyn aggregation. We propose an aggregation mechanism in which stable asyn aggregates seed the aggregation process and hence the hierarchical assembly of structures. Our findings demonstrate that membrane-induced conformational changes in asyn lead to its heterogeneous aggregation which could be physiologically relevant in its function or in the diseased state.",

     "abstract": "Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) induced cross-linking of proteins has been reported to proceed through formation of di-tyrosine cross-links. In the case of low molar mass phenolic substrates, the enzymatic oxidation is reported to lead to polymerization of the phenols. The aim of this work was to investigate if during oxidative cross-linking of proteins oligo-tyrosine cross-links are formed in addition to dityrosine. To this end, \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA) was cross-linked using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The reaction products were acid hydrolysed, after which the cross-linked amino acids were investigated by LC-MS and MALDI-MS. To test the effect of the size of the substrate, the cross-linking reaction was also performed with L-tyrosine, N-acetyl L-tyrosinamide and angiotensin. These products were analyzed by LC-MS directly, as well as after acid hydrolysis. In the acid hydrolysates of all samples oligo-tyrosine (Yn, n\u00a0=\u00a03\u20138) was found in addition to di-tyrosine (Y2). Two stages of cross-linking of \u03b1-LA were identified: a) 1\u20132 cross-links were formed per monomer until the monomers were converted into oligomers, and b) subsequent cross-linking of oligomers formed in the first stage to form nanoparticles containing 3\u20134 cross-links per monomer. The transition from first stage to the second stage coincided with the point where di-tyrosine started to decrease and more oligo-tyrosines were formed. In conclusion, extensive polymerization of \u03b1-LA using HRP via oligo-tyrosine cross-links is possible, as is the case for low molar mass tyrosine containing substrates.",

An observed hydrogen bond between 2-hydroxybiphenyl and His48 in the active site confirmed the previously suggested role of this residue in substrate deprotonation. The entrance to the active site was confirmed by generating variant G255F which exhibited only 7% of the wild-type's specific activity of product formation, suggesting inhibition of substrate entrance into the active site by the large aromatic residue. Residue Arg242 is suggested to facilitate FAD movement and reduction as was previously reported in studies on the homologous protein para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. In addition, it is suggested that Trp225, which is located in the active site, facilitates proper substrate entrance into the binding pocket in contrast to aklavinone-11-hydroxylase and para-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in which a residue at a similar position is responsible for substrate deprotonation.

We designed a number of TlL mutants to promote interactions via interfaces detected in the crystal-lattice structure, through strengthening of hydrophobic, polar or electrostatic contacts or truncation of sterically blocking residues. We identify a mutant predicted to lead to increased interfacial hydrophobic contacts (N92F) that shows markedly increased self-association properties on native gradient gels. While wildtype TlL mainly forms monomer and <\u00a05% dimers, N92F forms stable trimers and dimers according to Size-Exclusion Chromatography and Small-Angle X-ray Scattering. These oligomers account for ~\u00a025% of the population and their enzymatic activity is comparable to that of the monomer. Self-association stabilizes TlL against thermal denaturation. Furthermore, the trimer is stable to dilution and requires high concentrations (>\u00a02\u00a0M) of urea to dissociate.

Later, the unique level of detail KIEs provided led to deeper questions about the potential role of protein motions in PTP catalysis. The recent discovery that such motions are responsible for different catalytic rates between PTPs arose from questions originating from KIE data showing that the transition states and chemical mechanisms are identical, combined with structural data demonstrating superimposable active sites.

     "abstract": "\u03b2-Glucosidase from sweet almond is a retaining, family 1, glycohydrolase. It is known that glycosylation of the enzyme by aryl glucosides occurs with little, if any, acid catalysis. For this reaction both the solvent and \u03b1-secondary kinetic isotope effects are 1.0. However, for the deglucosylation reaction (e.g., kcat for 2,4-dinitrophenyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside) there is a small solvent deuterium isotope effect of 1.50 (\u00b1\u00a00.06) and an \u03b1-secondary kinetic isotope effect of 1.12 (\u00b1\u00a00.03). For aryl glucosides, kcat/KM is very sensitive to the pKa of the phenol leaving group [\u03b2lg\u00a0\u2248\u00a0\u2212\u00a01; Dale et al., Biochemistry25 (1986) 2522\u20132529]. With alkyl glucosides the \u03b2lg is smaller (between \u2212\u00a00.2 and \u2212\u00a00.3) but still negative. This, coupled with the small solvent isotope effect on the pH-independent second-order rate constant for the glucosylation of the enzyme with 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl-\u03b2-glucoside [D2O(kcat/KM)\u00a0=\u00a01.23 (\u00b1\u00a00.04)] suggests that there is more glycone\u2013aglycone bond fission than aglycone oxygen protonation in the transition state for alkyl glycoside hydrolysis. The kinetics constants for the partitioning (between water and various alcohols) of the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate, coupled with the rate constants for the forward (hydrolysis) reaction provide an estimate of the stability of the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate. This is a relatively stable species with an energy about 2 to 4\u00a0kcal/mol higher than that of the ES complex.

     "abstract": "Enzymatic reactions are integral components in many biological functions and malfunctions. The iconic structure of each reaction path for elucidating the reaction mechanism in details is the molecular structure of the rate-limiting transition state (RLTS). But RLTS is very hard to get caught or to get visualized by experimentalists. In spite of the lack of explicit molecular structure of the RLTS in experiment, we still can trace out the RLTS unique \u201cfingerprints\u201d by measuring the isotope effects on the reaction rate. This set of \u201cfingerprints\u201d is considered as a most direct probe of RLTS. By contrast, for computer simulations, oftentimes molecular structures of a number of TS can be precisely visualized on computer screen, however, theoreticians are not sure which TS is the actual rate-limiting one. As a result, this is an excellent stage setting for a perfect \u201cmarriage\u201d between experiment and theory for determining the structure of RLTS, along with the reaction mechanism, i.e., experimentalists are responsible for \u201cfingerprinting\u201d, whereas theoreticians are responsible for providing candidates that match the \u201cfingerprints\u201d. In this Review, the origin of isotope effects on a chemical reaction is discussed from the perspectives of classical and quantum worlds, respectively (e.g., the origins of the inverse kinetic isotope effects and all the equilibrium isotope effects are purely from quantum). The conventional Bigeleisen equation for isotope effect calculations, as well as its refined version in the framework of Feynman's path integral and Kleinert's variational perturbation (KP) theory for systematically incorporating anharmonicity and (non-parabolic) quantum tunneling, are also presented. In addition, the outstanding interplay between theory and experiment for successfully deducing the RLTS structures and the reaction mechanisms is demonstrated by applications on biochemical reactions, namely models of bacterial squalene-to-hopene polycyclization and RNA 2\u2032-O-transphosphorylation. For all these applications, we used our recently-developed path-integral method based on the KP theory, called automated integration-free path-integral (AIF-PI) method, to perform ab initio path-integral calculations of isotope effects. As opposed to the conventional path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) and Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, values calculated from our AIF-PI path-integral method can be as precise as (not as accurate as) the numerical precision of the computing machine. Lastly, comments are made on the general challenges in theoretical modeling of candidates matching the experimental \u201cfingerprints\u201d of RLTS.

     "abstract": "Divalent metal ions, due to their ability to stabilize high concentrations of negative charge, are important for RNA folding and catalysis. Detailed models derived from the structures and kinetics of enzymes and from computational simulations have been developed. However, in most cases the specific catalytic modes involving metal ions and their mechanistic roles and effects on transition state structures remain controversial. Valuable information about the nature of the transition state is provided by measurement of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). However, KIEs reflect changes in all bond vibrational modes that differ between the ground state and transition state. QM calculations are therefore essential for developing structural models of the transition state and evaluating mechanistic alternatives. Herein, we present computational models for Zn2\u00a0+ binding to RNA 2\u2032O-transphosphorylation reaction models that aid in the interpretation of KIE experiments. Different Zn2\u00a0+ binding modes produce distinct KIE signatures, and one binding mode involving two zinc ions is in close agreement with KIEs measured for non-enzymatic catalysis by Zn2\u00a0+ aquo ions alone. Interestingly, the KIE signatures in this specific model are also very close to those in RNase A catalysis. These results allow a quantitative connection to be made between experimental KIE measurements and transition state structure and bonding, and provide insight into RNA 2\u2032O-ransphosphorylation reactions catalyzed by metal ions and enzymes.

     "abstract": "The well-studied mechanism of ribonuclease A is believed to involve concerted general acid\u2013base catalysis by two histidine residues, His12 and His119. The basic features of this mechanism are often cited to explain rate enhancement by both protein and RNA enzymes that catalyze RNA 2\u2032-O-transphosphorylation. Recent kinetic isotope effect analyses and computational studies are providing a more chemically detailed description of the mechanism of RNase A and the rate limiting transition state. Overall, the results support an asynchronous mechanism for both solution and ribonuclease catalyzed reactions in which breakdown of a transient dianoinic phosphorane intermediate by 5\u2032OP bond cleavage is rate limiting. Relative to non-enzymatic reactions catalyzed by specific base, a smaller KIE on the 5\u2032O leaving group and a less negative \u03b2LG are observed for RNase A catalysis. Quantum mechanical calculations consistent with these data support a model in which electrostatic and H-bonding interactions with the non-bridging oxygens and proton transfer from His119 render departure of the 5\u2032O less advanced and stabilize charge buildup in the transition state. Both experiment and computation indicate advanced 2\u2032OP bond formation in the rate limiting transition state. However, this feature makes it difficult to resolve the chemical steps involved in 2\u2032O activation. Thus, modeling the transition state for RNase A catalysis underscores those elements of its chemical mechanism that are well resolved, as well as highlighting those where ambiguity remains.

Conformation is a key concept for understanding how functional activity, inhibition and sequence are linked. We assemble and annotate the mammalian structural kinome from the Protein Data Bank on the basis of a universal residue nomenclature. We identify a torsion angle around the Gly of the DFG-motif whose sharp distribution profile corresponds to three eclipsed conformations. This allows the definition a small set of clusters whose distribution shows a bias for the active conformation. A common rationale links the active and inactive state: stabilization of the active conformation, as well as inactivation by displacement of helix-\u03b1C or the DFG-motif is governed by the interaction between helix-\u03b1C and the DFG motif. In particular, the conformation of the DFG-motif is tightly correlated with the propensity of helix-\u03b1C displacement. Our analysis reveals detailed mechanisms for the displacement of helix-\u03b1C and the DFG and improves our understanding of the role of individual residues. By pooling conformations from the whole structural kinome, the energetic contributions of sequence and extrinsic factors can be estimated in free energy analyses.

The hallmark signature of an active kinase is a hydrophobic spine called the regulatory (R) spine, which consists of four residues, two in the N-lobe and two in the C-lobe. RS1 is in the catalytic loop, RS2 is the Phe in the DFG motif, RS3 is at the C-terminus of the \u03b1C-Helix, and RS4 is at the beginning of \u03b24. Assembly of the R-spine is typically facilitated by phosphorylation of the Activation Loop. The assembled R-spine brings together all of the functional motifs that are essential for transferring the phosphate from ATP to a tethered protein substrate. This includes the G-Loop, which anchors the ATP, the catalytic loop, the DFG motif fused to the Activation Loop, and the \u03b1C-Helix. We focus here on the properties of the \u03b1C-Helix showing 1) how residues communicate with different parts of the molecule, 2) how it is recruited to the active site as a consequence of assembling of the R-spine, and 3) how it is regulated by linkers/motifs/proteins that lie outside the conserved kinase core.

Here, we identify and classify CNB domain-containing proteins in eukaryotic genomes to understand the evolutionary basis for CNB domain functional divergence in pathogens. We identify 359 CNB domain-containing proteins in 31 pathogenic organisms and classify them into distinct subfamilies based on sequence similarity within the CNB domain as well as functional domains associated with the CNB domain. Our study reveals novel subfamilies with pathogen-specific variations in the phosphate-binding cassette.

     "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key reaction in the regulation of cellular events and is catalysed by over 500 protein kinases in humans. The activities of protein kinases are strictly controlled through a diverse set of mechanisms. Structural studies have shown that the conformation adopted by kinases in their active state is highly similar, whereas inactive kinases can adopt a variety of conformations. Many kinases are maintained in a catalytically inactive state through autoinhibition. This involves a conformation of the kinase active site that is unable to support catalysis and requires activation through a signal such as binding of a regulatory protein. In this review, we briefly summarise some of the well-established autoinhibitory mechanisms and then focus on a relatively unexplored mode of autoinhibition that was first discovered in the Nek family of kinases and is also relevant to IRE1. This involves a tyrosine side-chain that blocks the active site and which must undergo a conformational change to enable kinase activity. We have termed this the Tyr-down autoinhibitory mechanism. We summarise the evidence for this mechanism and describe its role in kinase inhibitor design. Finally, we survey the kinome to identify other kinases with the potential to be governed by an autoinhibitory Tyr-down mechanism.

This is increasingly enabled by the growing availability of potent compounds and kinome-wide binding data. Assessing the prospects for adapting known compounds to new therapeutic uses is thus a key priority for current drug discovery efforts. Tools that can successfully link the diverse information regarding target sequence, structure, and ligand binding properties now accompany a transformation of protein kinase inhibitor research, away from single, block-buster drug models, and toward \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d with niche applications and highly specialized research groups. Major hurdles for the transformation to data driven drug discovery include mismatches in data types, and disparities of methods and molecules used; at the core remains the problem that ligand binding energies cannot be predicted precisely from individual structures. However, there is a growing body of experimental data for increasingly successful focussing of efforts: focussed chemical libraries, drug repurposing, polypharmacological design, to name a few.Protein kinase target similarity is easily quantified by sequence, and its relevance to ligand design includes broad classification by key binding sites, evaluation of resistance mutations, and the use of surrogate proteins.

Kinase signaling pathways are coordinated by scaffolding proteins that orchestrate the assembly of multi-protein complexes. One family of such scaffolding proteins are the A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). AKAPs share the commonality of binding cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In addition, they bind further signaling proteins and kinase substrates and tether such multi-protein complexes to subcellular locations. The A-kinase binding (AKB) domain of AKAPs typically contains a conserved helical motif that interacts directly with the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain of the regulatory subunits of PKA. Based on a pull-down proteomics approach, we identified neurochondrin (neurite-outgrowth promoting protein) as a previously unidentified AKAP.

     "abstract": "A SILAC analysis performed on HEK-293T cells either treated or not for 3\u00a0h with the CK2 inhibitor quinalizarin (QZ) led to the quantification of 53 phosphopeptides whose amount was reduced by 50% or more by QZ. These phosphopeptides include altogether 69 phosphoresidues, a large proportion of which (almost 50%) are generated by CK2, while the others do not conform to the CK2 consensus. Intriguingly QZ treatment also promotes a 50% or more increase of 108 phosphopeptides including altogether 117 phosphoresidues, 30% of which conform to the CK2 consensus. Here we disclose two mechanisms by which the level of certain phosphosites can be increased rather than decreased by QZ: one relies on the uneven dephosphorylation rate of phosphoresidues close to each other, causing, upon CK2 blockage, the decrease/disappearance of bis-phosphorylated peptides paralleled by the rise of one of its two singly phosphorylated derivatives; the other reflects the increased cellular concentration of a subset of proteins whose expression is substantially up-regulated by QZ treatment. These proteins do not include CK2 itself, whose subunit level is unaffected by QZ. They do include instead a number of substrates whose phosphorylation is increased upon QZ treatment, as well as several kinase/phosphatase regulators and a large number of components of the ribosomal and proteasomal machinery, a circumstance that may partially account for side effects of QZ not directly executed by CK2. Especially remarkable is the finding that all the components of the proteasomal catalytic core and of the PA28 complex committed to the degradation of the non-ubiquitinated proteins are increased, while those of the regulatory complex 19S conferring the ability to degrade the ubiquitinated proteins are unaffected.

     "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a nearly universal post-translation modification involved in a plethora of cellular events. Even though phosphorylation of extracellular proteins had been observed, the identity of the kinases that phosphorylate secreted proteins remained a mystery until only recently. Advances in genome sequencing and genetic studies have paved the way for the discovery of a new class of kinases that localize within the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus and the extracellular space. These novel kinases phosphorylate proteins and proteoglycans in the secretory pathway and appear to regulate various extracellular processes. Mutations in these kinases cause human disease, thus underscoring the biological importance of phosphorylation within the secretory pathway.

     "abstract": "Protein kinase CK2 is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic (\u03b1/\u03b1\u2032) and two regulatory (\u03b2) subunits. It has a global prosurvival function, especially in cancer, and represents an attractive therapeutic target. Most CK2 inhibitors available so far are ATP-competitive compounds; however, the possibility to block only the phosphorylation of few substrates has been recently explored, and a compound composed of a Tat cell-penetrating peptide and an active cyclic peptide, selected for its ability to bind to the CK2 substrate E7 protein of human papilloma virus, has been developed [Perea et al., Cancer Res. 2004; 64:7127\u20137129]. By using a similar chimeric peptide (CK2 modulatory chimeric peptide, CK2-MCP), we performed a study to dissect its molecular mechanism of action and the signaling pathways that it affects in cells. We found that it directly interacts with CK2 itself, counteracting the regulatory and stabilizing functions of the \u03b2 subunit. Cell treatment with CK2-MCP induces a rapid decrease of the amount of CK2 subunits, as well as of other signaling proteins. Concomitant cell death is observed, more pronounced in tumor cells and not accompanied by apoptotic events. CK2 relocalizes to lysosomes, whose proteases are activated, while the proteasome machinery is inhibited. Several sequence variants of the chimeric peptide have been also synthesized, and their effects compared to those of the parental peptide. Intriguingly, the Tat moiety is essential not only for cell penetration but also for the in vitro efficacy of the peptide. We conclude that this class of chimeric peptides, in addition to altering some properties of CK2 holoenzyme, affects several other cellular targets, causing profound perturbations of cell biology.

     "abstract": "The interaction of human CK2\u03b1 (hCK2\u03b1) with nine halogenated benzotriazoles, TBBt and its analogues representing all possible patterns of halogenation on the benzene ring of benzotriazole, was studied by biophysical methods. Thermal stability of protein\u2013ligand complexes, monitored by calorimetric (DSC) and optical (DSF) methods, showed that the increase in the mid-point temperature for unfolding of protein\u2013ligand complexes (i.e. potency of ligand binding to hCK2\u03b1) follow the inhibitory activities determined by biochemical assays.The dissociation constant for the ATP\u2013hCK2\u03b1 complex was estimated with the aid of microscale thermophoresis (MST) as 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0\u03bcM, and MST-derived dissociation constants determined for halogenated benzotriazoles, when converted according to known ATP concentrations, perfectly reconstruct IC50 values determined by the biochemical assays.Ligand-dependent quenching of tyrosine fluorescence, together with molecular modeling and DSC-derived heats of unfolding, support the hypothesis that halogenated benzotriazoles bind in at least two alternative orientations, and those that are efficient hCK2\u03b1 inhibitors bind in the orientation which TBBt adopts in its complex with maize CK2\u03b1.DSC-derived apparent heat for ligand binding (\u0394\u0394Hbind) is driven by intermolecular electrostatic interactions between Lys68 and the triazole ring of the ligand, as indicated by a good correlation between \u0394\u0394Hbind and ligand pKa. Overall results, additionally supported by molecular modeling, confirm that a balance of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions contribute predominantly (~\u00a040\u00a0kJ/mol), relative to possible intermolecular halogen/hydrogen bonding (less than 10\u00a0kJ/mol), in binding of halogenated benzotriazoles to the ATP-binding site of hCK2\u03b1.

     "abstract": "Fam20C is an atypical kinase implicated in bio-mineralization and phosphate homeostasis disorders, and has recently been shown to account for the activity of an orphan enzyme (\u201cgenuine casein kinase\u201d, G-CK) previously characterized for its ability to phosphorylate casein and a plethora of secreted proteins at serine residues specified by the S-x-E/pS motif. Fam20C/G-CK activity is only appreciable in the presence of high Mn2\u00a0+ concentration (>\u00a01\u00a0mM), and is negligible if Mn2\u00a0+ is replaced by physiological Mg2\u00a0+ concentrations. Here we show that sphingosine (but not its biological precursor ceramide) not only stimulates several-fold Fam20C activity in the presence of Mn2\u00a0+, but also confers a comparable activity to Fam20C assayed with Mg2\u00a0+. Activation by sphingosine is evident using a variety of substrates, and is accounted for by both higher Vmax and decreased Km(ATP), as judged from kinetics run with the \u03b2(28\u201340) substrate peptide and a physiological substrate, BMP-15. Sphingosine also protects Fam20C from thermal inactivation. Consistent with the in vitro results, by treating Fam20C expressing HEK293T cells with myriocin, a potent inhibitor of the sphingosine biosynthetic pathway, the activity of Fam20C released into the conditioned medium is substantially decreased corroborating the concept that sphingosine (or related metabolite(s)) is a co-factor required by Fam20C to optimally display its biological functions. None of the small molecule kinase inhibitors tested so far were able to inhibit Fam20C. Interestingly however fingolimod, an immunosuppressive drug structurally related to sphingosine, used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, is a powerful activator of Fam20C, both wild type and its pathogenic, loss of function, T268M mutant.

     "abstract": "This review analyzes how interplay between folate binding and changes in folate binding protein (FBP) conformation/self-association affects the biological function of FBP. Concentration-dependent, reversible self-association of hydrophobic apo-FBP at pI\u00a0=\u00a07.4 is associated with decreased affinity for folate, probably due to shielding of binding sites between interacting hydrophobic patches. Titration with folate removes apo-monomers, favoring dissociation of self-associated apo-FBP into apo-monomers. Folate anchors to FBP through a network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, and the binding induces a conformational change with formation of hydrophilic and stable holo-FBP. Holo-FBP exhibits a ligand-mediated concentration-dependent self-association into multimers of great thermal and chemical stability due to strong intermolecular forces. Both ligand and FBP are thus protected against biological/physicochemical decomposition. In biological fluids with low FBP concentrations, e.g., saliva, semen and plasma, hydrophobic apo-monomers and hydrophilic holo-monomers associate into stable asymmetrical complexes with aberrant binding kinetics unless detergents, e.g., cholesterol or phospholipids are present.",

Luciferase is a generic term for bioluminescent enzymes that catalyze the emission of light through the oxidization of a luciferin (also a generic term). Luciferase are not necessarily evolutionary related and do not share sequence or structural similarities. Some luciferases, such as those from fireflies and Renilla, have been thoroughly characterized and are being used in a wide range of applications in bio-imaging. Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps is the smallest known luciferase, and it is attracting much attention as a potential reporter protein. GLuc identification is relatively recent, and its structure and its biophysical properties remain to be fully characterized. Here, we review the bacterial production of natively folded GLuc with special emphasis on its disulfide bond formation and the re-engineering of its bioluminescence properties. We also compare the bioluminescent properties under a strictly controlled in vitro condition of selected GLuc's variants using extensively purified proteins with native disulfide bonds. Furthermore, we discuss and predict the domain structure and location of the catalytic core based on literature and on bioinformatics analysis. Finally, we review some examples of GLuc's emerging use in biomolecular imaging and biochemical assay systems.",

The family GH77 is a member of the \u03b1-amylase clan GH-H. The main difference discriminating a GH77 4-\u03b1-glucanotransferase from the main GH13 \u03b1-amylase family members is the lack of domain C succeeding the catalytic (\u03b2/\u03b1)8-barrel. Of more than 2400 GH77 members, bacterial amylomaltases clearly dominate with more than 2300 sequences; the rest being approximately equally represented by Archaea and Eucarya. The main goal of the present study was to deliver a detailed bioinformatics study of family GH77 (416 collected sequences) focused on amylomaltases from borreliae (containing unique sequence substitutions in functionally important positions) and plant DPE2 representatives (possessing an insert of ~\u00a0140 residues between catalytic nucleophile and proton donor). The in silico analysis reveals that within the genus of Borrelia a gradual evolutionary transition from typical bacterial Thermus-like amylomaltases may exist to family-GH77 amylomaltase versions that currently possess progressively mutated the most important and otherwise invariantly conserved positions. With regard to plant DPE2, a large group of bacterial amylomaltases represented by the amylomaltase from Escherichia coli with a longer N-terminus was identified as a probable intermediary connection between Thermus-like and DPE2-like (existing also among bacteria) family GH77 members. The presented results concerning both groups, i.e. amylomaltases from borreliae and plant DPE2 representatives (with their bacterial counterpart), may thus indicate the direction for future experimental studies.",

Here for the first time the molecular and cellular defects of G47R-Mi are reported. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the recombinant purified G47R-Mi variant exhibits only a 2.5-fold reduction of its kcat, and its apo form displays a remarkably decreased PLP binding affinity, increased dimer\u2013monomer equilibrium dissociation constant value, susceptibility to thermal denaturation and to N-terminal region proteolytic cleavage, and aggregation propensity.

Moreover, the intact and nicked forms have a peroxisomal and a mitochondrial localization, respectively. Unlike what already seen for G41R-Mi, exposure of G47R-Mi expressing cells to pyridoxine (PN) remarkably increases the expression level and the specific activity in a dose-dependent manner, reroutes all the protein to peroxisomes, and rescues its functionality. Although the mechanism of the different effect of PN on the variants G47R-Mi and G41R-Mi remains elusive, the chaperoning activity of PN may be of value in the therapy of patients bearing the G47R mutation.",

This coordinated expression indicated a unique and integrated system for degradation of not only crystalline cellulose but also other components of lignocellulolytic substrates, namely lignin and xylan. Activities of the identified proteins were confirmed by plate assays and activity measurements.

     "abstract": "Pepsin is initially produced as the zymogen pepsinogen, containing a 44 residue prosegment (PS) domain. When folded without the PS, pepsin forms a thermodynamically stable denatured state (refolded pepsin, Rp). To guide native folding, the PS binds to Rp, stabilizes the folding transition state, and binds tightly to native pepsin (Np), thereby driving the folding equilibrium to favor the native state. It is unknown whether these functionalities of the PS are encoded within the entire sequence or within discrete segments. PS residues 1p\u201329p correspond to a highly conserved region in pepsin-like aspartic proteases and we hypothesized that this segment is critical to PS-catalyzed folding. This notion was tested in the present study by characterizing the ability of various truncated PS peptides to bind Rp, catalyze folding from Rp to Np, and to inhibit Np. Four PS truncations were examined, corresponding to PS residues 1p\u201316p (PS1\u201316), 1p\u201329p (PS1\u201329), 17p\u201344p (PS17\u201344) and 30p\u201344p (PS30\u201344). The three PS functionalities could be ascribed primarily to discrete regions within the highly conserved motif: 1p\u201316p dictated Rp binding, 17p\u201329p dictated Np binding/inhibition, while the entire 1p\u201329p dictated transition state binding/catalyzing folding. Conversely, PS30\u201344 played no obvious role in PS-catalyzed folding; it is hypothesized that this more variable region may serve as a linker between PS1\u201329 and the mature domain. The high sequence conservation of PS1\u201329 and its role in catalyzing pepsin folding strongly suggest that there is a conserved PS-catalyzed folding mechanism shared by pepsin-like aspartic proteases with this motif.",

     "abstract": "In this project, we studied some physicochemical properties of two different globin domains of the polymeric hemoglobin of the brine shrimp Artemia salina and compared them with those of the native molecule. Two domains (AsHbC1D1 and AsHbC1D5) were cloned and expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins as well as the native hemoglobin (AfHb) were purified from bacteria and frozen Artemia, respectively by standard chromatographic methods and assessed by SDS-PAGE. The heme environment of these proteins was studied by optical spectroscopy and ligand-binding kinetics (e.g. CO association and O2 binding affinity) were measured for the two recombinant proteins and the native hemoglobin. This indicates that the CO association rate for AsHbC1D1 is higher than that of AsHbC1D5 and AfHb, while the calculated P50 value for AsHbC1D1 is lower than that of AsHbC1D5 and AfHb. The geminate and bimolecular rebinding parameters indicate a significant difference between both domains. Moreover, EPR results showed that the heme pocket in AfHb is in a more closed conformation than the heme pocket in myoglobin. Finally, the reduction potential of \u2212\u00a00.13\u00a0V versus the standard hydrogen electrode was determined for AfHb by direct electrochemical measurements. It is about 0.06\u00a0V higher than the potential of the single domain AsHbC1D5. This work shows that each domain in the hemoglobin of Artemia has different characteristics of ligand binding.",

     "abstract": "Correct folding of proteins is crucial for cellular homeostasis. More than thirty percent of proteins contain one or more cofactors, but the impact of these cofactors on co-translational folding remains largely unknown. Here, we address the binding of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to nascent flavodoxin, by generating ribosome-arrested nascent chains that expose either the entire protein or C-terminally truncated segments thereof. The native \u03b1/\u03b2 parallel fold of flavodoxin is among the most ancestral and widely distributed folds in nature and exploring its co-translational folding is thus highly relevant. In Escherichia coli (strain BL21(DE3) \u0394tig::kan) FMN turns out to be limiting for saturation of this flavoprotein on time-scales vastly exceeding those of flavodoxin synthesis. Because the ribosome affects protein folding, apoflavodoxin cannot bind FMN during its translation. As a result, binding of cofactor to released protein is the last step in production of this flavoprotein in the cell. We show that once apoflavodoxin is entirely synthesized and exposed outside the ribosome to which it is stalled by an artificial linker containing the SecM sequence, the protein is natively folded and capable of binding FMN.",

NCS proteins vary in functional specificity, probably depending on the structure and conformation of their non-conserved C-terminal segments. Here, we investigated the role of the C-terminal segment in guanylate cyclase activating protein-2, GCAP2, an NCS protein controlling the Ca2\u00a0+-dependent regulation of photoreceptor guanylate cyclases. We obtained two chimeric proteins by exchanging C-terminal segments between GCAP2 and its photoreceptor homolog recoverin, a Ca2\u00a0+-sensor controlling rhodopsin kinase (RK) activity. The exchange affected neither the structural integrity of GCAP2 and recoverin nor the Ca2\u00a0+-sensitivity of GCAP2. Intrinsic fluorescence, circular dichroism, biochemical studies and hydrophobic dye probing revealed Ca2\u00a0+-dependent conformational transition of the C-terminal segment of GCAP2 occurring in the molecular environment of both proteins. In Ca2\u00a0+-GCAP2, the C-terminal segment was constrained and its replacement provided the protein with approximately two-fold inhibitory activity towards RK, suggesting that the segment contributes to specific target recognition by interfering with RK-binding. Upon Ca2\u00a0+-release, it became less constrained and more available for phosphorylation by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase. The transition from the Ca2\u00a0+-bound to the apo-state exposed hydrophobic sites in GCAP2, and was associated with its activating function without affecting its dimerization. The released C-terminal segment participated further in photoreceptor membrane binding making it sensitive to phosphorylation. Thus, the C-terminal segment in GCAP2 confers target selectivity, facilitates membrane binding and provides sensitivity of the membrane localization of the protein to phosphorylation by signaling kinases.",

In this study, we identify short (30-mer) single-stranded DNA aptamers as a novel class of potent inhibitors of Mtb-AHAS through an in vitro DNA-SELEX method. Among all tested aptamers, two candidate aptamers (Mtb-Apt1 and Mtb-Apt6) demonstrated the greatest inhibitory potential against Mtb-AHAS activity with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (28.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002 and 22.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001\u00a0nM respectively). Interestingly, inhibition kinetics analysis of these aptamers showed different modes of enzyme inhibition (competitive and mixed type of inhibition respectively). Secondary structure-guided mutational modification analysis of Mtb-Apt1 and Mtb-Apt6 identified the minimal region responsible for their inhibitory action and consequently led to 17-mer and 20-mer shortened aptamers that retained equivalent or greater inhibitory potential. Notably, a modeling and docking exercise investigated the binding site of these two potent inhibitory aptamers on the target protein and showed possible involvement of some key catalytic dimer interface residues of AHAS in the DNA\u2013protein interactions that lead to its potent inhibition. Importantly, these two short candidate aptamers, Mtb-Apt1 (17-mer) and Mtb-Apt6 (20-mer), also demonstrated significant growth inhibition against multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) strains of tuberculosis with very low MIC of 5.36\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 6.24\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively and no significant cytotoxicity against mammalian cell line.

However, the molecular determinants involved in substrate recognition by these enzymes are poorly defined. Here, we investigated the role of arginine 386 (chymotrypsin numbering c202), a surface-exposed residue on the FX catalytic domain. The naturally occurring FX386Cys mutant and FX386Ala variant were characterized. Despite the unpaired cysteine, recombinant (r)FX386Cys was efficiently secreted (88.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.3% of rFXwt) and possessed normal clearance in mice. rFX386Cys was also normally activated by FVIIa/TF and displayed intact amidolytic activity. In contrast, rFX386Cys activation by the FIXa/FVIIIa complex was 4.5-fold reduced, which was driven by a decrease in the kcat (1.6\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u2212\u00a04\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 vs 5.8\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u2212\u00a04\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, rFXwt). The virtually unaltered Km (70.6\u00a0nM vs 55.6\u00a0nM, rFXwt) suggested no major alterations in the FX substrate exosite. Functional assays in plasma supplemented with rFX386Cys indicated a remarkable reduction in the thrombin generation rate and thus in coagulation efficiency. Consistently, the rFX386Ala variant displayed similar biochemical features suggesting that global changes at position 386 impact the intrinsic pathway activation.These data indicate that the FXArg386 is involved in FIXa/FVIIIa-mediated FX activation and help in elucidating the bleeding tendency associated with the FX386Cys in a rare FX deficiency case. Taking advantage of the unpaired cysteine, the rFX386Cys mutant may be efficiently targeted by thiol-specific ligands and represent a valuable tool to study FX structure\u2013function relationships both in vitro and in vivo.",

Since it was extracted and isolated from Saponaria officinalis for the first time almost thirty years ago, the protein has been widely studied mainly for its potential applications in anti-tumour and anti-viral infection therapy. Like other RIPs, saporin-S6 is particularly effective in the form of immunotoxin conjugated with monoclonal antibodies and its chemico-physical characteristics made the protein a perfect candidate for the synthesis, development and use of saporin-S6-based chimeric toxins. The high stability of the protein against different denaturing agents has been broadly demonstrated, however, its complete thermal unfolding characterization has not already been performed. In this work we analyse in detail structure, thermostability and unfolding features by means of infrared spectroscopy coupled with two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy. Our data showed that saporin-S6 in solution at neutral pH exhibits a secondary structure analogue to that of the crystal and confirmed its good stability at moderately high temperatures, with a temperature of melting of 58\u00a0\u00b0C. Our results also demonstrated that the thermal unfolding process is non-cooperative and occurs in two steps, and revealed the sequence of the events that take place during the denaturation, showing a higher stability of the N-terminal domain of the protein.",

     "abstract": "Human microsomal glutathione transferase 2 (MGST2) is a trimeric integral membrane protein that belongs to the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family. The mammalian MAPEG family consists of six members where four have been structurally determined. MGST2 activates glutathione to form a thiolate that is crucial for GSH peroxidase activity and GSH conjugation reactions with electrophilic substrates, such as 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Several studies have shown that MGST2 is able to catalyze a GSH conjugation reaction with the epoxide LTA4 forming the pro-inflammatory LTC4. Unlike its closest homologue leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S), MGST2 appears to activate its substrate GSH using only one of the three potential active sites [Ahmad S, et al. (2013) Biochemistry. 52, 1755\u20131764]. In order to demonstrate and detail the mechanism of one-third of the sites reactivity of MGST2, we have determined the enzyme oligomeric state, by Blue native PAGE and Differential Scanning Calorimetry, as well as the stoichiometry of substrate and substrate analog inhibitor binding to MGST2, using equilibrium dialysis and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, respectively. Global simulations were used to fit kinetic data to determine the catalytic mechanism of MGST2 with GSH and CDNB (1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) as substrates. The best fit was observed with 1/3 of the sites catalysis as compared with a simulation where all three sites were active. In contrast to LTC4S, MGST2 displays a 1/3 the sites reactivity, a mechanism shared with the more distant family member MGST1 and recently suggested also for microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1.",

We show that for papain, replacing the terminal carboxylate group of a peptide inhibitor with a hydrogen atom decreases binding 3\u20134 fold while replacing an aldehyde or glyoxal group with a hydrogen atom decreases binding by 300,000\u20131,000,000 fold. Thiohemiacetal formation by papain with aldehyde or glyoxal inhibitors is shown to be ~\u00a010,000 times more effective than hemiacetal or hemiketal formation with chymotrypsin. It is shown using effective molarities, that for papain, thiohemiacetal stabilization is more effective with aldehyde inhibitors than with glyoxal inhibitors. The effective molarity obtained when papain is inhibited by an aldehyde inhibitor is similar to the effective molarity obtained when chymotrypsin is inhibited by glyoxal inhibitors showing that both enzymes can stabilize tetrahedral adducts by similar amounts. Therefore the greater potency of aldehyde and glyoxal inhibitors with papain is not due to greater thiohemiacetal stabilization by papain compared to the hemiketal and hemiacetal stabilization by chymotrypsin, instead it reflects the greater intrinsic reactivity of the catalytic thiol group of papain compared to the catalytic hydroxyl group of chymotrypsin. It is argued that while the hemiacetals and thiohemiacetals formed with the serine and cysteine proteases respectively can mimic the catalytic tetrahedral intermediate they are also analogues of the productive and non-productive acyl intermediates that can be formed with the cysteine and serine proteases.",

Within this aim, enzymes exhibiting various abilities to catalyze acyltransfer reaction in water/lipid systems have been identified. Among these, CpLIP2 from Candida parapsilosis has been characterized as a lipase/acyltransferase, able to catalyze acyltransfer reactions preferentially to hydrolysis in the presence of particularly low acyl acceptor concentration and high thermodynamic activity of water (aw\u00a0>\u00a00.9). Lipase/acyltransferases are thus of great interest, being able to produce new esters at concentrations above the thermodynamic equilibrium of hydrolysis/esterification with limited to no release of free fatty acids. Here, we present a 3D model of CpLIP2 based on homologies with crystallographic structures of Pseudozyma antarctica lipase A. Indeed, the two enzymes have 31% of identity in their primary sequence, yielding a same general structure, but different catalytic properties. The quality of the calculated CpLIP2 model was confirmed by several methods. Limited proteolysis confirmed the location of some loops at the surface of the protein 3D model. Directed mutagenesis also supported the structural model constructed on CAL-A template: the functional properties of various mutants were consistent with their structure-based putative involvement in the oxyanion hole, substrate specificity, acyltransfer or hydrolysis catalysis and structural stability. The CpLIP2 3D model, in comparison with CAL-A 3D structure, brings insights for the elucidation and improvement of the structural determinants involved in the exceptional acyltransferase properties of this promising biocatalyst and of homologous enzymes of the same family.",

Sequence alignments suggested that the \u201csalicylate 1,2-dioxygenase\u201d (SDO) from this strain is homologous to gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases found in bacteria, archaea and fungi. In the present study the catalytic mechanism of the SDO and gentisate 1,2-dioxygenases in general was analyzed based on sequence alignments, mutational and previously performed crystallographic studies and mechanistic comparisons with \u201cextradiol- dioxygenases\u201d which cleave aromatic nuclei in the 2,3-position. Different highly conserved amino acid residues that were supposed to take part in binding and activation of the organic substrates were modified in the SDO by site-specific mutagenesis and the enzyme variants subsequently analyzed for the conversion of salicylate, gentisate and 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoate. The analysis of enzyme variants which carried exchanges in the positions Arg83, Trp104, Gly106, Gln108, Arg127, His162 and Asp174 demonstrated that Arg83 and Arg127 were indispensable for enzymatic activity. In contrast, residual activities were found for variants carrying mutations in the residues Trp104, Gly106, Gln108, His162, and Asp174 and some of these mutants still could oxidize gentisate, but lost the ability to convert salicylate. The results were used to suggest a general reaction mechanism for gentisate-1,2-dioxygenases and to assign to certain amino acid residues in the active site specific functions in the cleavage of (substituted) salicylate(s).",

     "abstract": "Dengue fever is a re-emerging tropical disease and its severe form is caused by cross-reactivity between its four serotypes (DEN1, DEN2, DEN3 and DEN4). The third domain of the viral envelope protein (ED3) contains the two major putative epitopes and is a highly suitable model protein for examining the molecular determinants of a virus' sero-specificity. Here we examine d the sero-specificity and cross-reactivity of the immune response against DEN3 and DEN4 ED3 using six epitope grafted ED3 variants where the surface-exposed epitope residues from DEN3 ED3 were switched to those of DEN4 ED3 and vice versa. We prepared anti-DEN3 and anti-DEN4 ED3 serum by immunizing Swiss albino mice and measured their reactivities against all six grafted mutants. As expected, both sera exhibited strong reactivity against its own serotype's ED3, and little cross-reactivity against their counterpart serotype's ED3s. E2 played a major role in the sero-specificity of anti-DEN3 serum, whereas E1 was important for DEN4 ED3's sero-specificity. Next, the reactivity patterns corroborated our working hypothesis that sero-specificity could be transferred by grafting the surface exposed epitope residues from one serotype to the other. To analyze the above results from a structural viewpoint, we determined the crystal structure of a DEN4 ED3 variant, where E2 was grafted from DEN3 ED3, at 2.78\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and modeled the structures of the five remaining grafted variants by assuming that the overall backbone remained unchanged. The examination of the electrostatic and molecular surfaces of the variants suggested some further rationale for the sero-specificity of the immune responses.",

While the mechanism of myosin-linked regulation is sufficiently studied, there is still no consensus on the mechanism of actin-linked regulation. Earlier we showed a high degree of Ca2\u00a0+-sensitivity of thin filaments from the adductor muscle of the mussel Crenomytilus grayanus (Mytiloida). In order to elucidate the nature of this regulation, we isolated the fraction of minor proteins from the mussel thin filaments, which confers Ca2\u00a0+-sensitivity to reconstituted actomyosin\u2013tropomyosin. Proteins of this fraction, ABP-19, ABP-20, and ABP-28, were chromatographically purified and identified. According to the results of mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis, as well as by their functional properties, these mussel actin-binding proteins appeared to correspond to the troponin components from the skeletal muscles of vertebrates (TnC, TnI and TnT). The reconstituted mussel troponin complex confers to actomyosin\u2013tropomyosin more than 80% Ca2\u00a0+-sensitivity. The in vivo molar ratio of actin/tropomyosin/troponin was calculated to be 7:1:0.5, i.e., the content of troponin in mussel thin filaments is two times lower than in thin filaments of skeletal muscles of vertebrates. These data demonstrate that troponin-like regulation found in the catch muscle of the mussel C. grayanus is present at least in two suborders of bivalves: Pectinoida and Mytiloida.",

Some species of Photobacteria feature an additional gene, luxF, which shows similarity to luxA and luxB, the genes encoding the heterodimeric luciferase. Isolated dimeric LuxF binds four molecules of an unusually derivatized flavin, i.e., 6-(3\u2032-(R)-myristyl)-FMN (myrFMN). In the present study we have heterologously expressed LuxF in Escherichia coli BL21 in order to advance our understanding of the protein's binding properties and its role in photobacterial bioluminescence. Structure determination by X-ray crystallography confirmed that apo-LuxF possesses four preorganized binding sites, which are further optimized by adjusting the orientation of amino acid side chains. To investigate the binding properties of recombinant LuxF we have isolated myrFMN from Photobacterium leiognathi S1. We found that LuxF binds myrFMN tightly with a dissociation constant of 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0nM demonstrating that the purified apo-form of LuxF is fully competent in myrFMN binding. In contrast to LuxF, binding of myrFMN to luciferase is much weaker (Kd\u00a0=\u00a04.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0\u03bcM) enabling LuxF to prevent inhibition of the enzyme by scavenging myrFMN.

Currently, only biochemical evidence for the function of NRS/ER has been described. In this study, a crystal structure for Arabidopsis thaliana NRS/ER was determined, which is the first report of a eukaryotic rhamnose synthase with both epimerase and reductase activities. NRS/ER functions as a metal ion independent homodimer that forms through hydrophobic interactions via a four-helix bundle. Each monomer exhibits \u03b1/\u03b2 folding that can be divided into two regions, nucleotide cofactor binding domain and sugar substrate binding domain. The affinities of ligands with NRS/ER were measured using isothermal titration calorimetry, which showed that NRS/ER has a preference for dTDP over UDP, while the cofactor binding site has a similar affinity for NADH and NADPH. Structural analysis coupled to site-directed mutagenesis suggested C115 and K183 as the acid/base pair responsible for epimerization, while T113, Y144 and K148 are the conserved residues in reduction. These findings shed light on the molecular mechanism of NRS/ER and were helpful to explore other eukaryotic enzymes involved in L-Rha synthesis.",

Members of the ISWI family are involved in regulating the structure of cellular chromatin during times of transcription, translation, and repair. Current models for the nucleosome repositioning activity of ISWI and other chromatin remodelers require the translocation of the remodeling protein along double-stranded DNA through an ATP-dependent mechanism. Here we report results from spectrofluorometric stopped-flow experiments which demonstrate that ISWI displays very low processivity for free DNA translocation. By combining these results with those from experiments monitoring the DNA stimulated ATPase activity of ISWI we further demonstrate that the DNA translocation by ISWI is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The calculated coupling efficiency of 0.067\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.018\u00a0ATP/ISWI/bp is seemingly quite low in comparison to similar DNA translocases and we present potential models to account for this.

     "abstract": "Human chitotriosidase (HCHT) is one of two active glycoside hydrolase family 18 chitinases produced by humans. The enzyme is associated with several diseases and is thought to play a role in the anti-parasite responses of the innate immune system. HCHT occurs in two isoforms, one 50\u00a0kDa (HCHT50) and one 39\u00a0kDa variant (HCHT39). Common for both isoforms is a catalytic domain with the (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 TIM barrel fold. HCHT50 has an additional linker-region, followed by a C-terminal carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) classified as CBM family 14 in the CAZy database. To gain further insight into enzyme functionality and especially the effect of the CBM, we expressed both isoforms and compared their catalytic properties on chitin and high molecular weight chitosans. HCHT50 degrades chitin faster than HCHT39 and much more efficiently. Interestingly, both HCHT50 and HCHT39 show biphasic kinetics on chitosan degradation where HCHT50 is faster initially and HCHT39 is faster in the second phase. Moreover, HCHT50 produces distinctly different oligomer distributions than HCHT39. This is likely due to increased transglycosylation activity for HCHT50 due the CBM extending the positive subsites binding surface and therefore promoting transglycosylation. Finally, studies with both chitin and chitosan showed that both isoforms have a similarly low degree of processivity. Combining functional and structural features of the two isoforms, it seems that HCHT combines features of exo-processive and endo-nonprocessive chitinases with the somewhat unusual CBM14 to reach a high degree of efficiency, in line with its alleged physiological task of being a \u201ccomplete\u201d chitinolytic machinery by itself.",

While the low pH of endosome favors membrane interaction of the heavy chain (HC) for the formation of a membrane channel and translocation of the light chain (LC), the catalytic activity of the LC requires a neutral pH for cleavage of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex in the cytosol. In this study, we monitored secondary structural characteristics of LC, HC and holotoxin at individual pHs 4.5 and 7.2 and at the transition pH\u00a04.5 to 7.2 to identify the structural signatures underlying their function. The HC showed higher thermal stability at pH\u00a04.5 with a melting temperature (Tm) of 60.4\u00a0\u00b0C. The structural analysis of HC in the presence of liposomes showed no difference in ellipticity with that of HC at pH\u00a07.2 at 208 and 222\u00a0nm but a 25.2% decrease in ellipticity at 208\u00a0nm at acidic pH, indicating low pH-induced structural changes that might facilitate interaction with the membrane. Further, HC showed 18% release of K+ ions from liposomes at pH\u00a04.5 as against 6% at neutral pH, reinforcing its role in membrane channel formation. LC on the other hand, showed maximum ellipticity at pH\u00a07.2, a condition that is relevant to its endopeptidase activity in the cytosol of the neurons. Also, the similarity in the structures at pH\u00a07.2 and transition pH\u00a04.5 to 7.2 suggested that the flexibility acquired by the protein at low pH was reversible upon exposure to neutral pH for cleavage of SNARE proteins.",

Two main functions have been attributed to LEA proteins: membrane stabilization and enzyme protection. We have hypothesized previously that LEA7 from Arabidopsis thaliana may stabilize membranes because it interacts with liposomes in the dry state. Here we show that LEA7, contrary to this expectation, did not stabilize liposomes during drying and rehydration. Instead, it partially preserved the activity of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) during drying and freezing. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed no evidence of aggregation of LDH in the dry or rehydrated state under conditions that lead to complete loss of activity. To approximate the complex influence of intracellular conditions on the protective effects of a LEA protein in a convenient in-vitro assay, we measured the activity of two Arabidopsis enzymes (glucose-6-P dehydrogenase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase) in total soluble leaf protein extract (Arabidopsis soluble proteome, ASP) after drying and rehydration or freezing and thawing. LEA7 partially preserved the activity of both enzymes under these conditions, suggesting its role as an enzyme protectant in vivo. Further FTIR analyses indicated the partial reversibility of protein aggregation in the dry ASP during rehydration. Similarly, aggregation in the dry ASP was strongly reduced by LEA7. In addition, mixtures of LEA7 with sucrose or verbascose reduced aggregation more than the single additives, presumably through the effects of the protein on the H-bonding network of the sugar glasses.",

The CH3 domain is the C-terminal domain of the heavy chain of IgG1. The disulfide bonds of some of the CH3 domains are known to be reduced in recombinant human monoclonal antibodies. The lack of intramolecular disulfide bonds may decrease the stability and increase the aggregation propensity of an antibody molecule. To investigate the effects of a reduced disulfide bond in the CH3 domain on conformational stability and aggregation propensity, we performed several physicochemical measurements including circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and 2D NMR. DSC measurements showed that both the stability and reversibility of the reduced form were lower than those of the oxidized form. In addition, detailed analyses of the thermal denaturation data revealed that, although a dominant fraction of the reduced form retained a stable dimeric structure, some fractions assumed a less-specifically associated oligomeric state between monomers.

Here, the broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody 2G12 was class-switched to IgM and then further engineered by introduction of 17 germline residues. The impact of these changes on the structure and conformational stability of the antibody was then assessed using a range of biophysical techniques. We also investigated the effects of the class switch and germline substitutions on the ligand-binding properties of 2G12 and its capacity for HIV-1 neutralization. Our results demonstrate that the introduced germline residues improve the conformational and thermal stability of 2G12-IgM without altering its overall shape and ligand-binding properties.

With the gap between experimentally characterized and uncharacterized proteins continuing to widen, it is necessary to develop new computational methods and tools for protein structural information that is directly related to function.

However, translation of the NMR spectral parameters to even low-resolution structural information such as protein class requires multiple time consuming steps. In this paper, we present an unorthodox method to predict the protein structural class directly by using the residue's averaged chemical shifts (ACS) based on machine learning algorithms. Experimental chemical shift information from 1491 proteins obtained from Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) and their respective protein structural classes derived from structural classification of proteins (SCOP) were used to construct a data set with 119 attributes and 5 different classes. Twenty four different classification schemes were evaluated using several performance measures. Overall the residue based ACS values can predict the protein structural classes with 80% accuracy measured by Matthew correlation coefficient. Specifically protein classes defined by mixed \u03b1\u03b2 or small proteins are classified with >\u00a090% correlation. Our results indicate that this NMR-based method can be utilized as a low-resolution tool for protein structural class identification without any prior chemical shift assignments.",

     "abstract": "Pharmacological chaperones are small compounds that correct the folding of mutant proteins, and represent a promising therapeutic strategy for misfolding diseases. We have performed a screening of 10,000 compounds searching for pharmacological chaperones of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamines. A large number of compounds bound to human TH, isoform 1 (hTH1), but only twelve significantly protected wild-type (hTH1-wt) and mutant TH-R233H (hTH1-p.R202H), associated to the rare neurological disorder TH deficiency (THD), from time-dependent loss of activity. Three of them (named compounds 2, 4 and 5) were subjected to detailed characterization of their functional and molecular effects. Whereas compounds 2 and 4 had a characteristic pharmacological chaperone (stabilizing) effect, compound 5 protected the activity in a higher extent than expected from the low conformational stabilization exerted on hTH1. Compounds 4 and 5 were weak competitive inhibitors with respect to the cofactor BH4 and, as seen by electron paramagnetic resonance, they induced small changes to the first coordination sphere of the catalytic iron. Molecular docking also indicated active-site location with coordination to the iron through a pyrimidine nitrogen atom. Interestingly, compound 5 increased TH activity in cells transiently transfected with either hTH1-wt or the THD associated mutants p.L205P, p.R202H and p.Q381K without affecting the steady-state TH protein levels. This work revealed different mechanisms for the action of pharmacological chaperones and identifies a subtype of compounds that preserve TH activity by weak binding to the catalytic iron.

     "abstract": "The global carbon cycle depends on the biological transformations of C1 compounds, which include the reductive incorporation of CO2 into organic molecules (e.g. in photosynthesis and other autotrophic pathways), in addition to the production of CO2 from formate, a reaction that is catalyzed by formate dehydrogenases (FDHs). FDHs catalyze, in general, the oxidation of formate to CO2 and H+. However, selected enzymes were identified to act as CO2 reductases, which are able to reduce CO2 to formate under physiological conditions. This reaction is of interest for the generation of formate as a convenient storage form of H2 for future applications. Cofactor-containing FDHs are found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea, in addition to facultative anaerobic or aerobic bacteria. These enzymes are highly diverse and employ different cofactors such as the molybdenum cofactor (Moco), FeS clusters and flavins, or cytochromes. Some enzymes include tungsten (W) in place of molybdenum (Mo) at the active site. For catalytic activity, a selenocysteine (SeCys) or cysteine (Cys) ligand at the Mo atom in the active site is essential for the reaction. This review will focus on the characterization of Mo- and W-containing FDHs from bacteria, their active site structure, subunit compositions and its proposed catalytic mechanism. We will give an overview on the different mechanisms of substrate conversion available so far, in addition to providing an outlook on bio-applications of FDHs.

Therefore, their biogenesis is tightly regulated across a variety of organisms and environmental conditions. In Gram-negative bacteria, two pathways \u2013 ISC and SUF \u2013 concur for maintaining intracellular iron\u2013sulfur cluster balance. Recently, the mechanism of iron\u2013sulfur cluster biosynthesis regulation by IscR, an iron\u2013sulfur cluster-containing regulator encoded by the isc operon, was found to be conserved in some Gram-positive bacteria. Belonging to the Rrf2 family of transcriptional regulators, IscR displays a single helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain but is able to recognize two distinct DNA sequence motifs, switching its specificity upon cluster ligation. This review provides an overview of gene regulation by iron\u2013sulfur cluster-containing sensors, in the light of the recent structural characterization of cluster-less free and DNA-bound IscR, which provided insights into the molecular mechanism of nucleotide sequence recognition and discrimination of this unique transcription factor.

Previously, assays have relied upon the non-physiological reducing agents dithionite and dithiothreitol to assess function. We have addressed this shortcoming by using electron transfer between NADPH and ferredoxin-NADP-reductase to reduce ferredoxin. Our results show that this trio of electron transfer partners are sufficient to sustain the reaction in in vitro studies, albeit with a rate slower compared with DTT-mediated cluster assembly.

     "abstract": "Ferritin is a ubiquitous iron concentrating nanocage protein that functions through the enzymatic oxidation of ferrous iron and the reversible synthesis of a caged ferric-oxo biomineral. Among vertebrate ferritins, the bullfrog M homopolymer ferritin is a frequent model for analyzing the role of specific amino acids in the enzymatic reaction and translocation of iron species within the protein cage. X-ray crystal structures of ferritin in the presence of metal ions have revealed His54 binding to iron(II) and other divalent cations, with its imidazole ring proposed as \u201cgate\u201d that influences iron movement to/from the active site. To investigate its role, His54 was mutated to Ala. The H54A ferritin variant was expressed and its reactivity studied via UV\u2013vis stopped-flow kinetics. The H54A variant exhibited a 20% increase in the initial reaction rate of formation of ferric products with 2 or 4 Fe2\u00a0+/subunit and higher than 200% with 20 Fe2\u00a0+/subunit. The possible meaning of the increased efficiency of the ferritin reaction induced by this mutation is proposed taking advantage of the comparative sequence analysis of other ferritins. The data here reported are consistent with a role for His54 as a metal ion trap that maintains the correct levels of access of iron to the active site.

     "abstract": "The lysine-\u03b5-oxidase, LodA, and glycine oxidase, GoxA, from Marinomonas mediteranea each possesses a cysteine tryptophylquinone (CTQ) cofactor. This cofactor is derived from posttranslational modifications which are covalent crosslinking of tryptophan and cysteine residues and incorporation of two oxygen atoms into the indole ring of Trp. In this manuscript, it is shown that the recombinant synthesis of LodA and GoxA containing a fully synthesized CTQ cofactor requires coexpression of a partner flavoprotein, LodB for LodA and GoxB for GoxA, which are not interchangeable. An inactive precursor of LodA or GoxA which contained a monohydroxylated Trp residue and no crosslink to the Cys was isolated from the soluble fraction when they were expressed alone. The structure of LodA revealed an Asp residue close to the cofactor which is conserved in quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase (QHNDH), containing CTQ, and methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH) containing tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) as cofactor. To study the role of this residue in the synthesis of the LodA precursor, Asp-512 was mutated to Ala. When the mutant protein was coexpressed with LodB an inactive protein was isolated which was soluble and contained no modifications at all, suggesting a role for this Asp in the initial LodB-independent hydroxylation of Trp. A similar role had been proposed for this conserved Asp residue in MADH. It is noteworthy that the formation of TTQ in MADH from the precursor also requires an accessory enzyme for its biosynthesis but it is a diheme enzyme MauG and not a flavoprotein. The results presented reveal novel mechanisms of post-translational modification involved in the generation of protein-derived cofactors.

Moreover, through the activity of the NAD-dependent deacetylating sirtuins, NAD behaves as a beacon molecule that reports the cell metabolic state, and accordingly modulates transcriptional responses and metabolic adaptations. In this view, NAD biosynthesis emerges as a highly regulated process: it enables cells to preserve NAD homeostasis in response to significant NAD-consuming events and it can be modulated by various stimuli to induce, via NAD level changes, suitable NAD-mediated metabolic responses.

     "abstract": "In the brain, d-amino acid oxidase plays a key role in modulating the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation state, catalyzing the stereospecific degradation of the coagonist d-serine. A relationship between d-serine signaling deregulation, NMDAR dysfunction, and CNS diseases is presumed. Notably, the R199W substitution in human DAAO (hDAAO) was associated with familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and further coding substitutions, i.e., R199Q and W209R, were also deposited in the single nucleotide polymorphism database. Here, we investigated the biochemical properties of these different hDAAO variants. The W209R hDAAO variant shows an improved d-serine degradation ability (higher activity and affinity for the cofactor FAD) and produces a greater decrease in cellular d/(d\u00a0+\u00a0l) serine ratio than the wild-type counterpart when expressed in U87 cells. The production of H2O2 as result of excessive d-serine degradation by this hDAAO variant may represent the factor affecting cell viability after stable transfection. The R199W/Q substitution in hDAAO altered the protein conformation and enzymatic activity was lost under conditions resembling the cellular ones: this resulted in an abnormal increase in cellular d-serine levels. Altogether, these results indicate that substitutions that affect hDAAO functionality directly impact on d-serine cellular levels (at least in the model cell system used). The pathological effect of the expression of the R199W hDAAO, as observed in familial ALS, originates from both protein instability and a decrease in kinetic efficiency: the increase in synaptic d-serine may be mainly responsible for the neurotoxic effect. This information is expected to drive future targeted treatments.",

     "abstract": "Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP), the catalytically active form of vitamin B6, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes. In most organisms, PLP is recycled from nutrients and degraded B6-enzymes in a salvage pathway that involves pyridoxal kinase (PLK), pyridoxine phosphate oxidase and phosphatase activities. Regulation of the salvage pathway is poorly understood. Escherichia coli possesses two distinct pyridoxal kinases, PLK1, which is the focus of the present work, and PLK2. From previous studies dating back to thirty years ago, pyridoxal (PL) was shown to inhibit E. coli PLK1 forming a covalent link with the enzyme. This inhibition was proposed to play a regulative role in vitamin B6 metabolism, although its details had never been clarified. Recently, we have shown that also PLP produced during PLK1 catalytic cycle acts as an inhibitor, forming a Schiff base with Lys229, without being released in the solvent. The question arises as to which is the actual inhibition mechanism by PL and PLP. In the present work, we demonstrated that also PL binds to Lys229 as a Schiff base. However, the isolated covalent PLK1\u2013PL complex is not inactive but, in the presence of ATP, is able to catalyse the single turnover production of PLP, which binds tightly to the enzyme and is ultimately responsible for its inactivation. The inactivation mechanism mediated by Lys229 may play a physiological role in controlling cellular levels of PLP.

These reactions depend on the ability of PLP to stabilize, to a varying degree, \u03b1-carbanionic intermediates. Furthermore, oxidative decarboxylations and rearrangements suggest that PLP can stabilize radical intermediates as well. The reaction mechanisms of two PLP-dependent enzymes are discussed, kynureninase and tyrosine phenol-lyase (TPL). Kynureninase catalyzes a retro-Claisen reaction of kynurenine to give anthranilate and alanine. The key step, hydration of the \u03b3-carbonyl, is assisted by acid\u2013base catalysis with the phosphate of the PLP, mediated by a conserved tyrosine, and an oxyanion hole. TPL catalyzes the reversible elimination of phenol, a poor leaving group, from l-tyrosine.

Chemotherapy is particularly challenging because M. tuberculosis can persist in the lungs of infected individuals; estimates of the WHO indicate that about 1/3 of the world population is infected with latent tuberculosis providing a large reservoir for relapse and subsequent spread of the disease. Persistent M. tuberculosis shows considerable tolerance towards conventional antibiotics making treatment particularly difficult. In this phase the bacilli are exposed to oxygen and nitrogen radicals generated as part of the host response and redox-defense mechanisms are thus vital for the survival of the pathogen. Sulfur metabolism and de novo cysteine biosynthesis have been shown to be important for the redox homeostasis in persistent M. tuberculosis and these pathways could provide promising targets for novel antibiotics for the treatment of the latent form of the disease. Recent research has provided evidence for three de novo metabolic routes of cysteine biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis, each with a specific PLP dependent cysteine synthase with distinct substrate specificities. In this review we summarize our present understanding of these pathways, with a focus on the advances on functional and mechanistic characterization of mycobacterial PLP dependent cysteine synthases, their role in the various pathways to cysteine, and first attempts to develop specific inhibitors of mycobacterial cysteine biosynthesis.

This \u201ccysteine synthase\u201d complex is stabilized by insertion of the CysE C-terminus into the active-site of CysK. Remarkably, the CysK/CysE binding interaction is conserved in most bacterial and plant systems. For the past 40\u00a0years, CysK was thought to function exclusively in cysteine biosynthesis, but recent studies have revealed a repertoire of additional \u201cmoonlighting\u201d activities for this enzyme. CysK and its paralogs influence transcription in both Gram-positive bacteria and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. CysK also activates an antibacterial nuclease toxin produced by uropathogenic Escherichia coli. Intriguingly, each moonlighting activity requires a binding partner that invariably mimics the C-terminus of CysE to interact with the CysK active site.

These proteins were originally christened \u201csubgroup-II aminotransferases\u201d (AT-II) but are very often referred to as \u201cclass-III aminotransferases\u201d. As names suggest, the subgroup includes mainly transaminases, with just a few interesting exceptions. However, at variance with most other PLP-dependent enzymes, catalysts in this subfamily seem specialized at utilizing substrates whose amino function is not adjacent to a carboxylate group.AT-II enzymes are widespread in biology and play mostly catabolic roles. Furthermore, today several transaminases in this group are being used as bioorganic tools for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. We present an overview of the biochemical and structural features of these enzymes, illustrating how they are distinctive and how they compare with those of the other fold-type I enzymes.

It was replaced for phenylalanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The X-ray structure of the mutant enzyme was determined at 1.96\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Comparison of spatial structures and absorption spectra of wild-type and mutant holoenzymes demonstrated that the replacement did not result in essential changes of the conformation of the active site Tyr58Phe MGL. The Kd value of PLP for Tyr58Phe MGL proved to be comparable to the Kd value for the wild-type enzyme. The replacement led to a decrease of catalytic efficiencies in both \u03b3- and \u03b2-elimination reactions of about two orders of magnitude as compared to those for the wild-type enzyme. The rates of exchange of C-\u03b1- and C-\u03b2- protons of inhibitors in D2O catalyzed by the mutant form are comparable with those for the wild-type enzyme. Spectral data on the complexes of the mutant form with the substrates and inhibitors showed that the replacement led to a change of rate the limiting step of the physiological reaction.

     "abstract": "Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the \u03b1-decarboxylation of glutamate to \u03b3-aminobutyrate. A unique feature of plant GAD is the presence of a calmodulin (CaM)-binding domain at its C-terminus. In plants, transient elevation of cytosolic Ca2\u00a0+ in response to different types of stress is responsible for GAD activation via CaM. The crystal structure of GAD isoform 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGAD1) shows that the enzyme is a hexamer composed of a trimer of dimers. Herein, we show that in solution AtGAD1 is in a dimer\u2013hexamer equilibrium and estimate the dissociation constant (Kd) for the hexamer under different conditions. The association of dimers into hexamers is promoted by several conditions, including high protein concentrations and low pH. Notably, binding of Ca2\u00a0+/CaM1 abolishes the dissociation of the AtGAD1 oligomer. The AtGAD1 N-terminal domain is critical for maintaining the oligomeric state as removal of the first 24 N-terminal residues dramatically affects oligomerization by producing a dimeric enzyme. The deleted mutant retains decarboxylase activity, highlighting the dimeric nature of the basic structural unit of AtGAD1. Site-directed mutagenesis identified Arg24 in the N-terminal domain as a key residue since its mutation to Ala prevents hexamer formation in solution. Both dimeric mutant enzymes form a stable hexamer in the presence of Ca2\u00a0+/CaM1. Our data clearly reveal that the oligomeric state of AtGAD1 is highly responsive to a number of experimental parameters and may have functional relevance in vivo in the light of the biphasic regulation of AtGAD1 activity by pH and Ca2\u00a0+/CaM1 in plant cells.

Many advances have been made in revealing the mechanisms of heme-protein cross-link formation, as well as the structural and functional roles. Moreover, most of these cross-links have been successfully recreated in natural or de novo proteins. These tremendous progresses have not only enhanced our knowledge of how cross-links fine-tune the structure and function of natural heme proteins, but also provided us powerful strategies for design of artificial heme proteins with functionalities beyond those of natural heme proteins.",

     "abstract": "The BRICHOS domain is associated with human amyloid disease, and it efficiently prevents amyloid fibril formation of the amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2) in vitro and in vivo. Recombinant human prosurfactant protein C (proSP-C) BRICHOS domain forms a homotrimer as observed by x-ray crystallography, analytical ultracentrifugation, native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical size exclusion chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry. It was hypothesized that the trimer is an inactive storage form, as a putative substrate-binding site identified in the monomer, is buried in the subunit interface of the trimer. We show here increased dissociation of the BRICHOS trimer into monomers, by addition of detergents or of bis-ANS, known to bind to the putative substrate-binding site, or by introducing a Ser to Arg mutation expected to interfere with trimer formation. This leads to increased capacity to delay A\u03b242 fibril formation. Cross-linking of the BRICHOS trimer with glutaraldehyde, in contrast, renders it unable to affect A\u03b242 fibril formation. Moreover, proSP-C BRICHOS expressed in HEK293 cells is mainly monomeric, as detected by proximity ligation assay. Finally, proteolytic cleavage of BRICHOS in a loop region that is cleaved during proSP-C biosynthesis results in increased capacity to delay A\u03b242 fibril formation. These results indicate that modulation of the accessibility of the substrate-binding site is a means to regulate BRICHOS activity.",

In this work the role of the Gly717 residue, located in a \u03b1-helix structure bridging the active site and the linker domain, has been investigated mutating it in Phe. The mutation gives rise to drug resistance in vivo as observed through a viability assay of yeast cells. In vitro activity assays show that the mutant is characterized by a fast religation rate, only partially reduced by the presence of the drug. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of the native and mutant proteins indicate that the mutation of Gly717 affects the motion orientation of the linker domain, changing its interaction with the DNA substrate, likely affecting the strand rotation and religation rate. The mutation also causes a slight rearrangement of the active site and of the drug binding site, providing an additional explanation for the lowered effect of camptothecin toward the mutant.",

It catalyzes the monooxygenation of anthranoyl-CoA to 5-hydroxyl-2-aminobenzoyl-CoA and the subsequent reduction to the dearomatized product 2-amino-5-oxo-cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA. The two reactions occur in separate domains, termed the monooxygenase and reductase domain. Both domains were reported to utilize FAD as a cofactor for hydroxylation and reduction, respectively. We have heterologously expressed ACMR in Escherichia coli BL21 and found that the monooxygenase domain contains FAD. However, the reductase domain utilizes FMN and not FAD for the reduction of the intermediate 5-hydroxyl-2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. A homology model for the reductase domain predicted a topology similar to the Old Yellow Enzyme family, which exclusively bind FMN, in accordance with our results. Binding studies with 2- a mino b enzoyl-CoA (AbCoA) and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (pHB) as probes for the monooxygenase and reductase domain, respectively, indicated that two functionally distinct and independent active sites exist. Given the homodimeric quartenary structure of ACMR and the compact shape of the dimer as determined by small-angle X-ray scattering experiments we propose that the monooxygenase and reductase domain of opposite peptide chains are involved in the transformation of anthranoyl-CoA to 2-amino-5-oxo-cyclohex-1-ene-1-carbonyl-CoA.",

The FADS from Corynebacterium ammoniagenes, CaFADS, forms transient oligomers during catalysis. These oligomers are stabilized by several interactions between the RFK and FMNAT sites from neighboring protomers, which otherwise are separated in the monomeric enzyme. Among these inter-protomer interactions, the salt bridge between E268 at the RFK site and R66 at the FMNAT-module is particularly relevant, as E268 is the catalytic base of the kinase reaction. Here we have introduced point mutations at R66 to analyze the impact of the salt-bridge on ligand binding and catalysis. Interestingly, these mutations have only mild effects on ligand binding and kinetic properties of the FMNAT-module (where R66 is located), but considerably impair the RFK activity turnover. Substitutions of R66 also modulate the ratio between monomeric and oligomeric species and modify the quaternary arrangement observed by single-molecule methods. Therefore, our data further support the cross-talk between the RFK- and FMNAT-modules of neighboring protomers in the CaFADS enzyme, and establish the participation of R66 in the modulation of the geometry of the RFK active site during catalysis.",

Here we study the effect of zinc on the aggregation and conformational change of human prion protein (PrP). As revealed by thioflavin T binding assays, Sarkosyl-soluble SDS-PAGE, and transmission electron microscopy, aggregation of wild-type PrP in the absence of Zn2\u00a0+ undergoes four steps: amorphous aggregates, profibrils, mature fibrils, and fragmented fibrils. When the molar ratio of Zn2\u00a0+ to PrP was 9:1, however, aggregation of wild-type PrP undergoes another pathway in which wild-type PrP forms oligomers quickly and then forms short-rod aggregates. Unlike wild-type PrP, the octarepeats deletion mutant PrP\u0394octa forms typical mature fibrils either with or without zinc. As evidenced by isothermal titration calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and proteinase K digestion assays, Zn2\u00a0+ strongly binds to wild-type PrP monomers with the first binding constant exceeding 107\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 under denaturing conditions, and changes the conformation of wild-type PrP aggregates remarkably, but weakly binds to PrP\u0394octa with binding affinity around 104\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 and has no obvious effects on the conformation of PrP\u0394octa aggregates. Our data demonstrate that zinc significantly changes the aggregation pathway and the conformation of wild-type PrP aggregates mainly via interaction with its octarepeat region. Our findings could explain how zinc modifies pathological PrP conformation associated with prion diseases.",

     "abstract": "Imidazole binding to three apolar distal heme pocket mutants of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) has been investigated between pH\u00a04 and 8. The three CcP variants have Arg-48, Trp-51, and His-52 mutated to either all alanine, CcP(triAla), all valine, CcP(triVal), or all leucine residues, CcP(triLeu). The imidazole binding curves for all three mutants are biphasic indicating that each of the mutants exists in at least two conformational states with different affinities for imidazole. At pH\u00a07, the high-affinity conformations of the three CcP mutants bind imidazole between 3.8 and 4.7 orders of magnitude stronger than that of wild-type CcP while the low-affinity conformations have binding affinities about 2.5 orders of magnitude larger than wild-type CcP. Imidazole binding to the three CcP mutants is pH dependent with the strongest binding observed at high pH. Apparent pKa values for the transition in binding vary between 5.6 and 7.5 for the high-affinity conformations and between 6.2 and 6.8 for the low-affinity conformations of the CcP triple mutants. The kinetics of imidazole binding are also biphasic. The fast phase of imidazole binding to CcP(triAla) and CcP(triLeu) is linearly dependent on the imidazole concentration while the slow phase is independent of imidazole concentration. Both phases of imidazole binding to CcP(triVal) have a hyperbolic dependence on the imidazole concentration. The apparent association rate constants vary between 30 and 170\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 while the apparent dissociation rate constants vary between 0.05 and 0.43\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01.

Nevertheless, it is unclear what chemical sources of polyanionicity enable the binding by \u03b1X\u03b22. Osteopontin (OPN) is an intrinsically disordered protein, which facilitates phagocytosis via the integrin \u03b1X\u03b22. Unlike for other integrins, neither the RGD nor the SVVYGLR motifs account for this binding, and the molecular basis of OPN binding by \u03b1X\u03b22 remains uncharacterized. Here, we show that the monovalent interactions between the ligand-binding domain of \u03b1X\u03b22 and OPN, its fragments, or caseins are weak, with dissociation constants higher than 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M but with high apparent stoichiometries. From comparison with cell adhesion studies, the discrimination between \u03b1X\u03b22 ligands and non-ligands appears to rely on these apparent stoichiometries in a way, which involves glutamate rather than aspartate side chains. Surprisingly, the extensive, negatively charged phosphorylation of OPN is not contributing to \u03b1X\u03b22 binding. Furthermore, synchrotron radiation circular spectroscopy excludes that the phosphorylation affects the general folding of OPN. Taken together, our quantitative analyses reveal a mode of ligand recognition by integrin \u03b1X\u03b22, which seem to differ in principles considerably from other OPN receptors.",

In chelicerates, where phenoloxidases are lacking, phenoloxidase-activity can be induced in the oxygen carrier hemocyanin in vitro by proteolytic cleavage, incubation with the artificial inducer SDS, or lipids. The role of protein\u2013protein interaction has up to now received little attention. This is remarkable, as lipoproteins \u2014 complexes of proteins and lipids \u2014 are present at high concentrations in arthropod hemolymph. We characterized the three lipoproteins present in tarantula hemolymph, two high-density lipoproteins and one very high-density lipoprotein, and show that the two high-density lipoproteins have distinct structures: the more abundant high-density lipoprotein is an ellipsoid particle with axes of ~\u00a022.5\u00a0nm and ~\u00a016.8\u00a0nm, respectively. The second high-density lipoprotein, present only in trace amount, is a large discoidal lipoprotein with a diameter of ~\u00a038.4\u00a0nm and an on-edge thickness of ~\u00a07.1\u00a0nm. We further demonstrate that the interaction between lipoproteins and hemocyanin induces phenoloxidase activity in hemocyanin, and propose that this activation is due to protein\u2013protein interaction rather than protein\u2013lipid interaction, as neither lipid micelles nor lipid monomers were found to be activating. Activation was strongest in the presence of high-density lipoproteins; very high-density lipoproteins were found to be non-activating. This is the first time that the ability of lipoproteins to induce phenoloxidase activity of hemocyanin has been demonstrated, thus adding novel aspects to the function of lipoproteins apart from their known role in nutrient supply.",

We show that the majority of cellular Hfq cannot be extracted without detergents and that purified Hfq can be retained on hydrophobic matrices. Analyses of purified Hfq and the native Hfq complexes observed in whole-cell E. coli extracts indicate the existence of dodecameric assemblies likely stabilized by interlocking C-terminal polypeptides originating from separate Hfq hexamers and/or accessory nucleic acid. We demonstrate that cellular Hfq is redistributed between transcription complexes and an insoluble fraction that includes protein complexes harboring polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNP). This distribution pattern is consistent with a function at the interface of the apparatuses responsible for synthesis and degradation of RNA. Taken together with the results of prior studies, these results suggest that Hfq could function as an anchor/coupling factor responsible for de-solubilization of RNA and its tethering to the degradosome complex.",

To date, it remains challenging to obtain kinetic information for interactions between G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and small-molecule ligands in a label-free manner. Often GPCRs need to be solubilized or even stabilized by mutations which can be difficult and is time consuming. In addition, it is often unclear if the native conformation of the receptors is sustained.In this study, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and surface acoustic wave (SAW) technologies have been used to detect ligand binding to the GPCR chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) expressed in lipoparticles. We first evaluated different strategies to immobilize CXCR4-expressing lipoparticles. The highest small-molecule binding signal in SPR and SAW was achieved with a matrix-free carboxymethylated sensor chip coated with wheat germ agglutinin for lipoparticle capturing. Next, the binding kinetics of the anti-CXCR4 antibody 12G5 raised against a conformational epitope (kon\u00a0=\u00a01.83\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01, koff\u00a0=\u00a02.79\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04 s\u2212\u00a01) and the small molecule AMD3100 (kon\u00a0=\u00a05.46\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01, koff\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a02\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) were assessed by SAW.

     "abstract": "It is expected that during the hydrolysis of proteins with specific enzymes only peptides are formed that result from hydrolysis of the specific cleavage sites (i.e. specific peptides). It is, however, quite common to find a-specific peptides (i.e. resulting from a-specific cleavage), which are often ignored, or explained by impurities in the enzyme preparation. In recent work in a whey protein isolate (WPI) hydrolysate obtained with the specific Bacillus licheniformis protease (BLP), 13 peptides of 77 identified were found to be the result of a-specific cleavage. These were formed after degradation of 6 specific peptides, after 5 different types of amino acids. The fact that other peptides were not hydrolyzed after these 5 amino acids suggests that the cleavages were not the result of a contamination with a different enzyme. In other systems, certain peptide sequences have been described to degrade chemically, under relatively mild conditions. This process is referred to as spontaneous cleavage. To test if the a-specific peptides observed in the WPI hydrolysis are the results of spontaneous cleavages, the parental peptides were synthesized. Surprisingly, 4 of the 5 synthesized peptides were indeed spontaneously cleaved under the mild conditions used in this study (i.e. 40\u00a0\u00b0C and pH\u00a08) showing that peptides are less stable than typically considered. The rate of cleavage on the a-specific bonds was found to be enhanced in the presence of BLP. This suggests that the formation of a-specific peptides is not due to side activity but rather an enhancement of intrinsic instability of the peptides.",

Immersing elastin in various glycerol\u2013water mixtures, we observe at room temperature that the protein mobility is higher for lower glycerol fractions in the solvent and, thus, lower solvent viscosity. When decreasing the temperature, the elastin spectra approach the line shape for the rigid protein at 245\u00a0K for all studied samples, indicating that the protein ceases to be mobile on the experimental time scale of ~\u00a010\u2212\u00a05\u00a0s.

It is the penultimate enzyme in both the mandelate pathway and the d-phenylglycine degradation pathway. The ThDP-dependent Enzyme Engineering Database (TEED) now lists more than 800 sequences annotated as BFDCs, including one from Mycobacterium smegmatis (MsBFDC). However, there is no evidence that either pathway for benzoylformate formation exists in the M. smegmatis genome. Further, sequence alignments of MsBFDC with the well characterized enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas putida (PpBFDC) indicate that there will be active site substitutions in MsBFDC likely to reduce activity with benzoylformate. Taken together these data would suggest that the annotation is unlikely to be correct. To test this hypothesis the putative MsBFDC was cloned, expressed, purified, and the X-ray structure was solved to a resolution of 2.2\u00a0\u00c5. While showing no evidence for ThDP in the active site, the structure was very similar to that of PpBFDC. A number of 2-oxo acids were tested as substrates. For MsBFDC the Km value for benzoylformate was ~\u00a023\u00a0mM, nearly 100-fold greater than that of PpBFDC while the kcat value was reduced 60-fold. These values would suggest that benzoylformate is not the physiological substrate for this enzyme, and that annotation as a 2-oxo acid decarboxylase may be more appropriate.",

We studied the protease responsible for ApoE4 degradation in human peripheral monocyte extracts, which are from the same lineage as microglia. We detected the hydrolytic activity for ApoE4 in high-salt extracts with 2\u00a0M NaCl and found that the activity was inhibited by a serine protease inhibitor and an elastase-specific inhibitor, but not by other protease inhibitors. The extracts exhibited higher activity for the elastase substrate, and we followed the activity with ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography. Through silver staining, we partially purified a protein of 28\u00a0kDa, which was clarified as elastase by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry. These observations suggest that elastase is the key protease for ApoE4 degradation. We also detected ApoE4 hydrolytic activity in high-salt extracts in mouse microglial (BV-2) cell lysates, and showed that the ApoE4 fragments by the BV-2 extracts differed from the fragments by the monocyte extracts. Though the ApoE4 degradation by the extracts was not inhibited with elastase-specific inhibitors, it was inhibited by an elastase-specific monoclonal antibody, suggesting that elastase-like proteases in microglia differ from those of monocytes. Immunohistochemistry revealed that both elastase and ApoE were expressed in the senile plaques of brains with AD. In vitro studies also disclosed the localization of elastase in the microglial cell line, BV-2.

     "abstract": "The Hendra virus is a member of the Henipavirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. The nucleoprotein, which consists of a structured core and of a C-terminal intrinsically disordered domain (NTAIL), encapsidates the viral genome within a helical nucleocapsid. NTAIL partly protrudes from the surface of the nucleocapsid being thus capable of interacting with the C-terminal X domain (XD) of the viral phosphoprotein. Interaction with XD implies a molecular recognition element (MoRE) that is located within NTAIL residues 470\u2013490, and that undergoes \u03b1-helical folding. The MoRE has been proposed to be embedded in the hydrophobic groove delimited by helices \u03b12 and \u03b13 of XD, although experimental data could not discriminate between a parallel and an antiparallel orientation of the MoRE. Previous studies also showed that if the binding interface is enriched in hydrophobic residues, charged residues located close to the interface might play a role in complex formation. Here, we targeted for site directed mutagenesis two acidic and two basic residues within XD and NTAIL. ITC studies showed that electrostatics plays a crucial role in complex formation and pointed a parallel orientation of the MoRE as more likely. Further support for a parallel orientation was afforded by SAXS studies that made use of two chimeric constructs in which XD and the MoRE were covalently linked to each other. Altogether, these studies unveiled the multiparametric nature of the interactions established within this complex and contribute to shed light onto the molecular features of protein interfaces involving intrinsically disordered regions.",

The early diagnosis of these disorders is difficult, thus, the need for identifying, developing and using valid clinically applicable biomarkers that meet the criteria of precision, specificity and repeatability is very vital. The application of rapidly emerging technology such as mass spectrometry (MS) in proteomics has opened new avenues to accelerate biomarker discovery, both for diagnostic as well as for prognostic purposes.

     "abstract": "The nervous system constitutes arguably the most complicated and least understood cellular network in the human body. This consequently manifests itself in the fact that the molecular bases of neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown. The limited understanding of neurobiological mechanisms relates directly to the lack of appropriate bioanalytical technologies that allow highly resolved, sensitive, specific and comprehensive molecular imaging in complex biological matrices. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is an emerging technique for molecular imaging. The technique is characterized by its high chemical specificity allowing comprehensive, spatial protein and peptide profiling in situ. Imaging MS represents therefore a powerful approach for investigation of spatio-temporal protein and peptide regulations in CNS derived tissue and cells.

     "abstract": "Technologies to assay single cells and their extracellular microenvironments are valuable in elucidating biological function, but there are challenges. Sample volumes are low, the physicochemical parameters of the analytes vary widely, and the cellular environment is chemically complex. In addition, the inherent difficulty of isolating individual cells and handling small volume samples complicates many experimental protocols. Here we highlight a number of mass spectrometry (MS)-based measurement approaches for characterizing the chemical content of small volume analytes, with a focus on methods used to detect intracellular and extracellular metabolites and peptides from samples as small as individual cells. MS has become one of the most effective means for analyzing small biological samples due to its high sensitivity, low analyte consumption, compatibility with a wide array of sampling approaches, and ability to detect a large number of analytes with different properties without preselection. Having access to a flexible portfolio of MS-based methods allows quantitative, qualitative, untargeted, targeted, multiplexed, and spatially resolved investigations of single cells and their similarly scaled extracellular environments. Combining MS with on-line and off-line sample conditioning tools, such as microfluidic and capillary electrophoresis systems, significantly increases the analytical coverage of the sample's metabolome and peptidome, and improves individual analyte characterization/identification. Small volume assays help to reveal the causes and manifestations of biological and pathological variability, as well as the functional heterogeneity of individual cells within their microenvironments and within cellular populations.

     "abstract": "Nasal lavage fluid (NLF) becomes more and more important as a noninvasive patient sample serving as a new opportunity to discover new biomarkers in diverse human diseases comprising mainly respiratory disorders. This was supported by the observation that the protein profile of NLF differs from conventional samples of i.e. whole blood, hence being capable to complement or even expand the so far biomarker index. Since sample acquisition and processing are the most crucial steps for a profound and sensitive identification we present here a modified protocol of NLF generation and measurement. We show that mild washing steps for sample generation followed by column-mediated concentration and acetone precipitation are appropriate steps to minimize serum leakage by concomitantly highlighting proteins which represent typical components of NLF. This is shown by separation of proteins via 2D-PAGE followed by LC-MS/MS as well as Gel-LC-MS/MS measurements of cut and digested protein spots/bands.For a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying respiratory diseases NLF samples are favored sources for protein research. NLF acquisition and sample processing were impaired so far by the problem of blood serum leakage and high salt content. Here, we present a modified protocol of NLF generation leading to the display of typical inventory of NLF proteins combined with reduced salt and serum contaminants. By this, both assay reproducibility and the detection of up- or down-regulated proteins reliably can be discovered in the case of biomarker screenings in a disease versus control design.

     "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune mediated chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system usually initiated during young adulthood, affecting approximately 2.5 million people worldwide. There is currently no cure for MS, but disease modifying treatment has become increasingly more effective, especially when started in the first phase of the disease. The disease course and prognosis are often unpredictable and it can be challenging to determine an early diagnosis. The detection of novel biomarkers to understand more of the disease mechanism, facilitate early diagnosis, predict disease progression, and find treatment targets would be very attractive. Over the last decade there has been an increasing effort toward finding such biomarker candidates. One promising strategy has been to use state-of-the-art quantitative proteomics approaches to compare the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome between MS and control patients or between different subgroups of MS.

The pathogenesis of the diseases is still unclear and clinical diagnosis of FTLD is hampered by overlapping symptoms within the FTLD subtypes and with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Intracellular protein aggregates in the brain are a major hallmark of FTLD and implicate alterations in protein metabolism or function in the disease's pathogenesis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which surrounds the brain can be used to study changes in neurodegenerative diseases and to identify disease-related mechanisms or neurochemical biomarkers for diagnosis. In the present review, we will give an overview of the current literature on proteomic studies in CSF of FTLD patients. Reports of targeted and unbiased proteomic approaches are included and the results are discussed in regard of their informative value about disease pathology and the suitability to be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Finally, we will give some future perspectives on CSF proteomics and a list of candidate biomarkers which might be interesting for validation in further studies.

Neuropathologically, the disease is characterized by accumulation of a 42 amino acid peptide called amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b242) in extracellular senile plaques, intraneuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal and axonal degeneration and loss. Biomarker assays capturing these pathologies have been developed for use on cerebrospinal fluid samples but there are additional molecular pathways that most likely contribute to the neurodegeneration and full clinical expression of AD. One way of learning more about AD pathogenesis is to identify novel biomarkers for these pathways and examine them in longitudinal studies of patients in different stages of the disease.

While imperfect, the slow, chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced non-human primate animal model system of parkinsonism is an abundant source of pre-motor or early stage PD biomarker discovery. Here, we present a study of a MPTP rhesus monkey model of PD that utilizes complementary quantitative iTRAQ-based proteomic, glycoproteomics and phosphoproteomics approaches. We compared the glycoprotein, non-glycoprotein, and phosphoprotein profiles in the putamen of asymptomatic and symptomatic MPTP-treated monkeys as well as saline injected controls. We identified 86 glycoproteins, 163 non-glycoproteins, and 71 phosphoproteins differentially expressed in the MPTP-treated groups. Functional analysis of the data sets inferred the biological processes and pathways that link to neurodegeneration in PD and related disorders. Several potential biomarkers identified in this study have already been translated for their usefulness in PD diagnosis in human subjects and further validation investigations are currently under way.

The past decade has seen remarkable advances in the high-throughput sequencing techniques that are collectively called next generation sequencing (NGS).

Neuropeptidomics aims to comprehensively identify the collection of neuropeptides in an organism, organ, tissue or cell. The neuropeptidome of several invertebrates is thoroughly explored since they are important model organisms (and models for human diseases), disease vectors and pest species. The charting of the neuropeptidome is the first step towards understanding peptidergic signaling. This review will first discuss the latest developments in exploring the neuropeptidome. The physiological roles and modes of action of neuropeptides can be explored in two ways, which are largely orthogonal and therefore complementary. The first way consists of inferring the functions of neuropeptides by a forward approach where neuropeptide profiles are compared under different physiological conditions. Second is the reverse approach were neuropeptide collections are used to screen for receptor-binding. This is followed by localization studies and functional tests. This review will focus on how these different functional screening methods contributed to the field of invertebrate neuropeptidomics and expanded our knowledge of peptidergic signaling.

     "abstract": "Pseudopodia are ventral membrane protrusions that extend toward higher concentrations of chemoattractants and play key roles in cell migration and cancer cell invasion. Cancers, including carcinoma and sarcoma, become life threatening when they invade surrounding structures and other organs. Understanding the molecular basis of invasiveness is important for the elimination of cancers. Thus, determining the pseudopodial composition will offer insights into the mechanisms underlying tumor cell invasiveness and provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Pseudopodial composition has been extensively investigated by using proteomic approaches. A variety of modalities, including gel-based and mass spectrometry-based methods, have been employed for pseudopodial proteomics. Our research group recently established a novel method using excimer laser pulses to selectively harvest pseudopodia, and we successfully identified a number of new pseudopodial constituents. Here, we summarized the conventional proteomic procedures and describe our new excimer laser-assisted method, with a special emphasis on the differences in the methods used to isolate pseudopodia. In addition, we discussed the theoretical background for the use of excimer laser-mediated cell ablation in proteomic applications. Using the excimer laser-assisted method, we showed that alpha-parvin, an actin-binding adaptor protein, is localized to pseudopodia, and is involved in breast cancer invasiveness. Our results clearly indicate that excimer laser-assisted cell etching is a useful technique for pseudopodial proteomics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Medical Proteomics.",

     "abstract": "Plasma renin activity (PRA) is essential for the screening and diagnosis of primary aldosteronism (PA), a form of secondary hypertension, which affects approximately 100 million people worldwide. It is commonly determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and, more recently, by relatively low-throughput LC\u2013MS/MS methods. In order to circumvent the negative aspects of RIAs (radioisotopes, cross-reactivity) and the low throughput of LC\u2013MS based methods, we have developed a high-throughput immuno-MALDI (iMALDI)-based assay for PRA determination using an Agilent Bravo for automated liquid handling and a Bruker Microflex LRF instrument for MALDI analysis, with the goal of implementing the assay in clinical laboratories. The current assay allows PRA determination of 29 patient samples (192 immuno-captures), within ~\u00a06 to 7\u00a0h, using a 3-hour Ang I generation period, at a 7.5-fold faster analysis time than LC\u2013MS/MS. The assay is performed on 350\u00a0\u03bcL of plasma, and has a linear range from 0.08 to 5.3\u00a0ng/L/s in the reflector mode, and 0.04 to 5.3\u00a0ng/L/s in the linear mode. The analytical precision is 2.0 to 9.7% CV in the reflector mode, and 1.5 to 14.3% CV in the linear mode. A method comparison to a clinically employed LC\u2013MS/MS assay for PRA determination showed excellent correlation within the linear range, with an R2 value of \u2265\u00a00.98. This automated high throughput iMALDI platform has clinically suitable sensitivity, precision, linear range, and correlation with the standard method for PRA determination. Furthermore, the developed workflow based on the iMALDI technology can be used for the determination of other proteomic biomarkers.

     "abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) plays a key role in multiple physiological and pathological processes such as cytokine production, mineralization, inflammation, immune responses, and tumorigenesis. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of OPN significantly affect its structure and biological properties; however, site-specific characterization of O-glycosylation in human OPN has not been reported. In this work, we profiled the overall glycan pattern of human recombinant OPN using a lectin array and completed detailed structural analysis of O-glycopeptides by mass spectrometry (MS). We detected 28 O-glycopeptides from 7 O-glycosylation regions of human OPN, occupied by highly heterogeneous O-glycans. These O-glycans carried, in part, functionally relevant epitopes such as T antigens (Gal\u03b21-3GalNAc\u03b11-), sialyl-Tn antigens, sialyl-T antigens, and sialyl-Lex/a antigens [Neu\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc/Neu\u03b12-3Gal\u03b21-3(Fuc\u03b11-4)GlcNAc]. MS3 spectra of the generated O-glycopeptides showed cleavages of the peptide backbone and provided essential information on the peptide sequence. Furthermore, 26 phosphorylation sites were identified by reverse-phase liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC\u2013MS/MS), including a novel one (Y209). We provide a detailed, site-specific structural characterization of O-glycosylation and identify the phosphorylation sites of OPN.

     "abstract": "Immunoprecipitation (IP) is a widely used technique for identifying the binding partners of the target proteins of specific antibodies. Putative binding targets and their partners are usually in much lower amounts than the antibodies used to capture these target proteins. Thus antigen identification using proteomics following IP is often confounded by the presence of an overwhelming amount of interfering antibody protein. Even covalently linking antibodies to beads is susceptible to antibody leaching during IP. To circumvent this interference, we describe here a reagent, called Biotin-CDM that reversibly tags all potential target proteins in a cell lysate with biotin. The presence of biotin coupled to the target proteins allows for a secondary separation step in which antibodies are washed away from the reversibly biotinylated target proteins by binding them to an Avidin-coupled matrix. The captured target proteins are released from the Avidin matrix by reversing the Biotin-CDM link, thus releasing a pool of target proteins ready for further proteomic analysis compatible with 2D-electrophoresis. Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of Biotin-CDM. We also demonstrate Biotin-CDM's use for immunoprecipitation of a known antigen, as well as its use for capturing an array of proteins targeted by the autoantibodies found in the serum a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The use of this reagent allows one to combine immunoprecipitation and 2D-Difference gel electrophoresis, overcoming the current limitations of Serological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) in discovering autoantigens.

The dinuclear zinc(II) complex forms a stable 1:1 complex with a phosphate monoester dianion in an aqueous solution under conditions of neutral pH. By using a series of functional Phos-tag derivatives, our group has developed novel techniques that are useful in studies on kinomics and phosphoproteomics. Among the derivatives, a series of biotinylated Phos-tag derivatives have been used as molecular tools in applications such as Western blotting for comprehensive detection of phosphorylated proteins and in highly sensitive peptide microarray-based techniques for the detection of kinase activities in biological samples. The review also gives an outline of phosphate affinity electrophoresis, in which immobilized Phos-tag molecules in a general polyacrylamide gel are used to separate proteins and detect differences in their phosphorylation status. This technique permits quantitative analyses of multiple phosphorylation statuses of individual cellular proteins and their time-dependent changes. Conventional mass spectrometry-based shotgun techniques used in phosphoproteomics detect the phosphorylation modification of proteins in peptide fragments, whereas the Phos-tag electrophoresis technique permits the direct analysis of the phosphorylation status of full-length proteins. The technique therefore provides a greater understanding of the detailed properties of particular proteins involved in specific physiological and pathological events.

     "abstract": "CK2 is an extremely pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase, responsible for the generation of a large proportion of the human phosphoproteome and implicated in a wide variety of biological functions. CK2 plays a global role as an anti-apoptotic agent, a property which is believed to partially account for the addiction of many cancer cells to high CK2 levels. To gain information about the CK2 targets whose phosphorylation is primarily implicated in its pro-survival signaling advantage has been taken of quinalizarin (QZ) a cell permeable fairly specific CK2 inhibitor, previously shown to be able to block endogenous CK2 triggering an apoptotic response. HEK-293T cells either treated or not for 3\u00a0h with 50\u00a0\u03bcM QZ were exploited to perform a quantitative SILAC phosphoproteomic analysis of phosphosites readily responsive to QZ treatment. Our analysis led to the identification of 4883 phosphosites, belonging to 1693 phosphoproteins. 71 phosphosites (belonging to 47 proteins) underwent a 50% or more decreased occupancy upon QZ treatment. Almost 50% of these fulfilled the typical consensus sequence recognized by CK2 (S/T-x-x-E/D/pS) and in several cases were validated as bona fide substrates of CK2 either based on data in the literature or by performing in vitro phosphorylation experiments with purified proteins. The majority of the remaining phosphosites drastically decreased upon QZ treatment display the pS/T-P motif typical of proline directed protein kinases and a web logo extracted from them differentiates from the web logo extracted from all the proline directed phosphosites quantified during our analysis (1151 altogether). A paradoxical outcome of our study was the detection of 116 phosphosites (belonging to 92 proteins altogether) whose occupancy is substantially increased (50% or more), rather than decreased by QZ treatment: 40% of these display the typical motif recognized by proline directed kinases, while about 25% fulfill the CK2 consensus. Collectively taken our data on one side have led to the disclosure of a subset of CK2 targets which are likely to be implicated in the early steps of CK2 signaling counteracting apoptosis, on the other they provide evidence for the existence of side and off-target effects of the CK2 inhibitor quinalizarin, paving the road toward the detection of other kinases susceptible to this compound.

These tumors show a better response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Recently, we found a lower abundance of peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1) in oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q deletion, suggesting a potential role of this enzyme in the clearance of therapy induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we confirmed the importance of PRDX1 in tumor cell survival by PRDX1 knockdown and overexpression in A-172 cells treated with the alkylating agent bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU). Overexpression of PRDX1 resulted in a higher resistance of cells to BCNU treatment. In addition, BCNU challenged cells showed higher levels of ROS in PRDX1 knockdown cells. We applied a modified version of the redox two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis approach to analyze ROS mediated effects on protein thiols after BCNU treatment by labeling protein thiols with fluorescent dyes. Altogether eleven proteins were identified showing PRDX1 dependent altered labeling, many of them have been previously linked to stress response processes. Furthermore, 30 additional potentially redox active proteins were identified. The majority of them is involved in therapy associated processes like cellular stress response, DNA damage and regulation of cell death and therewith suggests that tumor cells maintain a network of redox sensitive proteins to escape chemotherapy.

     "abstract": "The prostate-specific G-protein-coupled receptor 1 (PSGR1) is an olfactory receptor specifically expressed in the prostate gland. PSGR1 expression is elevated both in benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue and in prostate cancer. Stimulation of PSGR1 by the odorant \u03b2-ionone leads to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and a decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation. To further extend our knowledge about PSGR1 signaling in prostate cancer cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomics study using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture and mass spectrometry. We report 51 differentially regulated phosphorylation sites in 24 proteins with functions in cytoskeletal remodeling, signaling and ion transport. Activation of PSGR1 evoked an increase in intracellular pH mediated by the sodium/hydrogen exchanger NHE1. Furthermore, we report the protein tyrosine kinase Pyk2 as a central effector of PSGR1 signaling cascades in LNCaP cells. Our data show that phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase is triggered by Pyk2. In addition, we confirmed dephosphorylation of the tumor suppressor protein N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) at Ser330 downstream of Pyk2. Since NDRG1 impacts oncogenic signaling pathways interfering with tumor progression, we suggest that the Pyk2\u2013NDRG1 axis is possibly involved in conveying the anti-proliferative effect of \u03b2-ionone in prostate cancer cells.

While imaging techniques have advanced, adjuvant protein-biomarkers as glypican3 (GPC3), glutamine-synthetase (GS) and heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) have enhanced diagnostic accuracy. The aim was to further detect useful protein-biomarkers of HCC with a structured systematic approach using differential proteome techniques, bring the results to practical application and compare the diagnostic accuracy of the candidates with the established biomarkers.After label-free and gel-based proteomics (n\u00a0=\u00a018 HCC/corresponding non-tumorous liver tissue (NTLT)) biomarker candidates were tested for diagnostic accuracy in immunohistochemical analyses (n\u00a0=\u00a014 HCC/NTLT). Suitable candidates were further tested for consistency in comparison to known protein-biomarkers in HCC (n\u00a0=\u00a078), hepatocellular adenoma (n\u00a0=\u00a025; HCA), focal nodular hyperplasia (n\u00a0=\u00a028; FNH) and cirrhosis (n\u00a0=\u00a028).Of all protein-biomarkers, 14-3-3Sigma (14-3-3S) exhibited the most pronounced up-regulation (58.8\u00d7) in proteomics and superior diagnostic accuracy (73.0%) in the differentiation of HCC from non-tumorous hepatocytes also compared to established biomarkers as GPC3 (64.7%) and GS (45.4%). 14-3-3S was part of the best diagnostic three-biomarker panel (GPC3, HSP70, 14-3-3S) for the differentiation of HCC and HCA which is of most important significance. Exclusion of GS and inclusion of 14-3-3S in the panel (>\u00a01 marker positive) resulted in a profound increase in specificity (+\u00a044.0%) and accuracy (+\u00a011.0%) while sensitivity remained stable (96.0%).14-3-3S is an interesting protein biomarker with the potential to further improve the accuracy of differential diagnostic process of hepatocellular tumors.

In the past few decades, concerted and systematic efforts have been made to identify key genetic alterations and to develop therapeutic agents targeting active signaling molecules. However, the efficacy of molecular therapeutics often varies among individuals, and precise mapping of active molecules in individual patients is now considered an essential for therapy optimization. Reverse-phase protein array or microarray (RPPA or RPPM) is an emerging antibody-based highly quantitative proteomic technology, especially suitable for profiling of expression and modification of signaling proteins in low abundance. Because the supply of clinical materials is often limited, RPPA technology is highly advantageous for clinical proteomics in view of its high sensitivity as well as accurate quantification. RPPA has now begun to be incorporated into various clinical trials employing molecular-targeted therapeutics. In this article we review and discuss the application of RPPA technology in the fields of basic, preclinical, and clinical research.

     "abstract": "The homodimeric glycoprotein, stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) is previously known to be involved in the regulation of calcium and phosphate transport in the kidney and also reported to play multiple roles in several cancers. However, its function and clinical significance in lung cancer have never been reported and still remain uncertain. Here, we investigated the possibility of STC2 as a lung cancer biomarker and identified its potential role in lung cancer cell growth, metastasis and progression. Proteomic analysis of secretome of primary cultured lung cancer cells revealed higher expression of STC2 in cancers compared to that of adjacent normal cells. RT-PCR and Western blot analyses showed higher mRNA and protein expressions of STC2 in lung cancer tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Knockdown of STC2 in H460 lung cancer cells slowed down cell growth progression and colony formation. Further analysis revealed suppression of migration, invasion and delayed G0/G1 cell cycle progression in the STC2 knockdown cells. STC2 knockdown also attenuated the H202-induced oxidative stress on H460 cell viability with a subsequent increase in intracellular ROS levels, which suggest a protective role of STC2 in redox regulatory system of lung cancer. These findings suggest that STC2 can be a potential lung cancer biomarker and plays a positive role in lung cancer metastasis and progression.

The proteome as a functional translation of the genome is a straightforward representation of genomic mechanisms that trigger carcinogenesis. Cancer proteomics has identified the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and tumor progression, detected biomarker candidates for early diagnosis, and provided novel therapeutic targets for personalized treatments. Our review focuses on three major topics in EC proteomics: diagnostics, treatment, and molecular mechanisms. We discuss the major histological differences between EC types, i.e., esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, and evaluate the clinical significance of published proteomics studies, including promising diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets, which should be further validated prior to launching clinical trials. Multi-disciplinary collaborations between basic scientists, clinicians, and pathologists should be established for inter-institutional validation. In conclusion, EC proteomics has provided significant results, which after thorough validation, should lead to the development of novel clinical tools and improvement of the clinical outcome for esophageal cancer patients.

Fluorescence anisotropy decay of BoNT/A LC resolved sub-nanosecond local motion (faster component), interpreted as internal flexibility of the molecule was affected significantly with viscosity.

Here we investigated, by using atomic force microscopy, nanomechanical manipulation and FTIR spectroscopy, whether the epitaxially grown fibrils display structural and mechanical features similar to the ones evolving under equilibrium conditions in bulk solution. Unlike epitaxially grown fibrils, solution-grown fibrils displayed a heterogeneous morphology and an apparently helical structure. While fibril assembly in solution occurred on a time scale of hours, it appeared within a few minutes on mica surface fibrils. Both types of fibrils showed a similar plateau-like nanomechanical response characterized by the appearance of force staircases. The IR spectra of both fibril types contained an intense peak between 1620 and 1640\u00a0cm\u2212\u00a01, indicating that \u03b2-sheets dominate their structure. A shift in the amide I band towards greater wave numbers in epitaxially assembled fibrils suggests that their structure is less compact than that of solution-grown fibrils. Thus, equilibrium conditions are required for a full structural compaction. Epitaxial A\u03b225\u201335 fibril assembly, while significantly accelerated, may trap the fibrils in less compact configurations. Considering that under in vivo conditions the assembly of amyloid fibrils is influenced by the presence of extracellular matrix components, the ultimate fibril structure is likely to be influenced by the features of underlying matrix elements.",

In this pathway, N-acetylhexosamine 1-kinase (NahK) catalyzes the phosphorylation of GlcNAc or GalNAc at the anomeric C1 position with ATP. Crystal structures of NahK have only been determined in the closed state. In this study, we determined open state structures of NahK in three different forms (apo, ADP complex, and ATP complex). A comparison of the open and closed state structures revealed an induced fit structural change defined by two rigid domains. ATP binds to the small N-terminal domain, and binding of the N-acetylhexosamine substrate to the large C-terminal domain induces a closing conformational change with a rotation angle of 16\u00b0. In the nucleotide binding site, two magnesium ions bridging the \u03b1-\u03b3 and \u03b2-\u03b3 phosphates were identified. A mutational analysis indicated that a residue coordinating both of the two magnesium ions (Asp228) is essential for catalysis. The involvement of two magnesium ions in the catalytic machinery is structurally similar to the catalytic structures of protein kinases and aminoglycoside phosphotransferases, but distinct from the structures of other anomeric kinases or sugar 6-kinases. These findings help to elucidate the possible evolutionary adaptation of substrate specificities and induced fit mechanism.",

The role of the CA:CypA interaction is still unclear. Previous studies showed that a CypA-binding loop mutant, \u039487\u201397, has increased ability to assemble in vitro. We used this mutant to infer whether the CypA-binding region has an overall effect on CA stability, as measured by pressure and chemical perturbation. We built a SAXS-based envelope model for the dimer of both WT and \u039487\u201397. A new conformational arrangement of the dimers is described, showing the structural plasticity that CA can adopt. In protein folding studies, the deletion of the loop drastically reduces CA stability, as assayed by high hydrostatic pressure and urea. We hypothesize that the deletion promotes a rearrangement of helix 4, which may enhance the heterotypic interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains of CA dimers. In addition, we propose that the cyclophilin-binding loop may modulate capsid assembly during infection, either in the cytoplasm or near the nucleus by binding to the nuclear protein Nup385.",

As a strategy to resist the innate immunity and to successfully spread and proliferate, B. burgdorferi expresses a set of outer membrane proteins that are capable of binding complement regulator factor H (CFH), factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL-1) and factor H-related proteins (CFHR) to avoid complement-mediated killing. B. burgdorferi B31 contains three proteins that belong to the Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family and are capable of binding CFH and some CFHRs, namely ErpA, ErpC and ErpP. We have determined the crystal structure of ErpP at 2.53\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and the crystal structure of ErpC at 2.15\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. Recently, the crystal structure of the Erp family member OspE from B. burgdorferi N40 was determined in complex with CFH domains 19\u201320, revealing the residues involved in the complex formation. Despite the high sequence conservation between ErpA, ErpC, ErpP and the homologous protein OspE (78\u201380%), the affinity for CFH and CFHRs differs markedly among the Erp family members, suggesting that ErpC may bind only CFHRs but not CFH. A comparison of the binding site in OspE with those of ErpC and ErpP revealed that the extended loop region, which is only observed in the potential binding site of ErpC, plays an important role by preventing the binding of CFH. These results can explain the inability of ErpC to bind CFH, whereas ErpP and ErpA still possess the ability to bind CFH.",

We have previously showed that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH6 modulates the transcriptional repression activity of ATXN1 through ubiquitylation. In the present study, we sought to identify sites in the AXH domain that are ubiquitylated by UbcH6. Systematic replacement of each lysine residue in the AXH domain revealed that the lysine at 589 (K589) of ATXN1 is essential for its ubiquitylation by UbcH6. Mass spectrometry studies further confirmed the ubiquitylation site. Interestingly, protein aggregation was significantly enhanced in mutant AXH K589R, implying that the aggregation is strongly associated with the level of ATXN1 expression. Our study may suggest a therapeutic potential of UbcH6 in the treatment of SCA1.",

Flag-tagged Aha1 was over-expressed in HeLa cells and isolated by anti-Flag affinity pull downs, followed by trypsin digestion and identification co-adsorbing proteins by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS). A probability-based identification of Aha1 PPIs was generated from the LC-MS/MS analysis by using a relative quantification strategy, spectral counting (SC). By comparing the SC-based protein levels between Aha1 pull-down samples and negative controls, 164 Aha1-interacting proteins were identified that were quantitatively enriched in the pull-down samples over the controls. The identified Aha1-interacting proteins are involved in a wide number of intracellular bioprocesses, including DNA maintenance, chromatin structure, RNA processing, translation, nucleocytoplasmic and vesicle transport, among others. The interactions of 33 of the identified proteins with Aha1 were further confirmed by Western blotting, demonstrating the reliability of our affinity-purification-coupled quantitative SC-MS strategy.

All substitutions reduced Ca-dependent activation of the actomyosin ATPase. The effects of mutations in Arg167 and Lys168 were the most severe.

The excimer fluorescence of N-(1-pyrene)iodoacetamide, a probe attached to the central Cys190, demonstrated that substitutions located near the troponin core domain-binding region strongly affected conformational changes accompanying the tropomyosin\u2013troponin interactions. The thermal stability of all tropomyosin mutants was lower than the stability of the wild type tropomyosin, with TM reduced by 5.3\u20138.5\u00a0\u00b0C.

Using magic angle spinning 13C NMR spectroscopy and relaxation methodologies, we have measured the modification in structure and dynamics following three known purification protocols. Our experimental data reveal that the 13C spectra of the hydrated samples appear remarkably similar across the various purification methods. Subtle differences in the half maximum widths were observed in the backbone carbonyl suggesting possible structural heterogeneity across the different methods of purification. Additionally, small differences in the relative signal intensities were observed between purified samples. Lyophilizing the samples results in a reduction of backbone motion and reveals additional differences across the purification methods studied. These differences were most notable in the alanine motifs indicating possible changes in cross-linking or structural rigidity. The measured correlation times of glycine and proline moieties are observed to also vary considerably across the different purification methods, which may be related to peptide bond cleavage. Lastly, the relative concentration of desmosine cross-links in the samples quantified by MALDI mass spectrometry is reported.",

STPKs belong to the protein kinase family named as one-component signal transduction systems, which combine both sensing and regulating properties. Thermodynamic investigations of sensing extra-cellular portions of two important Ser-Thr kinases, PrkC, from Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were conducted by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) melting measurements, coupled with modelling studies. The study of thermodynamic properties of the two domains is challenging since they share a modular domain organization. Consistently, DSC and CD data show that they present similar thermodynamic behaviours and that folding/unfolding transitions do not fit a two-state folding model. However, the thermal unfolding of the two proteins is differentially sensitive to pH. In particular, their unfolding is characteristic of modular structures at the neutral pH, with independent contributions of individual domains to folding. Differently, a cooperative unfolding is evidenced at acidic pH for the B. subtilis member, suggesting that a significant interaction between domains becomes valuable.",

Our results showed that i) exon 6 is a very flexible polycation with high disordered propensity, features well conserved in all mammals, ii) the structures of all the isoforms are stabilized by H-bond sub-networks organized around HUB residues and, iii) the charge content of exon 6 modulates the intrinsic structural preference of its flexible backbone, which can be described as an ensemble of conformations. Moreover, complexes between NRP-1 and VEGFA isoforms were modeled by molecular docking to study what isoforms are able to bind NRP-1. The analysis of complexes evidenced that VEGFA_121, VEGFA_145, VEGFA_183, VEGFA_189 and VEGFA_206, containing exons 7 and 8a, are able to interact with NRP-1 because they have the key regions of exons 7b and/or 8a. An overview of the isoforms shows how the fluctuations are the main guidance of their biological function. MD simulations also provide insights into factors that stabilize the binding regions of isoforms.",

     "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons. Unfortunately, effective therapeutics against this disease is still not available. Almost 20% of familial ALS (fALS) is suggested to be associated with pathological deposition of superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Evidences suggest that SOD1-containing pathological inclusions in ALS exhibit amyloid like properties. An effective strategy to combat ALS may be to inhibit amyloid formation of SOD1 using small molecules. In the present study, we observed the fibrillation of one of the premature forms of SOD1 (SOD1 with reduced disulfide) in the presence of curcumin. Using ThT binding assay, AFM, TEM images and FTIR, we demonstrate that curcumin inhibits the DTT-induced fibrillation of SOD1 and favors the formation of smaller and disordered aggregates of SOD1. The enhancement in curcumin fluorescence on the addition of oligomers and pre-fibrillar aggregates of SOD1 suggests binding of these species to curcumin. Docking studies indicate that putative binding site of curcumin may be the amyloidogenic regions of SOD1. Further, there is a significant increase in SOD1 mediated toxicity in the regime of pre-fibrillar and fibrillar aggregates which is not evident in curcumin containing samples. All these data suggest that curcumin reduces toxicity by binding to the amyloidogenic regions of the species on the aggregation pathway and blocking the formation of the toxic species. Nanoparticles of curcumin with higher aqueous solubility show similar aggregation control as that of curcumin bulk. This suggests a potential role for curcumin in the treatment of ALS.",

At the early stage of infection, growth of the pathogen is subject to the nutrition stress of limited nitrogen. To investigate the secreted pathogenic proteins that play indispensable roles during invasion at this stage, we compared the profiles of secreted proteins of V. dahliae under nitrogen starvation and normal conditions by using in-gel and in-solution digestion combined with liquid chromatography\u2013nano-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013nanoESI-MS). In total, we identified 212 proteins from the supernatant of liquid medium, including 109 putative secreted proteins. Comparative analysis indicated that the expression of 76 proteins was induced, whereas that of 9 proteins was suppressed under nitrogen starvation. Notably, 24 proteins are constitutively expressed. Further bioinformatic exploration enabled us to classify the stress-induced proteins into seven functional groups: cell wall degradation (10.5%), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and stress response (11.8%), lipid effectors (5.3%), protein metabolism (21.1%), carbohydrate metabolism (15.8%), electron\u2013proton transport and energy metabolism (14.5%), and other (21.0%). In addition, most stress-suppressed proteins are involved in the cell-wall remodeling. Taken together, our analyses provide insights into the pathogenesis of V. dahliae and might give hints for the development of novel strategy against the verticillium wilt disease.",

Fundamental research can be done using cell culture providing researchers with virtually infinite sample amounts. In contrast, clinical, pre-clinical and biomedical research is often restricted to minute sample amounts and requires an efficient analysis with only micrograms of protein. To address this issue, we generated a highly sensitive workflow for combined LC-MS-based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics by refining an ERLIC-based 2D phosphoproteomics workflow into an ERLIC-based 3D workflow covering the global proteome as well. The resulting 3D strategy was successfully used for an in-depth quantitative analysis of both, the proteome and the phosphoproteome of murine cytomegalovirus-infected mouse fibroblasts, a model system for host cell manipulation by a virus. In a 2-plex SILAC experiment with 150\u00a0\u03bcg of a tryptic digest per condition, the 3D strategy enabled the quantification of ~\u00a075% more proteins and even ~\u00a0134% more peptides compared to the 2D strategy. Additionally, we could quantify ~\u00a050% more phosphoproteins by non-phosphorylated peptides, concurrently yielding insights into changes on the levels of protein expression and phosphorylation. Beside its sensitivity, our novel three-dimensional ERLIC-strategy has the potential for semi-automated sample processing rendering it a suitable future perspective for clinical, pre-clinical and biomedical research.",

PAFAH-II in its resting state is mainly cytoplasmic, and it responds to oxidative stress by becoming increasingly bound to endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes. Numerous studies have indicated that this enzyme is essential for protecting cells from oxidative stress induced apoptosis. However, the regulatory mechanism of the oxidative stress response by PAFAH-II has not been fully resolved. Here, changes to the oligomeric state of human PAFAH-II were investigated as a potential regulatory mechanism toward enzyme trafficking. Native PAGE analysis in vitro and photon counting histogram within live cells showed that PAFAH-II is both monomeric and dimeric. A Gly-2-Ala site-directed mutation of PAFAH-II demonstrated that the N-terminal myristoyl group is required for homodimerization. Additionally, the distribution of oligomeric PAFAH-II is distinct within the cell; homodimers of PAFAH-II were localized to the cytoplasm while monomers were associated to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. We propose that the oligomeric state of PAFAH-II drives functional protein trafficking. PAFAH-II localization to the membrane is critical for substrate acquisition and effective oxidative stress protection. It is hypothesized that the balance between monomer and dimer serves as a regulatory mechanism of a PAFAH-II oxidative stress response.",

     "abstract": "Starch and glycogen are widespread storage polysaccharides in bacteria, plants, and animals. Recently, some cyanobacteria were found to accumulate water-insoluble \u03b1-glucan similar to amylopectin rather than glycogen, the latter of which is more commonly produced in these organisms. The amylopectin-producing species including Cyanobacterium sp. NBRC 102756 invariably have three branching enzyme (BE) homologs, BE1, BE2, and BE3, all belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 13. Multiple BE isoforms in prokaryotes have not been previously studied. In the present work, we carried out functional characterization of these enzymes expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzymes were all active, although the specific activity of BE3 was much lower than those of BE1 and BE2. After the incubation of the enzymes with amylopectin or amylose, the reaction products were analyzed by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate capillary electrophoresis method. BE1 and BE2 showed similar chain-length preference to BEIIb isoform of rice (Oryza sativa L.), while the catalytic specificity of BE3 was similar to that of rice BEI. These results indicate that starch-producing cyanobacteria have both type-I BE (BE3) and type-II BEs (BE1 and BE2) in terms of chain-length preferences, as is the case of plants. All BE isoforms were active against phosphorylase limit dextrin, in which outer branches had been uniformly diminished to 4 glucose residues. Based on its catalytic properties, BE3 was assumed to have a role to transfer the glucan chain bearing branch(es) to give rise to a newly growing unit, or cluster as observed in amylopectin molecule.",

We have reported that P5 has insulin reductase activity and inhibits lysozyme refolding by formation of lysozyme multimers with hypermolecular mass inactivated by intermolecular disulfides (hyLYS) in oxidative refolding of reduced denatured lysozyme. To explore the role of each domain of P5, we investigated the effects of domain deletion and Cys-Ala mutants of P5 on insulin reduction and the oxidative refolding of the lysozyme. The mutants of catalytic cysteines, C36/39A, C171/174A, and C36/39/171/174A inhibited the lysozyme refolding almost similarly to P5, and even b domain without catalytic cysteines showed moderate inhibitory effect, suggesting that the b domain played a key role in the inhibition. Western blotting analysis of the refolding products indicated that the catalytic cysteines in both the a and a\u2032 domains cross-linked lysozyme comparably to form hyLYS resistant to trypsin, in which b domain was suggested to capture lysozyme for the significant sulfhydryl oxidation. The mutant of the conserved cysteines in b domain, C272/278A, did not form hyLYS, however, showed predominant reductase activity, implying that P5 functioned as a potent sulfhydryl oxidase and a predominant reductase depending on the circumstance around C272/278.

The structure and functions of 14-3-3 proteins are regulated in different ways, including Ser58 phosphorylation in the interface, which shifts equilibrium towards the formation of protein monomers whose role is poorly understood. While modification of Ser58 induced only partial dissociation, the engineered triple mutation of human 14-3-3\u03b6 located in the first \u03b1-helix deeply monomerized the protein, allowing for a structural analysis of the monomeric form. Dimer-incapable 14-3-3 proteins retained binding capacity and specificity towards some phosphopartners, and also demonstrated increased chaperone-like activity on various substrates. Here, we found a substantial propensity of the N-terminal segment (~\u00a040 residues) of 14-3-3 proteins to intrinsic disorder, showing remarkable conservation across different isoforms and organisms. We hypothesized that this intrinsic disorder propensity, hidden in the \u03b1-helical 14-3-3 dimer, can be manifested upon its dissociation and interrogated novel monomeric 14-3-3\u03b6 carrying both monomerizing and S58E mutations (14-3-3\u03b6mS58E). CD spectroscopy showed that, at physiological temperatures, this protein has ~\u00a010\u201315% reduced helicity relative to the wild type protein, corresponding to roughly 40 residues. Along with the known flexibility of C-terminus, SAXS-based modeling of the 14-3-3\u03b6mS58E structure strongly suggested pliability of its N-terminus. The unraveled disorder propensity of the N-terminal tails of 14-3-3 proteins provides new clues for better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of dimerization and multifunctionality of these universal adapter proteins.",

The enzyme functions as an AP-endonuclease at high ionic environments, while the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032-exonuclease activity is predominant at low ionic environments. Our molecular modelling and mutational experiments show that E57 and D251 are critical for catalysis. Although nicked DNA and gapped DNA are fair substrates of MtbXthA, the gap-size did not affect the excision activity and furthermore, a substrate with a recessed 3\u2032-end is preferred. To understand the determinants of abasic-site recognition, we examined the possible roles of (i) the base opposite the abasic site, (ii) the abasic ribose ring itself, (iii) local distortions in the AP-site, and (iv) conserved residues located near the active site. Our experiments demonstrate that the first three determinants do not play a role in MtbXthA, and in fact the enzyme exhibits robust endonucleolytic activity against single-stranded AP DNA also. Regarding the fourth determinant, it is known that the catalytic-site of AP endonucleases is surrounded by conserved aromatic residues and intriguingly, the exact residues that are directly involved in abasic site recognition vary with the individual proteins. We therefore, used a combination of mutational analysis, kinetic assays, and structure-based modelling, to identify that Y237, supported by Y137, mediates the formation of the MtbXthA\u2013AP-DNA complex and AP-site incision.",

     "abstract": "X-ray crystal structures propel biochemistry research like no other experimental method, since they answer many questions directly and inspire new hypotheses. Unfortunately, many users of crystallographic models mistake them for actual experimental data. Crystallographic models are interpretations, several steps removed from the experimental measurements, making it difficult for nonspecialists to assess the quality of the underlying data. Crystallographers mainly rely on \u201cglobal\u201d measures of data and model quality to build models. Robust validation procedures based on global measures now largely ensure that structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) are largely correct. However, global measures do not allow users of crystallographic models to judge the reliability of \u201clocal\u201d features in a region of interest. Refinement of a model to fit into an electron density map requires interpretation of the data to produce a single \u201cbest\u201d overall model. This process requires inclusion of most probable conformations in areas of poor density. Users who misunderstand this can be misled, especially in regions of the structure that are mobile, including active sites, surface residues, and especially ligands. This article aims to equip users of macromolecular models with tools to critically assess local model quality. Structure users should always check the agreement of the electron density map and the derived model in all areas of interest, even if the global statistics are good.

The eicosanoids, in extremely low concentrations, are required in a number of physiological processes. However, the increase in their concentrations above the essential physiological requirements leads to various inflammatory conditions. In order to prevent the unwanted rise in the concentrations of eicosanoids, the actions of PLA2 and other enzymes of the pathway need to be blocked.

Threonine aldolases have great biotechnological potential for the syntheses of pharmaceutically relevant drug molecules because of their stereospecificity. The pH-dependency of their catalytic activity, affecting reaction intermediates, led us to study the effect of low-pH on Escherichia coli TA (eTA) structure. We report here a low-pH crystal structure of eTA at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, with a non-covalently bound uncleaved l-serine substrate, and a PLP cofactor bound as an internal aldimine. This structure contrasts with other eTA structures obtained at physiological pH that show products or substrates bound as PLP-external aldimines. The non-productive binding at low-pH is due to an unusual substrate serine binding orientation in which the \u03b1-amino group and carboxylate group are in the wrong positions (relative to the active site residues) as a result of protonation of the \u03b1-amino group of the serine, as well as the active site histidines, His83 and His126.

For the detection of GH abuse, blood samples are screened for abnormal ratios between the 22 and 20\u00a0kDa GH proteoforms that demonstrate the administration of the synthetic hormone. Current detection methods are based on classical immunoassays as they provide sufficient sensitivity for the detection of GH proteoforms. These antibody based methods, however, suffer from unclear selectivity and potential cross-reactivity towards similar proteins. For unambiguous GH detection, we report a Mass Spectrometry ImmunoAssay (MSIA) that first enriches GH from plasma with an antibody of relatively low specificity, and subsequently quantifies the 22 and 20\u00a0kDa proteoforms by Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) LC-MS/MS analysis. This method proved superior to an antibody-free strategy based on GH purification by protein precipitation. Using GH-MSIA we successfully quantified the 22/20\u00a0kDa GH ratio in post-exercise capillary plasma extracted from two individuals. This GH-MSIA is applicable to anti-doping and GH-related disease analysis.",

Many sHsps exhibit chaperone-like activity in preventing aggregation of target proteins, keeping them in a folding\u2013competent state and refolding them by themselves or in concert with other ATP-dependent chaperones. Mutations in human sHsps result in myopathies, neuropathies and cataract. Their expression is modulated in diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and cancer. Their ability to bind Cu2\u00a0+, and suppress generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may have implications in Cu2\u00a0+-homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases. Circulating \u03b1B-crystallin and Hsp27 in the plasma may exhibit immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory functions. \u03b1B-crystallin and Hsp20 exhitbit anti-platelet aggregation: these beneficial effects indicate their use as potential therapeutic agents. sHsps have roles in differentiation, proteasomal degradation, autophagy and development. sHsps exhibit a robust anti-apoptotic property, involving several stages of mitochondrial-mediated, extrinsic apoptotic as well as pro-survival pathways. Dynamic N- and C-termini and oligomeric assemblies of \u03b1B-crystallin and Hsp27 are important factors for their functions. We propose a \u201cdynamic partitioning hypothesis\u201d for the promiscuous interactions and pleotropic functions exhibited by sHsps.

Over the years, NGF and proNGF of either human or mouse origin, given their high degree of homology, have been exploited for numerous applications in biomedical sciences.The mouse NGF has been considered the golden-standard for bioactivity. Indeed, due to evolutionary relatedness to human NGF and to its ready availability and by assuming identical properties to its human counterpart, the mouse NGF, isolated and purified from sub-maxillary glands, has been tested not only in laboratory practice and in preclinical models, but it has also been evaluated in several human clinical trials.Aiming to validate this assumption, widely believed, we performed a comparative study of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the mouse and human counterparts of NGF and proNGF. The mature and the precursor proteins of either species strikingly differ in their biophysical profiles and, when tested for ligand binding to their receptors, in their in vitro biological activities. We provide a structural rationale that accounts for their different functional behaviors.Despite being highly conserved during evolution, NGF and proNGF of mouse and human origins show distinct properties and therefore special care must be taken in performing experiments with cross-species systems in the laboratory practice, in developing immunoassays, in clinical trials and in pharmacological treatments.",

This ordering is accompanied by structural transitions leading to the formation of ordered \u03b2-structural motifs in proteins and peptides lacking secondary structures. To characterize the effect of the monomer arrangements on the aggregation process at various stages, we performed comparative studies of the yeast prion protein Sup35 heptapeptide (GNNQQNY) along with its dimeric form CGNNQQNY-(d-Pro)-G-GNNQQNY. The (d-Pro)-G linker in this construct is capable of adopting a \u03b2-turn, facilitating the assembly of the dimer into the dimeric antiparallel hairpin structure (AP-hairpin). We applied Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques to follow peptide\u2013peptide interactions at the single molecule level, to visualize the morphology of aggregates formed by both constructs, thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence to follow the aggregation kinetics, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to characterize the secondary structure of the constructs. The ThT fluorescence data showed that the AP-hairpin aggregation kinetics is insensitive to the external environment such as ionic strength and pH contrary to the monomers the kinetics of which depends dramatically on the ionic strength and pH. The AFM topographic imaging revealed that AP-hairpins primarily assemble into globular aggregates, whereas linear fibrils are primary assemblies of the monomers suggesting that both constructs follow different aggregation pathways during the self-assembly. These morphological differences are in line with the AFM force spectroscopy experiments and CD spectroscopy measurements, suggesting that the AP-hairpin is structurally rigid regardless of changes of environmental factors.",

The residual structures observed in two intrinsically disordered proteins, including the C-terminal segment of peripherin-2 (63 residues) and measles virus nucleocapsid protein Ntail (125 residues), were compared using NMR. Differences in the chemical shifts of alpha-, beta- and carbonyl carbons between the observed structure and calculated random coil revealed the existence of a helix and some possible beta-structures in both proteins. The intensity of signals in the C-terminal segment of peripherin-2 in NMR spectra was informative and locally low, particularly in the middle and N-terminal parts: this suggested the broadening of the signals caused by the formation of residual structures in those areas. Furthermore, the protection of exchange of amide protons was significantly observed at the N-terminus. Conversely, the intensities of signals for Ntail were random beyond the overall areas of protein, and indicated no characteristic pattern. Only a faint protection of amide\u2013proton exchange in Ntail was observed in the C-terminus. It was concluded that Ntail was more intrinsically disordered than the C-terminal segment of peripherin-2. The combination of chemical shifts with the amide\u2013proton exchanges and signal intensities was useful for the analyses of the remaining secondary structures. The beta-structure might be more detectable by the protection of amide\u2013proton exchange than the helical structure, although the changes in chemical shifts were sensitive for the detection of elements of both secondary structures.",

     "abstract": "Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, including Huntington's disease, are neurodegenerative disorders associated with the abnormal expansion of a polyQ tract within nine proteins. The polyQ expansion is thought to be a major determinant in the development of neurotoxicity, triggering protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils, although non-polyQ regions play a modulating role. In this work, we investigate the relative importance of the polyQ length, its location within a host protein, and the conformational state of the latter in the amyloid fibril elongation. Model polyQ proteins made of the \u03b2-lactamase BlaP containing up to 79Q inserted at two different positions, and quartz crystal microbalance and atomic force microscopy were used for this purpose. We demonstrate that, independently of the polyQ tract location and the conformational state of the host protein, the relative elongation rate of fibrils increases linearly with the polyQ length. The slope of the linear fit is similar for both sets of chimeras (i.e., the elongation rate increases by ~\u00a01.9% for each additional glutamine), and is also similar to that previously observed for polyQ peptides. The elongation rate is, however, strongly influenced by the location of the polyQ tract within BlaP and the conformational state of BlaP. Moreover, comparison of our results with those previously reported for aggregation in solution indicates that these two parameters also modulate the ability of BlaP-polyQ chimeras to form the aggregation nucleus. Altogether our results suggest that non-polyQ regions are valuable targets in order to interfere with the process of amyloid fibril formation associated with polyQ diseases.",

In this study, the putative genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified to gel electrophoretic homogeneity, and then characterized. Purified PepR1 and PepR2 hydrolysed Pro-Xaa dipeptide substrates at similar rates, proving their nature as prolinases. Structural analyses using circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, gel filtration, and molecular modelling revealed that the two prolinases have similar structural characteristics: high \u03b2-sheet content, homotetrameric structure, and similar folding to the PepI/PepL/PepR peptidase family. However, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of PepR1 and PepR2 indicated differences in many aspects: optimum temperatures (25 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively), optimum pH (pH\u00a07.5 and 8.0, respectively), substrate specificities (high stringency of PepR2), kinetic parameters, and thermal stability (29 and 48\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively). Also, these prolinases behaved differently towards inhibitor treatments, suggesting structural and/or functional differences in their active sites. Differences in the two prolinases would contribute to a diversity of catalytic activities, so that they work together cooperatively and complementarily to hydrolyse proline-containing peptides with broader specificity, working pH, working temperature, and higher efficiency, thus allowing adaptation to a wider range of environments.",

In this work, we explored binding of total protein of human 40S ribosomal subunit to the RNA transcript corresponding to the major 3\u2032-domain of 18S rRNA. We showed that the resulting ribonucleoprotein particles contained almost all of the expected ribosomal proteins, whose binding sites are located in this 18S rRNA domain in the 40S subunit, together with several nonspecific proteins. The binding in solution was accompanied with aggregation of the RNA\u2013protein complexes. Ribosomal proteins bound to the RNA transcript protected from chemical modification mostly those 18S rRNA nucleotides that are known to be involved in binding with the proteins in the 40S subunit and thereby demonstrated their ability to selectively bind to the rRNA in vitro.

Calcium accumulates in the spinal and brain stem motor neurons of ALS patients triggering multiple pathophysiological processes which have been recently shown to include direct effects on the aggregation cascade of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). SOD1 is a Cu/Zn enzyme whose demetallated form is implicated in ALS protein deposits, contributing to toxic gain of function phenotypes. Here we undertake a combined experimental and computational study aimed at establishing the molecular details underlying the regulatory effects of Ca2\u00a0+ over SOD1 aggregation potential. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates entropy driven low affinity association of Ca2\u00a0+ ions to apo SOD1, at pH\u00a07.5 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Molecular dynamics simulations denote a noticeable loss of native structure upon Ca2\u00a0+ association that is especially prominent at the zinc-binding and electrostatic loops, whose decoupling is known to expose the central SOD1 \u03b2-barrel triggering aggregation. Structural mapping of the preferential apo SOD1 Ca2\u00a0+ binding locations reveals that among the most frequent ligands for Ca2\u00a0+ are negatively-charged gatekeeper residues located in boundary positions with respect to segments highly prone to edge-to-edge aggregation. Calcium interactions thus diminish gatekeeping roles of these residues, by shielding repulsive interactions via stacking between aggregating \u03b2-sheets, partly blocking fibril formation and promoting amyloidogenic oligomers such as those found in ALS inclusions. Interestingly, many fALS mutations occur at these positions, disclosing how Ca2\u00a0+ interactions recreate effects similar to those of genetic defects, a finding with relevance to understand sporadic ALS pathomechanisms.",

Global analysis of the unfolding kinetics of all variants revealed a linear unfolding route with a high-energy on-pathway intermediate state flanked by two transition state ensembles TSE1 and TSE2. The experiments show that CTH is mainly unfolded in TSE1 and the intermediate and becomes structured in TSE2. Structure-based molecular dynamics are in agreement with these experiments and provide protein-wide structural information on transient states. In our model, EcTRX folding starts with structure formation in the \u03b2-sheet, while the protein helices coalesce later.

Directed evolution was employed to alter the substrate specificity of DGD from 2-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) to 1-aminocyclohexane-1-carboxylate (AC6C). Four rounds of directed evolution led to the identification of several mutants, with clones in the final rounds containing five persistent mutations. The best clones show ~\u00a02.5-fold decrease in KM and ~\u00a02-fold increase in kcat, giving a modest ~\u00a05-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for AC6C. Additional rounds of directed evolution did not improve catalytic activity toward AC6C. Only one (S306F) of the five persistent mutations is close to the active site. S306F was observed in all 33 clones except one, and the mutation is shown to stabilize the enzyme toward denaturation. The other four persistent mutations are near the surface of the enzyme. The S306F mutation and the distal mutations all have significant effects on the kinetic parameters for AIB and AC6C. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the mutations alter the conformational landscape of the enzyme, favoring a more open active site conformation that facilitates the reactivity of the larger substrate. We speculate that the small increases in kcat/KM for AC6C are due to two constraints. The first is the mechanistic requirement for catalyzing oxidative decarboxylation via a concerted decarboxylation/proton transfer transition state. The second is that DGD must catalyze transamination at the same active site in the second half-reaction of the ping-pong catalytic cycle.",

     "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are highly conserved signaling pathways that respond to environmental cues. Arabidopsis MPK4 has been identified as a stress-responsive protein kinase. Here we demonstrate that Brassica napus MPK4 (BnMPK4) is activated by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Transient expression of a constitutively active BnMPK4 causes H2O2 production and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. However, little is known about how H2O2 contributes to the regulation of MPK4 kinase function. Biochemical analysis revealed that recombinant BnMPK4 autophosphorylates on both threonine and tyrosine residues in the activation loop. In the presence of H2O2, phosphorylation of BnMPK4 caused protein aggregation in vitro. The aggregation of BnMPK4 could be reversed to the monomeric form by reducing reagents. Point-mutation of cysteine codons indicated that cysteine 232 is involved in protein aggregation. Our results suggest that BnMPK4 is involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling and metabolism, and its aggregation may be modulated by redox.",

     "abstract": "The plant tau class glutathione transferases (GSTs) play important roles in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in crops and weeds. In this study, we systematically examined the catalytic and structural features of a GST isoenzyme from Glycine max (GmGSTU10-10). GmGSTU10-10 is a unique isoenzyme in soybean that is specifically expressed in response to biotic stress caused by soybean mosaic virus (SMV) infections. GmGSTU10-10 was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized. The results showed that GmGSTU10-10 catalyzes several different reactions and exhibits wide substrate specificity. Of particular importance is the finding that the enzyme shows high antioxidant catalytic function and acts as hydroperoxidase. In addition, its Km for GSH is significantly lower, compared to other plant GSTs, suggesting that GmGSTU10-10 is able to perform efficient catalysis under conditions where the concentration of reduced glutathione is low (e.g. oxidative stress). The crystal structure of GmGSTU10-10 was solved by molecular replacement at 1.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution in complex with glutathione sulfenic acid (GSOH). Structural analysis showed that GmGSTU10-10 shares the same overall fold and domain organization as other plant cytosolic GSTs; however, major variations were identified in helix H9 and the upper part of helix H4 that affect the size of the active site pockets, substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism. The results of the present study provide new information into GST diversity and give further insights into the complex regulation and enzymatic functions of this plant gene superfamily.",

The latter covers the active site, thereby maintaining the enzyme in a latent state. Activation can be achieved with SDS but little is known about the mechanism. We prepared domain-swap variants of dandelion PPO-1 and PPO-2 to test the specific functions of individual domains and their impact on enzyme characteristics.Our experiments revealed that the C-terminal domain modulates the pH optimum curve and has a strong influence on the optimal pH value. The linker determines the SDS concentration required for full activation. It also influences the SDS concentration required for half maximal activation (kSDS) and the stability of the enzyme during prolonged incubation in buffers containing SDS, but the N-terminal domain has the strongest effect on these parameters. The N-terminal domain also determines the IC50 of SDS and the stability in buffers containing or lacking SDS.We propose that the linker and C-terminal domain fine-tune the activation of plant PPOs. The C-terminal domain adjusts the pH optimum and the linker probably contains an SDS-binding/interaction site that influences inactivation and determines the SDS concentration required for activation. For the first time, we have determined the influence of the three PPO domains on enzyme activation and stability providing insight into the regulation and activation mechanisms of type-3 copper proteins in general.",

Although large-scale proteomics data have rapidly increased, the biological interpretation of these results remains as a challenging task. Here we reviewed basic concepts and different programs that are commonly used in proteomics data functional annotation, emphasizing the main strategies focused in the use of gene ontology annotations. Furthermore, we explored the characteristics of some tools developed for functional annotation analysis, concerning the ease of use and typical caveats on ontology annotations.

There are three types of crystallins in lens, designated as \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-crystallins. Alpha-crystallin is a hetero-polymer of about 800\u00a0kDa, consisting of 35\u201340 subunits of two different \u03b1A- and \u03b1B-subunits, each of 20\u00a0kDa. The \u03b2/\u03b3-crystallin superfamily comprises oligomeric \u03b2-crystallin (2\u20136 subunits) and monomeric \u03b3-crystallin. Since lens proteins have very long half-lives, they undergo numerous post-translational modifications including racemization, isomerization, deamidation, oxidation, glycation, and truncation, which may decrease crystallin solubility and ultimately cause cataract formation. Racemization and isomerization of aspartyl (Asp) residues have been detected only in polymeric \u03b1- and oligomeric \u03b2-crystallin, while the situation in monomeric \u03b3-crystallin has not been studied. Here, we investigated the racemization and isomerization of Asp in the \u03b3-crystallin fraction of elderly donors. The results show that Asp residues of \u03b3S-, \u03b3D- and \u03b3C-crystallins were not racemized and isomerized. However, strikingly, we found that a portion of \u03b1B-crystallin and \u03b2A3-crystallin moved to the lower molecular weight fraction which is the same size of \u03b3-crystallin. In those fractions, Asp-96 of \u03b1B-crystallin and Asp-37 of \u03b2A3-crystallin were highly inverted, which do not occur in the native lens higher molecular weight fraction. Our results indicate the possibility that the inversion of Asp residues may induce dissociation of \u03b1B- and \u03b2A3-crystallins from the polymeric and oligomeric states.

We have utilized in silico analysis to construct circularly permuted (CP) variants and estimated the retained activity and thermostability. New open termini in the region of residues 53 or 99 in two lichenase CP variants (CN-53 and CN-99) had no effect on their activity and thermal tolerance versus another variant CP variant, CN-140 (cut in the region of residue 140), which displayed a dramatic decrease in the activity and thermostability. Construction and further activity and thermostability testing of the modified lichenase variants (M variants) and CP variants with peptides integrated via insertion fusion have demonstrated that the N-terminal regions in the lichenase catalytic domain (53 and 99 amino acid residues) that permit circular permutations with retention of activity and thermostability of the enzyme as well as the region between the C and N termini of the native lichenase in thermostable and active lichenase variants (CN-53 and CN-99) may be used for integrating small peptides without the loss of activity and thermostability. These findings not only suggest that CP predictions can be used in search for internal integration sites within protein molecule, but also form the background for further enzymatic engineering of the C. thermocellum thermostable lichenase aiming to create new fusion proteins.",

     "abstract": "The lectins, a class of proteins that occur widely in animals, plants, fungi, lichens and microorganisms, are known for their ability to specifically bind to carbohydrates. Plant lectins can be classified into 12 families including the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA)-related lectin superfamily, which is widespread among monocotyledonous plants and binds specifically to mannose, a behavior that confers remarkable anti-tumor, anti-viral and insecticidal properties on these proteins. The present study characterized a mitogenic lectin from this family, called tarin, which was purified from the crude extract from taro (Colocasia esculenta). The results showed that tarin is a glycoprotein with 2\u20133% carbohydrate content, composed of least 10 isoforms with pIs ranging from 5.5 to 9.5. The intact protein is a heterotetramer of 47\u00a0kDa composed of two non-identical and non-covalently associated polypeptides, with small subunits of 11.9\u00a0kDa and large subunits of 12.6\u00a0kDa. The tarin structure is stable and recovers or maintains its functional structure following treatments at different temperatures and pH. Tarin showed a complex carbohydrate specificity, binding with high affinity to high-mannose and complex N-glycans. Many of these ligands can be found in viruses, tumor cells and insects, as well as in hematopoietic progenitor cells. Chemical modifications confirmed that both conserved and non-conserved amino acids participate in this interaction. This study determined the structural and ligand binding characteristics of a GNA-related lectin that can be exploited for several different purposes, particularly as a proliferative therapeutic molecule that is able to enhance the immunological response.",

These enzymes utilize the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to perform a variety of cellular functions. In this study, a clamp loader-clamp binding assay was developed to measure the rates of ATP-dependent clamp binding and ATP-hydrolysis-dependent clamp release for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae clamp loader (RFC) and clamp (PCNA). Pre-steady-state kinetics of PCNA binding showed that although ATP binding to RFC increases affinity for PCNA, ATP binding rates and ATP-dependent conformational changes in RFC are fast relative to PCNA binding rates. Interestingly, RFC binds PCNA faster than the Escherichia coli \u03b3 complex clamp loader binds the \u03b2-clamp. In the process of loading clamps on DNA, RFC maintains contact with PCNA while PCNA closes, as the observed rate of PCNA closing is faster than the rate of PCNA release, precluding the possibility of an open clamp dissociating from DNA. Rates of clamp closing and release are not dependent on the rate of the DNA binding step and are also slower than reported rates of ATP hydrolysis, showing that these rates reflect unique intramolecular reaction steps in the clamp loading pathway.",

     "abstract": "Arginine has been widely used as low molecular weight additive to promote protein refolding by suppressing aggregate formation. However, methods to investigate the role of arginine in protein refolding are often limited on protein's global conformational properties. Here, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to study the effects of arginine on recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) refolding at the scale of peptide mapping. It was found that deuteration levels of rhG-CSF refolded with arginine was higher than that without arginine during the whole refolding process, but they became almost the same when the refolding reached equilibrium. This phenomenon indicated that arginine could protect some amide deuterium atoms from being exchanged with hydrogen, but the protection diminished gradually along with refolding proceeding. Enzymatic digestion revealed six particular peptides of 16\u201347, 72\u201384, 84\u201393, 114\u2013124, 145\u2013153 and 154\u2013162 were mainly responsible for the deuteration, and all of them dominantly located in protein's \u03b1-helix domain. Furthermore, thermodynamics analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry provided direct evidence that arginine could only react with denatured and partially refolded rhG-CSF. Taking all of the results together, we suggest that arginine suppresses protein aggregation by a reversible combination. At the initial refolding stage, arginine could combine with the denatured protein mainly through hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, arginine is gradually excluded from protein with protein's native conformation recovering.",

Their core is packed by hydrophobic residues contributed by the 6 stranded \u03b2-barrel and three \u03b2-hairpins that make essential contacts with each other and keep the protein in \u2018topologically minimal frustrated state\u2019. A complete database analysis of the core residues of the \u03b2-trefoil fold proteins presented here identified a conserved tryptophan (W91) residue in the Kunitz (STI) family of inhibitors that projects from the lid and interacts with the bottom layer residues of the barrel. This kind of interactions is unique in Kunitz (STI) family because no other families of \u03b2-trefoil fold have such a shear sized residue at the barrel lid junction; suggesting its possible importance in packing and stability. We took WCI as a representative of this family and prepared four cavity creating mutants W91F-WCI, W91M-WCI, W91I-WCI & W91A-WCI.

Crystal structures of the mutants W91F-WCI, W91M-WCI & W91A-WCI also show the same feature. However, slight readjustments of the side chains around the site of mutation have been observed so as to minimize the cavity created due to mutation. Comparative stability of these mutants, estimated using heat denaturation CD spectroscopy, indicates that stability of the mutants inversely correlates with the size of the cavity inside the core. Interestingly, although we mutated at the core, mutants show varying susceptibility against tryptic digestion that grossly follow their instability determined by CD.

Studies about hyperthermophile proteins show that flexibility could be an effective indicator to find out weak spots to engineering thermostability of proteins. However, the relationship among flexibility, activity and stability in most of proteins is unclear. Proline is the most rigid residue and can be introduced to rigidify flexible regions to enhance thermostability of proteins. We firstly apply three different methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, B-FITTER and framework rigidity optimized dynamics algorithm (FRODA) to determine the flexible regions of Photinus pyralis luciferase: Fragment 197\u2013207; Fragment 471\u2013481 and Fragment 487\u2013495. Then, introduction of proline is used to rigidify these flexible regions. Two mutants D476P and H489P within most flexible regions are finally designed. In the results, H489P mutant shows improved thermostability while maintaining its catalytic efficiency compared to that of wild type luciferase. Flexibility analysis confirms that the overall rigidity and local rigidity of H489P mutant are greatly strengthened. D476P mutant shows decreased thermosatbility and the reason for this is elucidated at the molecular level. S307P mutation is randomly chosen outside the flexible regions as a control.

Conceivably, off-target effects could have implications upon proteins or processes being studied and understanding the molecular pathways affected would add value to the interpretation of experimental observations subsequent to cell transfection.Here we have used a SILAC-based proteomic approach to study differentially expressed proteins after transfection of HeLa cells with ECFP vector using a commonly employed non-liposome based transfection reagent, Fugene\u00aeHD.

The upregulated proteins might potentially inflict major cellular processes such as RNA splicing, chromatin remodeling, post-translational protein modification and cell cycle control. The results were validated by western analysis as well as quantitative RT-PCR and this demonstrated that an essentially identical response was induced in HeLa by transfection using an empty pUC18 vector, which does not contain a mammalian virus promoter, as well as a liposome-based transfection reagent, LipofectamineTM2000. Notably, no induction of the interferon response was observed in HEK293 cells, suggesting that these cells might be preferable to HeLa to avoid undesired off-target effects in transfection studies encompassing interferon-signaling and antiviral responses.",

     "abstract": "Envenomation via snakebites is an important public health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries that, in addition to mortality, can result in permanent sequelae as a consequence of local tissue damage, which represents a major challenge to antivenom therapy. Venom phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) and PLA2-like proteins play a leading role in the complex pathogenesis of skeletal muscle necrosis, nevertheless their precise mechanism of action is only partially understood. Recently, detailed structural information has been obtained for more than twenty different members of the PLA2-like myotoxin subfamily. In this review, we integrate the available structural, biochemical and functional data on these toxins and present a comprehensive hypothesis for their myotoxic mechanism. This process involves an allosteric transition and the participation of two independent interaction sites for docking and disruption of the target membrane, respectively, leading to a five-step mechanism of action. Furthermore, recent functional and structural studies of these toxins complexed with ligands reveal diverse neutralization mechanisms that can be classified into at least three different groups. Therefore, the data summarized here for the PLA2-like myotoxins could provide a useful molecular basis for the search for novel neutralizing strategies to improve the treatment of envenomation by viperid snakes.",

     "abstract": "The unique combination of nucleophilicity and redox-sensitivity that is characteristic of cysteine residues results in a variety of posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including oxidation, nitrosation, glutathionylation, prenylation, palmitoylation and Michael adducts with lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs). These PTMs regulate the activity of diverse protein families by modulating the reactivity of cysteine nucleophiles within active sites of enzymes, and governing protein localization between soluble and membrane-bound forms. Many of these modifications are highly labile, sensitive to small changes in the environment, and dynamic, rendering it difficult to detect these modified species within a complex proteome. Several chemical-proteomic platforms have evolved to study these modifications and enable a better understanding of the diversity of proteins that are regulated by cysteine PTMs. These platforms include: (1) chemical probes to selectively tag PTM-modified cysteines; (2) differential labeling platforms that selectively reveal and tag PTM-modified cysteines; (3) lipid, isoprene and LDE derivatives containing bioorthogonal handles; and (4) cysteine-reactivity profiling to identify PTM-induced decreases in cysteine nucleophilicity. Here, we will provide an overview of these existing chemical-proteomic strategies and their effectiveness at identifying PTM-modified cysteine residues within native biological systems.",

HNLs can also catalyze the reverse reaction, i.e., synthesis of cyanohydrins. Although several crystal structures of S-selective hydroxynitrile lyases (S-HNLs) have been reported, it remains unknown whether and how dynamics at the active site of S-HNLs influence their broad substrate specificity and affinity. In this study, we analyzed the structure, dynamics and function of S-HNL from Baliospermum montanum (BmHNL), which has an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold. Two crystal structures of BmHNL, apo1 and apo2, were determined at 2.55 and 1.9\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. Structural comparison between BmHNL (apo2) and S-HNL from Hevea brasiliensis with (S)-mandelonitrile bound to the active site revealed that hydrophobic residues at the entrance region of BmHNL formed hydrophobic interactions with the benzene ring of the substrate. The flexible structures of these hydrophobic residues were confirmed by a 15\u00a0ns molecular dynamics simulation. This flexibility regulated the size of the active site cavity, enabling binding of various substrates to BmHNL. The high affinity of BmHNL toward substrates containing a benzene ring was also confirmed by comparing the kinetics of BmHNL and S-HNL from Manihot esculenta. Taken together, the results indicated that the flexibility and placement of the residues are important for the broad substrate specificity of S-HNLs.",

     "abstract": "Snake venoms contain serine proteinases that are functionally similar to thrombin and specifically cleave fibrinogen to convert it into fibrin or activate platelets to aggregation. PA-BJ is a serine proteinase from Bothrops jararaca venom that promotes platelet aggregation and this effect is mediated by the G-coupled protein receptors PAR1 and PAR4. In this study we describe an improved procedure to obtain PA-BJ from B. jararaca venom that uses less chromatographic steps, and, interestingly, results in the isolation of eight proteoforms showing slightly different pIs and molecular masses due to variations in their glycosylation levels. The identity of the isolated PA-BJ forms (1\u20138) was confirmed by mass spectrometry, and they showed similar platelet-activating activity on washed platelet suspensions. N- and O-deglycosylation of PA-BJ 1\u20138 under denaturing conditions generated variable electrophoretic profiles and showed that some forms were resistant to complete deglycosylation. Furthermore, N- and O-deglycosylation under non-denaturing conditions also showed different electrophoretic profiles between the PA-BJ forms and caused partial loss of their ability to cleave a recombinant exodomain of PAR1 receptor. In parallel, three cDNAs encoding PA-BJ-like enzymes were identified by pyrosequencing of a B. jararaca venom gland library constructed with RNA from a single specimen. Taken together, our results suggest that PA-BJ occurs in the B. jararaca venom in multiple proteoforms displaying similar properties upon platelets regardless of their variable isoelectric points, molecular masses, carbohydrate moieties and susceptibility to the activity of glycosidases, and highlight that variability of specific venom components contributes to venom proteome complexity.",

     "abstract": "Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is a deadenylase with three RNA-binding domains (the nuclease, R3H and RRM domains) and a C-terminal domain. PARN participates in diverse physiological processes by regulating mRNA fates through deadenylation. PARN mainly exists as a dimer in dilute solutions. In this research, we found that PARN could self-associate into tetramer and high-order oligomers both in vitro and in living cells. Mutational and spectroscopic analysis indicated that PARN oligomerization was triggered by the R3H domain, which led to the solvent-exposed Trp219 fluorophore to become buried in a solvent-inaccessible microenvironment. The RRM and C-terminal domains also played a role in modulating the dissociation rate of the tetrameric PARN. Enzymatic analysis indicated that tetramerization did not affect the catalytic behavior of the full-length PARN and truncated enzymes containing the RRM domain, which might be caused by the high propensity of the dimeric proteins to self-associate into oligomers. Tetramerization significantly enhanced the catalytic activity and processivity of the truncated form with the removal of the RRM and C-terminal domains. The results herein suggested that self-association might be one of the regulation methods for PARN to achieve a highly regulated deadenylase activity. We propose that self-association may facilitate PARN to concentrate around the target mRNAs by restricted diffusion.",

     "abstract": "FAD synthase (FMN:ATP adenylyl transferase, FMNAT or FADS, EC 2.7.7.2) is the last enzyme in the pathway converting riboflavin into FAD. In humans, FADS is localized in different subcellular compartments and exists in different isoforms. Isoform 2 (490-amino acids) is organized in two domains: the 3\u2032-phosphoadenosine-5\u2032-phosphosulfate (PAPS) reductase domain, that is the FAD-forming catalytic domain, and one resembling a molybdopterin-binding (MPTb) domain, with a hypothetical regulatory role. hFADS2 contains ten Cys residues, seven of which located in the PAPS reductase domain, with a possible involvement either in FAD synthesis or in FAD delivery to cognate apo-flavoproteins. A homology model of the PAPS reductase domain of hFADS2 revealed a co-ordinated network among the Cys residues in this domain. In this model, C312 and C303 are very close to the flavin substrate, consistent with a significantly lowered FAD synthesis rate in C303A and C312A mutants. FAD synthesis is also inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents, suggesting the involvement of free cysteines in the hFADS2 catalytic cycle. Mass spectrometry measurements and titration with thiol reagents on wt hFADS2 and on several individual cysteine/alanine mutants allowed us to detect two stably reduced cysteines (C139 and C241, one for each protein domain), two stable disulfide bridges (C399\u2013C402, C303\u2013C312, both in the PAPS domain), and two unstable disulfides (C39\u2013C50; C440\u2013C464). Whereas the C39\u2013C50 unstable disulfide is located in the MPTb domain and appears to have no catalytic relevance, a cysteine-based redox switch may involve formation and breakdown of a disulfide between C440 and C464 in the PAPS domain.",

     "abstract": "Initiation of adipocyte differentiation is promoted by the synergistic action of insulin/insulin-like growth factor, glucocorticoids, and agents activating cAMP-dependent signaling. The action of cAMP is mediated via PKA and Epac, where at least part of the PKA function relates to strong repression of Rho kinase activity, whereas Epac counteracts the reduction in insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling associated with complete repression of Rho kinase activity. However, detailed knowledge of the Epac-dependent branch and the interplay with PKA is still limited. In the present study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of Epac-mediated processes and their interplay with PKA during the initiation of 3 T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation using a combination of proteomics, molecular approaches, and bioinformatics. Proteomic analyses revealed 7 proteins specifically regulated in response to Epac activation, 4 in response to PKA activation, and 11 in response to the combined activation of Epac and PKA during the initial phase of differentiation. Network analyses indicated that the identified proteins are involved in pathways of importance for glucose metabolism, inositol metabolism, and calcium-dependent signaling thereby adding a novel facet to our understanding of cAMP-mediated potentiation of adipocyte differentiation.",

Mafs unique DNA-binding domain contains a highly conserved extended homology region (EHR) that allows to recognize longer DNA sequences than other basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors.Inspired by the fact that overexpression of Mafs is observed in about 50% of cases of multiple myeloma, a hematological malignant disorder, we undertook a peptide inhibitor approach. The LZ domain of c-Maf, one of large Mafs, was produced by solid phase peptide synthesis. We characterized its secondary structure and dimerization properties, and found that dimerization and folding events are strictly coupled. Moreover, potential peptidic c-Maf dimerization inhibitors were computationally designed and synthesized. These compounds were demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to bind to c-Maf LZ monomers, to drive folding of their partially disordered structure and to efficiently compete with dimerization, suggesting a way for interfering with the function of c-Maf and, more generally, of intrinsically disordered proteins, till now considered undruggable targets.",

In actinomycetes, the cobalamin-dependent radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) methyltransferase PhpK catalyzes the formation of the second C\u2013P bond to generate the complete C\u2013P\u2013C linkage in phosphinothricin. Here we use electron paramagnetic resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies to characterize and demonstrate the activity of a cobalamin-dependent radical SAM methyltransferase denoted SD_1168 from Shewanella denitrificans OS217, a marine bacterium that has not been reported to synthesize phosphinothricin. Recombinant, refolded, and reconstituted SD_1168 binds a four-iron, four-sulfur cluster that interacts with SAM and cobalamin. In the presence of SAM, a reductant, and methylcobalamin, SD_1168 surprisingly catalyzes the P-methylation of N-acetyl-demethylphosphinothricin and demethylphosphinothricin to produce N-acetyl-phosphinothricin and phosphinothricin, respectively. In addition, this enzyme is active in the absence of methylcobalamin if the strong reductant titanium (III) citrate and hydroxocobalamin are provided. When incubated with [methyl-13C] cobalamin and titanium citrate, both [methyl-13C] and unlabeled N-acetylphosphinothricin are produced. Our results suggest that SD_1168 catalyzes P-methylation using radical SAM-dependent chemistry with cobalamin as a coenzyme.

Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopies were used to examine the effects of pH (1.0\u20133.0 and 7.5\u201310.5) and temperature (20 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C) on the structural integrity of ALAS. The secondary structure, as deduced from far-UV CD, is mostly resilient to pH and temperature changes. Partial unfolding was observed at pH\u00a02.0, but further decreasing pH resulted in acid-induced refolding of the secondary structure to nearly native levels. The tertiary structure rigidity, monitored by near-UV CD, is lost under acidic and specific alkaline conditions (pH\u00a010.5 and pH\u00a09.5/37\u00a0\u00b0C), where ALAS populates a molten globule state. As the enzyme becomes less structured with increased alkalinity, the chiral environment of the internal aldimine is also modified, with a shift from a 420\u00a0nm to 330\u00a0nm dichroic band. Under acidic conditions, the PLP cofactor dissociates from ALAS. Reaction with 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid corroborates increased exposure of hydrophobic clusters in the alkaline and acidic molten globules, although the reaction is more pronounced with the latter. Furthermore, quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of ALAS with acrylamide at pH\u00a01.0 and 9.5 yielded subtly different dynamic quenching constants. The alkaline molten globule state of ALAS is catalytically active (pH\u00a09.5/37\u00a0\u00b0C), although the kcat value is significantly decreased. Finally, the binding of 5-aminolevulinate restricts conformational fluctuations in the alkaline molten globule. Overall, our findings prove how the structural plasticity of ALAS contributes to reaching a functional enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is a heparin-binding proangiogenic protein. FGF1 lacks the conventional N-terminal signal peptide required for secretion through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\u2013Golgi secretory pathway. FGF1 is released through a Cu2+-mediated nonclassical secretion pathway. The secretion of FGF1 involves the formation of a Cu2+-mediated multiprotein release complex (MRC) including FGF1, S100A13 (a calcium-binding protein) and p40 synaptotagmin (Syt1). It is believed that the binding of Cu2+ to the C2B domain is important for the release of FGF1 into the extracellular medium. In this study, using a variety of biophysical studies, Cu2+ and lipid interactions of the C2B domain of Syt1 were characterized. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments reveal that the C2B domain binds to Cu2+ in a biphasic manner involving an initial endothermic and a subsequent exothermic phase. Fluorescence energy transfer experiments using Tb3+ show that there are two Cu2+-binding pockets on the C2B domain, and one of these is also a Ca2+-binding site. Lipid-binding studies using ITC demonstrate that the C2B domain preferentially binds to small unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidyl serine (PS). Results of the differential scanning calorimetry and limited trypsin digestion experiments suggest that the C2B domain is marginally destabilized upon binding to PS vesicles. These results, for the first time, suggest that the main role of the C2B domain of Syt1 is to serve as an anchor for the FGF1 MRC on the membrane bilayer. In addition, the binding of the C2B domain to the lipid bilayer is shown to significantly decrease the binding affinity of the protein to Cu2+. The study provides valuable insights on the sequence of structural events that occur in the nonclassical secretion of FGF1.",

     "abstract": "Differences in salt bridges are believed to be a structural hallmark of homologous enzymes from differently temperature-adapted organisms. Nevertheless, the role of salt bridges on structural stability is still controversial. While it is clear that most buried salt bridges can have a functional or structural role, the same cannot be firmly stated for ion pairs that are exposed on the protein surface. Salt bridges, found in X-ray structures, may not be stably formed in solution as a result of high flexibility or high desolvation penalty. More studies are thus needed to clarify the picture on salt bridges and temperature adaptation. We contribute here to this scenario by combining atomistic simulations and experimental mutagenesis of eight mutant variants of aqualysin I, a thermophilic subtilisin-like proteinase, in which the residues involved in salt bridges and not conserved in a psychrophilic homolog were systematically mutated. We evaluated the effects of those mutations on thermal stability and on the kinetic parameters.Overall, we show here that only few key charged residues involved in salt bridges really contribute to the enzyme thermal stability. This is especially true when they are organized in networks, as here attested by the D17N mutation, which has the most remarkable effect on stability. Other mutations had smaller effects on the properties of the enzyme indicating that most of the isolated salt bridges are not a distinctive trait related to the enhanced thermal stability of the thermophilic subtilase.",

Modern methods of bioorthogonal and biocompatible chemical modifications could make antibody functionalization more predictable and easier, without compromising the functions of the antibody. To explore this concept, we modified the well-known anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drug, cetuximab (Erbitux\u00ae), with 5-azido-2-nitro-benzoyl (ANB) modifications by optimization of an acylation protocol. We then show that the resulting ANB\u2013cetuximab can be reliably modified with dyes (TAMRA and carboxyrhodamine) or a novel synthesized cyclooctyne modified biotin. The resulting dye- and biotin-modified cetuximabs were then tested across several assay platforms with several cell lines including U87, LN229, F98EGFR, F98WT and HEK293 cells. The assay platforms included fluorescence microscopy, FACS and biotin\u2013avidin based immunoprecipitation methods. The modified antibody performs consistently in all of these assay platforms, reliably determining relative abundances of EGFR expression on EGFR expressing cells (LN229 and F98EGFR) and failing to cross react with weak to negative EGFR expressing cells (U87, F98WT and HEK293). The ease of achieving diverse and assay relevant functionalizations as well as the consequent rapid construction of highly correlated antigen expression data sets highlights the power of bioorthogonal and biocompatible methods to conjugate macromolecules.

     "abstract": "The Synthesis of Cytochrome Oxidase protein, or SCO protein, is required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase in many mitochondrial and bacterial respiratory chains. SCOs have been proposed to deliver copper to the CuA site of cytochrome c oxidase. We have reported that Bacillus subtilis SCO (i.e., BsSCO) binds Cu(II) with high-affinity via a two-step process mediated by three conserved residues (i.e., two cysteines and one histidine, or the CCH motif). A remarkable feature in the reaction of reduced (i.e., di-thiol) BsSCO with copper is that it does not generate any of the disulfide form of BsSCO. This molecular aversion is proposed to be a consequence of a binding mechanism in which the initial copper complex of BsSCO does not involve cysteine, but instead involves nitrogen ligands. We test this proposal here by constructing two isomers of BsSCO in which the conserved copper binding residues (i.e., the CCH-motif) are retained, but their positions are altered. In these variants the two cysteines are exchanged with histidine, and both react transiently with copper (II) with distinct kinetic profiles. The reaction generates Cu(I) and the protein is oxidized to its disulfide form. EPR analysis supports a copper binding model in which cysteine, which is at the \u201chistidine position\u201d in the mutant, is part of an initial encounter complex with copper. When cysteine is the initial ligating residue an oxidation reaction ensues. In contrast initial binding to native BsSCO uses nitrogen-based ligands, and thereby avoids the opportunity for thiol oxidation.",

Thus, the study of conformational properties can be very informative for characterizing new proteins and to rationalize how residue substitutions at specific protein sites affect its dynamics, activity and thermal stability. Here, we investigate the structure and dynamics of the recently isolated cold-adapted acylaminoacyl peptidase from Sporosarcina psychrophila (SpAAP) by the integration of simulations, circular dichroism, mass spectrometry and other experimental data. Our study notes traits of cold-adaptation, such as lysine-to-arginine substitutions and a lack of disulphide bridges. Cold-adapted enzymes are generally characterized by a higher number of glycine residues with respect to their warm-adapted counterparts. Conversely, the SpAAP glycine content is lower than that in the warm-adapted variants. Nevertheless, glycine residues are strategically located in proximity to the functional sites in SpAAP, such as the active site and the linker between the two domains.. In particular, G457 reduces the steric hindrance around the nucleophile elbow. Our results suggest a local weakening of the intramolecular interactions in the cold-adapted enzyme. This study offers a basis for the experimental mutagenesis of SpAAP and related enzymes. The approaches employed in this study may also provide a more general framework to characterize new protein structures in the absence of X-ray or NMR data.",

The performance of these novel features is verified based on the 10-fold cross-validation test and leave-one-out cross-validation test. The proposed features are compared with the published features, and fused strategy is investigated by combining the current features with the published features. And, these combination features are also utilized to identify and prioritize Parkinson's disease-related genes.

The most drastic effect when bacteria were grown at 28\u00a0\u00b0C was the accumulation of heat shock proteins as well as other proteins related to stress, redox homeostasis or protein synthesis and degradation, and the decrease of enzymes and components of the cell envelope. Furthermore, two main responses in the adaptation to warm temperature were detected: the presence of diverse isoforms in some differentially expressed proteins, and the composition of chaperone interaction networks at the limits of growth temperature. The abundance changes of proteins suggest that warming induces a stress situation in S. frigidimarina forcing cells to reorganize their molecular networks as an adaptive response to these environmental conditions.",

However, data acquisition is typically labour intensive, has low throughput and is difficult to automate. These factors, combined with high protein consumption, have limited the adoption of chemical denaturant titrations in commercial settings. Thermal denaturation assays can be automated, sometimes with very high throughput. However, thermal denaturation assays are incompatible with proteins that aggregate at high temperatures and large extrapolation of stability parameters to physiological temperatures can introduce significant uncertainties. We used capillary-based instruments to measure chemical denaturant titrations by intrinsic fluorescence and microscale thermophoresis. This allowed higher throughput, consumed several hundred-fold less protein than conventional, cuvette-based methods yet maintained the high quality of the conventional approaches. We also established efficient strategies for automated, direct determination of protein stability at a range of temperatures via chemical denaturation, which has utility for characterising stability for proteins that are difficult to purify in high yield. This approach may also have merit for proteins that irreversibly denature or aggregate in classical thermal denaturation assays. We also developed procedures for affinity ranking of protein\u2013ligand interactions from ligand-induced changes in chemical denaturation data, and proved the principle for this by correctly ranking the affinity of previously unreported peptide\u2013PDZ domain interactions. The increased throughput, automation and low protein consumption of protein stability determinations afforded by using capillary-based methods to measure denaturant titrations, can help to revolutionise protein research. We believe that the strategies reported are likely to find wide applications in academia, biotherapeutic formulation and drug discovery programmes.",

The binding affinity of bacterial MnSOD to non-sequence specific double stranded oligomeric DNA has been quantitated previously by nitrocellulose filter binding and gel shift assays. In the current study we have examined the equilibrium binding of Escherichia coli MnSOD to poly(U), poly(A), poly(C), poly(dU) and double-stranded (ds) DNA. Equilibrium association constant, Kobs, was measured by monitoring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Based on the extent of quenching, Kobs was determined as a function of monovalent salt (MX) concentration and type, as well as temperature, from which \u0394G\u00b0obs and \u0394H\u00b0obs were determined. It was found that the polynucleotides bind to MnSOD in the following affinity hierarchy, poly(dU)\u00a0>\u00a0poly(U)\u00a0>\u00a0dsDNA\u00a0>\u00a0poly(A)\u00a0>\u00a0poly(C). The differences in the hierarchy were not large in magnitude as the poly(dU) bound with less than a 100-fold higher affinity than poly(C) at any given [MX]. For each polynucleotide, Kobs decreases only slightly with increasing [K+], surprising for a relatively non-specific nucleic acid protein. Thus, our finding that MnSOD can bind to RNA leads to the possibility that MnSOD may confer protection to RNA, as well. This is, as of yet, untested. Typically one would expect strong electrostatic interactions to dominate a non-specific binding event like that, but our results show an unexpectedly strong non-electrostatic contribution to the binding.",

Several pathogenic bacteria similarly express NeuNAc on their cell surfaces, allowing evasion of their host's immune system. Prokaryotic NeuNAc biosynthesis proceeds via condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc), a reaction catalysed by the domain-swapped homodimeric enzyme, N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase (NeuNAcS). Conversely, the mammalian orthologue, N-acetylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate synthase (NeuNAc 9-PS) utilises the phosphorylated substrate N-acetylmannosamine 6-phosphate (ManNAc 6-P) in catalysis. Here we report an investigation into the determinants of substrate specificity of human NeuNAc 9-PS, using model-guided mutagenesis to delineate binding interactions with ManNAc 6-P. Modelling predicts the formation of a domain-swapped homodimer as observed for bacterial variants, which was supported by experimental small angle X-ray scattering. A number of conserved residues which may play key roles in the selection of ManNAc 6-P were identified and substituted for alanine to assess their function. Lys290 and Thr80 were identified as a putative phosphate binding pair, with the cationic lysine residue extending into the active site from the adjacent chain of the dimeric enzyme. Substitution of these residues results in a significant loss of activity and reduced affinity for ManNAc 6-P. These residues, along with the electropositive \u03b22\u03b12 loop, are likely to facilitate the PEP dependent binding and stabilisation of ManNAc 6-P. By utilising a phosphorylated sugar-substrate, the mammalian enzyme gains considerable catalytic affinity advantage over its bacterial counterpart.",

Fibrinogen was isolated from human plasma of twelve individuals and subunits of fibrinogen were separated by RP-HPLC and subsequently analyzed by high resolution ESI mass spectrometry. Two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms on the A\u03b1- and B\u03b2-subunit could be identified on the basis of their mass shifts: Three individuals are heterozygous and two are homozygous for Thr312Ala on the A\u03b1-subunit, three individuals are heterozygous for Arg448Lys on the B\u03b2-subunit. For the A\u03b1-subunit we find mono- and diphosphorylation amounting to about 55% to 71% and O-glycosylation (likely sialyl-T-antigen) from 10% to 17%. N-glycosylation is present with one or two sialic acids in a ratio of about 3:2 and 3:1 for the B\u03b2 and the \u03b3-subunit, respectively.

     "abstract": "\u03b3-Glutamyl transpeptidases (\u03b3-GTs, EC 2.3.2.2) are a class of ubiquitous enzymes which initiate the cleavage of extracellular glutathione (\u03b3-Glu-Cys-Gly, GSH) into its constituent glutamate, cysteine, and glycine and catalyze the transfer of its \u03b3-glutamyl group to water (hydrolysis), amino acids or small peptides (transpeptidation). These proteins utilize a conserved Thr residue to process their chains into a large and a small subunit that then form the catalytically competent enzyme. Multiple sequence alignments have shown that some bacterial \u03b3-GTs, including that from Bacillus licheniformis (BlGT), possess an extra sequence at the C-terminal tail of the large subunit, whose role is unknown. Here, autoprocessing, structure, catalytic activity and stability against both temperature and the chemical denaturant guanidinium hydrochloride of six BlGT extra-sequence deletion mutants have been characterized by SDS-PAGE, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence and homology modeling. Data suggest that the extra sequence has a crucial role in enzyme activation and structural stability. Our results assist in the development of a structure-based interpretation of the autoprocessing reaction of \u03b3-GTs and are helpful to unveil the molecular bases of their structural stability.",

     "abstract": "The crystal structure of a putative protease from Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (ppBat) suggested the presence of a zinc ion in each protomer of the dimer as well as a flavin in the dimer interface. Since the chemical identity of the flavin and the exact mode of binding remained unclear, we have determined the crystal structure of ppBat in complex with riboflavin. The obtained structure revealed that the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between two tryptophan residues (Trp164) from both chains and adopts two alternate orientations with the N(10)-ribityl side chain protruding from the binding site in opposite directions. In order to characterize the zinc-binding site, we generated two single variants and one double variant in which the two coordinating cysteine residues (Cys74 and Cys111) were replaced by alanine. All three variants were unable to bind zinc demonstrating that both cysteine residues are essential for binding. Moreover, the lack of zinc binding also resulted in drastically reduced thermal stability (11\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C). A similar effect was obtained when wild-type protein was incubated with EDTA supporting the conclusion that the zinc-binding site plays an important structural role in ppBat. On the other hand, attempts to identify proteolytic activity failed suggesting that the zinc may not act as a catalytic center in ppBat. Structurally similar zinc binding motives in other proteins were also found to play a structural rather than catalytic role and hence it appears that neither the flavin nor the zinc binding sites possess a catalytic function in ppBat.",

Erythrocyte binding-like (EBL) proteins play crucial roles in the attachment of merozoites to human erythrocytes by binding to specific receptors on the cell surface. In this study, we have carried out a bioinformatics analysis of the three EBL proteins EBA-140, EBA-175 and EBA-181 and show that they contain a large amount of intrinsic disorder in particular within the RIII\u2013V domains. The functional role of these domains has so far not been identified, although antibodies raised against these regions were shown to inhibit parasite invasion. Here, we obtain a more complete structural and dynamic view of the EBL proteins by focusing on the biophysical characterization of a smaller construct of the RIII\u2013V regions of EBA-181 (EBA-181945\u20131097). We show using a number of techniques that EBA-181945\u20131097 is intrinsically disordered, and we obtain a detailed structural and dynamic characterization of the protein at atomic resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Our results show that EBA-181945\u20131097 is essentially a statistical coil with the presence of several turn motifs and does not possess transiently populated secondary structures as is common for many intrinsically disordered proteins that fold via specific, pre-formed molecular recognition elements.",

The presence of chemical species in a protein solution with strong absorbance within this range can interfere with the ability to use these methods for the determination of the protein's helical structure. The objective of this research was to overcome this problem by developing a method for CD spectral analysis that relies on spectral features above this wavelength range. In this study, we determined that the slopes of CD spectra acquired over the 230 to 240\u00a0nm region strongly correlate with the helix contents including \u03b1-helix and 310-helix of protein as determined using conventional CD algorithms that rely on wavelengths between 190 and 230\u00a0nm. This approach (i.e., the 230\u2013240\u00a0nm slope method) is proposed as an effective method to determine the helix content within proteins in the presence of additives such as detergents or denaturants with high absorbance of wavelengths up to 230\u00a0nm.",

Surfactants interact with proteins in many applications, often leading to significant changes in protein properties. Given GBS' marked difference in structure compared to traditional chemical surfactants, it is of interest to investigate their impact on protein structure and stability. Here we combine spectroscopic and calorimetric studies to analyze the interactions between the anionic GBS rhamnolipid (RL) and two model proteins \u03b1-lactalbumin in the Ca2\u00a0+-free apo-form (\u03b1LA) and myoglobin (Mb), whose interactions with traditional surfactants are well known. RL denatures \u03b1LA at sub-cmc concentrations (0.1\u20131\u00a0mM) while Mb is only denatured above the cmc, i.e. in the presence of RL micelles. Denaturation leads to increased \u03b1-helicity, similar to the effect of SDS. The proteins bind approximately the same amount of RL by weight as SDS. However, RL employs a denaturation mechanism which combines features from non-ionic surfactants (very slow unfolding kinetics and few unfolding steps) with those of SDS (unfolding below the cmc in the case of \u03b1LA and the ability to unfold stable proteins in the case of Mb). We ascribe these features to RL's weakly acidic carboxylic head group and complex hydrophobic tail, which lead to a low cmc and low protein affinity. These features restrict the concentration range where RL monomers can bind and denature proteins while still allowing micelles to bind and denature to a significant extent.",

A comparison of the dimeric interfaces showed that the one in SmtB is much larger and have salt bridges that can be disrupted to accommodate metal ions. A model of HlyU-DNA complex suggests bending of the DNA. Cys38 in the structure was found to be modified as sulfenic acid; the oxidized form was not seen in another structure solved under reducing condition. Although devoid of any metal binding site, the presence of a Cys residue exhibiting oxidation-reduction suggests the possibility of the existence of a redox switch in transcription regulation.

In this work, we perform a comprehensive investigation on the energetic basis underlying mutational effects on the stability of human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). We study twenty two variants whose kinetic stabilities span over eleven orders of magnitude and are classified into two groups: i) ten naturally-occurring variants, including the most common mutations causing primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1); and ii) twelve consensus variants obtained by sequence-alignment statistics. We show that AGT dimer stability determines denaturation rates, and mutations modulate stability by changes in the effective thermodynamic stability, the aggregation propensity of partially/globally unfolded states and subtle energetic changes in the rate-limiting denaturation step. In combination with our previous expression analyses in eukaryotic cells, we propose the existence of two lower limits for AGT stability, one linked to optimal folding efficiency (close to the major allele stability) and the other setting a minimal efficiency compatible with glyoxylate detoxification in vivo (close to the minor allele stability). These lower limits could explain the high prevalence of misfolding as a disease mechanism in PH1 and support the use of pharmacological ligands aimed to increase AGT stability as therapies for this disease.",

In this context a comprehensive understanding of cellular processes and their pathophysiology based on reliable information on abundance, localization, posttranslational modifications and dynamic interactions of cellular components is indispensable. Besides their significant impact as therapeutic molecules, antibodies are arguably the most powerful research tools to study endogenous proteins and other cellular components. However, for cellular diagnostics their use is restricted to endpoint assays using fixed and permeabilized cells.Alternatively, live cell imaging using fluorescent protein-tagged reporters is widely used to study protein localization and dynamics in living cells. However, only artificially introduced chimeric proteins are visualized, whereas the endogenous proteins, their posttranslational modifications as well as non-protein components of the cell remain invisible and cannot be analyzed. To overcome these limitations, traceable intracellular binding molecules provide new opportunities to perform cellular diagnostics in real time.

Interfering with protein\u2013protein interactions is an important aspiration in both basic and disease biology but small molecule inhibitors have been difficult and expensive to isolate. Recently, we have adapted molecular biology techniques to develop a simple set of protocols for isolation of high affinity antibody fragments (in the form of single VH domains) that function within the reducing environment of higher organism cells and can bind to their target molecules. The method called Intracellular Antibody Capture (IAC) has been used to develop inhibitory anti-RAS and anti-LMO2 single domains that have been used for target validation of these antigens in pre-clinical cancer models and illustrate the efficacy of the IAC approach to generation of drug surrogates. Future use of inhibitory VH antibody fragments as drugs in their own right (we term these macrodrugs to distinguish them from small molecule drugs) requires their delivery to target cells in vivo but they can also be templates for small molecule drug development that emulate the binding sites of the antibody fragments.

A promising solution to this fundamental limitation is the engineering of smaller scaffolds based on the IgG1 Fc region. These scaffolds can be used for the generation of libraries of mutants from which high-affinity binders can be selected. Comprised of the CH2 and CH3 domains, the Fc region is important not only for the antibody effector function but also for its long half-life. This review focuses on engineered Fc based antibody fragments and domains including native (dimeric) Fc and monomeric Fc as well as CH2 and monomeric CH3, and their use as novel scaffolds and binders. The Fc based binders are promising candidate therapeutics with optimized half-life, enhanced tissue penetration and access to sterically restricted binding sites resulting in an increased therapeutic efficacy.

     "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies are a remarkably successful class of therapeutics used to treat a wide range of indications. There has been growing interest in smaller antibody fragments such as Fabs, scFvs and domain antibodies in recent years. In particular, the development of human VH and VL single-domain antibody therapeutics, as stand-alone affinity reagents or as \u201cwarheads\u201d for larger molecules, are favored over other sources of antibodies due to their perceived lack of immunogenicity in humans. However, unlike camelid heavy-chain antibody variable domains (VHHs) which almost unanimously resist aggregation and are highly stable, human VHs and VLs are prone to aggregation and exhibit poor solubility. Approaches to reduce VH and VL aggregation and increase solubility are therefore very active areas of research within the antibody engineering community. Here we extensively chronicle the various mutational approaches that have been applied to human VHs and VLs to improve their biophysical properties such as expression yield, thermal stability, reversible unfolding and aggregation resistance. In addition, we describe stages of the VH and VL development process where these mutations could best be implemented.

     "abstract": "More and more antibody therapeutics are being approved every year, mainly due to their high efficacy and antigen selectivity. However, it is still difficult to identify the antigen, and thereby the function, of an antibody if no other information is available. There are obstacles inherent to the antibody science in every project in antibody drug discovery. Recent experimental technologies allow for the rapid generation of large-scale data on antibody sequences, affinity, potency, structures, and biological functions; this should accelerate drug discovery research. Therefore, a robust bioinformatic infrastructure for these large data sets has become necessary. In this article, we first identify and discuss the typical obstacles faced during the antibody drug discovery process. We then summarize the current status of three sub-fields of antibody informatics as follows: (i) recent progress in technologies for antibody rational design using computational approaches to affinity and stability improvement, as well as ab-initio and homology-based antibody modeling; (ii) resources for antibody sequences, structures, and immune epitopes and open drug discovery resources for development of antibody drugs; and (iii) antibody numbering and IMGT.

     "abstract": "Antibodies have evolved to function in oxidative, extracellular environments. A pair of cysteines in close proximity will oxidatively react to form a disulfide bond that fixes and stabilizes the tertiary structure of a protein. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) includes several disulfide bonds, and the patterns of inter-chain disulfide bonds characterize different IgG sub-classes. Moreover, the Ig-fold domains are characterized by a buried intra-domain disulfide bond, which is important for its structural stability. However, the intra-domain disulfide bond can be replaced without crucial effects on the structure and function, if the domain structure is intrinsically stable or has been stabilized by protein engineering. In previous studies, disulfide bonds were removed by amino-acid substitution indicating that Val and/or Ala (i.e. Ala\u2013Ala, Ala\u2013Val, Val\u2013Ala, and Val\u2013Ala) pairs were preferred for cysteine replacement in the Ig-fold domain. As such, these mutations may be useful for the intracellular use of antibodies. Recently, additional intra-domain disulfide bonds have been shown to stabilize Ig-fold domains and whole IgGs. In heavy chain variable or light chain variable domains, the introduction of additional disulfide bonds into the framework region did not reduce antigen-binding affinity, suggesting that generating disulfide bonds may be a method for stabilizing IgG and antibody fragments, such as the antigen-binding fragment, and single-chain and single-domain antibodies.

     "abstract": "Antibodies are uniquely suited to serve essential roles in the human immune defense as they combine several specific functions in one hetero-oligomeric protein. Their constant regions activate effector functions and their variable domains provide a stable framework that allows incorporation of highly diverse loop sequences. The combination of non-germline DNA recombination and mutation together with heavy and light chain assembly allows developing variable regions that specifically recognize essentially any antigen they may encounter. However, this diversity also requires tailor-made mechanisms to guarantee that folding and association of antibodies is carefully this diversity also requires tailor-made mechanisms to guarantee that folding and association of antibodies is carefully controlled before the protein is secreted from a plasma cell. Accordingly, the generic immunoglobulin fold \u03b2-barrel structure of antibody domains has been fine-tuned during evolution to fit the different requirements. Work over the past decades has identified important aspects of the folding and assembly of antibody domains and chains revealing domain specific variations of a general scheme. The most striking is the folding of an intrinsically disordered antibody domain in the context of its partner domain as the basis for antibody assembly and its control on the molecular level in the cell. These insights have not only allowed a better understanding of the antibody folding process but also provide a wealth of opportunities for rational optimization of antibody molecules.In this review, we summarize current concepts of antibody folding and assembly and discuss how they can be utilized to engineer antibodies with improved performance for different applications.

The interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins of the same subclass are promiscuous; there are cross-interactions between some subclasses, but not all. To understand how Eph\u2013ephrin interactions can be both promiscuous and specific, we investigated sixteen energy landscapes of four Eph receptors (A2, A4, B2, and B4) interacting with four ephrin ligands (A1, A2, A5, and B2). We generated conformational ensembles and recognition energy landscapes starting from separated Eph and ephrin molecules and proceeding up to the formation of Eph\u2013ephrin complexes. Analysis of the Eph\u2013ephrin recognition trajectories and the co-evolution entropy of 400 ligand binding domains of Eph receptor and 241 ephrin ligands identified conserved residues during the recognition process. Our study correctly predicted the promiscuity and specificity of the interactions and provided insights into their recognition. The dynamic conformational changes during Eph\u2013ephrin recognition can be described by progressive conformational selection and population shift events, with two dynamic salt bridges between EphB4 and ephrin-B2 contributing to the specific recognition. EphA3 cancer-related mutations lowered the binding energies.

De novo cysteine biosynthesis is one of the essential pathways reported in bacteria, protozoa, and plants. Serine acetyltransferase (SAT) initiates this reaction by catalyzing the formation of O-acetylserine (OAS) using l-serine and acetyl coenzyme A as substrates. Here we report kinetic and crystallographic studies of this enzyme from B. abortus. The kinetic studies indicate that cysteine competitively inhibits the binding of serine to B. abortus SAT (BaSAT) and noncompetitively inhibits the binding of acetyl coenzyme A. The crystal structures of BaSAT in its apo state and in complex with coenzyme A (CoA) were determined to 1.96\u00a0\u00c5 and 1.87\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, respectively. BaSAT was observed as a trimer in a size exclusion column; however, it was seen as a hexamer in dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies and in the crystal structure, indicating it may exist in both states. The complex structure shows coenzyme A bound to the C-terminal region, making mostly hydrophobic contacts from the center of the active site extending up to the surface of the protein. There is no conformational difference in the enzyme between the apo and the complexed states, indicating lock and key binding and the absence of an induced fit mechanism.",

RHA contains a conserved core helicase domain that is flanked by five other domains. Two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD1 and dsRBD2) are at the N-terminus, whereas HA2 (helicase associated 2), OB-fold (oligonucleotide- or oligosaccharide-binding fold), and RGG (repeats of arginine and glycine\u2013glycine residues) domains are at the C-terminus. The role of these domains in the helicase activity of RHA is still elusive due to the difficulty of obtaining enzymatically active mutant RHA. Here, we purified a series of mutant RHAs containing deletions in either N-terminus or C-terminus. Analysis of these mutant RHAs reveals that the dsRBDs are not required for RNA unwinding, but can enhance the helicase activity by promoting the binding of RHA to substrate RNA. In contrast, deletion of C-terminal domains including RGG, OB-fold, and HA2 does not significantly affect the binding of RHA to substrate RNA. However, HA2 is essential for the RNA unwinding by RHA whereas the RGG and OB-fold are dispensable. The results indicate that the core helicase domain alone is not enough for RHA to execute the unwinding activity.",

Besides blocking the catalytic activity, recent works have shown that some PARP inhibitors exhibit a poisoning activity, by trapping the enzyme at damaged sites of DNA and forming cytotoxic complexes.In this study we have used microsecond molecular dynamics to study the allosteric reverse signalling that is at the basis of such an effect. We show that Olaparib, but not Veliparib and HYDAMTIQ, is able to induce a specific conformational drift of the WGR domain of PARP-1, which stabilizes PARP-1/DNA complex through the locking of several salt bridge interactions. Fluorescence anisotropy assays support such a mechanism, providing the first experimental evidence that HYDAMTIQ, a potent PARP inhibitor with neuroprotective properties, is less potent than Olaparib to trap PARP-1/DNA complex.",

This study examines the molecular basis for the different allosteric properties and quaternary structural stability of m-NAD(P)-ME and c-NADP-ME. Multiple residues corresponding to the fumarate-binding site were mutated in human c-NADP-ME to correspond to those found in human m-NAD(P)-ME. Additionally, the crystal structure of the apo (ligand-free) human c-NADP-ME conformation was determined. Kinetic studies indicated no significant difference between the wild-type and mutant enzymes in Km,NADP, Km,malate, and kcat. A chimeric enzyme, [51-105]_c-NADP-ME, was designed to include the putative fumarate-binding site of m-NAD(P)-ME at the dimer interface of c-NADP-ME; however, this chimera remained nonallosteric. In addition to fumarate activation, the quaternary structural stability of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME is quite different; c-NADP-ME is a stable tetramer, whereas m-NAD(P)-ME exists in equilibrium between a dimer and a tetramer. The quaternary structures for the S57K/N59E/E73K/S102D and S57K/N59E/E73K/S102D/H74K/D78P/D80E/D87G mutants of c-NADP-ME are tetrameric, whereas the K57S/E59N/K73E/D102S m-NAD(P)-ME quadruple mutant is primarily monomeric with some dimer formation. These results strongly suggest that the structural features near the fumarate-binding site and the dimer interface are highly related to the quaternary structural stability of c-NADP-ME and m-NAD(P)-ME.

While the identity of the metal varies, the binding site is well-conserved at the superfamily level with an aspartic acid and two histidine residues acting as ligands to the metal. Previous structural and bioinformatics results indicate that the metal can adopt an alternate architecture through the addition of an asparagine residue as a fourth ligand. This asparagine residue is strictly conserved in all members of the DRE-TIM metallolyase superfamily except fungal homocitrate synthase (HCS-lys) where it is replaced with isoleucine. The role of this additional metal ligand in \u03b1-isopropylmalate synthase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtIPMS) has been investigated using site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of the asparagine ligand with alanine or isoleucine results in inactive enzymes with respect to \u03b1-isopropylmalate formation. Control experiments suggest that the substitutions have not drastically affected the enzyme's structure indicating that the asparagine residue is essential for catalysis. Interestingly, all enzyme variants retained acetyl CoA hydrolysis activity in the absence of \u03b1-ketoisovalerate, similar to the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the requirement of magnesium for \u03b1-isopropylmalate formation, hydrolytic activity could be inhibited by the addition of magnesium chloride in wild-type, D81E, and N321A MtIPMS, but not in the other variants studied. Attempts to rescue loss of activity in N321I MtIPMS by mimicking the fungal HCS active site through the D81E/N321I double variant were unsuccessful.

These reactions, carried out by protein acetyltransferase enzymes, act by transferring an acetyl group from acetyl-coenzymeA (Ac-CoA) to various substrate proteins. Such protein acetylation remains poorly understood in Archaea, and has been only partially described. Information processing in Archaea has been reported to be similar to that in eukaryotes and distinct from the equivalent bacterial processes. The human N-acetyltransferase Ard1 (hArd1) is one of the acetyltransferases that has been found to be overexpressed in various cancer cells and tissues, and knockout of the hArd1 gene significantly reduces growth rate of the cancer cell lines. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of Thermoplasma volcanium Ard1 (Tv Ard1), which shows both ligand-free and multiple ligand-bound forms, i.e.,Ac-CoA- and coenzyme A (CoA)-bound forms. The difference between ligand-free and ligand-bound chains in the crystal structure was used to search for the interacting residues. The re-orientation and position of the loop between \u03b24 and \u03b13 including the phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) were observed, which are important for the ligand interaction. In addition, a biochemical assay to determine the N-acetyltransferase activity of Tv Ard1 was performed using the T.volcanium substrate protein Alba (Tv Alba). Taken together, the findings of this study elucidate ligand-free form of Tv Ard1 for the first time and suggest multiple modes of binding with Ac-CoA and CoA.",

The development of PSPAs to obtain 0\u00a0\u00c5 RMSD from native structures is considered central to computational biology. However, till date it has been quite challenging to measure how far a predicted protein structure is from its native \u2014 in the absence of a known experimental/native structure. In this work, we report the development of a metric \u201cD2N\u201d (distance to the native) \u2014 that predicts the \u201cRMSD\u201d of any structure without actually knowing the native structure. By combining physico-chemical properties and known universalities in spatial organization of soluble proteins to develop D2N, we demonstrate the ability to predict the distance of a proposed structure to within \u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0\u01fa error with a remarkable average accuracy of 93.6% for structures below 5\u00a0\u01fa from the native.

     "abstract": "Human centrosomal proteins show a significant, 3.5 fold, bias to be both unstructured and coiled-coils with respect to generic human proteins, based on results from state of the art bioinformatics tools. We hypothesize that this bias means that these proteins adopt an ensemble of disordered and partially helical conformations, with the latter becoming stabilized when these proteins form complexes. Characterization of the structural properties of 13 peptides from 10 different centrosomal proteins ranging in size from 20 to 61 residues by biophysical methods led us to confirm our hypothesis in most cases. Interestingly, the secondary structure adopted by most of these peptides becomes stabilized at acidic pH and it is concentration dependent. For two of them, PIK3R1453\u2013513 and BRCA11253\u20131273, we observed not only the stabilization of helical structure through self-association, but also the presence of \u03b2-structures linked to the formation of high molecular weight oligomers. These oligomers are the predominant forms detected by CD, but unobservable by liquid state NMR. BRCA11397\u20131424 and MAP3K11396\u2013441 populate helical structures that can also self-associate at pH\u00a03 through oligomeric species. Four peptides, derived from three proteins, namely CCNA2103\u2013123, BRCA11253\u20131273, BRCA11397\u20131424 and PIK3R1453\u2013513, can form intermolecular associations that are concomitant with alpha or beta structure stabilization. The self-phosphorylation previously described for the kinase NEK2 did not lead to any stabilization in the peptide's structure of NEK2303\u2013333, NEK2341\u2013361, and NEK2410\u2013430. Based on these results, obtained from a series of peptides derived from a significant number of different centrosomal proteins, we propose that conformational polymorphism, modulated by intermolecular interactions is a general property of centrosomal proteins.",

     "abstract": "Sperm-specific glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDS) exhibits enhanced stability compared to the somatic isoenzyme (GAPD). A comparative analysis of the structures of these isoenzymes revealed characteristic features, which could be important for the stability of GAPDS: six specific proline residues and three buried salt bridges. To evaluate the impact of these structural elements into the stability of this isoenzyme, we obtained two series of mutant GAPDS: 1) six mutants each containing a substitution of one of the specific prolines by alanine, and 2) three mutants each containing a mutation breaking one of the salt bridges. Stability of the mutants was evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry and by their resistance towards guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The most effect on thermostability was observed for the mutants P326A and P164A: the Tm values of the heat-absorption curves decreased by 6.0 and 3.3\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the wild type protein, respectively. The resistance towards GdnHCl was affected most by the mutation D311N breaking the salt bridge between the catalytic and NAD+-binding domains: the inactivation rate constant in the presence of GdnHCl increased six-fold, and the value of GdnHCl concentration corresponding to the protein half-denaturation decreased from 1.83 to 1.35\u00a0M. Besides, the mutation D311N enhanced the enzymatic activity of the protein two-fold. The results suggest that the residues P164 (\u03b2-turn), P326 (first position of \u03b1-helix), and the interdomain salt bridge D311\u2013H124 are significant for the enhanced stability of GAPDS. The salt bridge D311\u2013H124 enhances stability of the active site of GAPDS at the expense of the catalytic activity.",

     "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)/protein regions (IDPRs) lack unique three-dimensional structure at the level of secondary and/or tertiary structure and are represented as an ensemble of interchanging conformations. To investigate the role of presence/absence of secondary structures in promoting intrinsic disorder in proteins, a comparative sequence analysis of IDPs, IDPRs and proteins with minimal secondary structures (less than 5%) is required. A sequence analysis reveals proteins with minimal secondary structure content have high mean net positive charge, low mean net hydrophobicity and low sequence complexity. Interestingly, analysis of the relative local electrostatic interactions reveal that an increase in the relative repulsive interactions between amino acids separated by three or four residues lead to either loss of secondary structure or intrinsic disorder. IDPRs show increase in both local negative-negative and positive-positive repulsive interactions. While IDPs show a marked increase in the local negative-negative interactions, proteins with minimal secondary structure depict an increase in the local positive-positive interactions. IDPs and IDPRs are enriched in D, E and Q residues, while proteins with minimal secondary structure are depleted of these residues. Proteins with minimal secondary structures have higher content of G and C, while IDPs and IDPRs are depleted of these residues. These results confirm that proteins with minimal secondary structure have a distinctly different propensity for charge, hydrophobicity, specific amino acids and local electrostatic interactions as compared to IDPs/IDPRs. Thus we conclude that lack of secondary structure may be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for intrinsic disorder in proteins.",

Comparison of the bioactivity of S1 and S2 as muscle relaxants has revealed that S2 is ten times more potent than S1. Here we investigated a structural basis for this difference in potency by comparing the bioactivity and solution conformations (using NMR and CD spectroscopy) of S1 and S2 with three chimeric analogs of these peptides. A peptide comprising S1 with the addition of S2's N-terminal tetrapeptide (Long S1 or LS1; SGPY GFNSALMFamide) was not significantly different to S1 in its bioactivity and did not exhibit concentration-dependent structuring seen with S2. An analog of S1 with its penultimate residue substituted from S2 (S1(T); GFNSAL T Famide) exhibited S1-like bioactivity and structure. However, an analog of S2 with its penultimate residue substituted from S1 (S2(M); SGPYSFNSGL M Famide) exhibited loss of S2-type bioactivity and structural properties. Collectively, our data indicate that the C-terminal regions of S1 and S2 are the key determinants of their differing bioactivity. However, the N-terminal region of S2 may influence its bioactivity by conferring structural stability in solution. Thus, analysis of chimeric SALMFamides has revealed how neuropeptide bioactivity is determined by a complex interplay of sequence and conformation.",

     "abstract": "Electrostatic interaction is a major driving force in the binding of proteins to highly acidic glycosaminoglycan, such as heparin. Although NMR backbone chemical shifts have generally been used to identify the heparin-binding site on a protein, however, there is no correlation between the binding free energies and the perturbed backbone chemical shifts for individual residues. The binding event occurs at the end of a side chain of basic residue, and does not require causing significant alterations in the backbone environment at a distance of multiple bonds. We used the H2CN NMR pulse sequence to detect heparin binding through the side-chain resonances H\u03b5\u2013C\u03b5\u2013N\u03b6 of Lys and H\u03b4\u2013C\u03b4\u2013N\u03b5 of Arg in the two proteins of hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). H2CN titration experiments revealed chemical shift perturbations in the side chains, which were correlated with the free energy changes in various mutants. The residues K19 in HDGF and K125 in FGF2 demonstrated the most significant perturbations, consistent with our previous observation that the two residues are crucial for binding. The result suggests that H2CN NMR provides a precise evaluation for the electrostatic interactions. The discrepancy observed between backbone and side chain chemical shifts is correlated to the solvent accessibility of residues that the K19 and K125 backbones are highly buried with the restricted backbone conformation and are not strongly affected by the events at the end of the side chains.",

In the case of wild-type enzyme these reactions are described by the same kinetic scheme where binding of holoenzyme with an amino acid, leading to reversible formation of an external aldimine, proceeds very fast, while following transformations, leading finally to reversible formation of a quinonoid intermediate proceed with measureable rates. Principally the same scheme (\u201cinduced fit\u201d) is realized in the case of mutant Y72F enzyme reaction with OIA. For the reaction of mutant enzyme with l-Trp at lower concentrations of the latter a principally different kinetic scheme is observed. This scheme suggests that binding of the substrate and formation of the quinonoid intermediate are at fast equilibrium, while preceding conformational changes of the holoenzyme proceed with measureable rates (\u201cselected fit\u201d). For the reaction with S-ethyl-l-cysteine the observed concentration dependence of kobs agrees with the realization of both kinetic schemes, the \u201cselected fit\u201d becoming predominant at lower concentrations of substrate, the \u201cinduced fit\u201d\u2014 at higher ones. In the reaction with S-ethyl-l-cysteine the formation of the quinonoid intermediate proceeds slower than does catalytic \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination of ethylthiol from S-ethyl-l-cysteine, and consequently does not play a considerable role in the catalysis, which may be effected by a concerted E2 mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Our study on the highly charged N-terminal peptide of the human chemokine receptor CXCR3 by spectroscopic methods in solution and by means of molecular dynamics simulations showed that the charge content modulates the intrinsic structural preference of its flexible backbone. Collectively, our findings suggest that the structural organization of a protein should be seen as a part of a continuum in which the ratio between electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and the intrinsic flexibility are important properties used to optimize the folding. When this ratio changes and the structure is intrinsically flexible, the structural organization of the system moves along the continuum of the possible conformational states. By all this combined information, one can describe the structure of CXCR3(1\u201348) as an ensemble of conformations. In fact, the peptide shows stretches of negative charges embedded in a flexible sequence which can be used to maximize promiscuous interactions relevant to molecular recognition but globally the peptide appears as a poly-structured globule-like ensemble that is dynamically stabilized by H-bonds. We have approached the study of the most populated ensembles with subset selection to explain our experimental data also by evidencing that the changes into the fraction of charged residues discriminate between dynamically poly-structured states, conceivably because of small free energy barriers existing between the different conformations of CXCR3(1\u201348). Therefore, the overlap of a highly flexible backbone, negatively charged residues and sites which can be modified by post-translational modifications represent the structural organization that controls the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological functions carried out by CXCR3(1\u201348).",

On the other hand, we suggested that monomers also bind to the lateral sides of preformed fibrils during the seed-dependent elongation, diffuse to the growing ends, and finally make further conformation changes to the mature amyloid fibrils. To examine lateral binding during the elongation of fibrils, we used islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), which has been associated with type II diabetes, and prepared IAPP modified with the fluorescence dye, Alexa532.

However, recent years have seen significant advances in glycoproteomics driven, in part, by the developments of dedicated workflows and efficient sample preparation, including glycopeptide enrichment and prefractionation. In addition, glycoproteomics has benefitted from the continuous performance enhancement and more intelligent use of liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) instrumentation and a wider selection of specialized software tackling the unique challenges of glycoproteomics data. Together these advances promise more streamlined N- and O-linked glycoproteome analysis.

Most apparent among these are the ability to tetramerize and the presence of a flexible loop. The loop, situated between the 113\u2013119 residues, has been reported necessary for the tetramerization process. In this article, we report that a residue outside of this loop, Asn112, is a key to the process \u2014 to the point where the single Asn112Leu mutation prevents tetramerization altogether. We propose that a structural pattern involving the interaction of the Asn112 and Lys117 residues from two neighboring subunits plays a role in keeping the tetramer structure stable. We also report that, for the tetramerization of the wild-type PfGST to occur, phosphate or pyrophosphate anions must be present. In other words, tetramerization is a phosphate- or pyrophosphate-induced process. Furthermore, the presence of magnesium reinforces this induction. We present experimental evidence for these claims as well as a preliminary calorimetric and kinetic study of the dimeric Asn112Leu PfGST mutant.

     "abstract": "Human cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (hCBS) is a key enzyme of sulfur amino acid metabolism, controlling the commitment of homocysteine to the transsulfuration pathway and antioxidant defense. Mutations in hCBS cause inherited homocystinuria (HCU), a rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by accumulation of toxic homocysteine in blood and urine. hCBS is a complex multidomain and oligomeric protein whose activity and stability are independently regulated by the binding of S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) to two different types of sites at its C-terminal regulatory domain. Here we study the role of surface electrostatics on the complex regulation and stability of hCBS using biophysical and biochemical procedures. We show that the kinetic stability of the catalytic and regulatory domains is significantly affected by the modulation of surface electrostatics through noticeable structural and energetic changes along their denaturation pathways. We also show that surface electrostatics strongly affect SAM binding properties to those sites responsible for either enzyme activation or kinetic stabilization. Our results provide new insight into the regulation of hCBS activity and stability in vivo with implications for understanding HCU as a conformational disease. We also lend experimental support to the role of electrostatic interactions in the recently proposed binding modes of SAM leading to hCBS activation and kinetic stabilization.",

     "abstract": "Firefly luciferase is a two-domain enzyme that catalyzes the bioluminescent reaction of firefly luciferin oxidation. Color of the emitted light depends on the structure of the enzyme, yet the exact color-tuning mechanism remains unknown by now, and the role of the C-domain in it is rarely discussed, because a very few color-shifting mutations in the C-domain were described. Recently we reported a strong red-shifting mutation E457K in the C-domain; the bioluminescence spectra of this enzyme were independent of temperature or pH. In the present study we investigated the role of the residue E457 in the enzyme using the Luciola mingrelica luciferase with a thermostabilized N-domain as a parent enzyme for site-directed mutagenesis. We obtained a set of mutants and studied their catalytic properties, thermal stability and bioluminescence spectra. Experimental spectra were represented as a sum of two components (bioluminescence spectra of putative \u201cred\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d emitters); \u03bbmax of these components were constant for all the mutants, but the ratio of these emitters was defined by temperature and mutations in the C-domain. We suggest that each emitter is stabilized by a specific conformation of the active site; thus, enzymes with two forms of the active site coexist in the reactive media. The rigid structure of the C-domain is crucial for maintaining the conformation corresponding to the \u201cgreen\u201d emitter. We presume that the emitters are the keto- and enol forms of oxyluciferin.",

To identify the surface hydrophobic surfaces on apo and Ca2\u00a0+DREAM as a possible interaction sites for target proteins and/or specific regulators of DREAM function the binding interactions of 1,8-ANS and 2,6-ANS with DREAM were characterized by fluorescence and docking studies. Emission intensity of ANS\u2013DREAM complexes increases upon Ca2\u00a0+ association which is consistent with an overall decrease in surface polarity. The dissociation constants for ANS binding to apoDREAM and Ca2\u00a0+DREAM were determined to be 195\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM and 62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively.

One site is near the exiting helix of EF-4 and the second site is located in the hydrophobic crevice between EF-3 and EF-4. 1,8-ANS displacement studies using arachidonic acid demonstrate that the hydrophobic crevice between EF-3 and EF-4 serves as a binding site for fatty acids that modulate functional properties of Kv4 channel:KChIP complexes. Thus, the C-terminal hydrophobic crevice may be involved in DREAM interactions with small hydrophobic ligands as well as other intracellular proteins.",

In order to assess the genuineness of this commercial liqueur, we have prepared extracts of the three vegetable ingredients, assessed their proteomes, and compared them to the one found in the aperitif. The amaro's proteome was identified via prior capture with CPLLs at two different pH values (2.2 and 4.8). Via mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered fractions, after elution of the captured populations in 4% boiling SDS, we could confirm the presence of the following: six proteins originating from honey, 11 from orange peels, 29 from G. lutea and 46 from A. officinalis (including shared species), plus 33 species which could not be attributed to the other secret ingredients, due to paucity of genomic data on plant proteins, for a total of 93 unique gene products (merging shared proteins). This fully confirmed the genuineness of the product. Considering that most of these species could be present in trace amounts, undetectable by conventional techniques, the CPLL methodology, due to its ability to enhance the signal of trace components up to 3 to 4 orders of magnitude, could represent a powerful tool for investigating the genuineness and natural origin of commercial beverages in order to protect consumers from adulterated products.",

     "abstract": "HlyA from Escherichia coli is a member of the repeats in toxin (RTX) protein family, produced by a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria and secreted by a dedicated Type 1 Secretion System (T1SS). RTX proteins are thought to be secreted in an unfolded conformation and to fold upon secretion by Ca2\u00a0+ binding. However, the exact mechanism of secretion, ion binding and folding to the correct native state remains largely unknown. In this study we provide an easy protocol for high-level pro-HlyA purification from E. coli. Equilibrium folding studies, using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, revealed the well-known fact that Ca2\u00a0+ is essential for stability as well as correct folding of the whole protein. In the absence of Ca2\u00a0+, pro-HlyA adopts a non-native conformation. Such molecules could however be rescued by Ca2\u00a0+ addition, indicating that these are not dead-end species and that Ca2\u00a0+ drives pro-HlyA folding. More importantly, pro-HlyA unfolded via a two-state mechanism, whereas folding was a three-state process. The latter is indicative of the presence of a stable folding intermediate. Analysis of deletion and Trp mutants revealed that the first folding transition, at 6\u20137\u00a0M urea, relates to Ca2\u00a0+ dependent structural changes at the extreme C-terminus of pro-HlyA, sensed exclusively by Trp914. Since all Trp residues of HlyA are located outside the RTX domain, our results demonstrate that Ca2\u00a0+ induced folding is not restricted to the RTX domain. Taken together, Ca2\u00a0+ binding to the pro-HlyA RTX domain is required to drive the folding of the entire protein to its native conformation.",

Calorie restriction (CR) reduces the risk for age and obesity-associated complications. The impact of CR on obesity has been examined with human intervention studies, which showed alterations in circulating adipokines. However, a direct effect of CR on the human adipocyte secretome remains elusive. Therefore, the effect of a 96\u00a0h low glucose CR on the secretion profile of in vitro cultured mature human SGBS adipocytes was investigated by using proteomics technology. Low-glucose CR decreased the adipocyte triglyceride contents and resulted in an altered secretion profile. Changes in the secretome indicated an improved inflammatory phenotype. In addition, several adipocyte-secreted proteins related to insulin resistance showed a reversed expression after low-glucose CR. Furthermore, 6 novel CR-regulated adipocyte-secreted proteins were identified. Since resveratrol (RSV) mimics CR we compared results from this study with data from our previous RSV study on the SGBS adipocyte secretome. The CR and RSV adipocyte secretomes partly differed from each other, although both treatment strategies lead to secretome changes indicating a less inflammatory phenotype. Furthermore, both treatments induced SIRT1 expression and resulted in a reversed expression of detrimental adipokines associated with metabolic complications.",

Data suggest that the binding of l-Glu induces a reordering of the C-terminal tail of BlGT large subunit and allow the identification of a cluster of acid residues that are potentially involved in the recognition of a metal ion. The role of these residues on the conformational stability of BlGT has been studied by characterizing the autoprocessing, enzymatic activity, chemical and thermal denaturation of four new Ala single mutants.

For the design of libraries it is beneficial to know positions that will permit loop elongation to increase the potential interaction surface with antigen. However, the insertion of additional loop residues might impair the immunoglobulin fold. In the present work we have probed whether stabilizing mutations flanking the randomized and elongated loop region improve the quality of Fcab libraries. In detail, 13 libraries were constructed having the C-terminal part of the EF loop randomized and carrying additional residues (1, 2, 3, 5 or 10, respectively) in the absence and presence of two flanking mutations. The latter have been demonstrated to increase the thermal stability of the CH3 domain of the respective solubly expressed proteins. Assessment of the stability of the libraries expressed on the surface of yeast cells by flow cytometry demonstrated that loop elongation was considerably better tolerated in the stabilized libraries. By using in silico loop reconstruction and mimicking randomization together with MD simulations the underlying molecular dynamics were investigated. In the presence of stabilizing stem residues the backbone flexibility of the engineered EF loop as well as the fluctuation between its accessible conformations were decreased. In addition the CD loop (but not the AB loop) and most of the framework regions were rigidified. The obtained data are discussed with respect to the design of Fcabs and available data on the relation between flexibility and affinity of CDR loops in Ig-like molecules.",

In general, the chloromuconate cycloisomerases catalyze not only the cycloisomerization, but also the process of dehalogenation of the chloromuconate to dienelactone. However Rho-2-CMCI, unlike the homologous enzymes from the Gram-negative bacteria, is very specific for only one position of the chloride on the substrate chloromuconate. Furthermore, Rho-2-CMCI is not able to dehalogenate the 5-chloromuconolactone and therefore it cannot generate the dienelactone.The crystallographic structure of the homooctameric Rho-2-CMCI was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of the structure of chloromuconate cycloisomerase from Pseudomonas putida PRS2000. The structure was analyzed and compared to the other already known structures of (chloro)muconate cycloisomerases. In addition to this, molecular docking calculations were carried out, which allowed us to determine the residues responsible for the high substrate specificity and the lack of dehalogenation activity of Rho-2-CMCI. Our studies highlight that a histidine, located in a loop that closes the active site cavity upon the binding of the substrate, could be related to the dehalogenation inability of Rho-2-CMCI and in general of the muconate cycloisomerases.",

Thus, this paper focuses especially on the conformation of pressure-induced unfolding states of both forms of calmodulin, by combining small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) with biophysical techniques such as tyrosines and ANS fluorescence. In contrast to heat denaturation (Gibrat et al., BBA, 2012), the pressure denaturation of calmodulin is reversible up to pressures of 3000\u00a0bar (300\u00a0MPa). A pressure-induced compact intermediate state has been found for the two calmodulin forms, but their unfolding pathways are different. A domain compaction and an increase of the ANS fluorescence of holo form have been evidenced. On the contrary, a domain dilatation and an ANS fluorescence decrease have been found for the apo form. The pressure induced an increase of the interdomain distance for both calmodulin forms, suggesting that the central linker of calmodulin is flexible in solution.",

     "abstract": "Several snake species possess endogenous phospholipase A2 inhibitors (sbPLIs) in their blood plasma, the primary role of which is protection against an eventual presence of toxic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) from their venom glands in the circulation. These inhibitors have an oligomeric structure of, at least, three subunits and have been categorized into three classes (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3) based on their structural features. Sb\u03b3PLIs have been further subdivided into two subclasses according to their hetero or homomeric nature, respectively. Despite the considerable number of sb\u03b3PLIs described, their structures and mechanisms of action are still not fully understood. In the present study, we focused on the native structure of CNF, a homomeric sb\u03b3PLI from Crotalus durissus terrificus, the South American rattlesnake. Based on the results of different biochemical and biophysical experiments, we concluded that, while the native inhibitor occurs as a mixture of oligomers, tetrameric arrangement appears to be the predominant quaternary structure. The inhibitory activity of CNF is most likely associated with this oligomeric conformation. In addition, we suggest that the CNF tetramer has a spherical shape and that tyrosinyl residues could play an important role in the oligomerization. The carbohydrate moiety, which is present in most sb\u03b3PLIs, is not essential for the inhibitory activity, oligomerization or complex formation of the CNF with the target PLA2. A minor component, comprising no more than 16% of the sample, was identified in the CNF preparations. The amino-terminal sequence of that component is similar to the B subunits of the heteromeric sb\u03b3PLIs; however, the role played by such molecule in the functionality of the CNF, if any, remains to be determined.",

     "abstract": "The smoothelin-like 1 protein (SMTNL1) is a modulator of smooth and skeletal muscle contractility and can bind to calmodulin and tropomyosin. Calmodulin is the major calcium sensor of eukaryotic cells and it can cycle between calcium-free (apo-CaM) and calcium-bound (Ca-CaM) forms. Bioinformatic screening of the SMTNL1 sequence predicted a second CaM-binding region (CBD1) that is located N-terminal to the previously defined apo-CaM-binding site (CBD2). Pull-down assays, surface plasmon resonance, isothermal calorimetry and NMR techniques were used to determine that CBD1 associated preferentially to Ca-CaM while CBD2 bound preferentially to apo-CaM. Mutation of hydrophobic residues abolished Ca-CaM-binding to CBD1 while acidic residues in CBD2 were necessary for apo-CaM-binding to CBD2. The dissociation constant (Kd) for Ca-CaM-binding to a CBD1 peptide was 26\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u2212\u00a06M while the value for binding to a longer protein construct was 0.5\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M. The binding of SMTNL1 to both apo-CaM and Ca-CaM suggests that endogenous CaM is continuously associated with SMTNL1 to allow for quick response to changes in intracellular calcium levels. We also found that the intrinsically disordered N-terminus of SMTNL1 can reduce binding to apo-CaM and increase binding to Ca-CaM. This finding suggests that an additional CaM-binding region may exist and/or that intramolecular interactions between the N-terminus and the folded C-terminus reduce apo-CaM-binding to CBD2.

SEVI enhances human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity by four to five orders of magnitude (M\u00fcnch et al., 2007). Here, we show by various biophysical techniques including Thioflavin T fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy that fragments encompassing the central region of SEVI, i.e. PAP248\u2013271 and PAP257\u2013267, form fibrils of similar morphology to SEVI. Our results show that the central region, residues PAP267\u2013271, is crucially important in promoting SEVI fibril formation. Furthermore, SEVI and fibrillar forms of these peptide fragments are toxic to neuronal pheochromocytoma 12 cells but not to epithelial colon carcinoma cells. These findings imply that although SEVI assists in the attachment of HIV-1 to immune cells, it may not facilitate HIV entry by damaging the epithelial cell layer that presents a barrier to the HIV.",

This protein and its predecessor, \u039498\u0394 (segment 29\u2013126 of IFABP), were initially uncovered by controlled proteolysis. Remarkably, although IFABP and \u039498\u0394 are monomers in solution, \u039478\u0394 adopts a stable dimeric structure. With the aim of identifying key structural features that modulate the aggregation of \u03b2-proteins, we evaluate here the structure and aggregation propensity of \u039478\u0394. The 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) induced aggregation of this protein shows a primary nucleation\u2013elongation mechanism, characterized by the stabilization of a dimeric nucleus. Its rate of production from the co-solvent induced aggregation prone state governs the kinetics of polymerization. In this context, the value of \u039478\u0394 lies in the fact that \u2013 being a stable dimeric species \u2013 it reduces an otherwise bimolecular reaction to a unimolecular one. Interestingly, even though \u039478\u0394 and IFABP display similar conformational stability, the abrogated form of IFABP shows an enhanced aggregation rate, revealing the ancillary role played on this process by the free energy of the native proteins. \u039478\u0394 share with IFABP and \u039498\u0394 a common putative aggregation-prone central peptide. Differences in the exposure/accessibility of this segment dictated by the environment around this region might underlie the observed variations in the speed of aggregation. Lessons learnt from this natural dimeric protein might shed light on the early conformational events leading to \u03b2-conversion from barrels to amyloid aggregates.",

To identify catalytic residues, we generated a homology model of IroB from aligned structures of two similar C-glycosyltransferases as templates. Superposition of our homology model onto the structure of a TDP-bound orthologue revealed residue W264 as a possible stabilizer of UDP-glucose. D304 in our model was located near the predicted site of the glucose moiety of UDP-glucose. A loop containing possible catalytic residues (H65, H66, E67) was found at the predicted enterobactin-binding site. We generated IroB variants at positions 65\u201367, 264, and 304 and investigated variant protein conformations and enzymatic activities. Variants were found to have Tm values similar to wild-type IroB. Fluorescence emission spectra of H65A/H66A, E67A, and D304N were superimposable with wild-type IroB. However, the emission spectrum of W264L was blue-shifted, suggesting solvent exposure of W264. While H65A/H66A retained activity (92% conversion of enterobactin, with MGE as a major product), all other IroB variants were impaired in their abilities to glucosylate enterobactin: E67A catalyzed partial (29%) conversion of enterobactin to MGE; W264L converted 55% of enterobactin to MGE; D304N was completely inactive. Activity-impaired variants were found to bind enterobactin with affinities within 2.5-fold of wild-type IroB. Given our outcomes, we propose that IroB W264 and D304 are required for binding and orienting UDP-glucose, while E67, possibly supported by H65/H66, participates in enterobactin/MGE/DGE deprotonation.",

Previously, we prepared a chimeric PZ in which its C-terminal pseudo-catalytic domain was grafted on FX light-chain (Gla and EGF-like domains) (PZ/FX-LC). Characterization of PZ/FX-LC revealed that the ZPI interactive-site is primarily located within PZ pseudo-catalytic domain. Nevertheless, the cofactor function and apparent Kd of PZ/FX-LC for interaction with ZPI remained impaired ~\u00a06\u20137-fold, suggesting that PZ contains a ZPI interactive-site outside pseudo-catalytic domain. X-ray structural data indicates that Tyr-240 of ZPI interacts with EGF2-domain of PZ. Structural data further suggests that 3 other ZPI surface loops make salt-bridge interactions with PZ pseudo-catalytic domain. To identify ZPI interactive-sites on PZ, we grafted the N-terminal EGF2 subdomain of PZ onto PZ/FX-LC chimera (PZ-EGF2/FX-LC) and also generated two compensatory charge reversal mutants of PZ pseudo-catalytic domain (Glu-244 and Arg-212) and ZPI surface loops (Lys-239 and Asp-293).PZ chimeras were expressed in mammalian cells and ZPI derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli.The PZ EGF2 subdomain fusion restored the defective cofactor function of PZ/FX-LC. The activities of PZ and ZPI mutants were all impaired if assayed individually, but partially restored if the compensatory charge reversal mutants were used in the assay.PZ EGF2 subdomain constitutes an interactive-site for ZPI. Data with compensatory charge reversal mutants validates structural data that the identified residues are part of interactive-sites.Insight is provided into mechanisms through which specificity of ZPI\u2013PZ\u2013FXa complex formation is determined.",

However, the protein shows a high tendency (48%) for an intrinsically disordered structure based on the PONDR VL-XT prediction from the primary sequence. To assess the possibility of marginally stabilized structure under physiological conditions, the N-terminal domain of p24 was destabilized by the addition of an artificial flexible tag to either N- or C-terminal ends, and it was analyzed using T1, T2, hetero-nuclear NOE, and amide-proton exchange experiments. When the C-terminal tag (12 residues) was attached, the regions of the \u03b13\u20134 loop and helix 6 as well as the \u03b14\u20135 loop attained the flexible structures. Furthermore, in the protein containing the N-terminal tag (27 residues), helix 4 in addition to the above-mentioned area including \u03b13\u20134 and \u03b14\u20135 loops as well as helix 6 exhibited highly disordered structures. Thus, the long-range effects of the existence of tag sequence was observed in the stepwise manner of the appearance of disordered structures (step 1: \u03b14\u20135 loop, step 2: \u03b13\u20134 loop and helix 6, and step 3: helix 4).

The N1 methylation of adenosine 1408 (m1A1408) confers resistance to structurally diverse aminoglycosides, including kanamycin, neomycin and apramycin. The limited analyses to date of the enzymes responsible have identified common features but also potential differences in their molecular details of action. Therefore, with the goal of expanding the known 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferase family as a platform for developing a more complete mechanistic understanding, we report here the cloning, expression and functional analyses of four hypothetical aminoglycoside-resistance rRNA methyltransferases from recent genome sequences of diverse bacterial species. Each of the genes produced a soluble, folded protein with a secondary structure, as determined from circular dichroism (CD) spectra, consistent with enzymes for which high-resolution structures are available. For each enzyme, antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays revealed a resistance spectrum characteristic of the known 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferases and the modified nucleotide was confirmed by reverse transcription as A1408. In common with other family members, higher binding affinity for the methylation reaction by-product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) than the cosubstrate S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) was observed for three methyltransferases, while one unexpectedly showed no measurable affinity for SAH. Collectively, these results confirm that each hypothetical enzyme is a functional 16S rRNA (m1A1408) methyltransferase but also point to further potential mechanistic variation within this enzyme family.",

In this study, we have examined the molecular features of the sensor domain of CusS in order to understand how a metal-responsive histidine kinase senses specific metal ions. We find that the predicted periplasmic sensor domain of CusS directly interacts with Ag(I) ions and undergoes a conformational change upon metal binding. Metal binding also enhances the tendency of the domain to dimerize.

The transformation of inactive apo-urease into active holo-urease requires the insertion of two Ni(II) ions in the substrate binding site, a process that involves the interaction of four accessory proteins named UreD, UreF, UreG and UreE. This study, carried out using calorimetric and NMR-based structural analysis, is focused on the interaction between UreE and UreG from Sporosarcina pasteurii, a highly ureolytic bacterium. Isothermal calorimetric protein\u2013protein titrations revealed the occurrence of a binding event between SpUreE and SpUreG, entailing two independent steps with positive cooperativity (Kd1\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09\u00a0\u03bcM; Kd2\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcM). This was interpreted as indicating the formation of the (UreE)2(UreG)2 hetero-oligomer upon binding of two UreG monomers onto the pre-formed UreE dimer. The molecular details of this interaction were elucidated using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The occurrence of SpUreE chemical shift perturbations upon addition of SpUreG was investigated and analyzed to establish the protein\u2013protein interaction site. The latter appears to involve the Ni(II) binding site as well as mobile portions on the C-terminal and the N-terminal domains. Docking calculations based on the information obtained from NMR provided a structural basis for the protein\u2013protein contact site. The high sequence and structural similarity within these protein classes suggests a generality of the interaction mode among homologous proteins.

The HLH domains of the Id and bHLH proteins allow both self- and hetero-association. Due to their abnormal expression in cancer cells, the Id proteins are potential protein targets for cancer treatment. Suitable Id-protein inactivators should promote self-association and/or prevent hetero-association. In this work we evaluated the ability of the Id-protein HLH domain to recognize itself in form of short sequences extracted from the helical and loop regions. We performed a peptide scan of the Id1 HLH domain 64-106 based on three-residue overlapping octapeptides. Interaction of each octapeptide with the natively folded Id1 HLH domain was investigated by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results from both techniques showed that the helix-based but not the loop-based octapeptides interacted with the Id1 HLH domain in the low-micromolar range. In contrast, a nitrotyrosine-containing analog of the Id1 HLH region, which was unable to reproduce the native-like conformation, quenched only the 2-amino-benzoyl-(Abz)-labeled loop-based octapeptides. This opposite self-recognition pattern suggests that the short helix-based and loop-based sequences should be able to distinguish different folding states of the Id1 HLH domain. This feature may be biologically relevant, as the Id proteins are predicted to behave as intrinsically disordered proteins, being in equilibrium between rapidly exchanging monomeric conformations and structurally better-defined homo-/heterodimers displaying the parallel four-helix bundle.",

Cantareus aspersus was the first snail where three paralogous MTs were isolated: the highly specific cadmium (CaCdMT) and copper (CaCuMT) isoforms, and an unspecific CaCd/CuMT isoform, so called because it was natively isolated as a mixed Cd and Cu complex.

The comparison with the orthologous HpMTs and the study of the isoform-determinant residues allow correlating the protein sequence variability with the coordination capabilities of these MTs. Surprisingly, the CaCuMT isoform exhibits a stronger Cu-thionein character than the HpCuMT ortholog, and the CaCd/CuMT isoform could be defined as a non-optimized Cu-thionein, which has not attained any defined functional differentiation in the framework of the snail MT gene/protein family.",

     "abstract": "The NADH-dependent polysulfide reductase (Npsr) from Shewanella loihica PV-4 is a member of the single cysteine-containing subset of the family of disulfide reductases represented by glutathione reductase. We have determined the kinetics of the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme with NADH using stopped-flow spectroscopy and kinetic isotope effects, and these results indicate that the reductive and oxidative half-reactions are both partially rate-limiting for enzyme turnover. During reaction with NADH, the reduced nucleotide appears to bind rapidly in an unproductive conformation, followed by the formation of a productive E\u00b7NADH complex and subsequent electron transfer to FAD. F161 of Npsr fills the space in which the nicotinamide ring of NADH would be expected to bind. We have shown that while this residue is not absolutely required for catalysis, it does assist in the forward commitment to catalysis through its role in the reductive half reaction, where it appears to enhance hydride transfer in the productive E\u00b7NADH complex. While the fluorescence and absorbance spectra of the stable redox forms of the wild-type and F161A mutant enzymes are similar, intermediates formed during reduction and turnover have different characteristics and appear to indicate that the enzyme\u2013NADH complex formed just prior to hydride transfer on the F161A enzyme has weaker FAD\u2013NADH interactions than the wild-type enzyme, consistent with a \u201clooser\u201d enzyme\u2013NADH complex. The 2.7\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of the F161A mutant was determined, and shows that the nicotinamide ring of NADH would have the expected freedom of motion in the more open NADH binding cavity.",

S100A13 is co-expressed with acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF1) and interleukin-1\u03b1 which are key angiogenesis inducers. The S100 proteins have been shown to be involved in several cellular functions such as calcium homeostasis, cell growth and differentiation dynamic of cytoskeleton. Its biological functions are mainly mediated through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) signaling. RAGE is involved in inflammatory processes and is associated with diabetic complications, tumor outgrowth, and neurodegenerative disorders. RAGE induces cellular signaling upon binding of different ligands, such as S100 proteins, glycated proteins, and HMGB1. RAGE signaling is complex, and it depends on the cell type and concentration of the ligand. Molecular level interactions of RAGE and S100 proteins are useful to understand the RAGE signaling diversity. In this report we focus on the molecular level interactions of S100A13 and RAGE C2 domain. The binding between RAGE C2 and S100A13 is moderately strong (Kd\u00a0~\u00a01.3\u00a0\u03bcM).

     "abstract": "Sulfur-containing amino acids such as cysteine and methionine are particularly vulnerable to oxidation. Oxidation of cysteine and methionine in their free amino acid form renders them unavailable for metabolic processes while their oxidation in the protein-bound state is a common post-translational modification in all organisms and usually alters the function of the protein. In the majority of cases, oxidation causes inactivation of proteins. Yet, an increasing number of examples have been described where reversible cysteine oxidation is part of a sophisticated mechanism to control protein function based on the redox state of the protein. While for methionine the dogma is still that its oxidation inhibits protein function, reversible methionine oxidation is now being recognized as a powerful means of triggering protein activity. This mode of regulation involves oxidation of methionine to methionine sulfoxide leading to activated protein function, and inactivation is accomplished by reduction of methionine sulfoxide back to methionine catalyzed by methionine sulfoxide reductases. Given the similarity to thiol-based redox-regulation of protein function, methionine oxidation is now established as a novel mode of redox-regulation of protein function.

     "abstract": "Oxidative protein folding is confined to few compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondrial intermembrane space and the bacterial periplasm. Conversely, in compartments in which proteins are translated such as the cytosol, the mitochondrial matrix and the chloroplast stroma proteins are kept reduced by the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems that functionally overlap. The highly reducing NADPH pool thereby serves as electron donor that enables glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase to keep glutathione pools and thioredoxins in their reduced redox state, respectively. Notably, also compartments containing oxidizing machineries are linked to these reducing pathways. Reducing pathways aid in proofreading of disulfide bond formation by isomerization or they provide reducing equivalents for the reduction of disulfides prior to degradation. In addition, they contribute to the thiol-dependent regulation of protein activities, and they help to counteract oxidative stress. The existence of oxidizing and reducing pathways in the same compartment poses a potential problem as the cell has to avoid futile cycles of oxidation and subsequent reduction reactions. Thus, compartments that contain oxidizing machineries have developed sophisticated ways to spatiotemporally balance and regulate oxidation and reduction.

     "abstract": "By catalyzing oxidative protein folding, the bacterial disulfide bond protein A (DsbA) plays an essential role in the assembly of many virulence factors. Predictably, DsbA disruption affects multiple downstream effector molecules, resulting in pleiotropic effects on the virulence of important human pathogens. These findings mark DsbA as a master regulator of virulence, and identify the enzyme as a target for a new class of antivirulence agents that disarm pathogenic bacteria rather than killing them. The purpose of this article is to discuss and expand upon recent findings on DsbA and to provide additional novel insights into the druggability of this important disulfide oxidoreductase by comparing the structures and properties of 13 well-characterized DsbA enzymes. Our structural analysis involved comparison of the overall fold, the surface properties, the conformations of three loops contributing to the binding surface and the sequence identity of residues contributing to these loops. Two distinct structural classes were identified, classes I and II, which are differentiated by their central \u03b2-sheet arrangements and which roughly separate the DsbAs produced by Gram-negative from Gram-positive organisms. The classes can be further subdivided into a total of four subclasses on the basis of surface features. Class Ia is equivalent to the Enterobacteriaceae class that has been defined previously. Bioinformatic analyses support the classification of DsbAs into 3 of the 4 subclasses, but did not pick up the 4th subclass which is only apparent from analysis of DsbA electrostatic surface properties. In the context of inhibitor development, the discrete structural subclasses provide a platform for developing DsbA inhibitory scaffolds with a subclass-wide spectrum of activity. We expect that more DsbA classes are likely to be identified, as enzymes from other pathogens are explored, and we highlight the issues associated with structure-based inhibitor development targeting this pivotal mediator of bacterial virulence.

Gold(I) complexes bearing phosphole ligands are promising agents in the treatment of cancer and disturb the redox balance and proliferation of cancer cells by inhibiting disulfide reductases. Here, we report on the antitumor properties of the gold(I) complex 1-phenyl-bis(2-pyridyl)phosphole gold chloride thio-\u03b2-d-glucose tetraacetate (GoPI-sugar), which exhibits antiproliferative effects on human (NCH82, NCH89) and rat (C6) glioma cell lines. Compared to carmustine (BCNU), an established nitrosourea compound for the treatment of glioblastomas that inhibits the proliferation of these glioma cell lines with an IC50 of 430\u00a0\u03bcM, GoPI-sugar is more effective by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, GoPI-sugar inhibits malignant glioma growth in vivo in a C6 glioma rat model and significantly reduces tumor volume while being well tolerated. Both the gold(I) chloro- and thiosugar-substituted phospholes interact with DNA albeit more weakly for the latter. Furthermore, GoPI-sugar irreversibly and potently inhibits thioredoxin reductase (IC50 4.3\u00a0nM) and human glutathione reductase (IC50 88.5\u00a0nM). However, treatment with GoPI-sugar did not significantly alter redox parameters in the brain tissue of treated animals. This might be due to compensatory upregulation of redox-related enzymes but might also indicate that the antiproliferative effects of GoPI-sugar in vivo are rather based on DNA interaction and inhibition of topoisomerase I than on the disturbance of redox equilibrium. Since GoPI-sugar is highly effective against glioblastomas and well tolerated, it represents a most promising lead for drug development.

Thus iLBPs mediate the lipid transport within the cell and participate to a spectrum of tissue-specific pathways involved in lipid homeostasis. Structural studies have shown that iLBPs' binding sites are inaccessible from the bulk, implying that substrate binding should involve a conformational change able to produce a ligand entry portal. Many studies have been reported in the last two decades on iLBPs indicating that their dynamics play a pivotal role in regulating ligand binding and targeted release. The ensemble of reported data has not been reviewed until today. This review is thus intended to summarize and possibly generalize the results up to now described, providing a picture which could help to identify the missing notions necessary to improve our understanding of the role of dynamics in iLBPs' molecular recognition.

Here, a systemic study was performed to investigate His249 or/and His253 on self-assembly, cell attachment and immunogenicity of SVP. Point-mutagenesis of either or both histidine residues to alanine did not affect self-assembly of the SVP, but the SVP lost its Ni-NTA binding affinity when the His253 was mutated. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and inhibitory experiments also showed that His253 is essential for SVP to attach onto the DF-1 cells and to inhibit IBDV infection of DF-1 cells. Finally, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and chicken protection assays demonstrated that SVP with a mutation of His253 to alanine induced comparable neutralizing antibody titers in chickens as the wild-type SVP did. It was concluded that VP2's His253, a site not significant for the overall immunogenicity induced by SVP, is crucial for the binding affinity of SVP to Ni-NTA and the attachment of an IBDV host cell line.

     "abstract": "Because of the complex mechanisms of enzymatic reactions, no precise and simple method of understanding and controlling the chiral selectivity of enzymes has been developed. However, structure-based rational design is a powerful approach to engineering enzymes with desired catalytic activities. In this work, a simple, structure-based, large-scale in silico design and virtual screening strategy was developed and successfully applied to enzyme engineering. We first performed protein crystallization and X-ray diffraction to determine the structure of lipase LipK107, which is a novel family I.1 lipase displaying activity for both R and S isomers in chiral resolution reactions. The catalytic mechanism of family I.1, which includes LipK107, was ascertained first through comparisons of the sequences and structures of lipases from other families. The binding states of LipK107, including the energy and the conformation of complexes with the R and S enantiomers, have been evaluated by careful biocomputation to figure out the reason for the higher S selectivity. Based on this study, a simple strategy for manipulating the chiral selectivity by modulating a crucial distance in the enzyme\u2013substrate complex and judging virtual mutations in silico is recommended. Then, a novel electrostatic interaction analysis protocol was used to design LipK107 mutants to validate our strategy. Both positive and negative mutations determined using this theoretical protocol have been implemented in wet experiments and were proved to produce the desired enantioselectivity, showing a 176% increase or 50% decrease in enantioselectivity as desired. Because of its accuracy and versatility, the strategy is promising for practical applications.",

     "abstract": "Cell division protein FtsZ cooperatively self-assembles into straight filaments when bound to GTP. A set of conformational changes that are linked to FtsZ GTPase activity are involved in the transition from straight to curved filaments that eventually disassemble. In this work, we characterized the fluorescence of single Trp mutants as a reporter of the predicted conformational changes between the GDP- and GTP-states of Escherichia coli FtsZ. Steady-state fluorescence characterization showed the Trp senses different environments and displays low solvent accessibility. Time-resolved fluorescence data indicated that the main conformational changes in FtsZ occur at the interaction surface between the N and C domains, but also minor rearrangements were detected in the bulk of the N domain. Surprisingly, despite its location near the bottom protofilament interface at the C domain, the Trp 275 fluorescence lifetime did not report changes between the GDP and GTP states. The equilibrium unfolding of FtsZ features an intermediate that is stabilized by the nucleotide bound in the N-domain as well as by quaternary protein\u2013protein interactions. In this context, we characterized the unfolding of the Trp mutants using time-resolved fluorescence and phasor plot analysis. A novel picture of the structural transition from the native state in the absence of denaturant, to the solvent-exposed unfolded state is presented. Taken together our results show that conformational changes between the GDP and GTP states of FtsZ, such as those observed in FtsZ unfolding, are restricted to the interaction surface between the N and C domains.",

     "abstract": "As a potential hemoglobin (Hb)-based oxygen carrier (HBOC), the PEGylated Hb has received much attention for its non-nephrotoxicity. However, PEGylation can adversely alter the structural and functional properties of Hb. The site of PEGylation is an important factor to determine the structure and function of the PEGylated Hb. Thus, protection of some sensitive residues of Hb from PEGylation is of great significance to develop the PEGylated Hb as HBOC. Here, Cys-93(\u03b2) of Hb was conjugated with 20\u00a0kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG20K) through hydrazone and disulfide bonds. Then, the conjugate was modified with PEG5K succinimidyl carbonate (PEG5K-SC) using acylation chemistry, followed by removal of PEG20K Hb with hydrazone hydrolysis and disulfide reduction. Reversible conjugation of PEG20K at Cys-93(\u03b2) can protect Lys-95(\u03b2), Val-1(\u03b1) and Lys-16(\u03b1) of Hb from PEGylation with PEG5K-SC. The autoxidation rate, oxygen affinity, structural perturbation and tetramer instability of the PEGylated Hb were significantly decreased upon protection with PEG20K. The present study is expected to improve the efficacy of the PEGylated Hb as an oxygen therapeutic.",

Class II asparaginase from Escherichia coli (EcA), a homotetramer with a mass of 138\u00a0kDa, is especially effective in cancer therapy. However, the therapeutic potential of EcA is impaired by the limited stability of the enzyme in vivo and by the induction of antibodies in the patients. In an attempt to modify the properties of EcA, several variants with amino acid replacements at subunit interfaces were constructed and characterized. Chemical and thermal denaturation analysis monitored by activity, fluorescence, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry showed that certain variants with exchanges that weaken dimer\u2013dimer interactions exhibited complex denaturation profiles with active dimeric and/or inactive monomeric intermediates appearing at low denaturant concentrations. By contrast, other EcA variants showed considerably enhanced activity and stability as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Thus, even small changes at a subunit interface may markedly affect EcA stability without impairing its catalytic properties. Variants of this type may have a potential for use in the asparaginase therapy of leukemia.",

     "abstract": "Hydrophobins are small surface active proteins secreted by filamentous fungi. Because of their ability to self-assemble at hydrophilic\u2013hydrophobic interfaces, hydrophobins play a key role in fungal growth and development. In the present work, the organization in aqueous solution of SC3 hydrophobins from the fungus Schizophyllum commune was assessed using Dynamic Light Scattering, Atomic Force Microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. These complementary approaches have demonstrated that SC3 hydrophobins are able not only to spontaneously self-assemble at the air\u2013water interface but also in pure water. AFM experiments evidenced that hydrophobins self-assemble in solution into nanorods. Fluorescence assays with thioflavin T allowed establishing that the mechanism governing SC3 hydrophobin self-assembly into nanorods involves \u03b2-sheet stacking. SC3 assembly was shown to be strongly influenced by ionic strength and solution pH. The presence of a very low ionic strength significantly favoured the protein self-assembly but a further increase of ions in solution disrupted the protein assembly. It was assessed that solution pH had a significant effect on the SC3 hydrophobins organization. In peculiar, the self-assembly process was considerably reduced at acidic pH. Our findings demonstrate that the self-assembly of SC3 hydrophobins into nanorods of well-defined length can be directly controlled in solution. Such control allows opening the way for the development of new smart self-assembled structures for targeted applications.",

     "abstract": "An alternative route for haem b biosynthesis is operative in sulfate-reducing bacteria of the Desulfovibrio genus and in methanogenic Archaea. This pathway diverges from the canonical one at the level of uroporphyrinogen III and progresses via a distinct branch, where sirohaem acts as an intermediate precursor being converted into haem b by a set of novel enzymes, named the alternative haem biosynthetic proteins (Ahb). In this work, we report the biochemical characterisation of the Desulfovibrio vulgaris AhbD enzyme that catalyses the last step of the pathway. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that AhbD promotes the cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and converts iron-coproporphyrin III via two oxidative decarboxylations to yield haem b, methionine and the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that AhbD contains two [4Fe\u20134S]2\u00a0+/1\u00a0+ centres and that binding of the substrates S-adenosylmethionine and iron-coproporphyrin III induces conformational modifications in both centres. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that D. vulgaris AhbD belongs to the radical SAM protein superfamily, with a GGE-like motif and two cysteine-rich sequences typical for ligation of SAM molecules and iron-sulfur clusters, respectively. A structural model of D. vulgaris AhbD with putative binding pockets for the iron-sulfur centres and the substrates SAM and iron-coproporphyrin III is discussed.",

This membrane bound protease possesses the unique catalytic activity of hydrolysis of the post-proline bond two or more residues from the N-terminus of substrates. FAP is highly expressed in activated fibroblastic cells in tumours, arthritis and fibrosis. A rare, novel, human polymorphism, C1088T, encoding Ser363 to Leu, occurring in the sixth blade of the \u03b2 propeller domain, was identified in a family. Both in primary human fibroblasts and in Ser363LeuFAP transfected cells, we showed that this single substitution ablates FAP dimerisation and causes loss of enzyme activity. Ser363LeuFAP was detectable only in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in contrast to the distribution of wild-type FAP on the cell surface. The variant FAP showed decreased conformational antibody binding, consistent with an altered tertiary structure. Ser363LeuFAP expression was associated with upregulation of the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78, ER stress sensor ATF6, and the ER stress response target phospho-eIF2\u03b1, all indicators of ER stress. Proteasomal inhibition resulted in accumulation of Ser363LeuFAP, indicating the involvement of ER associated degradation (ERAD). Neither CHOP expression nor apoptosis was elevated, so ERAD is probably important for protecting Ser363LeuFAP expressing cells. These data on the first loss of function human FAP gene variant indicates that although the protein is vulnerable to an amino acid substitution in the \u03b2-propeller domain, inactive, unfolded FAP can be tolerated by cells.",

All the data obtained with TcoCBc1 were compared with those of human cathepsin B, including the pH profiles of the hydrolytic reactions. The most relevant observation is the preference of TcoCBc1 for substrates with a pair of acidic amino acids at positions P2 and P1 for its carboxydipeptidase activity and the well acceptance for E and D at P1 position for endopeptidase activity. These peculiar preferences for negatively charged groups of TcoCBc1 and its requirements for carboxydipeptidase activity were also observed on Abz labeled analogues of bradykinin (Abz-RPPG\u2193FSAFR-OH, Abz-RPPG\u2193FS\u2193AF-OH, Abz-RPPG\u2193DE\u2193AF-OH) and angiotensin I (Abz-DR\u2193VYIHAFHL-OH), where \u2193 indicates the cleavage site.

     "abstract": "Recent investigations have highlighted a key role of the proteins of the KCTD (K-potassium channel tetramerization domain containing proteins) family in several fundamental biological processes. Despite the growing importance of KCTDs, our current understanding of their biophysical and structural properties is very limited. Biochemical characterizations of these proteins have shown that most of them act as substrate adaptor in E3 ligases during protein ubiquitination. Here we present a characterization of the KCTD5-Cullin3 interactions which are mediated by the KCTD5 BTB domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments reveal that KCTD5 avidly binds the Cullin3 (Cul3). The complex presents a 5:5 stoichiometry and a dissociation constant of 59\u00a0nM. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations clearly indicate that the two proteins form a stable (KCTD5\u2013Cul3)5 pinwheel-shaped heterodecamer in which two distinct KCTD5 subunits cooperate in the binding of each cullin chain. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that different types of interactions contribute to the stability of the assembly. Interestingly, residues involved in Cul3 recognitions are conserved in the KCTD5 orthologs and paralogs implicated in important biological processes. These residues are also rather well preserved in most of the other KCTD proteins. By using molecular modeling techniques, the entire ubiquitination system including the E3 ligase, the E2 conjugating enzyme and ubiquitin was generated. The analysis of the molecular architecture of this complex machinery provides insights into the ubiquitination processes which involve E3 ligases with a high structural complexity.",

After purification from inclusion bodies produced in Escherichia coli, the recombinant EhCP-B9 precursor (ppEhCP-B9) can be refolded using detergents as artificial chaperones. However, the conformational changes that occur during ppEhCP-B9 refolding remain unknown. Here, we comprehensively describe conformational changes of ppEhCP-B9 that are induced by various chemical detergents acting as chaperones, including non-ionic, zwitterionic, cationic and anionic surfactants. We monitored the effect of detergent concentration and incubation time on the secondary and tertiary structures of ppEhCP-B9 using fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. In the presence of non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents, ppEhCP-B9 adopted a \u03b2-enriched structure (ppEhCP-B9\u03b21) without proteolytic activity at all detergent concentrations and incubation times evaluated. ppEhCP-B9 also exhibits a \u03b2-rich structure in low concentrations of ionic detergents, but at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the protein acquires an \u03b1\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b2 structure, similar to that of papain but without proteolytic activity (ppEhCP-B9\u03b1\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b21).

     "abstract": "Bovine CD38/NAD+ glycohydrolase catalyzes the hydrolysis of NAD+ to nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and the formation of cyclic ADP-ribose via a stepwise reaction mechanism. Our recent crystallographic study of its Michaelis complex and covalently-trapped intermediates provided insights into the modalities of substrate binding and the molecular mechanism of bCD38. The aim of the present work was to determine the precise role of key conserved active site residues (Trp118, Glu138, Asp147, Trp181 and Glu218) by focusing mainly on the cleavage of the nicotinamide\u2013ribosyl bond. We analyzed the kinetic parameters of mutants of these residues which reside within the bCD38 subdomain in the vicinity of the scissile bond of bound NAD+. To address the reaction mechanism we also performed chemical rescue experiments with neutral (methanol) and ionic (azide, formate) nucleophiles. The crucial role of Glu218, which orients the substrate for cleavage by interacting with the N-ribosyl 2\u2032-OH group of NAD+, was highlighted. This contribution to catalysis accounts for almost half of the reaction energy barrier. Other contributions can be ascribed notably to Glu138 and Asp147 via ground-state destabilization and desolvation in the vicinity of the scissile bond. Key interactions with Trp118 and Trp181 were also proven to stabilize the ribooxocarbenium ion-like transition state. Altogether we propose that, as an alternative to a covalent acylal reaction intermediate with Glu218, catalysis by bCD38 proceeds through the formation of a discrete and transient ribooxocarbenium intermediate which is stabilized within the active site mostly by electrostatic interactions.",

     "abstract": "Background: The crystallographic structure of the gigantic hemoglobin (erythrocruorin) of the annelid worm, Lumbricus terrestris, provides a molar mass of 3.6\u00a0MDa for the hexagonal bilayer structure. Prior to this determination, some light-scattering and ultracentrifugal measurements indicated higher masses: 4.1\u20134.4\u00a0MDa. Values of 3.6\u00a0MDa were attributed to dissociation or subunit loss. However, early electron microscopy of the giant hemoglobin from a related annelid, Eumenia crassa by \u00d6ster Levin, showed that the hexagonal bilayer molecules were present mostly as oligomers; few were monomeric. Methods: Measurements by light-scattering of solutions of Lumbricus hemoglobin resolved by size-exclusion chromatography have been used to determine the weight-average molar mass of self-associating proteins. The X-ray structure has been re-examined. Results: Our measurements show that both 3.6\u00a0MDa monomers and self-association products are present as a mixture. Analysis of the X-ray structure indicates several different kinds of monomer\u2013monomer interactions. Conclusions: We propose that the measured masses of Lumbricus hemoglobin as high as 4.4\u00a0MDa, result from oligomerization. These masses would result from the presence of an array of oligomers of various sizes together with monomers of 3.6\u00a0MDa. Furthermore, several different kinds of monomer\u2013monomer interactions are clearly evident in the X-ray structure as well as in solution. General significance: The results demonstrate that self-association of monomers of the hemoglobin of Lumbricus terrestris explains the high molar masses of 4.1\u20134.4\u00a0MDa previously observed.",

In Arabidopsis thaliana, THI1 protein has been associated with the synthesis of the thiazole ring, a finding supported by the identification of a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-like compound in its structure. Here, we investigated THI1 and its mutant THI1(A140V), responsible for the thiamin auxotrophy in a A. thaliana mutant line, aiming to clarify the impact of this mutation in the stability and activity of THI1. Recently, the THI1 orthologue (THI4) was revealed to be responsible for the donation of the sulfur atom from a cysteine residue to the thiazole ring in the thiamine intermediate. In this context, we carried out a cysteine quantification in THI1 and THI1(A140V) using electron spin resonance (ESR). These data showed that THI1(A140V) contains more sulfur-containing cysteines than THI1, indicating that the function as a sulfur donor is conserved, but the rate of donation reaction is somehow affected. Also, the bound compounds were isolated from both proteins and are present in different amounts in each protein. Unfolding studies presented differences in melting temperatures and also in the concentration of guanidine at which half of the protein unfolds, thus showing that THI1(A140V) has its conformational stability affected by the mutation. Hence, despite keeping its function in the early steps during the synthesis of TPP precursor, our studies have shown a decrease in the THI1(A140V) stability, which might be slowing down the biological activity of the mutant, and thus contributing to thiamin auxotrophy.",

Here, the structural role in the intrinsic stability of the Pro-rich sequence toward toxin activity was investigated. Three Val-substituted mutants (P193V, P194V and P196V) and one Phe-substituted mutant (P193F) were generated and over-expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusions at levels equal to the wild-type. Bioassays demonstrated that all mutants, particularly P193V and P193F whose inclusions were hardly soluble in carbonate buffer (pH\u00a09.0), exhibited reduced toxicity, suggesting an essential role in toxin function by the specific cyclic structure of individual Pro residues. Analysis of the 65-kDa Cry4Aa structure from 10-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop is substantially stable as it showed low structural fluctuation with a 1.2-\u00c5 RMSF value. When the flexibility of the \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop was increased through P193G, P194G and P196G substitutions, decreased toxicity was also observed for all mutants, mostly for the P193G mutant with low alkali-solubility, suggesting a functional importance of loop-rigidity attributed by individual Pro-cyclic side-chains, particularly Pro193. Further MD simulations revealed that the most critical residue\u2212Pro193 for which mutations vastly affect toxin solubility and larval toxicity is in close contact with several surrounding residues, thus playing an additional role in the structural arrangement of the Cry4Aa toxin molecule. Altogether, our data signify that the intrinsic stability of the unique Cry4Aa \u03b14\u2013\u03b15 loop structure comprising the Pro-rich sequence plays an important role in toxin activity.",

     "abstract": "The aldehyde inhibitor Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO has been synthesized and shown by 13C-NMR to react with the active site serine hydroxyl group of alpha-chymotrypsin to form two diastereomeric hemiacetals. For both hemiacetals oxyanion formation occurs with a pKa value of ~\u00a07 showing that chymotrypsin reduces the oxyanion pKa values by ~\u00a05.6 pKa units and stabilizes the oxyanions of both diastereoisomers by ~\u00a032\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01. As pH has only a small effect on binding we conclude that oxyanion formation does not have a significant effect on binding the aldehyde inhibitor. By comparing the binding of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO with that of Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-H we estimate that the aldehyde group increases binding ~\u00a0100 fold. At pH\u00a07.2 the effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxy group is ~\u00a06000 which is ~\u00a07\u00a0\u00d7 less effective than with the corresponding glyoxal inhibitor. Using 1H-NMR we have shown that at both 4 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C the histidine pKa is ~\u00a07.3 in free chymotrypsin and it is raised to ~\u00a08 when Z-Ala-Ala-Phe-CHO is bound. We conclude that oxyanion formation only has a minor role in raising the histidine pKa and that the aldehyde hydrogen must be replaced by a larger group to raise the histidine pKa\u00a0>\u00a010 and give stereospecific formation of tetrahedral intermediates. The results show that a large increase in the pKa of the active site histidine is not needed for the active site serine hydroxyl group to have an effective molarity of 6000.",

     "abstract": "Lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) plays a major role in the vertebrate visual cycle. Indeed, it is responsible for the esterification of all-trans retinol into all-trans retinyl esters, which can then be stored in microsomes or further metabolized to produce the chromophore of rhodopsin. In the present study, a detailed characterization of the enzymatic properties of truncated LRAT (tLRAT) has been achieved using in vitro assay conditions. A much larger tLRAT activity has been obtained compared to previous reports and to an enzyme with a similar activity. In addition, tLRAT is able to hydrolyze phospholipids bearing different chain lengths with a preference for micellar aggregated substrates. It therefore presents an interfacial activation property, which is typical of classical phospholipases. Furthermore, given that stability is a very important quality of an enzyme, the influence of different parameters on the activity and stability of tLRAT has thus been studied in detail. For example, storage buffer has a strong effect on tLRAT activity and high enzyme stability has been observed at room temperature. The thermostability of tLRAT has also been investigated using circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopy. A decrease in the activity of tLRAT was observed beyond 70\u00a0\u00b0C, accompanied by a modification of its secondary structure, i.e. a decrease of its \u03b1-helical content and the appearance of unordered structures and aggregated \u03b2-sheets. Nevertheless, residual activity could still be observed after heating tLRAT up to 100\u00a0\u00b0C. The results of this study highly improved our understanding of this enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Hydrophobins are small surface active proteins that fulfil a wide spectrum of functions in fungal growth and development. The human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus expresses RodA hydrophobins that self-assemble on the outer conidial surface into tightly organized nanorods known as rodlets. AFM investigation of the conidial surface allows us to evidence that RodA hydrophobins self-assemble into rodlets through bilayers. Within bilayers, hydrophilic domains of hydrophobins point inward, thus making a hydrophilic core, while hydrophobic domains point outward. AFM measurements reveal that several rodlet bilayers are present on the conidial surface thus showing that proteins self-assemble into a complex three-dimensional multilayer system. The self-assembly of RodA hydrophobins into rodlets results from attractive interactions between stacked \u03b2-sheets, which conduct to a final linear cross-\u03b2 spine structure. A Monte Carlo simulation shows that anisotropic interactions are the main driving forces leading the hydrophobins to self-assemble into parallel rodlets, which are further structured in nanodomains. Taken together, these findings allow us to propose a mechanism, which conducts RodA hydrophobins to a highly ordered rodlet structure. The mechanism of hydrophobin assembly into rodlets offers new prospects for the development of more efficient strategies leading to disruption of rodlet formation allowing a rapid detection of the fungus by the immune system.",

     "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are proteins of great interest not only because of their extreme toxicity but also paradoxically for their therapeutic applications. All the known serotypes (A-G) have varying degrees of longevity and potency inside the neuronal cell. Differential chemical modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination have been suggested as possible mechanisms for their longevity, but the molecular basis of the longevity remains unclear. Since the endopeptidase domain (light chain; LC) of toxin apparently survives inside the neuronal cells for months, it is important to examine the structural features of this domain to understand its resistance to intracellular degradation. Published crystal structures (both botulinum neurotoxins and endopeptidase domain) have not provided adequate explanation for the intracellular longevity of the domain. Structural features obtained from spectroscopic analysis of LCA and LCB were similar, and a PRIME (PReImminent Molten Globule Enzyme) conformation appears to be responsible for their optimal enzymatic activity at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. LCE, on the other hand, was although optimally active at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, but its active conformation differed from the PRIME conformation of LCA and LCB. This study establishes and confirms our earlier finding that an optimally active conformation of these proteins in the form of PRIME exists for the most poisonous poison, botulinum neurotoxin. There are substantial variations in the structural and functional characteristics of these active molten globule related structures among the three BoNT endopeptidases examined. These differential conformations of LCs are important in understanding the fundamental structural features of proteins, and their possible connection to intracellular longevity could provide significant clues for devising new countermeasures and effective therapeutics.",

     "abstract": "The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of dengue, one of the most devastating arthropod-borne viral infections in humans. The isoform specific A/B region, called the N-terminal domain (NTD), is hypervariable in sequence and length and is poorly conserved within the Ultraspiracle (Usp) family. The Usp protein together with ecdysteroid receptor (EcR) forms a heterodimeric complex. Up until now, there has been little data on the molecular properties of the isolated Usp-NTD. Here, we describe the biochemical and biophysical properties of the recombinant NTD of the Usp isoform B (aaUsp-NTD) from A. aegypti. These results, in combination with in silico bioinformatics approaches, indicate that aaUsp-NTD exhibits properties of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP). We also present the first experimental evidence describing the dimerization propensity of the isolated NTD of Usp. These characteristics also appear for other members of the Usp family in different species, for example, in the Usp-NTD from Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori. However, aaUsp-NTD exhibits the strongest homodimerization potential. We postulate that the unique dimerization of the NTD might be important for Usp function by providing an additional platform for interactions, in addition to the nuclear receptor superfamily dimerization via DNA binding domains and ligand binding domains that has already been extensively documented. Furthermore, the unique NTD\u2013NTD interaction that was observed might contribute new insight into the dimerization propensities of nuclear receptors.",

     "abstract": "A biomarker is a crucial tool for measuring the progress of disease and the effects of treatment for better clinical outcomes in cancer patients. Diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic biomarkers are required in various clinical settings. The proteome, a functional translation of the genome, is considered a rich source of biomarkers; therefore, sizable time and funding have been spent in proteomics to develop biomarkers. Although significant progress has been made in technologies toward comprehensive protein expression profiling, and many biomarker candidates published, none of the reported biomarkers have proven to be beneficial for cancer patients. The present deceleration in biomarker research can be attributed to technical limitations. Additional efforts are required to further technical progress; however, there are many examples demonstrating that problems in biomarker research are not so much with the technology but in the study design. In the study of biomarkers for early diagnosis, candidates are screened and validated by comparing cases and controls of similar sample size, and the low prevalence of disease is often ignored. Although it is reasonable to take advantage of multiple rather than single biomarkers when studying diverse disease mechanisms, the annotation of individual components of reported multiple biomarkers does not often explain the variety of molecular events underlying the clinical observations. In tissue biomarker studies, the heterogeneity of disease tissues and pathological observations are often not considered, and tissues are homogenized as a whole for protein extraction. In addition to the challenge of technical limitations, the fundamental aspects of biomarker development in a disease study need to be addressed.

A plethora of biomarkers have been claimed as useful for the early detection of cancer. However, disappointingly few biomarkers were approved for the detection of unrecognized disease, and even approved markers may lack a sound validation phase. Prospective studies aimed at the early detection of cancer are costly and long-lasting and therefore the bottleneck in marker research. They enroll a large number of clinically asymptomatic subjects and follow-up on incident cases. As invasive procedures cannot be applied to collect tissue samples from the target organ, biomarkers can only be determined in easily accessible body fluids. Marker levels increase during cancer development, with samples collected closer to the occurrence of symptoms or a clinical diagnosis being more informative than earlier samples. Only prospective designs allow the serial collection of pre-diagnostic samples. Their storage in a biobank upgrades cohort studies to serve for both, marker discovery and validation. Population-based cohort studies, which may collect a wealth of data, are commonly conducted with just one baseline investigation lacking serial samples. However, they can provide valuable information about factors that influence the marker level. Screening programs can be employed to archive serial samples but require significant efforts to collect samples and auxiliary data for marker research. Randomized controlled trials have the highest level of evidence in assessing a biomarker's benefit against usual care and present the most stringent design for the validation of promising markers as well as for the discovery of new markers. In summary, all kinds of prospective studies can benefit from a biobank as they can serve as a platform for biomarker research.

In addition, application of proteomic biomarkers in clinical diagnostics and practical improvement in the disease management is extremely rare. In this review, we discuss the relevant issues associated with identification of robust biomarkers of clinical value. Urine appears to be an ideal source of biomarkers, for theoretical, methodological, and practical reasons. Therefore, this review is focused on the search for biomarkers in urine within the last decade. Urine can be used for non-invasive assessment of a variety of diseases including those affecting the urogenital tract and also other pathologies such as cardiovascular disease or appendicitis. We also discuss the importance of data validation, an essential step in translating biomarkers into the clinical practice. Furthermore, we examine several examples of apparently successful proteomic biomarker discovery studies and their implications for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy evaluation. We also discuss some current challenges in this field and reflect on future research prospects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biomarkers: A Proteomic Challenge.",

     "abstract": "Majority of deaths due to communicable and non-communicable diseases occur in the low and middle-income nations (LMNs), mainly due to the lack of early diagnoses and timely treatments. In such a scenario, biomarkers serve as an indispensible resource that can be used as indicators of biological processes, specific disease conditions or response to therapeutic interventions. Evaluation, diagnosis and management of diseases in developing world by following/extrapolating the findings obtained on the basis of the research work involving only the populations from the developed countries, could often be highly misleading due to existence of diverse patterns of diseases in developing countries compared to the developed world. Biomarker candidates identified from high-throughput integrated omics technologies have promising potential; however, their actual clinical applications are found to be limited, primarily due to the challenges of disease heterogeneity and pre-analytical variability associated with the biomarker discovery pipeline. Additionally, in the developing world, economic crunches, lack of awareness and education, paucity of biorepositories, enormous diversities in socio-epidemiological background, ethnicity, lifestyle, diet, exposure to various environmental risk factors and infectious agents, and ethical and social issues also cumulatively hinder biomarker discovery ventures. Establishment of standard operating procedures, comprehensive data repositories and exchange of scientific findings are crucial for reducing the variability and fragmentation of data.

     "abstract": "An impressive, but often short objective response was obtained in many tumor patients treated with different targeted therapies, but most of the patients develop resistances against these drugs. So far, a number of distinct mechanisms leading to intrinsic as well as acquired resistances have been identified in tumors of distinct origin. These can arise from genetic alterations, like mutations, truncations, and amplifications or due to deregulated expression of various proteins and signal transduction pathways, but also from cellular heterogeneity within tumors after an initial response. Therefore, biomarkers are urgently needed for cancer prognosis and personalized cancer medicine. The application of \u201come\u201d-based technologies including cancer (epi)genomics, next generation sequencing, cDNA microarrays and proteomics might led to the predictive or prognostic stratification of patients to categorize resistance mechanisms and to postulate combinations of treatment strategies. This review discusses the implementation of proteome-based analysis to identify markers of pathway (in)activation in tumors and the resistance mechanisms, which represent major clinical problems as a tool to optimize individually tailored therapies based on targeted drugs.

Described herein is a method that extends the multiplexing ability of the MRM method to enable the quantitation 142 high-to-moderate abundance proteins (from 31\u00a0mg/mL to 44\u00a0ng/mL) in undepleted and non-enriched human plasma in a single run. The proteins have been reported to be associated to a wide variety of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), from cardiovascular disease (CVD) to diabetes. The concentrations of these proteins in human plasma are inferred from interference-free peptides functioning as molecular surrogates (2 peptides per protein, on average). A revised data analysis strategy, involving the linear regression equation of normal control plasma, has been instituted to enable the facile application to patient samples, as demonstrated in separate nutrigenomics and CVD studies. The exceptional robustness of the LC/MS platform and the quantitative method, as well as its high throughput, makes the assay suitable for application to patient samples for the verification of a condensed or complete protein panel.

Despite a large number of plausible candidate protein biomarkers published annually, the translation to clinical use is impeded by factors such as the required size of the initial studies, and limitations of the technologies used. The proximity ligation assay (PLA) is a versatile molecular tool that has the potential to address some obstacles, both in validation of biomarkers previously discovered using other techniques, and for future routine clinical diagnostic needs. The enhanced specificity of PLA extends the opportunities for large-scale, high-performance analyses of proteins. Besides advantages in the form of minimal sample consumption and an extended dynamic range, the PLA technique allows flexible assay reconfiguration. The technology can be adapted for detecting protein complexes, proximity between proteins in extracellular vesicles or in circulating tumor cells, and to address multiple post-translational modifications in the same protein molecule. We discuss herein requirements for biomarker validation, and how PLA may play an increasing role in this regard.

Additional information on NSCLC cell lines such as that of transcriptomic data, genomic aberrations, and drug sensitivity was analyzed in the context of proteomic data using supervised and non-supervised approaches for data analysis. First, the unsupervised analysis of proteomic data indicated that proteins clustering closely together reflect well-known signaling modules, e.g. PI3K/AKT- and RAS/RAF/ERK-signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, RAF, RAS, TP53, and PI3K were found dispersed across different signaling pathway clusters. Merely cell lines with an amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2 clustered closely together on the proteomic, but not on the transcriptomic level. Secondly, supervised data analysis revealed that sensitivity towards anti-EGFR drugs generally correlated better with high level EGFR phosphorylation than with EGFR abundance itself. High level phosphorylation of RB and high abundance of AURKA were identified as candidates that can potentially predict sensitivity towards the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680. Examples shown demonstrate that the RPPA approach presents a useful platform for targeted proteomics with high potential for biomarker discovery.

Here, we present the results of a study aiming for a comprehensive comparison of ion-intensity based label-free proteomics and two label-based approaches using isobaric tags incorporated at the peptide and protein levels, respectively. As model system for our quantitative analysis we used the three hepatoma cell lines HepG2, Hep3B and SK-Hep-1. Four biological replicates of each cell line were quantitatively analyzed using an RPLC\u2013MS/MS setup. Each quantification experiment was performed twice to determine technical variances of the different quantification techniques. We were able to show that the label-free approach by far outperforms both TMT methods regarding proteome coverage, as up to threefold more proteins were reproducibly identified in replicate measurements. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that all three methods show comparable reproducibility concerning protein quantification, but slightly differ in terms of accuracy. Here, label-free was found to be less accurate than both TMT approaches. It was also observed that the introduction of TMT labels at the protein level reduces the effect of underestimation of protein ratios, which is commonly monitored in case of TMT peptide labeling. Previously reported differences in protein expression between the particular cell lines were furthermore reproduced, which confirms the applicability of each investigated quantification method to study proteomic differences in such biological systems.

They maintain only a few pathways for obtaining energy and reducing power for the key functions they need to fulfill. This makes RBCs highly sensitive to any aberration. If so, these RBCs are quickly removed from circulation, but if the RBC levels reduce extremely fast, this results in hemolytic anemia. Several causes of HA exist, and proteome analysis is the most straightforward way to obtain deeper insight into RBC functioning under the stress of disease. This should result in discovery of biomarkers, typical for each source of anemia. In this review, several challenges to generate in-depth RBC proteomes are described, like to obtain pure RBCs, to overcome the wide dynamic range in protein expression, and to establish which of the identified/quantified proteins are active in RBCs. The final challenge is to acquire and validate suited biomarkers unique for the changes that occur for each of the clinical questions; in red blood cell aging (also important for transfusion medicine), for thalassemias or sickle cell disease. Biomarkers for other hemolytic anemias that are caused by dysfunction of RBC membrane proteins (the RBC membrane defects) or RBC cytosolic proteins (the enzymopathies) are sometimes even harder to discover, in particular for the patients with RBC rare diseases with unknown cause.

Overall, 66 proteins were found overexpressed (ratio\u00a0>\u00a01.5) in at least one cancer condition using proteomic analysis and 7 proteins were increased in all malignant/nonmalignant disease comparisons. Preliminary screening by immunoblot highlighted carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 6 (CEAM6), a cell surface protein overexpressed in many human cancers, as an interesting candidate biomarker. ELISA subsequently confirmed CEAM6 as a potential bile biomarker for distinguishing malignant from benign biliary stenoses with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (specificity 83%, sensitivity 93%, positive predictive value 93%, and negative predictive value 83%). No significant difference in serum CEAM6 level was found between malignant and nonmalignant samples.

Unfortunately, the complexity of bile and the presence of molecules interfering with protein analysis represent an obstacle for quantitative proteomic studies in bile samples. The simultaneous need to introduce purification steps and minimize the use of pre-fractionation methods inevitably leads to protein loss and limited quantifications. This dramatically reduces the chance of identifying new potential biomarkers. In the present study, we included differential centrifugation as a preliminary step in a quantitative proteomic workflow involving iTRAQ labeling, peptide fractionation by OFFGEL electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS, to compare protein expression in bile samples collected from patients with malignant or nonmalignant biliary stenoses.

Research into nuclear proteins in human tissues could uncover novel molecular processes in cancer. Here, we examine biochemical tissue fractions containing chromatin-binding (CB) proteins in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Methods: CB protein-containing fractions were biochemically extracted from human colorectal tissues, including carcinomas with chromosomal instability (CIN), carcinomas with microsatellite instability (MIN), and adenomas. The CB proteins were subjected to label-free LC\u2013MS/MS and the data were analyzed by bioinformatics. Results: Over 1700 proteins were identified in the CB fraction from colonic tissues, including 938 proteins associated with nuclear annotation. Of the latter, 169 proteins were differential between adenomas and carcinomas. In this adenoma-versus-carcinoma comparison, apart from specific changes in components of the splicing and protein translational machineries, we also identified significant changes in several proteins associated with chromatin-directed functions. Furthermore, several key cell cycle proteins as well as those involved in cellular stress were increased, whereas specific components of chromosome segregation and DNA recombination/repair systems were decreased. Conclusions: Our study identifies proteomic changes at the subnuclear level that are associated with CRC and may be further investigated.

A total of 1584 protein groups were identified. Of these, 708 proteins were identified in samples from both cohorts. Although present in both cohorts, 136 of these common proteins were significantly enriched in urine from adults and 94 proteins were significantly enriched in urine from infants. Using Gene Ontology, we found that the infant-enriched or specific subproteome (743 proteins) had an overrepresentation of proteins that are involved in translation and transcription, cellular growth and metabolic processes. In contrast, the adult enriched or specific subproteome (364 proteins) showed an overexpression of proteins involved in immune response and cell adhesion. This study demonstrates that the non-diseased male urinary proteome is quantitatively affected by age, has age-specific subproteomes, and identifies a common subproteome with no age-dependent abundance variations.

A combination of several biomarkers can improve the sensitivity and specificity of cancer detection and this work reports results from a panel of 4 proteins. By combining a validated preclinical mouse model with a proteomic approach we have recently discovered novel biomarkers for the detection of gastric cancer. Here, we investigate the specificity of four of those biomarkers (afamin, clusterin, VDBP and haptoglobin) for the detection of gastric cancer using two independent methods of validation: ELISA, and a non antibody based method: Multiple Reaction Monitoring with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (MRM-HR). All four biomarkers reliably differentiated GC from benign patient serum, and also in a small cohort of 11 early stage cases. We also present a novel isoform specific biomarker alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) that was identified using a mouse model for gastric cancer.

This mini-review describes what is known about the molecular determinants of protein halotolerance. Comparisons between the sequences of halophilic/non-halophilic homologous protein pairs indicated that Asp and Glu are significantly more frequent, while Lys, Ile and Leu are less frequent in halophilic proteins. Homologous halophilic and non-halophilic proteins have similar overall structure, secondary structure content, and number of residues involved in the formation of H-bonds. On the other hand, on the halophilic protein surface, a decrease of nonpolar residues and an increase of charged residues are observed. Particularly, halophilic adaptation correlates with an increase of Asp and Glu, compensated by a decrease of basic residues, mainly Lys, on protein surface. A thermodynamic model, that provides a reliable explanation of the salt effect on the conformational stability of globular proteins, is presented.",

It has been postulated that the higher catalytic activity of cold adapted enzymes when compared to homologues from thermophiles, reflects their higher molecular flexibility. To assess a potential difference in molecular flexibility between the two homologous proteinases, we have measured their Trp fluorescence quenching by acrylamide at different temperatures. We also investigated protein dynamics of VPR and AQUI at an atomic level by molecular dynamics simulations. VPR contains four Trp residues, three of which are at corresponding sites in the structure of AQUI. To aid in the comparison, a Tyr at the fourth corresponding site in AQUI was mutated to Trp (Y191W). A lower quenching effect of acrylamide on the intrinsic fluorescence of the thermophilic AQUI_Y191W was observed at all temperatures measured (10\u201355\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting that it possesses a more rigid structure than VPR. The MD analysis (C\u03b1 rmsf profiles) showed that even though VPR and AQUI have similar flexibility profiles, the cold adapted VPR displays higher flexibility in most regions of the protein structure. Some of these regions contain or are in proximity to some of the Trp residues (Trp6, Trp114 and Trp208) in the proteins. Thus, we observe an overall agreement between the fluorescence quenching data and the flexibility profiles obtained from the MD simulations to different flexibilities of specific regions in the proteins.",

The marine \u03b3-hydroxybutenolide terpenoid petrosaspongiolide M has been recently discovered as new proteasome inhibitor through a chemical proteomic approach and in cell biological assays. In this study a deep investigation has been carried out on the molecular mechanism of interaction of petrosaspongiolide M with the immunoproteasome, a proteasomal variant mainly involved in the immune responses. The results define a picture in which petrosaspongiolide M exerts its inhibitory activity by binding the active sites in the inner core of the immunoproteasome and/or covalently linking a Lys residue at the proteasome core/11S activator particle interface. Moreover, petrosaspongiolide M is also able to impair autophagy, a complementary pathway involved in protein degradation and cross-talking with the proteasome system. On this basis, petrosaspongiolide M could represent an interesting molecule for its propensity to modulate intracellular proteolysis through a dual inhibition of the immunoproteasome and autophagy.",

CK2 is generally found as a tetramer with two catalytic, \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 and two non catalytic \u03b2 subunits. CK2\u03b1 C-terminal tail phosphorylation is regulated during the mitotic events and the absence of these phosphosites in \u03b1\u2032 suggests an isoform specialization. We used a proteomic approach to identify proteins specifically phosphorylated by a CK2\u03b1 phosphomimetic mutant, CK2\u03b1T344ET360ES362ES370E (CK2\u03b14E), in human neuroblastoma SKNBE cellular extract. One of these proteins is lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1 or KDM1A), an important player of the epigenetic machinery. LSD1 is a FAD-dependent amine oxidase and promotes demethylation of lysine 4 and lysine 9 of mono- and di-methylated histone H3. We found that LSD1 is a new substrate and an interacting partner of protein kinase CK2. Three CK2 phosphosites, (Ser131, Ser137 and Ser166) in the N-terminal region of LSD1 have been identified. This domain is found in all chordates but not in more ancient organisms and it is not essential for LSD1 catalytic event while it could modulate the interaction with CK2 and with other partners in gene repressing and activating complexes. Our data support the view that the phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain by CK2 may represent a mechanism for regulating histone methylation, disclosing a new role for protein kinase CK2 in epigenetics.",

A key factor that has limited the success of this approach to date is insufficient accumulation of the engineered protein variants in vivo due to their improper folding and/or reduced stability, compared to the native protein. We have developed the Arabidopsis thaliana 11S proglobulins as a model system to enable studies exploring the factors underlying structural stability in this family of proteins.

To elucidate the role of these Cys residues in holding of the iron\u2013sulfur cluster in the course of oxidative decarboxylation of a 2-oxoacid, one or two of these Cys residues was/were substituted with Ala to yield C12A, C15A, C46A, C197A and C12/15A mutants.

The stable radical intermediate in wild type OFOR was rapidly decomposed upon addition of CoA in the absence of an electron acceptor. Non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, yielding acetaldehyde, has been reported to require CoA for other OFORs, but StOFOR catalyzed acetaldehyde production from pyruvate independent of CoA, regardless of whether the iron\u2013sulfur cluster is intact [4Fe\u20134S] type or not.

This reaction precedes the two ATP generating steps. Thus, inhibition of GAPDH will lead to substantially reduced energy generation. Consequently, there has been considerable interest in developing GAPDH inhibitors as anti-cancer and anti-parasitic agents. Here, we describe the biochemical characterisation of GAPDH from the common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica (FhGAPDH). The primary sequence of FhGAPDH is similar to that from other trematodes and the predicted structure shows high similarity to those from other animals including the mammalian hosts. FhGAPDH lacks a binding pocket which has been exploited in the design of novel antitrypanosomal compounds. The protein can be expressed in, and purified from Escherichia coli; the recombinant protein was active and showed no cooperativity towards glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as a substrate. In the absence of ligands, FhGAPDH was a mixture of homodimers and tetramers, as judged by protein\u2013protein crosslinking and analytical gel filtration. The addition of either NAD+ or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate shifted this equilibrium towards a compact dimer. Thermal scanning fluorimetry demonstrated that this form was considerably more stable than the unliganded one. These responses to ligand binding differ from those seen in mammalian enzymes. These differences could be exploited in the discovery of reagents which selectively disrupt the function of FhGAPDH.",

The profiles closely mirrored those established for M. tuberculosis. Rifalazil was confirmed to be the most potent rifamycin. Because the tuberculous granuloma presents a harshly oxidizing environment we explored the effects of oxidation on rifamycins. Mass spectrometry confirmed that three of the six major rifamycins showed autoxidation in the presence of trace metals. Oxidation could be monitored by distinctive changes including isosbestic points in the ultraviolet\u2013visible spectrum. Oxidation of rifamycins abrogated anti-mycobacterial activity in M. smegmatis. Protection from autoxidation was conferred by binding susceptible rifamycins to tear lipocalin, a promiscuous lipophilic protein. Rifalazil was not susceptible to autoxidation but was insoluble in aqueous solution. Solubility was enhanced when complexed to tear lipocalin and was accompanied by a spectral red shift. The positive solvatochromism was consistent with robust molecular interaction and binding. Other rifamycins also formed a complex with lipocalin, albeit to a lesser extent. Protection from oxidation and enhancement of solubility with protein binding may have implications for delivery of select rifamycin derivatives.",

In GAPN from Sulfolobus tokodaii (Sto-GAPN), Glc1P-induced activation follows an increase in affinity for GAP rather than an increase in maximum velocity, whereas in GAPN from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Sso-GAPN), Glc1P-induced activation follows an increase in maximum velocity rather than in affinity for GAP. To explore the molecular basis of this difference between Sto-GAPN and Sso-GAPN, we generated 14 mutants and 2 chimeras. The analyses of chimeric GAPNs generated from regions of Sto-GAPN and Sso-GAPN indicated that a 57-residue module located in the subunit interface was clearly involved in their allosteric behavior. Among the point mutations in this modular region, the Y139R variant of Sto-GAPN no longer displayed a sigmoidal K-type-like allostery, but instead had apparent V-type allostery similar to that of Sso-GAPN, suggesting that the residue located in the center of the homotetramer critically contributes to the allosteric behavior.",

Both Translin and TRAX were highly conserved in eukaryotes. The nucleic acid binding form of Translin is a barrel-shaped homo-octamer. A Translin\u2013TRAX hetero-octamer having a similar structure also binds nucleic acids. Previous reports suggested that Translin may be involved in chromosomal translocations, telomere metabolism and the control of mRNA transport and translation. More recent studies have indicated that Translin\u2013TRAX hetero-octamers are involved in RNA silencing. To gain a further insight into the functions of Translin, we have undertaken to systematically search for proteins with which it forms specific complexes in living cells. Here we report the results of such a search conducted in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a suitable model system. This search was carried out by affinity purification and immuno-precipitation techniques, combined with differential labeling of the intracellular proteins with the stable isotopes 15N and 14N. We identified for the first time two proteins containing an RNA Recognition Motif (RRM), which are specifically associated with the yeast Translin: (1) the pre-mRNA-splicing factor srp1 that belongs to the highly conserved SR family of proteins and (2) vip1, a protein conserved in fungi.

SidA can utilize both NADPH or NADH for activity; however, the enzyme is selective for NADPH. Structural analysis shows that R279 interacts with the 2\u2032-phosphate of NADPH. To probe the role of electrostatic interactions in coenzyme selectivity, R279 was mutated to both an alanine and a glutamate. The mutant proteins were active but highly uncoupled, oxidizing NADPH and producing hydrogen peroxide instead of hydroxylated ornithine. For wtSidA, the catalytic efficiency was 6-fold higher with NADPH as compared to NADH. For the R279A mutant the catalytic efficiency was the same with both coenyzmes, while for the R279E mutant the catalytic efficiency was 5-fold higher with NADH. The effects are mainly due to an increase in the KD values, as no major changes on the kcat or flavin reduction values were observed. Thus, the absence of a positive charge leads to no coenzyme selectivity while introduction of a negative charge leads to preference for NADH. Flavin fluorescence studies suggest altered interaction between the flavin and NADP+ in the mutant enzymes. The effects are caused by different binding modes of the coenzyme upon removal of the positive charge at position 279, as no major conformational changes were observed in the structure for R279A. The results indicate that the positive charge at position 279 is critical for tight binding of NADPH and efficient hydroxylation.",

Kinetic data highlighted two pKa, 7.17 and 9.64, in the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, the latter being absent in the E192Q mutant, suggesting that the substrate binding shifts Glu192 pKa from 7.07 to 9.64. A comparison of wt and E192Q mutant appears to show that the substrate binding shifts Lys185 pKa from 9.9 to 7.17. By comparing differences in proton release and the binding enthalpy of wt and mutant enzymes, the enthalpic cost of the change in the protonation state of Lys185 and Glu192 was estimated at \u2248\u00a06.1\u00a0kcal/mol. The change in protonation state of Lys185 and Glu192 has little effect on Gibbs free energy, 240\u2013325\u00a0cal/mol. However proton balance evidences the dissociation of other group(s) that can be collectively described by a single pKa shift from 9.1 to 7.54. This further change in ionization state of the enzyme causes an increase of free energy with a total cost of 1.2\u20132.3\u00a0kcal/mol to set the enzyme into a catalytically competent form.",

     "abstract": "Studies on thiamin biosynthesis have so far been achieved in eubacteria, yeast and plants, in which the thiamin structure is formed as thiamin phosphate from a thiazole and a pyrimidine moiety. This condensation reaction is catalyzed by thiamin phosphate synthase, which is encoded by the thiE gene or its orthologs. On the other hand, most archaea do not seem to have the thiE gene, but instead their thiD gene, coding for a 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine (HMP) kinase/HMP phosphate kinase, possesses an additional C-terminal domain designated thiN. These two proteins, ThiE and ThiN, do not share sequence similarity. In this study, using recombinant protein from the hyperthermophile archaea Pyrobaculum calidifontis, we demonstrated that the ThiN protein is an analog of the ThiE protein, catalyzing the formation of thiamin phosphate with the release of inorganic pyrophosphate from HMP pyrophosphate and 4-methyl-5-\u03b2-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate (HET-P). In addition, we found that the ThiN protein can liberate an inorganic pyrophosphate from HMP pyrophosphate in the absence of HET-P. A structure model of the enzyme\u2013product complex of P. calidifontis ThiN domain was proposed on the basis of the known three-dimensional structure of the ortholog of Pyrococcus furiosus. The significance of Arg320 and His341 residues for thiN-coded thiamin phosphate synthase activity was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis.

     "abstract": "MYB proteins are a family of transcription factors that play an important role in plant development and regulatory defense processes. Arabidopsis thaliana MYB30 (AtMYB30), a member of this protein family, is involved in cell death processes during the hypersensitive response (HR) of plants. HR is characterized by a vast production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO). NO may thus influence the binding of AtMYB30 to DNA. In this work we evaluated the effect of NO on AtMYB30 DNA binding activity, and also in the protein structural properties. A fully active minimal DNA-binding domain (DBD) of AtMYB30 (residues 11\u2013116) containing two cysteine residues (C49 and C53) was overexpressed and purified. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to obtain AtMYB30 DBD mutants C49A and C53A. The DNA binding activity of AtMYB30 DBD, and Cys single mutants is clearly inhibited upon incubation with a NO donor, and S-nitrosylation was confirmed by the biotin switch assay. Finally, in order to understand the mechanism of NO effect on AtMYB30 DNA binding activity we performed circular dichroism analysis, to correlate the observed protein function inhibition and a potential structural impairment on AtMYB30 DBD. Indeed, NO modification of C49 and C53 residues promotes a subtle modification on the secondary structure of this transcription factor. We thus demonstrated, using various techniques, the in vitro effect of NO on AtMYB30 DBD, and thus the potential consequences of NO activity on plant metabolism influenced by this transcription factor.",

In this study, Hsp26.7, Hsp23.2, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.4 and Hsp16.9A were up-regulated in Nipponbare during seedling and anthesis stages in response to heat stress. Subsequently, the expressing levels of these five sHsps in the heat-tolerant rice cultivar, Co39, were all significantly higher than that in the heat-susceptible rice cultivar, Azucena. This indicated that the expressive level of these five sHsps was positively related to the ability of rice plants to avoid heat stress. Thus, the expression level of these five sHsps can be regarded as bio-markers for screening rice cultivars with different abilities to avoid heat stress. Hsp18.1, Hsp17.9A, Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A, in the three rice cultivars under heat stress were found to be involved in one protein complex by Native-PAGE, and the interactions of Hsp18.1 and Hsp 17.7, Hsp18.1 and Hsp 17.9A, and Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A were further validated by yeast 2-hybridization. Pull down assay also confirmed the interaction between Hsp17.7 and Hsp16.9A in rice under heat stress. In conclusion, the up-regulation of the 5 sHsps is a key step for rice to tolerate heat stress, after that some sHsps assembled into a large hetero-oligomeric complex. In addition, through protein\u2013protein interaction, Hsp101 regulated thiamine biosynthesis, and Hsp82 homology affected nitrogen metabolism, while Hsp81-1 were involved in the maintenance of sugar or starch synthesis in rice plants under heat stress. These results provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of sHsps in rice.",

Since hPAD2 and hPAD4 are the isotypes expressed in the inflamed joints of RA patients and protein citrullination by PADs has been proposed to play a pathophysiological role, they represent unique therapeutic targets. To facilitate the development of substrate-based PAD inhibitors the substrate specificity of hPAD2 and hPAD4 was determined. Recombinant hPADs were expressed in bacteria or mammalian cell lines and allowed to citrullinate proteins in cell lysates, as well as a series of synthetic peptides. The citrullinated residues in proteins and the efficiency of peptide citrullination were determined by mass spectrometry. In total 320 hPAD2 and 178 hPAD4 citrullination sites were characterized. Amino acid residues most commonly found in citrullination sites for both isotypes are Gly at +\u00a01 and Tyr at +\u00a03 relative to the target arginine. For hPAD4 several additional amino acids were observed to be preferred at various positions from \u2212\u00a04 to +\u00a04. The substrate motifs determined by amino acid substitution analysis partially confirmed these preferences, although peptide context dependent differences were also observed. Taken together, our data show that the enzyme specificity for cellular substrates and synthetic peptides differs for hPAD2 and hPAD4. hPAD4 shows more restrictive substrate specificity compared to hPAD2. Consensus sequences, which can be used as the basis for the development of PAD inhibitors, were derived for the citrullination sites of both hPAD2 and hPAD4.",

There are two other conserved domains, MH1 (including a myristoylation site) and MH2, also located in the amino terminal region and whose structure and putative protein binding capabilities are currently unknown. MH2 sequence contains a serine that we described as being phosphorylated only in differentiating neurons (S25 in chick). Here, Circular Dichroism (CD) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were used to characterize the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of a peptide with the MARCKS sequence surrounding S25. The peptide phosphorylated at this residue is recognized by monoclonal antibody 3C3 (mAb 3C3). CD and NMR data indicated that S25 phosphorylation does not cause extensive modifications in the peptide structure. However, the sharper lines, the absence of multiple spin systems and relaxation dispersion data observed for the phosphorylated peptide suggested a more ordered structure. Surface Plasmon Resonance was employed to compare the binding properties of mAb 3C3 to MARCKS protein and peptide. SPR showed that mAb 3C3 binds to the whole protein and the peptide with a similar affinity, albeit different kinetics. The slightly ordered structure of the phosphorylated peptide might be at the origin of its ability to interact with mAb 3C3 antibody, but this binding did not noticeably modify the peptide structure.",

The majority of flavoproteins operate in mitochondria where they participate in redox processes revolving around the transfer of electrons to the electron transport chain. In addition, we found that flavoenzymes play a central role in various aspects of iron metabolism, such as iron uptake, the biogenesis of iron\u2013sulfur clusters and insertion of the heme cofactor into apocytochromes. Another important group of flavoenzymes is directly (Dus1-4p and Mto1p) or indirectly (Tyw1p) involved in reactions leading to tRNA-modifications. Despite the wealth of genetic information available for S. cerevisiae, we were surprised that many flavoproteins are poorly characterized biochemically. For example, the role of the yeast flavodoxins Pst2p, Rfs1p and Ycp4p with regard to their electron donor and acceptor is presently unknown. Similarly, the function of the heterodimeric Aim45p/Cir1p, which is homologous to the electron-transferring flavoproteins of higher eukaryotes, in electron transfer processes occurring in the mitochondrial matrix remains to be elucidated. This lack of information extends to the five membrane proteins involved in riboflavin or FAD transport as well as FMN and FAD homeostasis within the yeast cell. Nevertheless, several yeast flavoproteins, were identified as convenient model systems both in terms of their mechanism of action as well as structurally to improve our understanding of diseases caused by dysfunctional human flavoprotein orthologs.",

In normal cells, SFKs are kept in an inactive state mainly by phosphorylation of a consensus regulatory tyrosine near the C-terminus (Tyr530 in the SFK c-Src). As recent data indicate that tyrosine modification enhances binding of metal ions, the hypothesis that SFKs might be regulated by metal ions was investigated. The c-Src C-terminal peptide bound two Fe3\u00a0+ ions with affinities at pH\u00a04.0 of 33 and 252\u00a0\u03bcM, and phosphorylation increased the affinities at least 10-fold to 1.4 and 23\u00a0\u03bcM, as measured by absorbance spectroscopy. The corresponding phosphorylated peptide from the SFK Lyn bound two Fe3\u00a0+ ions with much higher affinities (1.2\u00a0pM and 160\u00a0nM) than the Src C-terminal peptide. Furthermore, when Lyn or Hck kinases, which had been stabilised in the inactive state by phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine, were incubated with Fe3\u00a0+ ions, a significant enhancement of kinase activity was observed. In contrast Lyn or Hck kinases in the unphosphorylated active state were significantly inhibited by Fe3\u00a0+ ions. These results suggest that Fe3\u00a0+ ions can regulate SFK activity by binding to the phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory tyrosine.",

We have investigated ArdA proteins from the genomes of Enterococcus faecalis V583, Staphylococcus aureus Mu50 and Bacteroides fragilis NCTC 9343, and compared them to the ArdA protein expressed by the conjugative transposon Tn916. We find that despite having very different structural stability and secondary structure content, they can all bind to the EcoKI methyltransferase, a core component of the EcoKI Type I RM system. This finding indicates that the less structured ArdA proteins become fully folded upon binding.

At pH\u00a07.4 (pI\u00a0=\u00a07\u20138) ligand binding increased concentration-dependent self-association of FBP into stable multimers of holo-FBP. DSC of 3.3\u00a0\u03bcM holo-FBP showed Tm (76\u00a0\u00b0C) and molar enthalpy (146\u00a0kcal\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01) values increasing to 78\u00a0\u00b0C and 163\u00a0kcal\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 at 10\u00a0\u03bcM holo-FBP, while those of apo-FBP were 55\u00a0\u00b0C and 105\u00a0kcal\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01. Besides ligand binding, intermolecular forces involved in concentration-dependent multimerization thus contribute to the thermostability of holo-FBP. Hence, thermal unfolding and dissociation of holo-FBP multimers occur simultaneously consistent with a gradual decrease from octameric to monomeric holo-FBP (10\u00a0\u03bcM) in DLS after a step-wise rise in temperature to 78\u00a0\u00b0C\u00a0\u2248\u00a0Tm. Stable holo-FBP multimers may protect naturally occurring labile folates against decomposition or bacterial utilization. DSC established an interrelationship between diminished folate binding at pH\u00a05, especially in NaCl-free buffers, and low thermostability. Positively charged apo-FBP was almost completely unfolded and aggregated at pH\u00a05 (Tm 38\u00a0\u00b0C) and holo-FBP, albeit more thermostable, was labile with aggregation tendency. Addition of 0.15\u00a0M NaCl increased thermostability of apo-FBP drastically, and even more so that of holo-FBP. Electrostatic forces thus seem to contribute to a diminished thermostability at low pH. Fluorescence spectroscopy after irreversible thermal unfolding of FBP revealed a weak-affinity folate binding.",

     "abstract": "The HIV-1 p17 matrix protein is a multifunctional protein that interacts with other molecules including proteins and membranes. The dynamic structure between its folded and partially unfolded states can be critical for the recognition of interacting molecules. One of the most important roles of the p17 matrix protein is its localization to the plasma membrane with the Gag polyprotein. The myristyl group attached to the N-terminus on the p17 matrix protein functions as an anchor for binding to the plasma membrane. Biochemical studies revealed that two regions are important for its function: D14\u2013L31 and V84\u2013V88. Here, the dynamic structures of the p17 matrix protein were studied using NMR for relaxation and amide proton exchange experiments at the physiological pH of 7.0. The results revealed that the \u03b112-loop, which includes the 14\u201331 region, was relatively flexible, and that helix 4, including the 84\u201388 region, was the most protected helix in this protein. However, the residues in the \u03b134-loop near helix 4 had a low order parameter and high exchange rate of amide protons, indicating high flexibility. This region is probably flexible because this loop functions as a hinge for optimizing the interactions between helices 3 and 4.

In order to gain better insight into the interaction between LPS and AMPs, we determined the structure of tachyplesin I (TP I), an antimicrobial peptide derived from horseshoe crab, in its bound state with LPS and proposed the complex structure of TP I and LPS using a docking program.CD and NMR measurements revealed that binding to LPS slightly extends the two \u03b2-strands of TP I and stabilizes the whole structure of TP I. The fluorescence wavelength of an intrinsic tryptophan of TP I and fluorescence quenching in the presence or absence of LPS indicated that a tryptophan residue is incorporated into the hydrophobic environment of LPS. Finally, we succeeded in proposing a structural model for the complex of TP I and LPS by using a docking program. The calculated model structure suggested that the cationic residues of TP I interact with phosphate groups and saccharides of LPS, whereas hydrophobic residues interact with the acyl chains of LPS.",

Interestingly, BmooMP\u03b1-I showed a strong bias towards hydrolysis after proline residues, which is unusual for most of characterized peptidases.

FRET peptide assays indicated a relative promiscuity at its S2\u2013S\u20322 subsites, with proline determining the scissile bond.

Structural analysis of the tripeptide LPL complexed with BmooMP\u03b1-I, generated by molecular dynamics simulations, assisted in defining the subsites and provided the structural basis for subsite preferences such as the restriction of basic residues at the S2 subsite due to repulsive electrostatic effects and the steric impediment for large aliphatic or aromatic side chains at the S1 subsite. These new functional and structural findings provided a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the physiological effects of this important class of enzymes in envenomation process.",

However, a non-polar patch may be required so that the protein can bind to another molecule. The mutant 6L\u2014derived from the acidic, dimeric \u03b1-helical protein sulerythrin and containing six additional leucines arranged to form a non-polar patch on its surface when properly folded\u2014has a substantially reduced solubility in comparison with that of wild-type sulerythrin. This reduced solubility appears to cause 6L to aggregate. To reverse this aggregation, we mutated 6L so that it contained three to six additional glutamates or aspartates that we predicted would surround the non-polar leucine patch on natively folded 6L. Although the introduction of three glutamates or aspartates increased solubility, the mutants still aggregate and have a reduced \u03b1-helical content. Conversely, mutants with six additional glutamates or aspartates appear to exist mostly as dimers and to have the same \u03b1-helical content as that of wild-type sulerythrin. Notably, the introduction of five lysines or five arginines at the positions held by the glutamates or aspartates did not recover solubility as effectively as did the negatively charged residues. These results demonstrate that negatively charged residues, but not positively charged ones, surrounding a non-polar patch on an acidic protein can completely reverse the decrease in its solubility caused by the patch of non-polar surface residues.",

Disruptors of protein\u2013protein interactions can be designed provided that the sterical features of binding pockets, including the transient ones, can be defined. Molecular Dynamics, MD, simulations have been used as a reliable framework for identifying transient pocket openings on the protein surface. Accessible surface area and intramolecular H-bond involvement of protein backbone amides are proposed as descriptors for characterizing binding pocket occurrence and evolution along MD trajectories. TEMPOL induced paramagnetic perturbations on 1H\u201315N HSQC signals of protein backbone amides have been analyzed as a fragment-based search for surface hotspots, in order to validate MD predicted pockets. This procedure has been applied to CXCL12, a small chemokine responsible for tumor progression and proliferation. From combined analysis of MD data and paramagnetic profiles, two CXCL12 sites suitable for the binding of small molecules were identified. One of these sites is the already well characterized CXCL12 region involved in the binding to CXCR4 receptor. The other one is a transient pocket predicted by Molecular Dynamics simulations, which could not be observed from static analysis of CXCL12 PDB structures. The present results indicate how TEMPOL, instrumental in identifying this transient pocket, can be a powerful tool to delineate minor conformations which can be highly relevant in dynamic discovery of antitumoral drugs.",

It is a homolog of CesA (98% sequence identity) and CesB (64% identity), both produced by B. subtilis strain 168. CesB can be used for the enantioselective hydrolysis of 1,2-O-isopropylideneglycerol (solketal) esters (E\u00a0>\u00a0200 for IPG-caprylate). Crystal structures of NP and CesB, determined to a resolution of 1.75\u00a0\u00c5 and 2.04\u00a0\u00c5, respectively, showed that both proteins have a canonical \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase fold with an extra N-terminal helix stabilizing the cap subdomain. The active site in both enzymes is located in a deep hydrophobic groove and includes the catalytic triad residues Ser130, His274, and Glu245. A product analog, presumably 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)acetic acid, was bound in the NP active site. The enzymes have different enantioselectivities, which previously were shown to result from only a few amino acid substitutions in the cap domain. Modeling of a substrate in the active site of NP allowed explaining the different enantioselectivities. In addition, Ala156 may be a determinant of enantioselectivity as well, since its side chain appears to interfere with the binding of certain R-enantiomers in the active site of NP. However, the exchange route for substrate and product between the active site and the solvent is not obvious from the structures. Flexibility of the cap domain might facilitate such exchange.

     "abstract": "Respiratory NADH dehydrogenase-2 (NDH-2) of Escherichia coli is a peripheral membrane-bound flavoprotein. By eliminating its C-terminal region, a water soluble truncated version was obtained in our laboratory. Overall conformation of the mutant version resembles the wild-type protein. Considering these data and the fact that the mutant was obtained as an apo-protein, the truncated version is an ideal model to study the interaction between the enzyme and its cofactor. Here, the FAD binding properties of this version were characterized using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), limited proteolysis, and steady-state and dynamic fluorescence spectroscopy. CD spectra, thermal unfolding and DSC profiles did not reveal any major difference in secondary structure between apo- and holo-protein. In addition, digestion site accessibility and tertiary conformation were similar for both proteins, as seen by comparable chymotryptic cleavage patterns. FAD binding to the apo-protein produced a parallel increment of both FAD fluorescence quantum yield and steady-state emission anisotropy. On the other hand, addition of FAD quenched the intrinsic fluorescence emission of the truncated protein, indicating that the flavin cofactor should be closely located to the protein Trp residues. Analysis of the steady-state and dynamic fluorescence data confirms the formation of the holo-protein with a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and an association constant KA\u00a0=\u00a07.0(\u00b1\u00a00.8)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01.

Molecular modeling based on our DEN3 and DEN4 ED3 structures indicated that the side-chains of residues 310/387, which are Val310/Ile387 and Met310/Leu387 in DEN3wt and DEN4wt, respectively, could be structurally compensated, and that a \u201csize switch type repacking\u201d might have occurred at these sites during the evolution of DEN into its four serotypes. This was experimentally confirmed by a 10\u00a0\u00b0C and 5\u00a0\u00b0C decrease in the thermal stability of, respectively, DEN3 ED3 variants with Met310/Ile387 and Val310/Leu387, whereas the variant with Met310/Leu387, which contains a double mutation, had the same stability as the wild type DEN3. Namely, the Met310Val mutation should have preceded the Leu387Ile mutation in order to maintain the tight internal packing of ED3 and thus its thermodynamic stability. This view was confirmed by a phylogenetic reconstruction indicating that a common DEN ancestor would have Met310/Leu387, and the intermediate node protein, Val310/Leu387, which then mutated to the Val310/Ile387 pair found in the present DEN3. The hypothesis was further confirmed by the observation that all of the present DEN viruses exhibit only stabilizing amino acid pairs at the 310/387 sites.",

Independent analyses of the spectral changes using two methods of multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy, revealed small but significant differences in the secondary structure as a result of the all-or-none transition. The cooperativity of the transition was quantitatively described using values corresponding to the mid-point (tm) and width of the transition (\u0394tm). The averages of the two parameters, calculated using the data collected by the different probes, were equal to 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 and 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1(SE), respectively.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 16790\u201316795 (2013)). The heme iron of HemAC-Lm is expected to participate in oxygen binding and activates adenylate cyclase activity during catalysis, but its interactions with O2 are uncharacterized. We have utilized the HemAC-Lm and stopped-flow methods to study the formation and decay of the HemAC-Lm oxygenated complex at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. Mixing of the ferrous HemAC-Lm with air-saturated buffer generates a very stable oxygenated complex with absorption maxima at 414, 540 and 576\u00a0nm. The distal axial ligand in the deoxygenated ferrous HemAC-Lm is displaced by O2 at a rate of ~\u00a010\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. To prepare apoprotein of heme iron in HemAC-Lm, we have mutated the proximal His161 to Ala and characterized the mutant protein. The apo as well as heme reconstituted ferric state of the mutant protein shows a ~\u00a030 fold lower catalytic activity compared to oxygenated form of wild type protein. The oxygenated form of heme reconstituted mutant protein is highly unstable (decay rate\u00a0=\u00a06.1\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01). Decomposition of the oxygenated intermediate is independent of O2 concentration and is monophasic. Thus, the stabilization of ferrous-oxy species is an essential requirement in the wild type HemAC-Lm for a conformational alteration in the sensor domain that, sequentially, activates the adenylate cyclase domain, resulting in the synthesis of cAMP.",

Although it is assumed that this regulator binds its DNA targets as a dimer, the way in which this interaction occurs remains unknown. We have focused on FurA from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. To assess the molecular mechanism by which FurA specifically binds to \u201ciron boxes\u201d in PfurA, we examined the topology arrangement of FurA\u2013DNA complexes by atomic force microscopy. Interestingly, FurA\u2013PfurA complexes exhibit several populations, in which one is the predominant and depends clearly on the regulator/promoter ratio on the environment. Those results together with EMSA and other techniques suggest that FurA binds PfurA using a sequential mechanism: (i) a monomer specifically binds to an \u201ciron box\u201d and bends PfurA; (ii) two situations may occur, that a second FurA monomer covers the free \u201ciron box\" or that joins to the previously used forming a dimer which would maintain the DNA kinked; (iii) trimerization in which the DNA is unbent; and (iv) finally undergoes a tetramerization; the next coming molecules cover the DNA strands unspecifically. In summary, the bending appears when an \u201ciron box\u201d is bound to one or two molecules and decreases when both \u201ciron boxes\u201d are covered. These results suggest that DNA bending contributes at the first steps of FurA repression promoting the recruitment of new molecules resulting in a fine regulation in the Fur-dependent cluster associated genes.",

Thermal and denaturant-induced unfolding of wild type and mutant PhSOD followed by circular dichroism and fluorescence studies revealed that C\u2192R substitution alters the thermal stability and the resistance against denaturants of the enzyme, whereas C57S only alters the stability of the protein against urea. The crystallographic data on the C57R mutation suggest an involvement of the Arg side chain in the formation of salt bridges on protein surface. These findings support the hypothesis that the thermal resistance of PhSOD relies on optimization of charge\u2013charge interactions on its surface.

As denaturant concentration is increased within the subdenaturing limit, the CO-association reaction is decelerated indicating that subdenaturing concentrations of denaturant reduce the structural fluctuation of the \u03a9-loop. Structural fluctuation of the \u03a9-loop is reduced more for urea and least for TMU. Intermolecular docking between horse cytochrome c and denaturant molecule (urea, MU, DMU, EU and TMU) reveals that polyfunctional interactions between the denaturant and different groups of \u03a9-loop and other part of protein decrease with an increase of alkyl group on urea molecule, which suggests that the decrease in the extent of restricted dynamics of \u03a9-loop with a corresponding increase of alkyl groups on urea molecule is due to the decrease of denaturant-mediated cross-linking interactions. These denaturant-mediated interactions are expected to reduce the conformational entropy of protein. Analysis of rate-temperature data shows a progressive decrease in conformational entropy of protein in the native to subdenaturing region. Thermodynamic analysis of denaturant (urea, MU, DMU, EU, TMU) effects on the thermal unfolding of ferrocytochrome c reveals that (i) thermodynamic stability of protein decreases with increasing concentration of denaturant or hydrophobicity of urea derivatives, (ii) water activity plays an important role in stabilization of ferrocytochrome c, and (iii) destabilization of ferrocytochrome c by denaturant occurs through the disturbance of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen-bonding.",

A highly potent example is the thermophilic \u03b2-mannanase from Aspergillus niger BK01 (ManBK), which can be efficiently expressed in industrial yeast strains and is thus an attractive candidate for commercial utilizations. In order to understand the molecular mechanism, which helps in strategies to improve the enzyme's performance that would meet industrial demands, 3D-structural information is a great asset. Here, we present the 1.57\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of ManBK. The protein adopts a typical (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 fold that resembles the other GH5 family members. Polysaccharides were subsequently modeled into the substrate binding groove to identify the residues and structural features that may be involved in the catalytic reaction. Based on the structure, rational design was conducted to engineer ManBK in an attempt to enhance its enzymatic activity. Among the 23 mutants that we constructed, the most promising Y216W showed an 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7% increase in specific activity by comparison with the wild type enzyme. The optimal temperature and heat tolerance profiles of Y216W were similar to those of the wild type, manifesting a preserved thermostability. Kinetic studies showed that Y216W has higher kcat values than the wild type enzyme, suggesting a faster turnover rate of catalysis. In this study we applied rational design to ManBK by using its crystal structure as a basis and identified the Y216W mutant that shows great potentials in industrial applications.",

Using thioflavin T fluorescence and static light scattering, the kinetic parameters such as amplitude, elongation rate constant and lag time of guanidine hydrochloride-induced aggregation reactions of hen egg white lysozyme were studied. We observed a contrasting effect of inhibitors on the kinetic parameters when aggregation reactions were measured by these two probes. The interactions of these inhibitors with hen egg white lysozyme were investigated using fluorescence quench titration method and molecular dynamics simulations coupled with binding free energy calculations. We conclude that both the inhibitors prolong nucleation of amyloid aggregation through binding to region of the protein which is known to form the core of the protein fibril, but once the nucleus is formed the rate of elongation is not affected by the inhibitors.

     "abstract": "The cofactor-binding site of the NAD+-dependent Arabidopsis thaliana aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3H1 was analyzed to understand structural features determining cofactor-specificity. Homology modeling and mutant analysis elucidated important amino acid residues. Glu149 occupies a central position in the cofactor-binding cleft, and its carboxylate group coordinates the 2\u2032- and 3\u2032-hydroxyl groups of the adenosyl ribose ring of NAD+ and repels the 2\u2032-phosphate moiety of NADP+. If Glu149 is mutated to Gln, Asp, Asn or Thr the binding of NAD+ is altered and rendered the enzyme capable of using NADP+. This change is attributed to a weaker steric hindrance and elimination of the electrostatic repulsion force of the 2\u2032-phosphate of NADP+. Simultaneous mutations of Glu149 and Ile200, which is situated opposite of the cofactor binding cleft, improved the enzyme efficiency with NADP+. The double mutant ALDH3H1Glu149Thr/Ile200Val showed a good catalysis with NADP+. Subsequently a triple mutation was generated by replacing Val178 by Arg in order to create a \u201cclosed\u201d cofactor binding site. The cofactor specificity was shifted even further in favor of NADP+, as the mutant ALDH3H1E149T/V178R/I200V uses NADP+ with almost 7-fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to NAD+. Our experiments suggest that residues occupying positions equivalent to 149, 178 and 200 constitute a group of amino acids in the ALDH3H1 protein determining cofactor affinity.",

The effect of salt additives (NaCl, CsCl, Na2SO4, NaClO4 and NaSCN) at different concentrations on the protein partition behavior was examined. The salt effects on protein partitioning were analyzed by using the Collander solvent regression relationship between the protein partition coefficients in ATPSs with and without salt additives. The results obtained show that the presence and concentration of salt additives affect the protein partition behavior. Analysis of ATPSs in terms of the differences between the relative hydrophobicity and electrostatic properties of the phases does not explain the protein partition behavior. The differences between protein partitioning could not be explained by the protein size. The structural signatures for the proteins were constructed from partition coefficient values in four ATPSs with different salt additives, and the structural distances were calculated using cytochrome c as the reference structure. The structural distances for all the examined proteins (except lysozyme) were found to be interrelated. Analysis of about 50 different descriptors of the protein structures revealed that the partition behavior of proteins is determined by the peculiarities of their surfaces (e.g., the number of water-filled cavities and the averaged hydrophobicity of the surface residues) and by the intrinsic flexibility of the protein structure measured in terms of the B-factor (or temperature factor).",

PriB has an OB-fold dimer structure and exhibits single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding activities similar to single-stranded binding protein (SSB). In this study, we examined PriB's interaction with ssDNA (oligo-dT35, -dT15, and -dT7) using heteronuclear NMR analysis. Interestingly, 1H or 15N chemical shift changes of the PriB main-chain showed two distinct modes using oligo-dT35. The chemical shift perturbation sites in the primary mode were consistent with the main contact site in PriB\u2013ssDNA, which was previously determined by crystal structure analysis. The results also suggested that approximately 8\u00a0nt in ssDNA was the main contact site to PriB. In the secondary mode, residues in the \u03b1-helix region (His57\u2013Ser65) and in \u03b24\u2013loop3\u2013\u03b25 were mainly perturbed. On the other hand, we examined the state of ssDNA by FRET using 5\u2032-Cy3- and 3\u2032-Cy5-modified oligo-dT35. As the PriB concentration increased, two-step saturation curves were observed in the FRET assay, suggesting a compact structure of ssDNA. Moreover, we confirmed two-step PriB binding to oligo-dT35 using EMSA. The pH dependence of FRET suggested contribution of the His residues. Therefore, we prepared His mutants of PriB and found that His64 in the \u03b1-helix region contributed to the second interaction between PriB and ssDNA using FRET and EMSA. Thus, from a structural standpoint, we suggested the role of His64 on the compactness of the PriB\u2013ssDNA complex and on the positive cooperativity of PriB.",

We examine the combination of phosphorylation and glycosylation site prediction with transmembrane protein topology prediction. We report the development of a Hidden Markov Model based method, capable of predicting the topology of transmembrane proteins and the existence of kinase specific phosphorylation and N/O-linked glycosylation sites along the protein sequence.

Solutions of myoglobin in glycerol/water mixtures of various compositions are measured by dielectric spectroscopy in the frequency range from 10\u00a0mHz to 10\u00a0MHz. The resolution of low frequency modes is improved by two approaches: electrical \u2018cleaning\u2019 and the analysis of the derivative of the real component of permittivity, which shows no direct signature of dc-conductivity. Effects of internal interfacial polarization are also addressed by measuring the same solvents in confinement as well as mixed with glass beads.

Expression of thermolysin variants truncated from the C-terminus was examined in E. coli culture. The C-terminal Lys316 residue was not significant in the expression, but Val315 was critical. Variants in which Val315 was substituted with fourteen amino acids were prepared. The variants substituted with hydrophobic amino acids such as Leu and Ile were almost the same as wild-type thermolysin (WT) in the expression amount, \u03b1-helix content, and stability. Variants with charged (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg), bulky (Trp), or small (Gly) amino acids were lower in these characteristics than WT. All variants exhibited considerably high activities (50\u2013100% of WT) in hydrolyzing protein and peptide substrates. The expression amount, helix content, and stability of variants showed good correlation with hydropathy indexes of the amino acids substituted for Val315. Crystallographic study of thermolysin has indicated that V315 is a member of the C-terminal hydrophobic cluster. The results obtained in the present study indicate that stabilization of the cluster increases thermolysin stability and that the variants with higher stability are expressed more in the culture.

This was done by comparing oligomerization and DNA binding of H-NS with that of a H-NS D68V-D71V linker mutant. The double linker mutation D68V-D71V, that makes the linker significantly more hydrophobic, leads to a dramatically enhanced and strongly temperature-dependent H-NS oligomerization in solution, as detected by dynamic light scattering. The DNA binding affinity of H-NS D68V-D71V for the hns promoter region is lower and has stronger temperature dependence than that of H-NS. DNase I footprinting experiments show that at high concentrations, regions protected by H-NS D68V-D71V are larger and less defined than for H-NS. In vitro transcription assays show that the enhanced protection also leads to enhanced transcriptional repression. Whereas the lower affinity of the H-NS D68V-D71V for DNA could be caused by competition between oligomerization in solution and oligomerization on DNA, the larger size of protected regions clearly confirms the notion that cooperative binding of H-NS to DNA is related to protein\u2013protein interactions. These results emphasize the relative contributions of protein\u2013protein interactions and substrate-dependent oligomerization in the control of gene repression operated by H-NS.",

SALMFamide neuropeptides act as muscle relaxants and both S1 and S2 cause relaxation of cardiac stomach and tube foot preparations in vitro but S2 is an order of magnitude more potent than S1.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that S1 does not have a defined structure in aqueous solution and this was supported by 2D nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. In contrast, we found that S2 has a well-defined conformation in aqueous solution. However, the conformation of S2 was concentration dependent, with increasing concentration inducing a transition from an unstructured to a structured conformation. Interestingly, this property of S2 was not observed in an N-terminally truncated analogue of S2 (short S2 or SS2; SFNSGLTFamide).

Plant carnivory has attracted much interest since Darwin's time, but many fundamental properties of the carnivorous lifestyle are largely unexplored. In particular, the chain of events leading from prey perception to its digestive utilization remains to be elucidated. One of the first steps after the capture of animal prey, i.e. the enzymatic breakup of the insects' chitin-based shell, is reflected by considerable chitinase activity in the secreted digestive fluid in the carnivorous plant Venus flytrap. This study addresses the molecular nature, function, and regulation of the underlying enzyme, VF chitinase-I. Using mass spectrometry based de novo sequencing, VF chitinase-I was identified in the secreted fluid. As anticipated for one of the most prominent proteins in the flytrap's \u201cgreen stomach\u201d during prey digestion, transcription of VF chitinase-I is restricted to glands and enhanced by secretion-inducing stimuli. In their natural habitat, Venus flytrap is exposed to high temperatures. We expressed and purified recombinant VF chitinase-I and show that the enzyme exhibits the hallmark properties expected from an enzyme active in the hot and acidic digestive fluid of Dionaea muscipula. Structural modeling revealed a relative compact globular form of VF chitinase-I, which might contribute to its overall stability and resistance to proteolysis. These peculiar characteristics could well serve industrial purposes, especially because of the ability to hydrolyze both soluble and crystalline chitin substrates including the commercially important cleavage of \u03b1-chitin.",

The objective of the present study is to show that the association of secondary structures that share some of their backbone residues is a commonplace in globular proteins, and that such deeper fusion of secondary structures, namely extended secondary structures (ESSs), helps stabilize the original secondary structures and the resulting tertiary structures. For statistical purposes, a set of 163 proteins from the protein databank was randomly selected and a few specific cases are structurally analyzed and characterized in more detail. The results point that about 30% of the residues from each protein, on average, participate in ESS. Alternatively, for the specific cases considered, our results were based on the secondary structures produced after extensive Molecular Dynamics simulation of a protein\u2013aqueous solvent system. Based on the very small width of the time distribution of the root mean squared deviations, between the ESS taken along the simulation and the ESS from the mean structure of the protein, for each ESS, we conclude that the ESSs significantly increase the conformational stability by forming very stable aggregates.

     "abstract": "Since cyanide potentiates the inhibitory activity of several monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, a series of carbonitrile-containing aminoheterocycles was examined to explore the role of nitriles in determining the inhibitory activity against MAO. Dicarbonitrile aminofurans were found to be potent, selective inhibitors against MAO A. The origin of the MAO A selectivity was identified by combining spectroscopic and computational methods. Spectroscopic changes induced in MAO A by mono- and dicarbonitrile inhibitors were different, providing experimental evidence for distinct binding modes to the enzyme. Similar differences were also found between the binding of dicarbonitrile compounds to MAO A and to MAO B. Stabilization of the flavin anionic semiquinone by monocarbonitrile compounds, but destabilization by dicarbonitriles, provided further support to the distinct binding modes of these compounds and their interaction with the flavin ring. Molecular modeling studies supported the role played by the nitrile and amino groups in anchoring the inhibitor to the binding cavity. In particular, the results highlight the role of Asn181 and Ile335 in assisting the interaction of the nitrile-containing aminofuran ring. The network of interactions afforded by the specific attachment of these functional groups provides useful guidelines for the design of selective, reversible MAO A inhibitors.",

Glycogen-1 and -2 coexist in liver glycogen preparations where the proteins are known to form homodimers, and they also have been shown to interact with each other. In order to study how glycogenin-1 and -2 interactions may influence each other's glucosylations we setup a cell-free expression system for in vitro production and glucosylation of glycogenin-1 and -2 in various combinations, and used a mass spectrometry based workflow for the characterization and quantitation of tryptic glycopeptides originating from glycogenin-1 and -2. The analysis revealed that the self-glucosylation endpoint was the incorporation of 4\u20138 glucose units on Tyr 195 of glycogenin-1, but only 0\u20134 glucose units on Tyr-228 of glycogenin-2. The glucosylation of glycogenin-2 was enhanced to 2\u20134 glucose units by the co-presence of enzymatically active glycogenin-1.

It is used by the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae to export several proteins, including its major virulence factor, cholera toxin. The pseudopilus is an essential component of the type II secretion system and likely acts as a piston to push the folded proteins across the outer membrane through the secretin pore. The pseudopilus is composed of the major pseudopilin, EpsG, and four minor pseudopilins, EpsH, EpsI, EpsJ and EpsK. We determined the x-ray crystal structure of the head domain of EpsH at 1.59\u00a0\u00c5 resolution using molecular replacement with the previously reported EpsH structure, 2qv8, as the template. Three additional N-terminal amino acids present in our construct prevent an artifactual conformation of residues 160\u2013166, present in one of the two monomers of the 2qv8 structure. Additional crystal contacts stabilize a long flexible loop comprised of residues 104\u2013135 that is more disordered in the 2qv8 structure but is partially observed in our structure in very different positions for the two EpsH monomers in the asymmetric unit. In one of the conformations the loop is highly extended.

In contrast to N-linked glycosylation, O-GlcNAcylation does not display a strict amino acid consensus sequence, although serine or threonine residues flanked by proline and valine are preferred sites of O-GlcNAcylation. Based on this information, computational prediction tools of O-GlcNAc sites have been developed. Here, we retrospectively assessed the performance of two available O-GlcNAc prediction programs YinOYang 1.2 server and OGlcNAcScan by comparing their predictions for recently discovered experimentally validated O-GlcNAc sites. Both prediction programs efficiently identified O-GlcNAc sites situated in an environment resembling the consensus sequence P-P-V-[ST]-T-A. However, both prediction programs revealed numerous false negative O-GlcNAc predictions when the site of modification was located in an amino acid sequence differing from the known consensus sequence. By searching for a common sequence motif, we found that O-GlcNAcylation of nucleocytoplasmic proteins preferably occurs at serine and threonine residues flanked downstream by proline and valine and upstream by one to two alanines followed by a stretch of serine and threonine residues. However, O-GlcNAcylation of proteins located in the mitochondria or in the secretory lumen occurs at different sites and does not follow a distinct consensus sequence. Thus, our study indicates the limitations of the presently available computational prediction methods for O-GlcNAc sites and suggests that experimental validation is mandatory. Continuously update and further development of available databases will be the key to improve the performance of O-GlcNAc site prediction.",

Little changes were observed in the protein denaturation temperature during storage, at either 5 or 40\u00a0\u00b0C. Glycerol was found to stabilize proteins; it increased the protein denaturation temperature. The stabilizing effect of glycerol disappeared after washing the sample with saline solution. Hydrogen-to-deuterium exchange rates of protein amide groups were fastest in leaflet tissue, followed by artery and muscle tissue. Diffusion of glycerol was found to be fastest in muscle tissue, followed by artery and leaflet tissue. Diffusion coefficients were derived and used to estimate the time needed to reach saturation. Fixation of tissue with glutaraldehyde had little effects on exchange and diffusion rates. Diffusion rates decreased with increasing molecular size. Proteins in decellularized heart valve tissue are stable during storage. Glycerol increases protein stability in a reversible manner. Solvent accessibility studies of protein amide groups provide an additional tool to study proteins in tissues.

We solved the structure of xlLTA4H to a resolution of 2.3\u00a0\u00c5. It is a dimeric structure where each monomer has three domains with the active site in between the domains, similar as to the human structure. An important difference between the human and amphibian enzyme is the phenylalanine to tyrosine exchange at position 375. Our studies show that mutating F375 in xlLTA4H to tyrosine abolishes the formation of the LTB4 isomeric product \u03946-trans-\u03948-cis-LTB4. In an attempt to understand how one amino acid exchange leads to a new product profile as seen in the xlLTA4H, we performed a conformer analysis of the triene part of the substrate LTA4. Our results show that the Boltzmann distribution of substrate conformers correlates with the observed distribution of products. We suggest that the observed difference in product profile between the human and the xlLTA4H arises from different level of discrimination between substrate LTA4 conformers.",

In particular, selenoprotein M (SelM) may function as thiol disulfide oxidoreductase that participates in the formation of disulfide bonds, and can be implicated in calcium responses. However, it presents a redox motif (CXXU), where U is a selenocysteine, and may also function as redox regulator because its decreased or increased expression regulated by dietary selenium alters redox homeostasis. No data are reported in literature about its involvement in cancer but only in neurodegenerative diseases. In this paper we evaluated the SelM expression in two hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7, compared to normal hepatocytes. The results suggested its involvement in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as its possible use to follow the progression of this cancer as putative marker. The aim of this study has been to analyze the structure\u2013function relationships of SelM. Hence, firstly we studied the evolutionary history of this protein by phylogenetic analysis and GC content of genes from various species.

We have cloned and characterized the 6x-His-tagged HMGR from the opportunistic lung pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia. Kinetic characterization shows that the enzyme prefers NAD(H) over NADP(H) as a cofactor, suggesting an oxidative physiological role for the enzyme. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the Burkholderia cenocepacia genome lacks the genes for the downstream enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. The enzyme exhibits positive cooperativity toward the substrates of the reductive reaction, but the oxidative reaction exhibits unusual double-saturation kinetics, distinctive among characterized HMG-CoA reductases.

Site-directed variants substituting residues E48 and E333 with alanine, aspartate and glutamine were characterized to probe the roles of these acidic residues, conserved in fungal and mammalian CGL sequences, in the active-site of CGL from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yCGL). The pH optimum of variants containing the alanine or glutamine substitutions of E333 is increased by 0.4\u20131.2 pH units, likely due to repositioning of the cofactor and modification of the pKa of the pyridinium nitrogen. The pH profile of yCGL-E48A/E333A resembles that of Escherichia coli cystathionine \u03b2-lyase. The effect of substituting E48, E333 or both residues is the 1.3\u20133, 26\u201358 and 124\u2013568-fold reduction, respectively, of the catalytic efficiency of l-Cth hydrolysis. The Kml-Cth of E333 substitution variants is increased ~\u00a017-fold, while Kml-OAS is within 2.5-fold of the wild-type enzyme, indicating that residue E333 interacts with the distal amine moiety of l-Cth, which is not present in the alternative substrate O-acetyl-l-serine.

Their function is unclear, but we previously discovered that REF had amyloid properties, which could be of particular interest during the coagulation process. First, we confirmed that REF and SRPP, homologous and principal proteins in hevea latex, are not glycoproteins. In this work, we investigated various aspects of protein interactions: aggregation, auto-assembling, yeast and erythrocyte agglutination, co-interactions by various biochemical (PAGE, spectroscopy, microscopy), biophysical (DLS, ellipsometry) and structural (TEM, ATR-FTIR, PM-IRRAS) approaches. We demonstrated that both proteins are auto-assembling into different aggregative states: REF polymerizes as an amyloid rich in \u03b2-sheets and forms quickly large aggregates (>\u00a0\u03bcm), whereas SRPP auto-assembles in solution into stable nanomultimers of a more globular nature. Both proteins are however able to interact together, and SRPP may inhibit the amyloidogenesis of REF. REF is also able to interact with the membranes of yeasts and erythrocytes, leading to their agglutination. In addition, we also showed that both REF and SRPP did not have antimicrobial activity, whereas their activity on membranes has been clearly evidenced. We may suspect that these aggregative properties, even though they are clearly different, may occur during coagulation, when the membrane is destabilized. The interaction of proteins with membranes could help in the colloidal stability of latex, whereas the protein\u2013protein interactions would contribute to the coagulation process, by bringing rubber particles together or eventually disrupting the particle monomembranes.",

     "abstract": "The PDZ domain is one of the most ubiquitous protein domains that is involved in coordinating signaling complex formation and protein networking by reversibly interacting with multiple binding partners. It has been linked to many devastating diseases such as avian influenza, Fraser syndrome, Usher syndrome and Dejerine\u2013Sottas neuropathy. Understanding the selectivity of PDZ domains can help elucidate how defects in PDZ proteins and their binding partners lead to human diseases. Since experimental methods to determine the interaction specificity of the PDZ domains are expensive and labor intensive, an accurate computational method is thus needed. Our developed support vector machine-based predictor using dipeptide composition is shown to qualitatively predict PDZ domain-peptide interaction with a high accuracy rate. Furthermore, since most of the dipeptide compositions are redundant and irrelevant, we propose a new hybrid feature selection technique to select only a subset of these compositions for interaction prediction. The experimental results show that only approximately 25% of dipeptide features are needed and that our method improves the prediction results significantly. The selected dipeptide features are also analyzed and shown to play important roles in specificity patterns of PDZ domains. Our method is based only on primary sequence information, and it can be used for the research of drug target and drug design in identifying PDZ domain-ligand interactions.

     "abstract": "Zinc is one of the most essential metals utilized by organisms, and zinc-binding proteins play an important role in a variety of biological processes such as transcription regulation, cell metabolism and apoptosis. Thus, characterizing the precise zinc-binding sites is fundamental to an elucidation of the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of zinc-binding proteins. Using systematic analyses of structural characteristics, we observed that 4-residue and 3-residue zinc-binding sites have distinctly specific geometric features. Based on the results, we developed the novel computational program Geometric REstriction for Zinc-binding (GRE4Zn) to characterize the zinc-binding sites in protein structures, by restricting the distances between zinc and its coordinating atoms. The comparison between GRE4Zn and analogous tools revealed that it achieved a superior performance. A large-scale prediction for structurally characterized proteins was performed with this powerful predictor, and statistical analyses for the results indicated zinc-binding proteins have come to be significantly involved in more complicated biological processes in higher species than simpler species during the course of evolution. Further analyses suggested that zinc-binding proteins are preferentially implicated in a variety of diseases and highly enriched in known drug targets, and the prediction of zinc-binding sites can be helpful for the investigation of molecular mechanisms. In this regard, these prediction and analysis results should prove to be highly useful be helpful for further biomedical study and drug design.

     "abstract": "Cyclic proteins (CPs) have circular chains with a continuous cycle of peptide bonds. Their unique structural traits result in greater stability and resistance to degradation when compared to their acyclic counterparts. They are also promising targets for pharmaceutical/therapeutic applications. To date, only a few hundred CPs are known, although recent studies suggest that their numbers might be substantially higher. Here we developed a first-of-its-kind, accurate and high-throughput method called CyPred that predicts whether a given protein chain is cyclic. CyPred considers currently well-represented CP families: cyclotides, cyclic defensins, bacteriocins, and trypsin inhibitors. Empirical tests demonstrate that CyPred outperforms commonly used alignment methods. We used CyPred to estimate the incidence of CPs and found ~\u00a03500 putative CPs among 5.7+ million chains from 642 fully sequenced proteomes from archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. The median number of putative CPs per species ranges from three for archaea proteomes to two for eukaryotes/bacteria, with 7% of archaea, 11% of bacterial, and 16% of eukaryotic proteomes having 10+ CPs. The differences in the estimated fractions of CPs per proteome are as large as three orders of magnitude. Among eukaryotes, animals have higher ratios of CPs compared to fungi, while plants have the largest spread of the ratios.

     "abstract": "p53 gain-of-function mutations are similar to driver mutations in cancer genes, with both promoting tumorigenesis. Most previous studies focused on residues lost by mutations, providing information related to a dominantly-negative effect. However, to understand gain-of-function mutations, it is also important to investigate what are the distributions of residues gained by mutations. We compile available p53/p63/p73 protein sequences and construct a non-redundant dataset. We analyze the amino acid and dipeptide composition of p53/p63/p73 proteins across evolution and compare them with the gain/loss of amino acids and dipeptides in human p53 following cancer-related somatic mutations. We find that the ratios of amino acids gained via somatic mutations during evolution to those lost through p53 cancer mutations correlate with the ratios found in single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human proteome. The dipeptide mutational gain/loss ratios are inversely correlated with those observed over p53 evolution but tend to follow the increasing p63/p73-like dipeptide propensities. We successfully simulated the p53 cancer mutation spectrum using the dipeptide composition across the p53 family accounting for the likelihood of mutations in p53 codons. The results revealed that the p53 mutation spectrum is dominated not only by p53 evolution but also by reversal of evolution to a certain degree.

     "abstract": "Drug-target interaction is a key research topic in drug discovery since correct identification of target proteins of drug candidates can help screen out those with unacceptable toxicities, thereby saving expense. In this study, we developed a novel computational approach to predict drug target groups that may reduce the number of candidate target proteins associated with a query drug. A benchmark dataset, consisting of 3028 drugs assigned within nine categories, was constructed by collecting data from KEGG. The nine categories are (1) G protein-coupled receptors, (2) cytokine receptors, (3) nuclear receptors, (4) ion channels, (5) transporters, (6) enzymes, (7) protein kinases, (8) cellular antigens and (9) pathogens. The proposed method combines the data gleaned from chemical\u2013chemical similarities, chemical\u2013chemical connections and chemical\u2013protein connections to allocate drugs to each of the nine target groups. A jackknife test applied to the training dataset that was constructed from the benchmark dataset, provided an overall correct prediction rate of 87.45%, as compared to 87.79% for the test dataset that was constructed by randomly selecting 10% of samples from the benchmark dataset. These prediction rates are much higher than the 11.11% achieved by random guesswork. These promising results suggest that the proposed method can become a useful tool in identifying drug target groups.

A recent study based on protein microarray experiments identified a large number of kinase\u2013substrate relationships (KSRs), and built a comprehensive and reliable phosphorylation network in humans. Analysis of this network, in conjunction with additional resources, revealed several key features. First, comparison of the human and yeast phosphorylation networks uncovered an evolutionarily conserved signaling backbone dominated by kinase-to-kinase relationships. Second, although most of the KSRs themselves are not conserved, the functions enriched in the substrates for a given kinase are often conserved. Third, the prevalence of kinase-transcription factor regulatory modules suggests that phosphorylation and transcriptional regulatory networks are inherently wired together to form integrated regulatory circuits. Overall, the phosphorylation networks described in this work promise to offer new insights into the properties of kinase signaling pathways, at both the global and the protein levels.

     "abstract": "Various molecular pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic (PK\u2013PD) models have been proposed in the last decades to represent and predict drug effects in anticancer chemotherapies. Most of these models are cell population based since clearly measurable effects of drugs can be seen much more easily on populations of cells, healthy and tumour, than in individual cells. The actual targets of drugs are, however, cells themselves. The drugs in use either disrupt genome integrity by causing DNA strand breaks, and consequently initiate programmed cell death, or block cell proliferation mainly by inhibiting factors that enable cells to proceed from one cell cycle phase to the next through checkpoints in the cell division cycle. DNA damage caused by cytotoxic drugs (and also cytostatic drugs at high concentrations) activates, among others, the p53 protein-modulated signalling pathways that directly or indirectly force the cell to make a decision between survival and death. The paper aims to become the first-step in a larger scale enterprise that should bridge the gap between intracellular and population PK\u2013PD models, providing oncologists with a rationale to predict and optimise the effects of anticancer drugs in the clinic. So far, it only sticks at describing p53 activation and regulation in single cells following their exposure to DNA damaging stress agents. We show that p53 oscillations that have been observed in individual cells can be reconstructed and predicted by compartmentalising cellular events occurring after DNA damage, either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, and by describing network interactions, using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), between the ATM, p53, Mdm2 and Wip1 proteins, in each compartment, nucleus or cytoplasm, and between the two compartments.

     "abstract": "P53 and E2F1 are critical transcription factors involved in the choices between different cell fates including cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Recent experiments have shown that two families of microRNAs (miRNAs), p53-responsive miR34 (miRNA-34 a, b and c) and E2F1-inducible miR449 (miRNA-449 a, b and c) are potent inducers of these different fates and might have an important role in sensitizing cancer cells to drug treatment and tumor suppression. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for the combinatorial regulatory roles of these two transcription factors and two miRNAs is an important and challenging problem. Here, based in part on the model proposed in Tongli Zhang et al. (2007), we developed a mathematical model of the decision process and explored the combinatorial regulation between these two transcription factors and two miRNAs in response to DNA damage. By analyzing nonlinear dynamic behaviors of the model, we found that p53 exhibits pulsatile behavior. Moreover, a comparison is given to reveal the subtle differences of the cell fate decision process between regulation and deregulation of miR34 on E2F1. It predicts that miR34 plays a critical role in promoting cell cycle arrest. In addition, a computer simulation result also predicts that the miR449 is necessary for apoptosis in response to sustained DNA damage. In agreement with experimental observations, our model can account for the intricate regulatory relationship between these two transcription factors and two miRNAs in the cell fate decision process after DNA damage. These theoretical results indicate that miR34 and miR449 are effective tumor suppressors and play critical roles in cell fate decisions. The work provides a dynamic mechanism that shows how cell fate decisions are coordinated by two transcription factors and two miRNAs.

     "publication date": "01-2014",
     "abstract": "Probably the most prominent expectation associated with systems biology is the computational support of personalized medicine and predictive health. At least some of this anticipated support is envisioned in the form of disease simulators that will take hundreds of personalized biomarker data as input and allow the physician to explore and optimize possible treatment regimens on a computer before the best treatment is applied to the actual patient in a custom-tailored manner. The key prerequisites for such simulators are mathematical and computational models that not only manage the input data and implement the general physiological and pathological principles of organ systems but also integrate the myriads of details that affect their functionality to a significant degree. Obviously, the construction of such models is an overwhelming task that suggests the long-term development of hierarchical or telescopic approaches representing the physiology of organs and their diseases, first coarsely and over time with increased granularity. This article illustrates the rudiments of such a strategy in the context of cystic fibrosis (CF) of the lung. The starting point is a very simplistic, generic model of inflammation, which has been shown to capture the principles of infection, trauma, and sepsis surprisingly well. The adaptation of this model to CF contains as variables healthy and damaged cells, as well as different classes of interacting cytokines and infectious microbes that are affected by mucus formation, which is the hallmark symptom of the disease (Perez-Vilar and Boucher, 2004) [1]. The simple model represents the overall dynamics of the disease progression, including so-called acute pulmonary exacerbations, quite well, but of course does not provide much detail regarding the specific processes underlying the disease. In order to launch the next level of modeling with finer granularity, it is desirable to determine which components of the coarse model contribute most to the disease dynamics. The article introduces for this purpose the concept of module gains or ModGains, which quantify the sensitivity of key disease variables in the higher-level system. In reality, these variables represent complex modules at the next level of granularity, and the computation of ModGains therefore allows an importance ranking of variables that should be replaced with more detailed models. The \u201chot-swapping\u201d of such detailed modules for former variables is greatly facilitated by the architecture and implementation of the overarching, coarse model structure, which is here formulated with methods of biochemical systems theory (BST).

Multiple studies also compared the differential network between HBV induced HCC and HCV induced HCC based on gene expression data. However network level comparison combining viral\u2013human interaction network and dysfunctional protein interaction network for HBV and HCV\u2013HCC has rarely been done before. In this work we did some pioneer job in construction of HBV/HCV viral dysfunctional network in HCC, in hope of investigating viral infection impact on the change of genome expression and eventually, the development of HCC. We found that HBx, the main HBV viral protein, directly acted on the gene groups of cell cycle, which could perfectly explain the dominant cell proliferation effect shown in the dysfunctional network of HBV\u2013HCC. On the other hand, multiple important HCV viral proteins including CORE, NS3 and NS5A were found to target very important cancer related proteins such as TP53 and SMAD3, but no direct targeting to major immune response or inflammation related proteins. Therefore the dominant activation of immune response and inflammation related pathways shown in dysfunctional network of HCV\u2013HCC might not be a direct effect of HCV infection. They might have been an indirect demonstration of activated cancer promoting pathways. Similar approaches may as well be applied to other important virus infection caused human diseases to help elucidate the mechanisms of virus\u2013host interaction, and even help with investigations on anti-virus based therapies.

With syndrome as the core of diagnosis and therapy in TCM, it has the advantage of collecting macroscopic information of patients for diagnosis. To understand the in vivo mechanism of TCM, a metabolomics approach was used to investigate the global biological characterization of the urine of psoriasis patients with Blood Stasis Syndrome and the therapeutic metabolomics mechanism of the Optimized Yinxieling formula. A total of 41 cases of psoriasis patients with Blood Stasis Syndrome and 19 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Fasting urine samples from patients with consecutive Optimized Yinxieling intake after 0, 4, 8 and 12\u00a0weeks and from healthy volunteers were analyzed by Orthogonal Projection on Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), which was utilized for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis and temporal metabolic changes identification. For psoriasis group, the scores of PASI of patients decreased after 12\u00a0weeks of Optimized Yinxieling treating. The metabolic variations visualized not only in the healthy group and psoriasis group, but also in the psoriasis group before and after Optimized Yinxieling treatment, demonstrated that the metabolic characteristics of the two groups were significantly different. The optimized complex structure of the target proteins from Protein Data Bank was analyzed by software package Discovery Studio. With docking score of original inhibitor and the receptor as the threshold values, two compounds from Chinese medicinal chemical database were predicted to have good interactions with the target proteins. The Metabolomics technique combining molecular docking analysis enhanced our current understanding of the metabolic response to Blood Stasis Syndrome of Psoriasis and the action mechanism of Optimized Yinxieling.

     "abstract": "A decade of successful results indicates that systems biology is the appropriate approach to investigate the regulation of complex biochemical networks involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. It becomes mandatory when dealing with highly interconnected biochemical networks, composed of hundreds of compounds, or when networks are enriched in non-linear motifs like feedback and feedforward loops. An emerging dilemma is to conciliate models of massive networks and the adequate description of non-linear dynamics in a suitable modeling framework. Boolean networks are an ideal representation of massive networks that are humble in terms of computational complexity and data demand. However, they are inappropriate when dealing with nested feedback/feedforward loops, structural motifs common in biochemical networks. On the other hand, models of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) cope well with these loops, but they require enormous amounts of quantitative data for a full characterization of the model. Here we propose hybrid models, composed of ODE and logical sub-modules, as a strategy to handle large scale, non-linear biochemical networks that include transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. We illustrate the construction of this kind of models using as example a regulatory network centered on E2F1, a transcription factor involved in cancer. The hybrid modeling approach proposed is a good compromise between quantitative/qualitative accuracy and scalability when considering large biochemical networks with a small highly interconnected core, and module of transcriptionally regulated genes that are not part of critical regulatory loops.

     "abstract": "Data processing, management and visualization are central and critical components of a state of the art high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics experiment, and are often some of the most time-consuming steps, especially for labs without much bioinformatics support. The growing interest in the field of proteomics has triggered an increase in the development of new software libraries, including freely available and open-source software. From database search analysis to post-processing of the identification results, even though the objectives of these libraries and packages can vary significantly, they usually share a number of features. Common use cases include the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines output files, and the visualization of MS-related information (including mass spectra and chromatograms). In this review, we provide an overview of the existing software libraries, open-source frameworks and also, we give information on some of the freely available applications which make use of them.

     "abstract": "The UniCarb-DB database is an emerging public glycomics data repository, containing over 500 tandem mass spectra (as of March 2013) of glycans released from glycoproteins. A major challenge in glycomics research is to provide and maintain high-quality datasets that will offer the necessary diversity to support the development of accurate bioinformatics tools for data deposition and analysis. The role of UniCarb-DB, as an archival database, is to provide the glycomics community with open-access to a comprehensive LC MS/MS library of N- and O- linked glycans released from glycoproteins that have been annotated with glycosidic and cross-ring fragmentation ions, retention times, and associated experimental metadata descriptions. Here, we introduce the UniCarb-DB data submission pipeline and its practical application to construct a library of LC\u2013MS/MS glycan standards that forms part of this database. In this context, an independent consortium of three laboratories was established to analyze the same 23 commercially available oligosaccharide standards, all by using graphitized carbon-liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization (ESI) ion trap mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode. A dot product score was calculated for each spectrum in the three sets of data as a measure of the comparability that is necessary for use of such a collection in library-based spectral matching and glycan structural identification. The effects of charge state, de-isotoping and threshold levels on the quality of the input data are shown. The provision of well-characterized oligosaccharide fragmentation data provides the opportunity to identify determinants of specific glycan structures, and will contribute to the confidence level of algorithms that assign glycan structures to experimental MS/MS spectra.

     "abstract": "3D imaging has a significant impact on many challenges in life sciences, because biology is a 3-dimensional phenomenon. Current 3D imaging-technologies (various types MRI, PET, SPECT) are labeled, i.e. they trace the localization of a specific compound in the body. In contrast, 3D MALDI mass spectrometry-imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a label-free method imaging the spatial distribution of molecular compounds. It complements 3D imaging labeled methods, immunohistochemistry, and genetics-based methods. However, 3D MALDI-MSI cannot tap its full potential due to the lack of statistical methods for analysis and interpretation of large and complex 3D datasets. To overcome this, we established a complete and robust 3D MALDI-MSI pipeline combined with efficient computational data analysis methods for 3D edge preserving image denoising, 3D spatial segmentation as well as finding colocalized m/z values, which will be reviewed here in detail.Furthermore, we explain, why the integration and correlation of the MALDI imaging data with other imaging modalities allows to enhance the interpretation of the molecular data and provides visualization of molecular patterns that may otherwise not be apparent.Therefore, a 3D data acquisition workflow is described generating a set of 3 different dimensional images representing the same anatomies. First, an in-vitro MRI measurement is performed which results in a three-dimensional image modality representing the 3D structure of the measured object. After sectioning the 3D object into N consecutive slices, all N slices are scanned using an optical digital scanner, enabling for performing the MS measurements. Scanning the individual sections results into low-resolution images, which define the base coordinate system for the whole pipeline. The scanned images conclude the information from the spatial (MRI) and the mass spectrometric (MALDI-MSI) dimension and are used for the spatial three-dimensional reconstruction of the object performed by image registration techniques. Different strategies for automatic serial image registration applied to MS datasets are outlined in detail. The third image modality is histology driven, i.e. a digital scan of the histological stained slices in high-resolution. After fusion of reconstructed scan images and MRI the slice-related coordinates of the mass spectra can be propagated into 3D-space. After image registration of scan images and histological stained images, the anatomical information from histology is fused with the mass spectra from MALDI-MSI. As a result of the described pipeline we have a set of 3 dimensional images representing the same anatomies, i.e. the reconstructed slice scans, the spectral images as well as corresponding clustering results, and the acquired MRI.Great emphasis is put on the fact that the co-registered MRI providing anatomical details improves the interpretation of 3D MALDI images. The ability to relate mass spectrometry derived molecular information with in vivo and in vitro imaging has potentially important implications.

     "abstract": "The spatial organisation of the chromosomes in the nucleus is influenced by chromatin regions binding to the nucleic lamina, i.e., the inner part of the nucleic envelope. To investigate the architecture of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus, it is thus of high interest to detect such chromatin segments. This goal can be achieved by considering the fibrous protein Lamin B as a surrogate, since regions of high abundance of Lamin B can indicate chromatin segments attached to the nucleic lamina.We analyse ChIP-Seq (Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) data from an experiment that is designed to record Lamin B abundance. We introduce a Bayesian segmentation procedure in which a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used for inference about the desired segmentation. The procedure is based on a Bayesian hierarchical model. Inference allows the distinction between regions of high versus low levels of Lamin B, and therefore, gives an insight into the binding of the chromatin to the nucleic envelope. An implementation of this approach is available in the statistical software environment R. This article is part of a special issue entitled: Computational proteomics in the post-identification era.

     "abstract": "Technical advances to analyze biological markers have generated a plethora of promising new marker candidates for early detection of cancer. However, in subsequent analyses only few could be successfully validated as being predictive, clinically useful, or effective. This failure is partially due to rapid publication of results that were detected in early stages of biomarker research. Methodological considerations are a major concern when carrying out molecular epidemiological studies of diagnostic markers to avoid errors that increase the potential for bias. Although guidelines for conducting studies and reporting of results have been published to improve the quality of marker studies, their planning and execution still need to be improved. We will discuss different sources of bias in study design, handling of specimens, and statistical analysis to illustrate possible pitfalls associated with marker research, and present legal, ethical, and technical considerations associated with storage and handling of specimens. This article presents a guide to epidemiological standards in marker research using bladder cancer as an example. Because of the possibility to detect early cancer stages due to leakage of molecular markers from the target organ or exfoliation of tumor cells into the urine, bladder cancer is particularly useful to study diagnostic markers. To improve the overall quality of marker research, future developments should focus on networks of studies and tissue banks according to uniform legal, ethical, methodological, and technical standards.

     "abstract": "The plasma fibrin-stabilizing factor (pFXIII) function is to maintain a hemostasis by the fibrin clot stabilization. The conversion of pFXIII to the active form of the enzyme (FXIII\u0430) is a multistage process. Ozone-induced oxidation of pFXIII has been investigated at different stages of its enzyme activation. The biochemical results point to a decrease of an enzymatic activity of FXIII\u0430 depending largely on the stage of the pFXIII conversion into FXIII\u0430 at which oxidation was carried out. UV-, FTIR- and Raman spectroscopy demonstrated that chemical transformation of cyclic, NH, SH and S\u2013S groups mainly determines the oxidation of amino acid residues of pFXIII polypeptide chains. Conversion of pFXIII to FXIIIa proved to increase protein sensitivity to oxidation in the order: pFXIII\u00a0<\u00a0pFXIII activated by thrombin\u00a0<\u00a0pFXIII in the presence of calcium ions\u00a0<\u00a0FXIIIa. The dynamic light scattering data indicate that the three-dimensional structure of pFXIII becomes loosened due to oxidative modification. ESR spectroscopy data also point to conformational changes of the fibrin-stabilizing factor under oxidation. Taking into account these new findings it seems reasonable to assume that the inhibitory/carrier FXIII-B subunits can serve as scavengers of ROS. Hypothetically, this mechanism could help to protect the key amino acid residues of the FXIII-A subunits responsible for the enzymatic function of FXIIIa.",

We examined the effects of ultrasonication on the fibrils of amyloid \u03b2(1\u201340) as well as on monomers. Ultrasonic pulses accelerated spontaneous fibrillation when the peptide concentration was above 1\u00a0\u03bcM. On the other hand, ultrasonic pulses accelerated the depolymerization of fibrils into monomers at 1\u00a0\u03bcM. These results indicate that, although amyloid fibrillation is a reversible process determined by thermodynamic stability, kinetically trapped supersaturation and physical difficulty of dissolving rigid fibrils prevent the smooth phase transitions.

     "abstract": "Development of extracellular plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is related to aggregation of amyloid peptides. The A\u03b2-42 peptide is the most aggregation prone species, and some missense mutant forms increase this aggregation ability. Due to its poor solubility as monomer in aqueous solutions, A\u03b2-42 conformational transitions in water have been largely investigated by molecular dynamics. Here we report an all-atom molecular dynamics analysis of the A\u03b2-42 peptide in aqueous environment using as starting conformation a structure obtained in an isotropic, low-polarity medium, representing a plausible model for the membrane-bound species. While previous studies commonly show that A\u03b2-42 is largely unstructured in aqueous solution, here we report that this peptide can adopt partially folded structures. Importance of ionic strength has been also investigated, showing that at physiological ionic strength condition a loop stabilizing electrostatic interaction involving Lys28 builds up. In addition, besides stable \u03b1-helix structures, we observe the appearance of 310 helix, similar to what was reported experimentally for the A\u03b2-40 species. The effect of E22Q (Dutch) mutation in high ionic strength condition has been explored. We show that this mutation has a dramatic impact on the A\u03b2-42 structure. Instead of a partially folded, but extended, conformation obtained with the wild type, the E22Q assumes a two-helix collapsed one due to the clustering of hydrophobic residues.",

Conformational analysis using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of Pseudomonas alcaligenes lipase (PAL) indicated that stronger steric exclusion and structural rigidity facilitated diastereopreference. A cysteine (Cys) residue was introduced using site-directed mutagenesis to construct variant A272C. The modifier 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was then reacted with the introduced Cys residue to provide stronger steric exclusion and structural rigidity. The modification was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Diastereopreference was improved significantly. The diastereomeric excess (dep) of l-menthol increased from 35% with wild type PAL to 90% with A272C-DTNB modified PAL when the conversion ratio of l-menthyl propionate was nearly 100%. Conformation and kinetic parameter analysis showed that A272C-DTNB modified PAL exhibited stronger steric exclusion and increased structural rigidity around the modification site that inhibited the hydrolysis of non-targeted substrates. The combination of site-directed mutagenesis and chemical modification could be an effective method to alter protein properties and enhance diastereopreference through the combined effect of steric exclusion and structural rigidity.",

     "abstract": "Conformational diseases often show defective protein folding efficiency in vivo upon mutation, affecting protein properties such as thermodynamic stability and folding/unfolding/misfolding kinetics as well as the interactions of the protein with the protein homeostasis network. Human phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (hPGK1) deficiency is a rare inherited disease caused by mutations in hPGK1 that lead to loss-of-function. This disease offers an excellent opportunity to explore the complex relationships between protein stability and dynamics because of the different unfolding mechanisms displayed towards chemical and thermal denaturation. This work explores these relationships using two thermostable mutants (p.E252A and p.T378P) causing hPGK1 deficiency and WT hPGK1 using proteolysis and chemical denaturation. p.T378P is degraded ~\u00a030-fold faster at low protease concentrations (here, the proteolysis step is rate-limiting) and ~\u00a03-fold faster at high protease concentrations (where unfolding kinetics is rate-limiting) than WT and p.E252A, indicating that p.T378P is thermodynamically and kinetically destabilized. Urea denaturation studies support the decrease in thermodynamic stability and folding cooperativity for p.T378P, as well as changes in folding/unfolding kinetics. The present study reveals changes in the folding landscape of hPGK1 upon mutation that may affect protein folding efficiency and stability in vivo, also suggesting that native state stabilizers and protein homeostasis modulators may help to correct folding defects in hPGK1 deficiency. Moreover, detailed kinetic proteolysis studies are shown to be powerful and simple tools to provide deep insight into mutational effects on protein folding and stability in conformational diseases.",

With the exception of fluorescence and UV\u2013vis binding experiments with its cofactor flavin mononucleotide (FMN), apo-Fld is almost completely uncharacterized in Escherichia coli.

     "abstract": "Schistosoma mansoni NAD+ catabolizing enzyme (SmNACE), a distant homolog of mammalian CD38, shows significant structural and functional analogy to the members of the CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase family. The hallmark of SmNACE is the lack of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity that might be ascribed to subtle changes in its active site. To better characterize the residues of the active site we determined the kinetic parameters of nine mutants encompassing three acidic residues: (i) the putative catalytic residue Glu202 and (ii) two acidic residues within the \u2018signature\u2019 region (the conserved Glu124 and the downstream Asp133), (iii) Ser169, a strictly conserved polar residue and (iv) two aromatic residues (His103 and Trp165). We established the very important role of Glu202 and of the hydrophobic domains overwhelmingly in the efficiency of the nicotinamide\u2013ribosyl bond cleavage step. We also demonstrated that in sharp contrast with mammalian CD38, the \u2018signature\u2019 Glu124 is as critical as Glu202 for catalysis by the parasite enzyme. The different environments of the two Glu residues in the crystal structure of CD38 and in the homology model of SmNACE could explain such functional discrepancies. Mutagenesis data and 3D structures also indicated the importance of aromatic residues, especially His103, in the stabilization of the reaction intermediate as well as in the selection of its conformation suitable for cyclization to cyclic ADP-ribose. Finally, we showed that inhibition of SmNACE by the natural product cyanidin requires the integrity of Glu202 and Glu124, but not of His103 and Trp165, hence suggesting different recognition modes for substrate and inhibitor.",

Chemical carcinogenesis is strongly associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The goal of this study was to detect thiol proteins that are sensitive to ROS generated during diethylnitrosamine (DEN) metabolism in the rat liver. DEN has been widely used to induce experimental hepatocellular carcinoma. We used modified redox-differential gel electrophoresis (redox-DIGE method) and mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF/TOF to identify differential oxidation protein profiles associated with carcinogen exposure. Our analysis revealed a time-dependent increase in the number of oxidized thiol proteins after carcinogen treatment; some of these proteins have antioxidant activity, including thioredoxin, peroxirredoxin 2, peroxiredoxin 6 and glutathione S-transferase alpha-3. According to functional classifications, the identified proteins in our study included chaperones, oxidoreductases, activity isomerases, hydrolases and other protein-binding partners. This study demonstrates that oxidative stress generated by DEN tends to increase gradually through DEN metabolism, causes time-dependent necrosis in the liver and has an oxidative effect on thiol proteins, thereby increasing the number of oxidized thiol proteins. Furthermore, these events occurred during the hepatocarcinogenesis initiation period.",

The crystal structure of wild type (WT) E. coli CS, determined by us previously, has no substrates bound, and part of the active site is in a highly mobile region that is shifted from the position needed for catalysis. The CS of Acetobacter aceti has a similar structure, but has been successfully crystallized with bound substrates: both oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and an analog of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA). We engineered a variant of E. coli CS wherein five amino acids in the mobile region have been replaced by those in the A. aceti sequence. The purified enzyme shows unusual kinetics with a low affinity for both substrates. Although the crystal structure without ligands is very similar to that of the WT enzyme (except in the mutated region), complexes are formed with both substrates and the allosteric inhibitor NADH. The complex with OAA in the active site identifies a novel OAA-binding residue, Arg306, which has no functional counterpart in other known CS-OAA complexes. This structure may represent an intermediate in a multi-step substrate binding process where Arg306 changes roles from OAA binding to AcCoA binding. The second complex has the substrate analog, S-carboxymethyl-coenzyme A, in the allosteric NADH-binding site and the AcCoA site is not formed. Additional CS variants unable to bind adenylates at the allosteric site show that this second complex is not a factor in positive allosteric activation of AcCoA binding.",

However, the dynamic interplay between the enzyme and the DNA remains unclear. In this study, we performed an extensive replica exchange with flexible tempering (REFT) molecular dynamics simulation of the ternary replicating complex of the archaeal family B DNA polymerase from the thermophile Thermococcus gorgonarius, right before the chemical step. The convoluted dynamics of the enzyme are reducible to rigid-body motions of six subdomains. Upon binding to the enzyme, the DNA double helix conformation changes from a twisted state to a partially untwisted state. The twisted state displays strong bending motion, whereby the DNA oscillates between a straight and a bent conformation. The dynamics of double-stranded DNA are strongly correlated with rotations of the thumb toward the palm, which suggests an assisting role of the enzyme during DNA translocation. In the complex, the primer\u2013template duplex displays increased preference for the B-DNA conformation at the n\u00a0\u2212\u00a02 and n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 dinucleotide steps.

In this work we studied the conformation of the Chaperone Binding Domain of the effector named Salmonella Outer protein B (SopB) alone and in complex with its cognate chaperone SigE by a combination of biochemical, biophysical and structural approaches. Our results show that the N-terminus part of SopB is mainly composed by \u03b1-helices and unfolded regions whose organization/stabilization depends on their interaction with the different partners. This suggests that the partially unfolded state of this N-terminal region, which confers the adaptability of the effector to bind very different partners during the infection cycle, allows the bacteria to modulate numerous host cells functions limiting the number of translocated effectors.",

During unfolding studies on human biliverdin-IX\u03b1 reductase it was discovered that the enzyme is activated at low concentrations of urea. Under standard assay conditions the native enzyme displays pronounced substrate inhibition with biliverdin as variable substrate; however in the presence of 3\u00a0M urea, the substrate inhibition is abolished and the enzyme exhibits Michaelian kinetics. When the initial rate kinetics with NADPH as variable substrate are conducted in 3\u00a0M urea, the Vmax is increased 11-fold to 1.8\u00a0\u03bcmol/min/mg and the apparent Km for biliverdin increases from 1 to 3\u00a0\u03bcM. We report the existence of two kinetically distinct folded intermediates between the native and unfolded forms. When the period of incubation with urea was varied prior to measuring enzyme activity, the apparent Vmax was shown to decay to half that seen at zero time with a half life of 5.8\u00a0minutes, while the apparent Km for NADPH remains constant at approximately 5\u00a0\u03bcM. With NADH as cofactor the half life of the activated (A) form was 2.9\u00a0minutes, and this form decays in 3\u00a0M urea to a less active (LA) form. The apparent Km for NADH increases from 0.33\u00a0mM to 2\u00a0mM for the A and LA forms.

However, the precise molecular basis for interaction with substrate or antitoxin and the mechanism of mRNA cleavage remain unclear.

Through the combined approach of structural analysis and structural homology search, the amino acids involved in mRNase active site were monitored and the reorientations of different residues were discussed in detail. In the mRNase active site of HP0894 toxin, His84 acts as a catalytic residue and reorients itself to exhibit this type of activity, acting as a general acid in an acid\u2013base catalysis reaction, while His47 and His60 stabilize the transition state.

This work shows that rat CSTB is an unstable protein that undergoes structural changes following the interaction with a chaperone, either prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Both the prokaryotic DnaK and eukaryotic HSP70 promote CSTB polymerization. Denaturated CSTB is polymerized by the chaperone alone. Native CSTB monomers are more stable than denatured monomers and require Cu2\u00a0+ for chaperone-dependent polymerization. Cu2\u00a0+ interacts with at least two conserved histidines, at positions 72 and 95 modifying the structure of native monomeric CSTB. Subsequently, CSTB becomes unstable and readily responds to the addition of DnaK or HSP70, generating polymers. This reaction depends strictly on the presence of this divalent metal ion and on the presence of one cysteine in the protein chain. The cysteine deletion mutant does not polymerize. We propose that Cu2\u00a0+ modifies the redox environment of the protein, allowing the oxidation of the cysteine residue of CSTB that triggers polymerization. These polymers are sensitive to reducing agents while polymers obtained from denatured CSTB monomers are DTT resistant. We propose that the Cu2\u00a0+/HSP70 dependent polymers are physiological and functional in eukaryotic cells. Furthermore, while monomeric CSTB has anti-protease function, it seems likely that polymeric CSTB fulfils different function(s).",

Mg-ATPase rate of myosin subfragment-1 (S1) is increased by 4-fold by 0.3\u00a0M 1,3-diethylurea (DEU), but it is unaffected by urea, thiourea, and 1,3-dimethylurea at \u2264\u00a01\u00a0M concentration. Thus, we further examine the effects of DEU in comparison to those of urea as reference. In in vitro motility assay, we find that in the presence of 0.3\u00a0M DEU, the sliding speeds of actin filaments driven by myosin and heavy meromyosin (HMM) are significantly decreased to 1/16 and 1/6.6, respectively, compared with the controls. However, the measurement of the actin-activated ATPase activity of HMM shows that the maximal rate, Vmax, is almost unchanged with DEU. Thus, the myosin-driven sliding motility of actin filaments is significantly impeded in the presence of 0.3\u00a0M DEU, whereas the cyclic interaction of myosin with F-actin occurs during the ATP turnover, the rate of which is close to that without DEU. In contrast to DEU, 0.3\u00a0M urea exhibits only modest effects on both actin-activated ATPase and sliding motility of actomyosin. Thus, DEU has the effect of uncoupling the sliding motility of actomyosin from its ATP turnover.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify proteins with aberrant expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), and elucidate their clinical utilities. The protein expression profiles of primary ccRCC tumor tissues and neighboring non-tumor tissues were obtained from 9 patients by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Comparative analysis of 3771 protein spots led to the identification of 73 proteins that were expressed at aberrant levels in tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. Among these 73 proteins, we further focused on N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 protein (NDRG1). NDRG1 expression is regulated by members of myc family as well as by p53, HIF1A, and SGK1. The biological and clinical significance of NDRG1 is controversial for various malignancies and no detailed studies on NDRG1 have been reported in ccRCC until our study. For the 82 newly enrolled ccRCC patients, immunohistochemical analysis revealed a significant association between nuclear NDRG1 and favorable prognosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated the role of NDRG1 as an independent factor of progression-free survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Subsequent in vitro gene suppression assay demonstrated that NDRG1 silencing significantly enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of RCC cells. The cytotoxic effects of NDRG1 up-regulation induced by an iron chelator were also confirmed. These findings suggest that nuclear NDRG1 has tumor suppressive effects, and the NDRG1 expression may have clinical values in ccRCC. Nuclear NDRG1 may provide additional insights on molecular backgrounds of ccRCC progression, and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategy.",

     "abstract": "Protein crystals form in supersaturated solutions via a nucleation and growth mechanism. The amyloid fibrils of denatured proteins also form via a nucleation and growth mechanism. This similarity suggests that, although protein crystals and amyloid fibrils are distinct in their morphologies, both processes can be controlled in a similar manner. It has been established that ultrasonication markedly accelerates the formation of amyloid fibrils and simultaneously breaks them down into fragmented fibrils. In this study, we investigated the effects of ultrasonication on the crystallization of hen egg white lysozyme and glucose isomerase from Streptomyces rubiginosus. Protein crystallization was monitored by light scattering, tryptophan fluorescence, and light transmittance. Repeated ultrasonic irradiations caused the crystallization of lysozyme and glucose isomerase after cycles of irradiations. The size of the ultrasonication-induced crystals was small and homogeneous, and their numbers were larger than those obtained under quiescent conditions. Switching off ultrasonic irradiation when light scattering or tryptophan fluorescence began to change resulted in the formation of larger crystals due to the suppression of the further nucleation and fractures in preformed crystals. The results indicate that protein crystallization and amyloid fibrillation are explained on the basis of a common phase diagram in which ultrasonication accelerates the formation of crystals or crystal-like amyloid fibrils as well as fragmentation of preformed crystals or fibrils.",

The enzyme displays a dimer\u2013tetramer equilibrium and NADPH (but not NADP) reduces the rate of approach to equilibrium, while 6PG is able to antagonize the NADPH effect. The different behaviour of the two forms of coenzyme appears to be related to the differences in \u0394Cp, with NADP binding \u0394Cp closer to what is expected of crystallographic structures, while NADPH \u0394Cp is three times larger.

We have analyzed and compared the sequences of three experimental exoproteomes of Leishmania promastigotes from different species to determine their specific features and to identify new candidate proteins involved in interactions of Leishmania with the host. The exoproteomes differ from the proteomes by a decrease in the average molecular weight per protein, in disordered amino acid residues and in basic proteins. The exoproteome of the visceral species is significantly enriched in sites predicted to be phosphorylated as well as in features frequently associated with molecular interactions (intrinsic disorder, number of disordered binding regions per protein, interaction and/or trafficking motifs) compared to the other species. The visceral species might thus have a larger interaction repertoire with the host than the other species. Less than 10% of the exoproteomes contain heparin-binding and RGD sequences, and ~\u00a030% the host targeting signal RXLXE/D/Q. These latter proteins might thus be exported inside the host cell during the intracellular stage of the infection. Furthermore we have identified nine protein families conserved in the three exoproteomes with specific combinations of Pfam domains and selected eleven proteins containing at least three interaction and/or trafficking motifs including two splicing factors, phosphomannomutase, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, the paraflagellar rod protein-1D and a putative helicase. Their role in host\u2013Leishmania interactions warrants further investigation but the putative ATP-dependent DEAD/H RNA helicase, which contains numerous interaction motifs, a host targeting signal and two disordered regions, is a very promising candidate.",

     "abstract": "NADPH-dependent glyoxylate reductases from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtGLYR) convert both glyoxylate and succinic semialdehyde into their corresponding hydroxyacid equivalents. The primary sequence of cytosolic AtGLYR1 reveals several sequence elements that are consistent with the \u03b2-HAD (\u03b2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase) protein family, whose members include 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, tartronate semialdehyde reductase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Here, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to identify catalytically important amino acid residues for glyoxylate reduction in AtGLYR1. Kinetic studies and binding assays established that Lys170 is essential for catalysis, Phe231, Asp239, Ser121 and Thr95 are more important in substrate binding than in catalysis, and Asn174 is more important in catalysis. The low activity of the mutant enzymes precluded kinetic studies with succinic semialdehyde. The crystal structure of AtGLYR1 in the absence of substrate was solved to 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 by molecular replacement using a previously unrecognized member of the \u03b2-HAD family, cytokine-like nuclear factor, thereby enabling the 3-D structure of the protein to be modeled with substrate and co-factor. Structural alignment of AtGLYR1 with \u03b2-HAD family members provided support for the essentiality of Lys170, Phe173, Asp239, Ser121, Asn174 and Thr95 in the active site and preliminary support for an acid/base catalytic mechanism involving Lys170 as the general acid and a conserved active-site water molecule. This information established that AtGLYR1 is a member of the \u03b2-HAD protein family. Sequence and activity comparisons indicated that AtGLYR1 and the plastidial AtGLYR2 possess structural features that are absent in Arabidopsis hydroxypyruvate reductases and probably account for their stronger preference for glyoxylate over hydroxypyruvate.",

They mediate spatial and temporal recruitment of effector proteins to distinct cellular compartments through GTP-induced changes in their conformation. Despite numerous structural studies, the molecular basis for Rab/effector specificity and subsequent biological activity remains poorly understood. Rab25, also known as Rab11c, which is epithelial-specific, has been heavily implicated in ovarian cancer development and independently appears to act as a tumour suppressor in the context of a distinct subset of carcinomas. Here, we show that Rab25 associates with FIP2 and can recruit this effector protein to endosomal membranes. We report the crystal structure of Rab25 in complex with the C-terminal region of FIP2, which consists of a central dimeric FIP2 coiled-coil that mediates a heterotetrameric Rab25-(FIP2)2-Rab25 complex. Thermodynamic analyses show that, despite a relatively conserved interface, FIP2 binds to Rab25 with an approximate 3-fold weaker affinity than to Rab11a. Reduced affinity is mainly associated with lower enthalpic gains for Rab25:FIP2 complex formation, and can be attributed to subtle differences in the conformations of switch 1 and switch 2. These cellular, structural and thermodynamic studies provide insight into the Rab11/Rab25 subfamily of small GTPases that regulate endosomal trafficking pathways in eukaryotes.",

Interestingly, the genome of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans contains three expressed genes predicted to encode OAS-TL orthologs (cysl-1\u2013cysl-3), and a related pseudogene (cysl-4); these genes play different roles in resistance to hypoxia, hydrogen sulfide and cyanide. To get an insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms we purified the three recombinant worm OAS-TL proteins, and we determined their enzymatic activities, substrate binding affinities, quaternary structures and the conformations of their active site shapes. We show that the nematode OAS-TL orthologs can bind O-acetylserine and catalyze the canonical reaction although this ligand may more likely serve as a competitive inhibitor to natural substrates instead of being a substrate for sulfur assimilation. In addition, we propose that S-sulfocysteine may be a novel endogenous substrate for these proteins. However, we observed that the three OAS-TL proteins are conformationally different and exhibit distinct substrate specificity. Based on the available evidences we propose the following model: CYSL-1 interacts with EGL-9 and activates HIF-1 that upregulates expression of genes detoxifying sulfide and cyanide, the CYSL-2 acts as a cyanoalanine synthase in the cyanide detoxification pathway and simultaneously produces hydrogen sulfide, while the role of CYSL-3 remains unclear although it exhibits sulfhydrylase activity in vitro.

The mutation E104D is the most frequent cause of the disease. Although the wild type and mutant exhibit similar kinetic parameters, it has been shown that the E104D substitution induces perturbation of an interfacial water network that, in turn, reduces the association constant between subunits promoting enzyme inactivation. To gain further insight into the effects of the mutation on the structure, stability and function of the enzyme, we measured the sensitivity of recombinant E104D mutant and wild type HsTIM to limited proteolysis. The mutation increases the susceptibility to proteolysis as consequence of the loss of rigidity of its overall 3-D structure. Unexpectedly, it was observed that proteolysis of wild type HsTIM generated two different stable nicked dimers. One was formed in relatively short times of incubation with proteinase K; as shown by spectrometric and crystallographic data, it corresponded to a dimer containing a nicked monomer and an intact monomer. The formation of the other nicked species requires relatively long incubation times with proteinase K and corresponds to a dimer with two clipped subunits. The first species retains 50% of the original activity, whereas the second species is inactive. Collectively, we found that the E104D mutant is highly susceptible to proteolysis, which in all likelihood contributes to the pathogenesis of enzymopathy.

There are seven serologically distinctive types of BoNTs and many subtypes within a serotype have been identified. BoNT/A5 is a recently discovered subtype of type A botulinum neurotoxin which possesses a very high degree of sequence similarity and identity to the well-studied A1 subtype. In the present study, we examined the endopeptidase activity of these two BoNT/A subtypes and our results revealed significant differences in substrate binding and cleavage efficiency between subtype A5 and A1. Distinctive hydrolysis efficiency was observed between the two toxins during cleavage of the native substrate SNAP-25 versus a shortened peptide mimic. N-terminal truncation studies demonstrated that a key region of the SNAP-25, including the amino acid residues at 151 through 154 located in the remote binding region of the substrate, contributed to the differential catalytic properties between A1 and A5. Elevated binding affinity of the peptide substrate resulted from including these important residues and enhanced BoNT/A5's hydrolysis efficiency. In addition, mutations of these amino acid residues affect the proteolytic performance of the two toxins in different ways. This study provides a better understanding of the biological activity of these toxins, their performance characteristics in the Endopep-MS assay to detect BoNT in clinical samples and foods, and is useful for the development of peptide substrates.",

However, the combination of neutral residues both at positions 97 and 107 was not acceptable even with the pair at 60\u201362 intact. Reversal of charge polarity could partially restore the interaction. The residues including K90, R101 and R103 with potential to form H-bonds to ATP are conserved throughout across numerous orthologs of PII but when mutated to Alanine, they did not show significant differences in the total free energy change of the interaction as examined through isothermal titration calorimetry. The ATP binding pattern showed anti-cooperativity using three-site binding model. We observed compensatory effect in enthalpy and entropy changes and these may represent structural adjustments to accommodate ATP in the cavity even in absence of some interactions to perform the requisite function. In this respect these small differences between the PII orthologs may have evolved to suite species specific physiological niches.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are important mediators of the cellular adaptive response during acute hypoxia. The role of HIF-1 and HIF-2 during prolonged periods of hypoxia, i.e. chronic hypoxia is less defined. Therefore, we used human THP-1 macrophages with a knockdown of either HIF-1\u03b1, HIF-2\u03b1, or both HIF\u03b1-subunits, incubated them for several days under hypoxia (1% O2), and analyzed responses to hypoxia using 2D-DIGE coupled to MS/MS-analysis. Chronic hypoxia was defined as a time point when the early but transient accumulation of HIF\u03b1-subunits and mRNA expression of classical HIF target genes returned towards basal levels, with a new steady state that was constant from 72\u00a0h onwards. From roughly 800 spots, that were regulated comparing normoxia to chronic hypoxia, about 100 proteins were unambiguously assigned during MS/MS-analysis. Interestingly, a number of glycolytic proteins were up-regulated, while a number of inner mitochondrial membrane proteins were down-regulated independently of HIF-1\u03b1 or HIF-2\u03b1. Chronic hypoxic conditions depleted the mitochondrial mass by autophagy, which occurred independently of HIF proteins. Macrophages tolerate periods of chronic hypoxia very well and adaptive responses occur, at least in part, independently of HIF-1\u03b1 and/or HIF-2\u03b1 and comprise mitophagy as a pathway of particular importance.",

Dysregulation of the secretome of obesity-associated enlarged WAT may lead to obesity-related disorders. This can be caused by hypoxia as a result of poorly vascularized WAT. The effect of hypoxia on the secretome of human (pre)adipocytes is largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the effect of CoCl2, a hypoxia mimetic, on the secretome of human SGBS (pre)adipocytes by a proteomics approach combined with bioinformatic analysis. In addition, regulation of protein secretion was examined by protein turnover experiments. As such, secretome changes were particularly associated with protein down-regulation and extracellular matrix protein dysregulation. The observed up-regulation of collagens in adipocytes may be essential for cell survival while down-regulation of collagens in preadipocytes may indicate a disturbed differentiation process. These CoCl2-induced changes reflect WAT dysfunction that ultimately may lead to obesity-associated complications. In addition, 9 novel adipocyte secreted proteins were identified from which 6 were regulated by CoCl2. Mass spectrometry data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000162.",

Catalytically inactive phospholipases A2-like (Lys49-PLA2s) are among the main components from Bothrops genus venoms and are capable of causing drastic myonecrosis. Several studies have shown that the C-terminal region of these toxins, which includes a variable combination of positively charged and hydrophobic residues, is responsible for their activity. In this work we describe the crystal structures of two Lys49-PLA2s (BbTX-II and MTX-II) from B. brazili venom and a comprehensive structural comparison with several Lys49-PLA2s. Based on these results, two independent sites of interaction were identified between protein and membrane which leads to the proposition of a new myotoxic mechanism for bothropic Lys49-PLA2s composed of five different steps. This proposition is able to fully explain the action of these toxins and may be useful to develop efficient inhibitors to complement the conventional antivenom administration.",

     "abstract": "To investigate the contribution of solvent environments to the enzymatic function of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the salt-, pH-, and pressure-dependence of the enzymatic function of the wild-type protein were compared with those of the active-site mutant D27E in relation to their structure and stability. The salt concentration-dependence of enzymatic activity indicated that inorganic cations bound to and inhibited the activity of wild-type DHFR at neutral pH. The BaCl2 concentration-dependence of the 1H\u201315N HSQC spectra of the wild-type DHFR\u2013folate binary complex showed that the cation-binding site was located adjacent to the Met20 loop. The insensitivity of the D27E mutant to univalent cations, the decreased optimal pH for its enzymatic activity, and the increased Km and Kd values for its substrate dihydrofolate suggested that the substrate-binding cleft of the mutant was slightly opened to expose the active-site side chain to the solvent. The marginally increased fluorescence intensity and decreased volume change due to unfolding of the mutant also supported this structural change or the modified cavity and hydration. Surprisingly, the enzymatic activity of the mutant increased with pressurization up to 250\u00a0MPa together with negative activation volumes of \u2212\u00a04.0 or \u2212\u00a04.8\u00a0mL/mol, depending on the solvent system, while that of the wild-type was decreased and had positive activation volumes of 6.1 or 7.7\u00a0mL/mol. These results clearly indicate that the insertion of a single methylene at the active site could substantially change the enzymatic reaction mechanism of DHFR, and solvent environments play important roles in the function of this enzyme.",

The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains three different RuvB like proteins. Thus it has been of interest to explore why P. falciparum requires three RuvB like proteins and how these enzymes are biochemically regulated. In this study, we present the detailed biochemical characterization of PfRuvB2. The complex of PfRuvB3 was immunopurified and the presence of PfRuvB2 was confirmed. The in vitro interaction study shows that PfRuvB2 interacts only with PfRuvB3 but not with PfRuvB1. The recombinant as well as endogenous PfRuvB2 contains ATPase as well as weak DNA helicase activities. The presence of PfRuvB3 in the helicase reaction of PfRuvB2 increases the helicase activity significantly. Interestingly PfRuvB2/PfRuvB3 complex preferentially translocates and unwinds DNA in the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction. In vivo studies showed that PfRuvB2 is expressed in all the asexual intraerythrocytic developmental stages and localizes mainly in the nucleus during merozoite, ring and trophozoite stages while during schizont stage it relocalizes partially in the nucleus and partially towards cytoplasm. As PfRuvB3 is specific to intraerythrocytic mitosis so we interpret that PfPuvB3 interacts with PfRuvB2 during schizont/intraerythrocytic mitosis and acts as its modulator mainly for the appreciable helicase activity.",

     "abstract": "Hereditary mutations in the transforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) gene cause phenotypically distinct corneal dystrophies characterized by protein deposition in cornea. We show here that the Arg555Trp mutant of the fourth fasciclin 1 (FAS1-4) domain of the protein (TGFBIp/keratoepithelin/\u03b2ig-h3), associated with granular corneal dystrophy type 1, is significantly less susceptible to proteolysis by thermolysin and trypsin than the WT domain. High-resolution liquid-state NMR of the WT and Arg555Trp mutant FAS1-4 domains revealed very similar structures except for the region around position 555. The Arg555Trp substitution causes Trp555 to be buried in an otherwise empty hydrophobic cavity of the FAS1-4 domain. The first thermolysin cleavage in the core of the FAS1-4 domain occurs on the N-terminal side of Leu558 adjacent to the Arg555 mutation. MD simulations indicated that the C-terminal end of helix \u03b13\u2032 containing this cleavage site is less flexible in the mutant domain, explaining the observed proteolytic resistance. This structural change also alters the electrostatic properties, which may explain increased propensity of the mutant to aggregate in vitro with 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol. Based on our results we propose that the Arg555Trp mutation disrupts the normal degradation/turnover of corneal TGFBIp, leading to accumulation and increased propensity to aggregate through electrostatic interactions.",

Members of two divergent subfamilies of centrins were found in the aquatic fungus Blastocladiella emersonii, contrasting with the occurrence of only one member known for the better explored terrestrial fungi. BeCen1 shows greatest identity with human centrins HsCen1, HsCen2 and green algae centrin CrCenp, while BeCen3 records largest identity with human centrin HsCen3 and yeast centrin Cdc31p. Following the discovery of this unique feature, BeCen1 and BeCen3 centrins were produced to study whether these proteins had distinct features upon calcium binding. Circular dichroism showed opposite calcium binding effects on the \u03b1-helix arrangement of the secondary structure. The spectra indicated a decrease in \u03b1-helix signal for holo-BeCen1 contrasting with an increase for holo-BeCen3. In addition, only BeCen1 refolds after being de-natured. The fluorescence emission of the hydrophobic probe ANS increases for both proteins likely due to hydrophobic exposure, however, only BeCen1 presents a clear blue shift when calcium is added. ITC experiments identified four calcium binding sites for both proteins. In contrast to calcium binding to BeCen1, which is mainly endothermic, binding to BeCen3 is mainly exothermic. Light-scattering evidenced the formation of large particles in solution for BeCen1 and BeCen3 at temperatures above 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 40\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. Atomic force microscopy confirmed the presence of supramolecular structures, which differ in the compactness and branching degree. Binding of calcium leads to different structural changes in BeCen1 and BeCen3 and the thermodynamic characteristics of the interaction also differ.",

We sought a way to reduce their potent allergenicity in view of the development of immunotherapy for peanut allergy. Isoforms of conglutin were purified, reduced with dithiothreitol and subsequently alkylated with iodoacetamide. The effect of this modification was assessed on protein folding and IgE-binding. We found that all disulfide bridges were reduced and alkylated. As a result, the secondary structure lost \u03b1-helix and gained some \u03b2-structure content, and the tertiary structure stability was reduced. On a functional level, the modification led to a strongly decreased IgE-binding. Using conditions for limited reduction and alkylation, partially reduced and alkylated proteins were found with rearranged disulfide bridges and, in some cases, intermolecular cross-links were found. Peptide mass finger printing was applied to control progress of the modification reaction and to map novel disulfide bonds. There was no preference for the order in which disulfides were reduced, and disulfide rearrangement occurred in a non-specific way. Only minor differences in kinetics of reduction and alkylation were found between the different conglutin isoforms. We conclude that the peanut conglutins Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 can be chemically modified by reduction and alkylation, such that they substantially unfold and that their allergenic potency decreases.",

The results obtained show that the concentration of buffer as well as the presence and concentration of salt additives affects the protein partition behavior.

These changes can contribute to the acquisition and maintenance of the recognised hallmarks of cancer. In addition, evidence is emerging for a more sophisticated role for the tumour secretome in cancer, with significant implications for malignant disease progression. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of factors contributing to secretome alterations in cancer, including genetic mutations, microRNA-based regulation and the influence of the tumour microenvironment. The contribution of secreted factors in maintenance and function of cancer stem cells, and of tumour-derived factors in specification of a pre-metastatic niche are also discussed. Collectively, evidence from the current literature suggests that the tumour secretome, consisting of factors derived from cancer stem cells, non-stem cells and the surrounding stroma, plays a deterministic role in cancer progression, and may constitute a key therapeutic target in many cancers.

     "abstract": "Despite major improvements on the knowledge and clinical management, cancer is still a deadly disease. Novel biomarkers for better cancer detection, diagnosis and treatment prediction are urgently needed. Proteins secreted, shed or leaking from the cancer cell, collectively termed the cancer secretome, are promising biomarkers since they might be detectable in blood or other biofluids. Furthermore, the cancer secretome in part represents the tumor microenvironment that plays a key role in tumor promoting processes such as angiogenesis and invasion. The cancer secretome, sampled as conditioned medium from cell lines, tumor/tissue interstitial fluid or tumor proximal body fluids, can be studied comprehensively by nanoLC-MS/MS-based approaches. Here, we outline the importance of current cancer secretome research and describe the mass spectrometry-based analysis of the secretome. Further, we provide an overview of cancer secretome research with a focus on the three most common cancer types: lung, breast and colorectal cancer. We conclude that the cancer secretome research field is a young, but rapidly evolving research field. Up to now, the focus has mainly been on the discovery of novel promising secreted cancer biomarker proteins. An interesting finding that merits attention is that in cancer unconventional secretion, e.g. via vesicles, seems increased.

     "abstract": "Tumor interstitial fluid (TIF) is a proximal fluid that, in addition to the set of blood soluble phase-borne proteins, holds a subset of aberrantly externalized components, mainly proteins, released by tumor cells and tumor microenvironment through various mechanisms, which include classical secretion, non-classical secretion, secretion via exosomes and membrane protein shedding. Consequently, the interstitial aqueous phase of solid tumors is a highly promising resource for the discovery of molecules associated with pathological changes in tissues. Firstly, it allows one to delve deeper into the regulatory mechanisms and functions of secretion-related processes in tumor development. Secondly, the anomalous secretion of molecules that is innate to tumors and the tumor microenvironment, being associated with cancer progression, offers a valuable source for biomarker discovery and possible targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we provide an overview of the features of tumor-associated interstitial fluids, based on recent and updated information obtained mainly from our studies of breast cancer. Data from the study of interstitial fluids recovered from several other types of cancer are also discussed. This article is a part of a Special Issue entitled: The Updated Secretome.",

     "abstract": "The thyroid hormone, 3,3,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), modulates several physiological processes, including cellular growth, differentiation, metabolism and proliferation, via interactions with thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in the regulatory regions of target genes. Several intracellular and extracellular protein candidates are regulated by T3. Moreover, T3-regulated secreted proteins participate in physiological processes or cellular transformation. T3 has been employed as a marker in several disorders, such as cardiovascular disorder in chronic kidney disease, as well as diseases of the liver, immune system, endocrine hormone metabolism and coronary artery. Our group subsequently showed that T3 regulates several tumor-related secretory proteins, leading to cancer progression via alterations in extracellular matrix proteases and tumor-associated signaling pathways in hepatocellular carcinomas. Therefore, elucidation of T3/thyroid hormone receptor-regulated secretory proteins and their underlying mechanisms in cancers should facilitate the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This review provides a detailed summary on the known secretory proteins regulated by T3 and their physiological significance. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: An Updated Secretome.",

     "abstract": "Secreted proteins, collectively referred to as the secretome, were suggested as valuable biomarkers in disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, some secreted proteins from cell cultures are difficult to detect because of their intrinsically low abundance; they are frequently masked by the released proteins from lysed cells and the substantial amounts of serum proteins used in culture medium. The hollow fiber culture (HFC) system is a commercially available system composed of small fibers sealed in a cartridge shell; cells grow on the outside of the fiber. Recently, because this system can help cells grow at a high density, it has been developed and applied in a novel analytical platform for cell secretome collection in cancer biomarker discovery. This article focuses on the advantages of the HFC system, including the effectiveness of the system for collection of secretomes, and reviews the process of cell secretome collection by the HFC system and proteomic approaches to discover cancer biomarkers. The HFC system not only provides a high-density three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system to mimic tumor growth conditions in vivo but can also accommodate numerous cells in a small volume, allowing secreted proteins to be accumulated and concentrated. In addition, cell lysis rates can be greatly reduced, decreasing the amount of contamination by abundant cytosolic proteins from lysed cells. Therefore, the HFC system is useful for preparing a wide range of proteins from cell secretomes and provides an effective method for collecting higher amounts of secreted proteins from cancer cells.

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of mortality in Western populations. Growing evidence from human and rodent studies indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause regression of existing colon tumors and act as effective chemopreventive agents in sporadic colon tumor formation. Although much is known about the action of the NSAID sulindac, especially its role in inducing apoptosis, mechanisms underlying these effects is poorly understood. In previous secretome-based proteomic studies using 2D-DIGE/MS and cytokine arrays we identified over 150 proteins released from the CRC cell line LIM1215 whose expression levels were dysregulated by treatment with 1\u00a0mM sulindac over 16\u00a0h; many of these proteins are implicated in molecular and cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, angiogenesis and apoptosis (Ji et al., Proteomics Clin. Appl. 2009, 3, 433\u2013451). We have extended these studies and describe here an improved protein/peptide separation strategy that facilitated the identification of 987 proteins and peptides released from LIM1215 cells following 1\u00a0mM sulindac treatment for 8\u00a0h preceding the onset of apoptosis. This peptidome separation strategy involved fractional centrifugal ultrafiltration of concentrated cell culture media (CM) using nominal molecular weight membrane filters (NMWL 30\u00a0K, 3\u00a0K and 1\u00a0K). Proteins isolated in the >\u00a030\u00a0K and 3\u201330\u00a0K fractions were electrophoretically separated by SDS-PAGE and endogenous peptides in the 1\u20133\u00a0K membrane filter were fractioned by RP-HPLC; isolated proteins and peptides were identified by nanoLC-MS\u2013MS. Collectively, our data show that LIM1215 cells treated with 1\u00a0mM sulindac for 8\u00a0h secrete decreased levels of proteins associated with extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g., collagens, perlecan, syndecans, filamins, dyneins, metalloproteinases and endopeptidases), cell adhesion (e.g., cadherins, integrins, laminins) and mucosal maintenance (e.g., glycoprotein 340 and mucins 5\u00a0AC, 6, and 13). A salient finding of this study was the increased proteolysis of cell surface proteins following treatment with sulindac for 8\u00a0h (40% higher than from untreated LIM1215 cells); several of these endogenous peptides contained C-terminal amino acids from transmembrane domains indicative of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). Taken together these results indicate that during the early-stage onset of sulindac-induced apoptosis (evidenced by increased annexin V binding, dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and cleavage of caspase-3), 1\u00a0mM sulindac treatment of LIM1215 cells results in decreased expression of secreted proteins implicated in ECM remodeling, mucosal maintenance and cell\u2013cell-adhesion.

     "abstract": "Protein biomarker discovery for early detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a crucial unmet need to improve patient outcomes. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a promising tool for identification of biomarkers in different cancer types. Proteins secreted from cancer cells can serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis. In the current study, we have used isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling methodology coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry to identify and quantitate secreted proteins from a panel of head and neck carcinoma cell lines. In all, we identified 2,472 proteins, of which 225 proteins were secreted at higher or lower abundance in HNSCC-derived cell lines. Of these, 148 were present in higher abundance and 77 were present in lower abundance in the cancer-cell derived secretome. We detected a higher abundance of some previously known markers for HNSCC including insulin like growth factor binding protein 3, IGFBP3 (11-fold) and opioid growth factor receptor, OGFR (10-fold) demonstrating the validity of our approach. We also identified several novel secreted proteins in HNSCC including olfactomedin-4, OLFM4 (12-fold) and hepatocyte growth factor activator, HGFA (5-fold). IHC-based validation was conducted in HNSCC using tissue microarrays which revealed overexpression of IGFBP3 and OLFM4 in 70% and 75% of the tested cases, respectively. Our study illustrates quantitative proteomics of secretome as a robust approach for identification of potential HNSCC biomarkers.

     "abstract": "A major but hitherto overseen component of the blood/plasma secretome is that of extracellular vesicles (EVs) which are shed from all blood cell types. These EVs are made up of microvesicles (MVs) and exosomes. MVs, 100\u00a0nm\u20131\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter, are released from the cell surface, and are a rich source of non-conventionally secreted proteins lacking a conventional signal peptide, and thus not secreted by the classical secretory pathways. Exosomes are smaller vesicles (\u2264\u00a0100\u00a0nm) having an endocytic origin and released upon multivesicular body fusion with the plasma membrane. Both vesicle types play major roles in intercellular cross talk and constitute an important component of the secretome especially in the area of biomarkers for cancer. The release of EVs, which are found in all the bodily fluids, is enhanced in cancer and a major focus of cancer proteomics is therefore targeted at EVs. The blood/plasma secretome is also a source of EVs, potentially diagnostic of infectious disease, whether from EVs released from infected cells or from the pathogens themselves. Despite the great excitement in this field, as is stated here and in other parts of this Special issue entitled: An Updated Secretome, much of the EV research, whether proteomic or functional in nature, urgently needs standardisation both in terms of nomenclature and isolation protocols.

     "abstract": "Seminal plasma contains various types of extracellular vesicles, including \u2018prostasomes\u2019. Prostasomes are small vesicles secreted by prostatic epithelial cells that can be recruited by and fuse with sperm cells in response of progesterone that is released by oocyte surrounding cumulus cells. This delivers Ca2\u00a0+ signaling tools that allow the sperm cell to gain hypermotility and undergo the acrosome reaction. Conditions for binding of prostasomes to sperm cells are however unclear. We found that classically used prostasome markers are in fact heterogeneously expressed on distinct populations of small and large vesicles in seminal plasma. To study interactions between prostasomes and spermatozoa we used the stallion as a model organism. A homogeneous population of ~\u00a060\u00a0nm prostasomes was first separated from larger vesicles and labeled with biotin. Binding of biotinylated prostasomes to individual live spermatozoa was then monitored by flow cytometry. Contrary to assumptions in the literature, we found that such highly purified prostasomes bound to live sperm only after capacitation had been initiated, and specifically at pH \u2265\u00a07.5. Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that prostasomes bound primarily to the head of live sperm. We propose that in vivo, prostasomes may bind to sperm cells in the uterus, to be carried in association with sperm cells into oviduct and to fuse with the sperm cell only during the final approach of the oocyte.

     "abstract": "The interstitium or interstitial space describes the space outside the blood and lymphatic vessels. It contains two phases; the interstitial fluid (IF) and the extracellular matrix. In this review we focus on the interstitial fluid phase, which is the physical and biochemical microenvironment of the cells, and more specifically that of tumors. IF is created by transcapillary filtration and cleared by lymphatic vessels, and contains substances that are either produced and secreted locally, thus denoted secretome, or brought to the organ by the circulation. The structure of the interstitium is discussed briefly and moreover techniques for IF isolation focusing on those that are relevant for studies of the secretome. Accumulated data show that tumor IF is hypoxic and acidic compared with subcutaneous IF and plasma, and that there are gradients between IF and plasma giving information on where substances are produced and thereby reflecting the local microenvironment. We review recent data on the origin of tissue specific substances, challenges related to isolating a representative secretome and the use of this as a substrate for biomarker identification. Finally we perform a comparative analysis across human tumor types and techniques and show that there is great variation in the results obtained that may at least partially be due to the isolation method used. We conclude that when care is taken in isolation of substrate, analysis of the secretome may give valuable biological insight and result in identification of biomarker candidates.

     "abstract": "We aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in interstitial fluid from ovarian cancer employing multiple fractioning and high resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, and asked whether specific proteins that may serve as biomarker candidates or therapeutic targets could be identified. High throughput proteomics was conducted on immunodepleted and fractioned interstitial fluid from pooled samples of ovarian carcinomas, using endometrial carcinomas and healthy ovarian tissue as controls. Differential analysis revealed the up-regulation of extracellular proteasomes in tumor interstitial fluid compared to the healthy control. Moreover, a number of differentially expressed proteins in interstitial fluid from ovarian carcinomas compared with control tissues were identified. Detection of proteasome 20S related proteins in TIF compared to IF from healthy tissue indicates that the 20S proteasome can have a role in the tumor microenvironment. Six selected proteins, CEACAM5, FREM2, MUC5AC, TFF3, PYCARD and WDR1, were independently validated in individual tumor lysates from ovarian carcinomas by multiple reaction monitoring initiated detection and sequence analysis, Western blot and/or selected reaction monitoring. Quantification of specific proteins revealed substantial heterogeneity between individual samples. Nevertheless, WD repeat-containing protein 1 was confirmed as being significantly overexpressed in interstitial fluid from ovarian carcinomas compared to healthy ovarian tissue by Orbitrap analysis of individual native interstitial fluid from ovarian and endometrial carcinomas and healthy ovarian tissue. We suggest that this protein should be explored as a therapeutic target in ovarian carcinomas. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: An Updated Secretome.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), one of the most prevalent cancers in the western world, is treatable if detected early. However, 70% of CRC is detected at an advanced stage. This is largely due to the inadequacy of current faecal occult blood screening testing and costs involved in conducting population-based colonoscopy, the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for CRC detection. Another biomarker for CRC, carcinoembryonic antigen, while useful for monitoring CRC recurrence, is ineffective, lacking the specificity required early detection of CRC. For these reasons there is a need for more effective blood-based markers for early CRC detection. In this study we targeted glycoproteins secreted from the human colon carcinoma cell line LIM1215 as a source of potential CRC biomarkers. Secreted candidate glycoproteins were confirmed by MS and validated by Western blot analysis of tissue/tumour interstitial fluid (Tif) from LIM1215 xenograft tumours grown in immunocompromised mice. Overall, 39 glycoproteins were identified in LIM1215 culture media (CCM) and 5 glycoproteins in LIM1215 tumour xenograft Tif; of these, cadherin-17 (CDH17), galectin-3 binding protein (LGALS3BP), and tyrosine-protein kinase-like 7 (PTK7) were identified in both CM and glycosylation motifs. Swiss-Prot was used to annotate Tif. Many of the glycoproteins identified in this study (e.g., AREG, DSG2, EFNA1, EFNA3, EFNA4, EPHB4, ST14, and TIMP1) have been reported to be implicated in CRC biology. Interestingly, the cadherin-17 ectodomain, but not full length cadherin-17, was identified in CM, Tif and plasma derived from mice bearing the LIM1215 xenograft tumour. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cadherin-17 ectodomain in plasma.

During neural tissues development, a large diversity of neuronal phenotypes is produced from neural precursor cells. In recent years, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which specific types of neurons are generated have been explored with the aim to elucidate the complex events leading to the generation of different phenotypes via distinctive developmental programs that control self-renewal, differentiation, and plasticity. The extracellular environment is thought to provide instructive influences that actively induce the production of specific neuronal phenotypes.In this work, the secretome profiling of differentiated neural mes-c-myc A1 (A1) cell line endowed with stem cell properties was analyzed by applying a shotgun LC\u2013MS/MS approach. The results provide a list of secreted molecules with potential relevance for the functional and biological features characterizing the A1 neuronal phenotype. Proteins involved in biological processes closely related to nervous system development including neurites growth, differentiation of neurons and axonogenesis were identified. Among them, proteins belonging to extracellular matrix and cell-adhesion complexes as well as soluble factors with well established neurotrophic properties were detected. The presented work provides the basis to clarify the complex extracellular protein networks implicated in neuronal differentiation and in the acquisition of the neuronal phenotype.

Secreted peptides were identified using a combination of Mascot and post-processing analyses including MSPro re-scoring, extended feature sets and Percolator, resulting in 474 protein identifications from 1228 peptides (\u2264\u00a01% q-value, \u2264\u00a05% PEP) \u2014 a 36% increase in peptide identifications when compared with conventional Mascot (homology ionscore thresholding). In both colon tumour models, 122 identified peptides were derived from 41 cell surface protein ectodomains, 23 peptides (12 proteins) from regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP), and 12 peptides (9 proteins) generated from intracellular domain proteolysis. Further analyses using the protease/substrate database MEROPS, (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/), revealed 335 (71%) proteins classified as originating from classical/non-classical secretion, or the cell membrane. Of these, peptides were identified from 42 substrates in MEROPS with defined protease cleavage sites, while peptides generated from a further 205 substrates were fragmented by hitherto unknown proteases. A salient finding was the identification of peptides from 88 classical/non-classical secreted substrates in MEROPS, implicated in tumour progression and angiogenesis (FGFBP1, PLXDC2), cell\u2013cell recognition and signalling (DDR1, GPA33), and tumour invasiveness and metastasis (MACC1, SMAGP); the nature of the proteases responsible for these proteolytic events is unknown. To confirm reproducibility of peptide fragment abundance in this study, we report the identification of a specific cleaved peptide fragment in the secretopeptidome from the colon-specific GPA33 antigen in 4/14 human CRC models. This improved secretopeptidome isolation and characterisation strategy has extended our understanding of endogenous peptides generated through proteolysis of classical/non-classical secreted proteins, extracellular proteolytic processing of cell surface membrane proteins, and peptides generated through RIP. The novel peptide cleavage site information in this study provides a useful first step in detailing proteolytic cleavage associated with tumourigenesis and the extracellular environment.

     "abstract": "Peptides represent a major class of cell\u2013cell signaling molecules. Most peptidomic studies have focused on peptides present in brain or other tissues. For a peptide to function in intercellular signaling, it must be secreted. The present study was undertaken to identify the major peptides secreted from mouse brain slices that were cultured in oxygenated buffer for 3\u20134\u00a0h. Approximately 75% of the peptides identified in extracts of cultured slices matched the previously reported peptide content of heat-inactivated mouse brain tissue, whereas only 2% matched the peptide content of unheated brain tissue; the latter showed a large number of postmortem changes. As found with extracts of heat-inactivated mouse brain, the extracts of cultured brain slices represented secretory pathway peptides as well as peptides derived from intracellular proteins such as those present in the cytosol and mitochondria. A subset of the peptides detected in the extracts of the cultured slices was detected in the culture media. The vast majority of secreted peptides arose from intracellular proteins and not secretory pathway proteins. The peptide RVD-hemopressin, a CB1 cannabinoid receptor agonist, was detected in culture media, which is consistent with a role for RVD-hemopressin as a non-classical neuropeptide. Taken together with previous studies, the present results show that short-term culture of mouse brain slices is an appropriate system to study peptide secretion, especially the non-conventional pathway(s) by which peptides produced from intracellular proteins are secreted.

Glia and neurons are in continuous reciprocal communication under both physiological and neuropathological conditions, and glia secrete various guidance factors or proteinaceous signals that service vital neuronal\u2013glial interactions in health and disease. Analysis and profiling of glial secretome, especially of microglia and astrocytes, have raised new expectations for the diagnosis and treatment of CNS disorders, and the availability of a catalog of glia-secreted proteins might provide an origin for further research on the complex extracellular signaling mediated by glial cells. Components of the glial secretome play important roles as mediators and modulators of brain structure and function during neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. Therapeutic hypothermia has been acclaimed an effective modulator of brain injury via its substantial effect on the protein expression profiles of glia. Furthermore, emerging proteomic tools and methodologies make feasible the documentation of the reactive glial secretome signature.

     "abstract": "Over recent years, analyses of secretomes (complete sets of secreted proteins) have been reported in various organisms, cell types, and pathologies and such studies are quickly gaining popularity. Fungi secrete enzymes can break down potential food sources; plant secreted proteins are primarily parts of the cell wall proteome; and human secreted proteins are involved in cellular immunity and communication, and provide useful information for the discovery of novel biomarkers, such as for cancer diagnosis. Continuous development of methodologies supports the wide identification and quantification of secreted proteins in a given cellular state. The role of secreted factors is also investigated in the context of the regulation of major signaling events, and connectivity maps are built to describe the differential expression and dynamic changes of secretomes. Bioinformatics has become the bridge between secretome data and computational tasks for managing, mining, and retrieving information. Predictions can be made based on this information, contributing to the elucidation of a given organism's physiological state and the determination of the specific malfunction in disease states. Here we provide an overview of the available bioinformatics databases and software that are used to analyze the biological meaning of secretome data, including descriptions of the main functions and limitations of these tools. The important challenges of data analysis are mainly related to the integration of biological information from dissimilar sources. Improvements in databases and developments in software will likely substantially contribute to the usefulness and reliability of secretome studies.

     "abstract": "Proteomic analysis of human body fluids is highly challenging, therefore many researchers are redirecting efforts toward secretome profiling. The goal is to define potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the secretome that can be traced back in accessible human body fluids. However, currently there is a lack of secretome profiles of normal human primary cells making it difficult to assess the biological meaning of current findings. In this study we sought to establish secretome profiles of human primary cells obtained from healthy donors with the goal of building a human secretome atlas. Such an atlas can be used as a reference for discovery of potential disease associated biomarkers and eventually novel therapeutic targets. As a preliminary study, secretome profiles were established for six different types of human primary cell cultures and checked for overlaps with the three major human body fluids including plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and urine. About 67% of the 1054 identified proteins in the secretome of these primary cells occurred in at least one body fluid. Furthermore, comparison of the secretome profiles of two human glioblastoma cell lines to this new human secretome atlas enabled unambiguous identification of potential brain tumor biomarkers. These biomarkers can be easily monitored in different body fluids using stable isotope labeled standard proteins. The long term goal of this study is to establish a comprehensive online human secretome atlas for future use as a reference for any disease related secretome study.

The ligand for MuSK is LRP4 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-4), a transmembrane protein in muscle, whose binding affinity for MuSK is potentiated by agrin, a neuronally derived heparan-sulfate proteoglycan. In addition, Dok7, a cytoplasmic adaptor protein, is also required for MuSK activation in vivo.

     "abstract": "Recent studies of insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR) revealed its unusual property to activate upon extracellular application of mildly alkaline media, pH\u00a0>\u00a07.9. The activation of IRR with hydroxyl anion has typical features of ligand\u2013receptor interaction; it is specific, dose-dependent, involves the IRR extracellular domain and is accompanied by a major conformational change. IRR is a member of the insulin receptor minifamily and has been long viewed as an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase since no peptide or protein agonist of IRR was found. In the evolution, IRR is highly conserved since its divergence from the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors in amphibia. The latter two cannot be activated by alkali. Another major difference between them is that unlike ubiquitously expressed insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors, IRR is found in specific sets of cells of only some tissues, most of them being exposed to extracorporeal liquids of extreme pH. In particular, largest concentrations of IRR are in beta-intercalated cells of the kidneys. The primary physiological function of these cells is to excrete excessive alkali as bicarbonate into urine. When IRR is removed genetically, animals loose the property to excrete bicarbonate upon experimentally induced alkalosis. In this review, we will discuss the available in vitro and in vivo data that support the hypothesis of IRR role as a physiological alkali sensor that regulates acid\u2013base balance.

     "abstract": "The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2, are two closely related receptor tyrosine kinases that are activated by triple-helical collagen in a slow and sustained manner. The DDRs have important roles in embryo development and their dysregulation is associated with human diseases, such as fibrosis, arthritis and cancer. The extracellular region of DDRs consists of a collagen-binding discoidin (DS) domain and a DS-like domain. The transmembrane region mediates the ligand-independent dimerisation of DDRs and is connected to the tyrosine kinase domain by an unusually long juxtamembrane domain. The major DDR binding site in fibrillar collagens is a GVMGFO motif (O is hydroxyproline), which is recognised by an amphiphilic trench at the top of the DS domain. How collagen binding leads to DDR activation is not understood. GVMGFO-containing triple-helical peptides activate DDRs with the characteristic slow kinetics, suggesting that the supramolecular structure of collagen is not required. Activation can be blocked allosterically by monoclonal antibodies that bind to the DS-like domain. Thus, collagen most likely causes a conformational change within the DDR dimer, which may lead to the formation of larger DDR clusters.

     "abstract": "The structural basis of ligand-induced dimerization of the receptor tyrosine kinase MET by its natural ligand hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is not well understood. However, interesting insight into the molecular mechanism of MET dimerization has emerged from crystal structures of MET in complex with a bacterial agonist, the invasion protein internalin B (InlB) from pathogenic Listeria monocytogenes. MET activation by InlB promotes uptake of bacteria into host cells. Structural and biophysical data suggest that InlB is monomeric on its own but dimerizes upon binding to the membrane-anchored MET receptor promoting the formation of a signaling active 2:2 complex. The dimerization interface is small and unusually located on the convex side of the curved InlB leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. As InlB does not dimerize in solution, the dimerization site could only be identified by studying packing contacts of InlB in various crystal forms and had to be proven by scrutinizing its biological relevance in cellular assays. InlB dimerization is thus an example of a low-affinity contact that appears irrelevant in solution but becomes physiologically significant in the context of 2-dimensional diffusion restricted to the membrane plane. The resulting 2:2 InlB:MET complex has an InlB dimer at its center with one MET molecule bound peripherally to each InlB. This model of ligand-mediated MET dimerization may serve as a blue-print to understand MET activation by NK1, a naturally occurring HGF/SF splice variant and MET agonist. Crystal structures of NK1 repeatedly show a NK1 dimer, in which residues implicated in MET-binding are located on the outside. Thus, MET dimerization by NK1 may also be ligand-mediated with a NK1 dimer at the center of the 2:2 complex with one MET molecule bound peripherally to each NK1.

To this end, various structure-based studies have led to the generation of bivalent peptide-based agonists and antibodies that selectively initiate Trk receptor signaling; however, these compounds do not possess the ideal characteristics of a potential drug. Additionally, the reliance of structure-based data to generate the compound libraries, limits the potential identification of novel chemical structures with desirable activity.

ALK has remained an \u201cOrphan Receptor.\u201d The studies cited below describe a unique mechanism termed \u201cLigand Independent Activation.\u201d It is shown that activation of ALK results when the cytokine pleiotrophin (PTN) interacts with its receptor, the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase \u03b2/\u03b6 (RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6). Pleiotrophin inactivates the catalytic activity of RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6, which, when not inactivated, dephosphorylates phosphotyrosine sites in the activation domain of ALK; as a consequence of the inactivation of RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 by PTN, autophosphorylation and autoactivation of ALK rapidly follow. The PTN/RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 signaling pathway thus regulates the catalytic activity of ALK and tyrosine phosphorylation levels of ALK downstream target proteins. Furthermore, since ALK is only one of the key ALK phosphoproteins targeted by the PTN/RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 signaling pathway, the PTN/RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6 signaling pathway has the potential to coordinately regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of other different key proteins in multiple cellular compartments.

It was also found that these dendrimers act as mixed partially non-competitive pepsin inhibitors. The negatively charged dendrimer (G3.5 PAMAM-COOH) was not able to inhibit the enzymatic activity of pepsin, probably due to the electrostatic repulsion between this dendrimer and the protein. No correlation between changes in enzymatic activity of pepsin and alterations in CD spectrum of the protein was observed.

     "abstract": "T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP) is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase. It is involved in the negative regulation of many cellular signaling pathways. Thus, activation of TCPTP could have important therapeutic applications in diseases such as cancer and inflammation. We have previously shown that the \u03b1-cytoplasmic tail of integrin \u03b11\u03b21 directly binds and activates TCPTP. In addition, we have identified in a large-scale high-throughput screen six small molecules that activate TCPTP. These small molecule activators include mitoxantrone and spermidine. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism behind agonist-induced TCPTP activation. By combining several molecular modeling and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that \u03b11-peptide and mitoxantrone activate TCPTP via direct binding to the catalytic domain, whereas spermidine does not interact with the catalytic domain of TCPTP in vitro. Furthermore, we have identified a hydrophobic groove surrounded by negatively charged residues on the surface of TCPTP as a putative binding site for the \u03b11-peptide and mitoxantrone. Importantly, these data have allowed us to identify a new molecule that binds to TCPTP, but interestingly cannot activate its phosphatase activity. Accordingly, we describe here mechanism of TCPTP activation by mitoxantrone, the cytoplasmic tail of \u03b11-integrin, and a mitoxantrone-like molecule at the atomic level. These data provide invaluable insight into the development of novel TCPTP activators, and may facilitate the rational discovery of small-molecule cancer therapeutics.",

Networks are playing an increasing and important role in the understanding of physiological processes such as homeostasis, signaling, spatial and temporal organizations, and pathological conditions. In this article we show the complex system of interactions determined by human Sirtuins (Sirt) largely involved in many metabolic processes as well as in different diseases. The Sirtuin family consists of seven homologous Sirt-s having structurally similar cores but different terminal segments, being rather variable in length and/or intrinsically disordered. Many studies have determined their cellular location as well as biological functions although molecular mechanisms through which they act are actually little known therefore, the aim of this work was to define, explore and understand the Sirtuin-related human interactome. As a first step, we have integrated the experimentally determined protein\u2013protein interactions of the Sirtuin-family as well as their first and second neighbors to a Sirtuin-related sub-interactome. Our data showed that the second-neighbor network of Sirtuins encompasses 25% of the entire human interactome, and exhibits a scale-free degree distribution and interconnectedness among top degree nodes. Moreover, the Sirtuin sub interactome showed a modular structure around the core comprising mixed functions. Finally, we extracted from the Sirtuin sub-interactome subnets related to cancer, aging and post-translational modifications for information on key nodes and topological space of the subnets in the Sirt family network.",

The change in the structure and flexibility of the small domain and its function in the thermodynamic stability of the actin monomer were examined with fluorescence spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The structure around the C-terminus of actin is slightly affected by the presence of cofilin and profilin. Temperature dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements indicated that both actin binding proteins decreased the flexibility of the protein matrix between the subdomains 1 and 2. Time resolved anisotropy decay measurements supported the idea that cofilin and profilin changed similarly the dynamics around the fluorescently labeled Cys-374 and Lys-61 residues in subdomains 1 and 2, respectively. DSC experiments indicated that the thermodynamic stability of actin increased by cofilin and decreased in the presence of profilin. Based on the information obtained it is possible to conclude that while the small domain of actin acts uniformly in the presence of cofilin and profilin the overall stability of actin changes differently in the presence of the studied actin binding proteins. The results support the idea that the small domain of actin behaves as a rigid unit during the opening and closing of the nucleotide binding pocket in the presence of profilin and cofilin as well. The structural arrangement of the nucleotide binding cleft mainly influences the global stability of actin while the dynamics of the different segments can change autonomously.",

     "abstract": "The activation of dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP) to form a ferryl intermediate requires the distal histidine, H55, to act as an acid base catalyst. The lack of ancillary amino acids in the distal pocket to assist in this process makes H55 even more important to the formation of active intermediates than in conventional peroxidases. Therefore, one can infer that the precise conformation H55 may greatly affect the enzymatic activity. Using site-direct mutagenesis at position T56, immediately adjacent to H55, we have confirmed that subtle changes in the conformation of H55 affect the catalytic efficiency of DHP. Mutating T56 to a smaller amino acid appears to permit H55 to rotate with relatively low barriers between conformations in the distal pocket, which may lead to an increase in catalytic activity. On the other hand, larger amino acids in the neighboring site appear to restrict the rotation of H55 due to the steric hindrance. In the case of T56V, which is an isosteric mutation, H55 appears less mobile, but forced to be closer to the heme iron than in wild type. Both proximity to the heme iron and flexibility of motion in some of the mutants can result in an increased catalytic rate, but can also lead to protein inactivation due to ligation of H55 to the heme iron, which is known as hemichrome formation. A balance of enzymatic rate and protein stability with respect to hemichrome formation appears to be optimum in wild type DHP (WT-DHP).",

Six cholesterol recognition putative motifs (5 CRAC/1 CCM) in apoA-I structure are suggested to interact with cholesterol. Among those, the K40-W50 partially conserved CCM sequence with a putative recognition feature, predicted by the MoRF tool, may underlie cholesterol binding to lipid-free apoA-I, the binding triggering the disorder-to-order transition within MoRF. Thus, the impairment of helix formation and accelerated protein aggregation may underlie the amyloidogenic effect of W50R substitution. Also, D102H substitution in conserved CRAC2 V97-K106 sequence may be harmful in reverse cholesterol transport. With PDBe Motifs and Sites algorithm, cholesterol is a ligand for L101, F104 and W108 residues in HDL-bound apoA-I.

Modeling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest Ala88 to be an important residue involved in determining the rate of catalysis with SCFA substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric and dimeric forms of StTdcD revealed plausible open and closed states, and also suggested role for dimerization in stabilizing segment 235\u2013290 involved in interfacial interactions and ligand binding.

The goal of this project was to develop a generic strategy for preparation of functional recombinant CB2 and immobilization at solid interfaces. Expression of CB2 as a fusion with Rho-tag (peptide composed of the last nine amino acids of rhodopsin) in E. coli was evaluated in terms of protein levels, accessibility of the tag, and activity of the receptor. The structural integrity of CB2 was tested by ligand binding to the receptor solubilized in detergent micelles, captured on tag-specific monoclonal 1D4 antibody-coated resin. Highly pure and functional CB2 was obtained by sequential chromatography on a 1D4- and Ni-NTA-resin and its affinity to the 1D4 antibody characterized by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Either the purified receptor or fusion CB2 from the crude cell extract was captured onto a 1D4-coated CM4 chip (Biacore) in a quantitative fashion at uniform orientation as demonstrated by the SPR signal. Furthermore, the accessibility of the extracellular surface of immobilized CB2 and the affinity of interaction with a novel monoclonal antibody NAA-1 was studied by SPR.

However, heme peroxidases react with peroxynitrite to form transient intermediates but the role of the distal histidine in this reaction is still unknown. In order to investigate catalytic roles of the histidine at the distal cavity, two Leishmania major peroxidase (LmP) mutants (H68E, H68V) were prepared. The rate of transition from ferric H68V to Compound ES by H2O2 is decreased by approximately five orders of magnitude relative to wild type, which is consistent with electron donor oxidation data where the H68V is ~\u00a01000 fold less active than wild type. In the reaction with peroxynitrite, the formation rate of intermediates in the mutants is not significantly lower than that for the wild type, indicating that the His68 has no major role in homolytic cleavage of an OO bond in peroxynitrite. EPR spectroscopic data suggest that the transient intermediates formed by the reaction of LmP with H2O2 exhibits an intense and stable signal similar to CCP Compound ES whereas in case of the reaction with peroxynitrite, this signal disappears, indicating that the transient intermediate is Compound II. Rapid kinetics data suggest that the distal His68 mutants display higher decay rates of Compound II than wild type. Thus, His68 mutations minimize Compound II formation (inactive species in peroxynitrite scavenging cycles) by increasing decay rates during the steady state and results in higher peroxynitrite degrading activity.",

The disaccharides, trehalose and maltose were used to assess if the disaccharide induced increase in Tm is reflected in the reversibility of thermally induced denaturation. There was extensive overlap between the Tm values where non-reversible and reversible thermal denaturation occurred. Indeed, for pH\u00a06, at the highest and lowest Tm, no refolding was observed whereas refolding was observed for intermediate values, but with similar Tm values having different proportions of refolded protein. We established a method to measure the degree of reversible unfolding following thermal denaturation and hence indirectly, the degree to which protein is lost to irreversible aggregation, and show that solution conditions which increase melt transition temperatures do not automatically confer an increase in reversibility.

This strain, originally isolated from a Japanese hot spring, exhibited tolerance to concentrations of arsenate and arsenite up to 20\u00a0mM and 15\u00a0mM, respectively; it owns in its genome a putative chromosomal arsenate reductase (TtarsC) gene encoding a protein homologous to the one well characterized from the plasmid pI258 of the Gram\u00a0+\u00a0bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.

Although heparin and fondaparinux bind \u03b22GPI at therapeutically relevant doses, neither fondaparinux nor heparin was efficient in inhibition of the binding of \u03b22GPI/antibody complexes to negatively charged phospholipids and endothelial cells. Our studies suggest that these drugs do not act on pathological properties of \u03b22GPI/antibody complexes, emphasizing the need for a new treatment specific for \u03b22GPI-related thrombosis in APS.

In the present study, three natural resveratrol analogs [pterostilbene, (E)-2\u2032,3,5\u2032,5-tetrahydroxystilbene (THSB), and oxyresveratrol] are structurally related to resveratrol and moracin M, but their inhibition and mechanism against PDE4 are still unclear. A combined method consisting of molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy, and bioassay was performed to better understand their inhibitory mechanism. The binding pattern of pterostilbene demonstrates that it involves hydrophobic/aromatic interactions with Phe340 and Phe372, and forms hydrogen bond(s) with His160 and Gln369 in the active site pocket. The present work also reveals that oxyresveratrol and THSB can bind to PDE4D and exhibits less negative predicted binding free energies than pterostilbene, which was qualitatively validated by bioassay (IC50\u00a0=\u00a096.6, 36.1, and 27.0\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively).

Our results imply that hydrophobic/aromatic forces are the primary factors in explaining the mechanism of inhibition by the three products.

     "abstract": "We report that the temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae associated with a variant tRNA nucleotidyltransferase containing an amino acid substitution at position 189 results from a reduced ability to incorporate AMP and CMP into tRNAs. We show that this defect can be compensated for by a second-site suppressor converting residue arginine 64 to tryptophan. The R64W substitution does not alter the structure or thermal stability of the enzyme dramatically but restores catalytic activity in vitro and suppresses the ts phenotype in vivo. R64 is found in motif A known to be involved in catalysis and nucleotide triphosphate binding while E189 lies within motif C previously thought only to connect the head and neck domains of the protein. Although mutagenesis experiments indicate that residues R64 and E189 do not interact directly, our data suggest a critical role for residue E189 in enzyme structure and function. Both R64 and E189 may contribute to the organization of the catalytic domain of the enzyme. These results, along with overexpression and deletion analyses, show that the ts phenotype of cca1-E189F does not arise from thermal instability of the variant tRNA nucleotidyltransferase but instead from the inability of a partially active enzyme to support growth only at higher temperatures.",

     "abstract": "Understanding protein solubility, and consequently aggregation, is an important issue both from an academic and a biotechnological application viewpoints. Here we report the effects of 10 representative amino acids on the aggregation kinetics of proteins. The effects were determined by measuring the solubility of a simplified bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) variant, to which short artificial tags containing the amino acid of interest were added at its C-terminus. We determined the solubility of the tagged variants as a function of equilibration time (20\u00a0min to 48\u00a0h) and total protein concentration ranging from 0.10\u00a0mg/ml to 25.0\u00a0mg/ml. We observed, as anticipated, that proteins precipitated when the total protein concentration exceeded a critical value. However, when the total protein concentration was further increased, the apparent solubility reached a concentration above the critical value, and slowly decreased to a value under the critical concentration upon increasing the equilibration period. We rationalized these observations by identifying three different solubility values, the \u201ctransient solubility (TS)\u201d, the \u201caggregation initiation concentration (AIC)\u201d and the \u201clong-term solubility (LS)\u201d. AIC and LS are parameters determined essentially by the amino acid types composing the tags and could be considered as an amino acid's intrinsic property. On the other hand, TS is an apparent solubility that is measured after some (20\u00a0min in our case) equilibration time and is often considered as the \u201csolubility\u201d of the protein. Similar aggregation kinetic patterns were observed with natural proteins, indicating the generality of the observations made using our model protein.",

     "abstract": "pH-dependent (pH\u00a06.0\u20138.0) quaternary structural changes of ferric Vitreoscilla hemoglobin (VHb) have been investigated using dynamic light scattering. The VHb exhibits a monomeric state under neutral conditions at pH\u00a07.0, while the protein forms distinct homodimeric species at pH\u00a06.0 and 8.0, respectively. The dissociation constant obtained using the Bio-Layer Interferometry technology indicates that, at pH\u00a07.0, the monomer\u2013monomer dissociation of VHb is about 6-fold or 5-fold higher (KD\u00a0=\u00a06.34\u00a0\u03bcM) compared with that at slightly acidic pH (KD\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u00a0\u03bcM) or slightly alkaline pH (KD\u00a0=\u00a01.22\u00a0\u03bcM). The pH-dependent absorption spectra demonstrate that the heme microenvironment of VHb is sensitive to the changes of pH value. The maximum absorption band of heme group of VHb shifts from 402\u00a0nm to 407\u00a0nm when pH changes from 6.0 to 8.0. In addition, the fluorescence emission spectra of VHb, taken at excitation wavelength of 295\u00a0nm, suggest that the single Trp122 fluorescence quantum yields in VHb are decreased due to the formation of the homodimeric species. However, the circular dichroism spectra data display that the secondary structures of VHb are little affected by pH transitions. The pH-dependent peroxidase activity of VHb was also investigated in this study. The optimum pH for VHb using 2,2\u2032-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as substrate is 7.0, which implies that the monomer state of VHb would exhibit better peroxidase activity than the homodimeric species of VHb at pH\u00a06.0 and 8.0.",

     "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between the DNA binding thermodynamics and the enzymatic activity of the Klenow and Klentaq Pol I DNA polymerases from Escherichia coli and Thermus aquaticus. Both polymerases bind DNA with nanomolar affinity at temperatures down to at least 5\u00a0\u00b0C, but have lower than 1% enzymatic activity at these lower temperatures. For both polymerases it is found that the temperature of onset of significant enzymatic activity corresponds with the temperature where the enthalpy of binding (\u0394Hbinding) crosses zero (TH) and becomes favorable (negative). This TH/activity upshift temperature is 15\u00a0\u00b0C for Klenow and 30\u00a0\u00b0C for Klentaq. The results indicate that a negative free energy of DNA binding alone is not sufficient to proceed to catalysis, but that the enthalpic versus entropic balance of binding may be a modulator of the temperature dependence of enzymatic function. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the catalytic activity of Klentaq polymerase using expanded Eyring theory yields thermodynamic patterns for \u0394G\u2021, \u0394H\u2021, and T\u0394S\u2021 that are highly analogous to those commonly observed for direct DNA binding. Eyring analysis also finds a significant \u0394Cp\u2021 of formation of the activated complex, which in turn indicates that the temperature of maximal activity, after which incorporation rate slows with increasing temperature, will correspond with the temperature where the activation enthalpy (\u0394H\u2021) switches from positive to negative.",

In contrast, however, the ctenophore photoproteins are extremely sensitive to UV and visible light over the range of their absorption spectrum. The spatial structure of a novel light-sensitive photoprotein from the ctenophore Beroe abyssicola in its apoform bound with three calcium ions is determined at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5. We demonstrate that the apoberovin is a slightly asymmetrical compact globular protein formed by two domains with a cavity in the center, which exactly retains the fold architecture characteristic of hydromedusan photoproteins despite their low amino acid sequence identity. However, the structural alignment of these two photoprotein classes clearly shows that despite the high similarity of shape and geometry of their coelenterazine-binding cavities, their interiors differ drastically. The key residues appearing to be crucial for stabilizing the 2-hydroperoxycoelenterazine and for formation of the emitter in hydromedusan photoproteins, are replaced in berovin by amino acid residues having completely different side chain properties. Evidently, these replacements must be responsible for the distinct properties of ctenophore photoproteins such as sensitivity to light or the fact that the formation of active photoprotein from apophotoprotein, coelenterazine, and oxygen is more effective at alkaline pH.",

Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms of allosteric and non-allosteric effector antibodies in an experimentally tractable system, consisting of single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that target the model enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherichia coli. A panel of thirty-five nanobodies was isolated using several strategies to increase nanobody diversity. The nanobodies exhibit a variety of effector properties, including partial inhibition, strong inhibition and stimulation of DHFR activity. Despite these diverse effector properties, chemical shift perturbation NMR epitope mapping identified only two epitope regions: epitope \u03b1 is a new allosteric site that is over 10\u00a0\u00c5 from the active site, while epitope \u03b2 is located in the region of the Met20 loop. The structural basis for DHFR allosteric inhibition or activation upon nanobody binding to the \u03b1 epitope was examined by solving the crystal structures of DHFR in complex with Nb113 (an allosteric inhibitor) and Nb179 (an allosteric activator). The structures suggest roles for conformational constraint and altered protein dynamics, but not epitope distortion, in the observed allosteric effects. The crystal structure of a \u03b2 epitope region binder (ca1698) in complex with DHFR is also reported. Although CDR3 of ca1698 occupies the substrate binding site, ca1698 displays linear mixed inhibition kinetics instead of simple competitive inhibition kinetics. Two mechanisms are proposed to account for this apparent anomaly. Evidence for structural convergence of ca1698 and Nb216 during affinity maturation is also presented.",

     "abstract": "A wide and still rapidly increasing range of heme-based sensor proteins has been discovered over the last two decades. At the molecular level, these proteins function as bistable switches in which the catalytic activity of an enzymatic domain is altered mostly by binding or dissociation of small gaseous ligands (O2, NO or CO) to the heme in a sensor domain. The initial \u201csignal\u201d at the heme level is subsequently transmitted within the protein to the catalytic site, ultimately leading to adapted expression levels of specific proteins. Making use of the photolability of the heme-ligand bond that mimics thermal dissociation, early processes in this intra-protein signaling pathway can be followed using ultrafast optical spectroscopic techniques; they also occur on timescales accessible to molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental studies performed over the last decade on proteins including the sensors FixL (O2), CooA (CO) and soluble guanylate cyclase (NO) are reviewed with an emphasis on emerging general mechanisms. After heme-ligand bond breaking, the ligand can escape from the heme pocket and eventually from the protein, or rebind directly to the heme. Remarkably, in all sensor proteins the rebinding, specifically of the sensed ligand, is highly efficient. This \u201dligand trap\u201d property possibly provides means to smoothen the effects of fast environmental fluctuations on the switching frequency. For 6-coordinate proteins, where exchange between an internal heme-bound residue and external gaseous ligands occurs, the study of early processes starting from the unliganded form indicates that mobility of the internal ligand may facilitate signal transfer.

     "abstract": "Background: CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs) are potential therapeutic agents, able to deliver CO \u2013 a critical gasotransmitter \u2013 in biological environments. CO-RMs are also effective antimicrobial agents; although the mechanisms of action are poorly defined, haem-containing terminal oxidases are primary targets. Nevertheless, it is clear from several studies that the effects of CO-RMs on biological systems are frequently not adequately explained by the release of CO: CO-RMs are generally more potent inhibitors than is CO gas and other effects of the molecules are evident. Methods: Because sensitivity to CO-RMs cannot be predicted by sensitivity to CO gas, we assess the differential susceptibilities of strains, each expressing only one of the three terminal oxidases of E. coli \u2014 cytochrome bd-I, cytochrome bd-II and cytochrome bo\u2032, to inhibition by CORM-3. We present the first sensitive measurement of the oxygen affinity of cytochrome bd-II (Km 0.24\u00a0\u03bcM) employing globin deoxygenation. Finally, we investigate the way(s) in which thiol compounds abolish the inhibitory effects of CORM-2 and CORM-3 on respiration, growth and viability, a phenomenon that is well documented, but poorly understood. Results: We show that a strain expressing cytochrome bd-I as the sole oxidase is least susceptible to inhibition by CORM-3 in its growth and respiration of both intact cells and membranes. Growth studies show that cytochrome bd-II has similar CORM-3 sensitivity to cytochrome bo\u2032. Cytochromes bo\u2032 and bd-II also have considerably lower affinities for oxygen than bd-I. We show that the ability of N-acetylcysteine to abrogate the toxic effects of CO-RMs is not attributable to its antioxidant effects, or prevention of CO targeting to the oxidases, but may be largely due to the inhibition of CO-RM uptake by bacterial cells. Conclusions: A strain expressing cytochrome bd-I as the sole terminal oxidase is least susceptible to inhibition by CORM-3. N-acetylcysteine is a potent inhibitor of CO-RM uptake by E. coli. General significance: Rational design and exploitation of CO-RMs require a fundamental understanding of their activity.

Though NP7 exhibits a large sequence resemblance with other NPs, two major differential features are the ability to interact with negatively charged cell surfaces and the presence of a specific N-terminus composed of three extra residues (Leu1-Pro2-Gly3). The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the N-terminus on the ligand binding, and the topological features of inner cavities in closed and open states of NP7, which can be associated to the protein structure at low and high pH, respectively. Laser flash photolysis measurements of the CO rebinding kinetics to NP7 and its variant NP7(\u03941\u20133), which lacks the three extra residues at the N-terminus, exhibit a similar pattern and support the existence of a common kinetic mechanism for ligand migration and binding. This is supported by the existence of a common topology of inner cavities, which consists of two docking sites in the heme pocket and a secondary site at the back of the protein. The ligand exchange between these cavities is facilitated by an additional site, which can be transiently occupied by the ligand in NP7, although it is absent in NP4. These features provide a basis to explain the enhanced internal gas hosting capacity found experimentally in NP7 and the absence of ligand rebinding from secondary sites in NP4. The current data allow us to speculate that the processes of docking to cell surfaces and NO release may be interconnected in NP7, thereby efficiently releasing NO into a target cell.

Still, a consensus picture for the ligand entrance is not clear, with a growing concern among experimental researchers that computational simulations always show multiple pathways for any globin. Modeling non-biased ligand entrance from conventional molecular dynamics techniques, however, has shown to be difficult (and expensive). Here we use our Monte Carlo methodology, capable of freely mapping ligand diffusion and the description of rare events, to two well-studied systems: myoglobin and the mini-hemoglobin from the sea worm Cerebratulus lacteus. Our results clearly show that the simulations are specific to the system providing a different trend in the entrance pathway, as expected from experiments. While Mb presents multiple entrance pathways, populating the well-known xenon cavities, in CerHb the ligand enters the protein only by one apolar channel. Most of the trajectories (64%) visiting myoglobin's active site though, are gated by the distal histidine.

     "abstract": "The balance between neuronal apoptosis and survival sculpts the developing brain and has an important role in neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the individuation of signals that could modulate the cell death machinery as well as enhance survival in neurons promises to provide multiple points of therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroglobin (NGB), the first nerve globin identified in neuronal tissues of humans, seems to possess a protective role in the brain only after up-regulation. Here, the NGB physiological role in the control of neuronal survival is reviewed. In vitro studies suggested that cytosolic NGB could react very rapidly with cytochrome c released from mitochondria, thus interfering with the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Although very suggestive, these data do not explain either the role of NGB up-regulation in neuroprotection or the recently reported NGB localization into mitochondria. Recently, we identified the steroid hormone 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) as an endogenous modulator of NGB levels in neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cell line. Upon E2 stimulation, NGB reallocates mainly into mitochondria where the association with the mitochondrial cytochrome c occurs. Remarkably, E2 treatment before an apoptotic stimulus strongly enhances the NGB:cytochrome c association reducing cytochrome c release into the cytosol. As a consequence, a decrease of caspase-3 activation and, in turn, of the apoptotic cascade activation take place.

     "abstract": "Multimeric globins (e.g., hemoglobin) are considered to be the prototypes of allosteric enzymes, whereas monomeric globins (e.g., myoglobin; Mb) usually are assumed to be non-allosteric. However, the modulation of the functional properties of monomeric globins by non-covalent (or allosteric) and covalent modifications casts doubts on this general assumption. Here, we report examples referable to these two extreme mechanisms modulating the reactivity of three mammalian monomeric globins. Sperm whale Mb, which acts as a reserve supply of O2 and facilitates the O2 flux within a myocyte, displays the allosteric modulation of the O2 affinity on lactate, an obligatory product of glycolysis under anaerobic conditions, thus facilitating O2 diffusion to the mitochondria in supporting oxidative phosphorylation. Human neuroglobin (NGB), which appears to protect neurons from hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, undergoes hypoxia-dependent phosphorylation (i.e., covalent modulation) affecting the coordination equilibrium of the heme-Fe atom and, in turn, the heme-protein reactivity. This facilitates heme-Fe-ligand binding and enhances the rate of anaerobic nitrite reduction to form NO, thus contributing to cellular adaptation to hypoxia. The reactivity of human cytoglobin (CYGB), which has been postulated to protect cells against oxidative stress, depends on both non-covalent and covalent mechanisms. In fact, the heme reactivity of CYGB depends on the lipid, such as oleate, binding which stabilizes the penta-coordination geometry of the heme-Fe atom. Lastly, the reactivity of NGB and CYGB is modulated by the redox state of the intramolecular CysCD7/CysD5 and CysB2/CysE9 residue pairs, respectively, affecting the heme-Fe atom coordination state. In conclusion, the modulation of monomeric globins reactivity by non-covalent and covalent modifications appears a very widespread phenomenon, opening new perspectives in cell survival and protection.

     "abstract": "Neuroglobin, a globin characterized by a bis-histidine ligation of the heme iron, has been identified in mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates, including fish, amphibians and reptiles. In human neuroglobin, the presence of an internal disulfide bond in the CD loop (CD7\u2013D5) is found to modulate the ligand binding through a change in the heme pocket structure. Although the neuroglobin sequences mostly display conserved Cys at positions CD7, D5 and G18/19, a number of exceptions are known. In this study, neuroglobins from amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis) and fish (Chaenocephalus aceratus, Dissostichus mawsoni and Danio rerio) are investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectroscopy. All these neuroglobins differ from human neuroglobin in their Cys-positions. It is demonstrated that if disulfide bonds are formed in fish and amphibian neuroglobins, the reduction of these bonds does not result in alteration of the heme pocket in these globins. Furthermore, it is shown that mutagenesis of the Cys residues of X. tropicalis neuroglobin influences the protein structure. The amphibian neuroglobin is also found to be more resistant to H2O2-induced denaturation than the other neuroglobins under study, although all show an overall large stability in high concentrations of this oxidant.

Although the mechanisms of this neuroprotection remain unknown, Ngb might play an important role in counteracting the adverse effects of ischaemic stroke and cerebral hypoxia. Several Ngb overexpressing mouse models have confirmed this hypothesis; however, these models were not yet exposed to in-depth behavioural characterisations. To investigate the potential changes in behaviour due to Ngb overexpression, heterozygous mice and wild type (WT) littermates were subjected to a series of cognitive and behavioural tests (i.e., the SHIRPA primary screening, the hidden-platform Morris water maze, passive avoidance learning, 47\u00a0h cage activity, open field exploration, a dark\u2013light transition box, an accelerating rotarod, a stationary beam, a wire suspension task and a gait test) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. No significant behavioural differences were found between WT and Ngb-overexpressing mice at three months old. However, one-year-old Ngb-overexpressing mice travelled more distance on the stationary beam compared with WT littermates. This result shows that the constitutive overexpression of Ngb might counteract the endogenous decrease of Ngb in crucial brain regions such as the cerebellum, thereby counteracting age-induced neuromotor dysfunction.

A significant fraction of the protein localizes within the mitochondria and is directly associated with mitochondrial metabolism and integrity. The retina is the site of the highest concentration for neuroglobin and has been reported to be up to 100-fold higher than in the brain. Since neuroglobin was especially abundant in retinal ganglion cell layer, we investigated its abundance in optic nerves. Remarkably in optic nerves, neuroglobin is observed, as expected, in retinal ganglion cell axon profiles but also astrocyte processes, in physiological conditions, possess high levels of the protein. Neuroglobin mRNA and protein levels are ~\u00a010-fold higher in optic nerves than in retinas, indicating an important accumulation of neuroglobin in these support cells. Additionally, neuroglobin levels increase in M\u00fcller cells during reactive gliosis in response to eye injury. This suggests the pivotal role of neuroglobin in retinal glia involved in neuronal support and/or healing. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxygen Binding and Sensing Proteins.",

Mammalian Ngb is involved in neuroprotection under conditions of oxidative stress, such as ischemia and reperfusion. We previously found that zebrafish Ngb can penetrate the mammalian cell membrane. In the present study, we investigated the functional characteristics of fish Ngb by using the zebrafish cell line ZF4 and zebrafish retina. We found that zebrafish Ngb translocates into ZF4 cells, but cannot protect ZF4 cells against cell death induced by hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a chimeric ZHHH Ngb protein, in which module M1 of human Ngb is replaced by that of zebrafish, is a cell-membrane-penetrating protein that can protect ZF4 cells against hydrogen peroxide exposure. Moreover, we investigated the localization of Ngb mRNA and protein in zebrafish retina and found that Ngb mRNA is expressed in amacrine cells in the inner nuclear layer and is significantly increased in amacrine cells 3\u00a0days after optic nerve injury. Immunohistochemical studies clarified that Ngb protein levels were increased in both amacrine cells and presynaptic regions in the inner plexiform layer after nerve injury. Taken together, we hypothesize that fish Ngb, whose expression is upregulated in amacrine cells after optic nerve injury, might be released from amacrine cells, translocate into neighboring ganglion cells, and function in the early stage of optic nerve regeneration.

     "abstract": "A bioinformatics survey of putative globins in over 2200 bacterial and some 140 archaeal genomes revealed that over half the bacterial and approximately one fifth of archaeal genomes contain genes encoding globins that were classified into three families: the M (myoglobin-like), and S (sensor) families all exhibiting the canonical 3/3 myoglobin fold, and the T family (truncated myoglobin fold). Although the M family comprises 2 subfamilies, flavohemoglobins (FHbs) and single domain globins (SDgbs), the S family encompasses chimeric globin-coupled sensors (GCSs), single domain Pgbs (protoglobins) and SSDgbs (sensor single domain globins). The T family comprises three classes TrHb1s, TrHb2s and TrHb3s, characterized by the abbreviated 2/2 myoglobin fold. The Archaea contain only Pgbs, GCSs and TrHb1s. The smallest globin-bearing genomes are the streamlined genomes (~\u00a01.3\u00a0Mbp) of the SAR11 clade of alphaproteobacteria and the slightly larger (ca. 1.7\u00a0Mbp) genomes of Aquificae. The smallest genome with members of all three families is the 2.3\u00a0Mbp genome of the extremophile Methylacidiphilum infernorum (Verrumicrobia). Of the 147 possible combinations of the eight globin subfamilies, only 83 are observed. Although binary combinations are infrequent and ternary combinations are rare, the FHb\u00a0+\u00a0TrHb2 combination is the most commonly observed. Of the possible functions of bacterial globins we discuss the two principal ones \u2014 nitric oxide detoxification via the NO dioxygenase or denitrosylase activities and the sensing of oxygen concentration in the environmental niche.

     "abstract": "The (hemo-)globins are among the best-investigated proteins in biomedical sciences. These small heme-proteins play an important role in oxygen supply, but may also have other functions. In addition to well known hemoglobin and myoglobin, six other vertebrate globin types have been identified in recent years: neuroglobin, cytoglobin, globin E, globin X, globin Y, and androglobin. Analyses of the genome of the \u201cliving fossil\u201d Latimeria chalumnae show that the coelacanth is the only known vertebrate that includes all eight globin types. Thus, Latimeria can also be considered as a \u201cglobin fossil\u201d. Analyses of gene synteny and phylogenetic reconstructions allow us to trace the evolution and the functional changes of the vertebrate globin family. Neuroglobin and globin X diverged from the other globin types before the separation of Protostomia and Deuterostomia. The cytoglobins, which are unlikely to be involved in O2 supply, form the earliest globin branch within the jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomata), but do not group with the agnathan hemoglobins, as it has been proposed before. There is strong evidence from phylogenetic reconstructions and gene synteny that the eye-specific globin E and muscle-specific myoglobin constitute a common clade, suggesting a similar role in intracellular O2 supply. Latimeria possesses two \u03b1- and two \u03b2-hemoglobin chains, of which one \u03b1-chain emerged prior to the divergence of Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii, but has been retained only in the coelacanth. Notably, the embryonic hemoglobin \u03b1-chains of Gnathostomata derive from a common ancestor, while the embryonic \u03b2-chains \u2013 with the exception of a more complex pattern in the coelacanth and amphibians \u2013 display a clade-specific evolution. Globin Y is associated with the hemoglobin gene cluster, but its phylogenetic position is not resolved. Our data show an early divergence of distinct globin types in the vertebrate evolution before the emergence of tetrapods. The subsequent loss of globins in certain taxa may be associated with changes in the oxygen-dependent metabolism.

In keeping with the MaPgb*-\u0394N20 mutant crystal structure, here reported at 2.0\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, which shows an increased exposure of the haem propionates to the solvent, the analysis of ligand binding kinetics highlights high accessibility of ligands to the haem pocket in ferric MaPgb*-\u0394N20. CO binding to ferrous MaPgb*-\u0394N20 displays a marked biphasic behavior, with a fast binding process close to that observed in MaPgb* and a slow carbonylation process, characterized by a rate-limiting step. Conversely, removal of the first 33 residues induces a substantial perturbation of the overall MaPgb* structure, with loss of \u03b1-helical content and potential partial collapse of the protein chain. As such, ligand binding kinetics are characterized by very slow rates that are independent of ligand concentration, this being indicative of a high energy barrier for ligand access to the haem, possibly due to localized misfolding.

This mutant was originally engineered with the aim to mimic the catalytic site of heme\u2013copper oxidases. Comparison of the wild-type protein Mb and CuBMb shows that the copper ion in the distal pocket gives rise to significant effects on ligand binding to the heme iron. In Mb and copper-free CuBMb, primary and secondary ligand docking sites are accessible upon photodissociation. In copper-bound CuBMb, ligands do not migrate to secondary docking sites but rather coordinate to the copper ion. Ligands entering the heme pocket from the outside normally would not be captured efficiently by the tight distal pocket housing the two additional large imidazole rings. Binding at the Cu ion, however, ensures efficient trapping in CuBMb. The Cu ion also restricts the motions of the His64 side chain, which is the entry/exit door for ligand movement into the active site, and this restriction results in enhanced geminate and slow bimolecular CO rebinding. These results support current mechanistic views of ligand binding in hemoglobins and the role of the CuB in the active of heme\u2013copper oxidases.

     "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a new round of research on one of the most studied proteins - myoglobin (Mb), the oxygen (O2) carrier of skeletal and heart muscle. Two major discoveries have stimulated research in this field: 1) that Mb has additional protecting functions, such as the regulation of in vivo levels of the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) by scavenging and generating NO during normoxia and hypoxia, respectively; and 2) that Mb in vertebrates (particularly fish) is expressed as tissue-specific isoforms in other tissues than heart and skeletal muscle, such as vessel endothelium, liver and brain, as found in cyprinid fish. Furthermore, Mb has also been found to protect against oxidative stress after hypoxia and reoxygenation and to undergo allosteric, O2-linked S-nitrosation, as in rainbow trout. Overall, the emerging evidence, particularly from fish species, indicates that Mb fulfills a broader array of physiological functions in a wider range of different tissues than hitherto appreciated. This new knowledge helps to better understand how variations in Mb structure and function may correlate with differences in animals' lifestyles and hypoxia-tolerance. This review integrates old and new results on Mb expression patterns and functional properties amongst vertebrates and discusses how these may relate to adaptive variations in different species.

     "abstract": "Hemocyanin transports oxygen in the hemolymph of many molluscs and arthropods and is therefore a central physiological factor in these animals. Molluscan hemocyanin molecules are oligomers composed of many protein subunits that in turn encompass subsets of distinct functional units. The structure and evolution of molluscan hemocyanin have been studied for decades, but it required the recent progress in DNA sequencing, X-ray crystallography and 3D electron microscopy to produce a detailed view of their structure and evolution. The basic quaternary structure is a cylindrical decamer 35\u00a0nm in diameter, consisting of wall and collar (typically at one end of the cylinder). Depending on the animal species, decamers, didecamers and multidecamers occur in the hemolymph. Whereas the wall architecture of the decamer seems to be invariant, four different types of collar have been identified in different molluscan taxa. Correspondingly, there exist four subunit types that differ in their collar functional units and range from 350 to 550\u00a0kDa. Thus, molluscan hemocyanin subunits are among the largest polypeptides in nature. In this report, recent 3D reconstructions are used to explain and visualize the different functional units, subunits and quaternary structures of molluscan hemocyanins. Moreover, on the basis of DNA analyses and structural considerations, their possible evolution is traced. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxygen Binding and Sensing Proteins.",

Here we show that the temperature dependence of the two forms supports the idea, that the maintenance of high affinity towards oxygen is the driving force for the differential expression of these hemocyanins. Furthermore, the two different types of hemocyanin differ not only in the affinity to oxygen, but also with respect to their interaction with l-lactate: while the 12-meric form displays a normal shift in oxygen affinity upon the addition of l-lactate this allosteric regulation is absent in the 6-meric form. Exclusive binding of l-lactate to the 12-meric form was supported by isothermal titration calorimetry. These results indicate that l-lactate binds either at the interface between the two hexamers or at subunit \u03b1\u2032 which is responsible for the formation of the 12-mers and is not present in the 6-meric form. Urate has a comparable effect on the oxygen affinity of 6-meric and 12-meric forms and also binds to a similar extent to the oxygenated state as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Thus, urate and l-lactate do not seem to share the same binding sites. Interestingly, urate binding sites with no allosteric effect seem to exist, which is unusual.

     "abstract": "In the last decade, protein allostery has experienced a major resurgence, boosted by the extension of the concept to systems of increasing complexity and by its exploitation for the development of drugs. Expansion of the field into new directions has not diminished the key role of hemoglobin as a test molecule for theory and experimental validation of allosteric models. Indeed, the diffusion of hemoglobins in all kingdoms of life and the variety of functions and of quaternary assemblies based on a common tertiary fold indicate that this superfamily of proteins is ideally suited for investigating the physical and molecular basis of allostery and firmly maintains its role as a main player in the field.

     "abstract": "The absolute values of the O2-affinities (P50, Klow, and Khigh) of hemoglobin (Hb) are regulated neither by changes in the static T-/R-quaternary and associated tertiary structures nor the ligation states. They are pre-determined and regulated by the extrinsic environmental factors such as pH, buffers, and heterotropic effectors. The effect and role of O2 on Hb are reversibly to drive the structural allosteric equilibrium between the T(deoxy)- and R(oxy)-Hb toward R(oxy)-Hb (the structural allostery). R(oxy)-Hb has a higher O2-affinity (Khigh) relative to that (Klow) of the T(deoxy)-Hb (Khigh\u00a0>\u00a0Klow) under any fixed environmental conditions. The apparent O2-affinity of Hb is high, as the globin matrix interferes with the dissociation process of O2, forcing the dissociated O2 geminately to re-bind to the heme Fe. This artificially increases [oxy-Hb] and concomitantly decreases [deoxy-Hb], leading to the apparent increases of the O2-affinity of Hb. The effector-linked high-frequency thermal fluctuations of the globin matrix act as a gating mechanism to modulate such physical, energetic, and kinetic barriers to enhance the dissociation process of O2, resulted in increases in [deoxy-Hb] and concomitant decrease in [oxy-Hb], leading to apparent reductions of the O2-affinity of Hb (the entropic allostery). The heme in Hb is simply a low-affinity O2-trap, the coordination structure of which is not altered by static T-/R-quaternary and associated tertiary structural changes of Hb. Thus, heterotrophic effectors are the signal molecule, which acts as a functional link between these two allosteries and generates the diverse functionality of Hb of physiological relevance.

     "abstract": "Many fish hemoglobins exhibit a marked dependence of oxygen affinity and cooperativity on proton concentration, called Root effect. Both tertiary and quaternary effects have been evoked to explain the allosteric regulation brought about by protons in fish hemoglobins. However, no general rules have emerged so far. We carried out a complementary crystallographic and microspectroscopic characterization of ligand binding to crystals of deoxy-hemoglobin from the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii (HbTb) at pH\u00a06.2 and pH\u00a08.4. At low pH ligation has negligible structural effects, correlating with low affinity and absence of cooperativity in oxygen binding. At high pH, ligation causes significant changes at the tertiary structural level, while preserving structural markers of the T state. These changes mainly consist in a marked displacement of the position of the switch region CD corner towards an R-like position. The functional data on T-state crystals validate the relevance of the crystallographic observations, revealing that, differently from mammalian Hbs, in HbTb a significant degree of cooperativity in oxygen binding is due to tertiary conformational changes, in the absence of the T\u2013R quaternary transition.

NO in the vasculature is depleted by the oxidative reaction with oxy Hb or by binding to deoxy Hb to generate partially nitrosylated Hb (Hb\u2013NO). Many aspects of the formation and persistence of Hb\u2013NO are yet to be clarified. In this study, we used a combination of EPR and visible absorption spectroscopy to investigate the interactions of partially nitrosylated Hb with O2. Partially nitrosylated Hb samples had predominantly hexacoordinate NO\u2013heme geometry and resisted oxidation when exposed to O2 in the absence of anionic allosteric effectors. Faster oxidation occurred in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) or inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), where the NO\u2013heme derivatives had higher levels of pentacoordinate heme geometry. The anion-dependence of the NO\u2013heme geometry also affected O2 binding equilibria. O2-binding curves of partially nitrosylated Hb in the absence of anions were left-shifted at low saturations, indicating destabilization of the low O2 affinity T-state of the Hb by increasing percentages of NO\u2013heme, much as occurs with increasing levels of CO\u2013heme. Samples containing IHP showed small decreases in O2 affinity, indicating shifts toward the low-affinity T-state and formation of inert \u03b1-NO/\u03b2-met tetramers. Most remarkably, O2-equilibria in the presence of the physiological effector DPG were essentially unchanged by up to 30% NO\u2013heme in the samples. As will be discussed, under physiological conditions the interactions of Hb with NO provide protection against nitrosative damage without impairing O2 transport by Hb's unoccupied heme sites.

Tf-trHb contains three polar residues in the distal site, namely TrpG8, TyrCD1 and TyrB10. Whereas TrpG8 can act as a potential hydrogen-bond donor, the tyrosines can act as donors or acceptors. Ligand binding in heme-containing proteins is determined by a number of factors, including the nature and conformation of the distal residues and their capability to stabilize the heme-bound ligand via hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since both the RR Fe\u2013OH\u2212 and Fe\u2013CN\u2212 frequencies are very sensitive to the distal environment, detailed information on structural variations has been obtained. The hydroxyl ligand binds only the WT protein giving rise to two different conformers. In form 1 the anion is stabilized by H-bonds with TrpG8, TyrCD1 and a water molecule, in turn H-bonded to TyrB10. In form 2, H-bonding with TyrCD1 is mediated by a water molecule. Unlike the OH\u2212 ligand, CN\u2212 binds both WT and the triple mutant giving rise to two forms with similar spectroscopic characteristics. The overall results clearly indicate that H-bonding interactions both with distal residues and water molecules are important structural determinants in the active site of Tf-trHb.

PCC 7002, GlbN, coordinates the heme iron with two histidines and exists either with a b heme or with a covalently attached heme. The binding of exogenous ligands displaces the distal histidine and induces a conformational rearrangement involving the reorganization of internal void volumes. The formation of passageways within the resulting conformation is thought to facilitate ligand exchange and play a functional role. Here we monitored the perturbation induced by pressure on the ferric bis-histidine and cyanide-bound states of GlbN using 1H\u201315N HSQC NMR spectroscopy. We inspected the outcome with a statistical analysis of 170 homologous 2/2 hemoglobin sequences. We found that the compression landscape of GlbN, as represented by the variation of an average chemical shift parameter, was highly sensitive to ligand swapping and heme covalent attachment. Stabilization of rare conformers was observed at high pressures and consistent with cavity redistribution upon ligand binding. In all states, the EF loop was found to be exceptionally labile to pressure, suggesting a functional role as a semi-flexible hinge between the adjacent helices. Finally, coevolved clusters presented a common pattern of compensating pressure responses. The high-pressure dissection combined with protein sequence analysis established locations with volumetric signatures relevant to residual communication of 2/2 hemoglobins.

     "abstract": "In a cold and oxygen-rich environment such as Antarctica, mechanisms for the defence against reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are needed and represent important components in the evolutionary adaptations. In the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, the presence of multiple genes encoding 2/2 haemoglobins and a flavohaemoglobin strongly suggests that these proteins fulfil important physiological roles, perhaps associated to the peculiar features of the Antarctic habitat. In this work, the putative role of Ph-2/2HbO, encoded by the PSHAa0030 gene, was investigated by in vivo and in vitro experiments in order to highlight its involvement in NO detoxification mechanisms. The PSHAa0030 gene was cloned and then over-expressed in a flavohaemoglobin-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli, unable to metabolise NO, and the resulting strain was studied analysing its growth properties and oxygen uptake in the presence of NO. We here demonstrate that Ph-2/2HbO protects growth and cellular respiration of the heterologous host from the toxic effect of NO-donors. Unlike in Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2/2 HbN, the deletion of the N-terminal extension of Ph-2/2HbO does not seem to reduce the NO scavenging activity, showing that the N-terminal extension is not a requirement for efficient NO detoxification. Moreover, the ferric form of Ph-2/2HbO was shown to catalyse peroxynitrite isomerisation in vitro, confirming its potential role in the scavenging of reactive nitrogen species.

     "abstract": "Kinetic studies were performed on ligand rebinding to a cold-adapted globin of the Antarctic bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 (Ph-2/2HbO). This 2/2 hemoglobin displays a rapid spectroscopic phase that is independent of CO concentration, followed by the standard bimolecular recombination. While the geminate recombination usually occurs on a ns timescale, Ph-2/2HbO displays a component of about 1\u00a0\u03bcs that accounts for half of the geminate phase at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, indicative of a relatively slow internal ligand binding. The O2 binding kinetics were measured in competition with CO to allow a short-time exposure of the deoxy hemes to O2 before CO replacement. Indeed Ph-2/2HbO is readily oxidised in the presence of O2, probably due to a superoxide character of the FeO2 bond induced by of a hydrogen-bond donor amino-acid residue. Upon O2 release or iron oxidation a distal residue (probably Tyr) is able to reversibly bind to the heme and as such to compete for binding with an external ligand. The transient hexacoordinated ferrous His\u2013Fe\u2013Tyr conformation after O2 dissociation could initiate the electron transfer from the iron toward its final acceptor, molecular O2 under our conditions. The hexacoordination via the distal Tyr is only partial, indicating a weak interaction between Tyr and the heme under atmospheric pressure. Hydrostatic high pressure enhances the hexacoordination indicating a flexible globin that allows structural changes. The O2 binding affinity for Ph-2/2HbO, poorly affected by the competition with Tyr, is about 1\u00a0Torr at 8\u00a0\u00b0C, pH\u00a07.0, which is compatible for an in vivo O2 binding function; however, this globin is more likely involved in a redox reaction associating diatomic ligands and their derived oxidative species.

To gain further insights into the roles of hemoglobin in the brain, we examined its quaternary structure in dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that (i) in mouse dopaminergic cell line stably over-expressing \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, hemoglobin exists as an \u03b12\u03b22 tetramer; (ii) similarly to the over-expressed protein, endogenous hemoglobin forms a tetramer of 64\u00a0kDa; (iii) hemoglobin also forms high molecular weight insoluble aggregates; and (iv) endogenous hemoglobin retains its tetrameric structure in mouse mesencephalon in vivo.

Here we report the crystal structure of Arabidopsis class I hemoglobin (AHb1) to 2.2\u00a0\u01fa and compare its key features with the structures of similar nonsymbiotic hemoglobin from other species. Crystal structure of AHb1 is homologous to the related members with similar globin fold and heme pocket architecture. The structure is homodimeric in the asymmetric unit with both distal and proximal histidines coordinating to the heme iron atom. Residues lining the dimeric interface are also conserved in AHb1 with the exception of additional electrostatic interaction between H112 and E113 of each subunit and that involving Y119 through two water molecules. In addition, differences in heme pocket non-covalent interactions, a novel Ser residue at F7 position, Xe binding site variability, internal cavity topology differences, CD loop conformation and stability and other such properties might explain kinetic variability in AHb1. Detailed cavity analysis of AHb1 showed the presence of a novel long tunnel connecting the distal pockets of both the monomers. Presence of such tunnel, along with conformational heterogeneity observed in the two chains, might suggest cooperative ligand binding and support its role in NO scavenging.

     "abstract": "This study reports a comparative analysis of the topological properties of inner cavities and the intrinsic dynamics of non-symbiotic hemoglobins AHb1 and AHb2 from Arabidopsis thaliana. The two proteins belong to the 3/3 globin fold and have a sequence identity of about 60%. However, it is widely assumed that they have distinct physiological roles. In order to investigate the structure\u2013function relationships in these proteins, we have examined the bis-histidyl and ligand-bound hexacoordinated states by atomistic simulations using in silico structural models. The results allow us to identify two main pathways to the distal cavity in the bis-histidyl hexacoordinated proteins. Nevertheless, a larger accessibility to small gaseous molecules is found in AHb2. This effect can be attributed to three factors: the mutation Leu35(AHb1)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Phe32(AHb2), the enhanced flexibility of helix B, and the more favorable energetic profile for ligand migration to the distal cavity. The net effect of these factors would be to facilitate the access of ligands, thus compensating the preference for the fully hexacoordination of AHb2, in contrast to the equilibrium between hexa- and pentacoordinated species in AHb1. On the other hand, binding of the exogenous ligand introduces distinct structural changes in the two proteins. A well-defined tunnel is formed in AHb1, which might be relevant to accomplish the proposed NO detoxification reaction. In contrast, no similar tunnel is found in AHb2, which can be ascribed to the reduced flexibility of helix E imposed by the larger number of salt bridges compared to AHb1. This feature would thus support the storage and transport functions proposed for AHb2. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxygen Binding and Sensing Proteins.",

To further exploit the pattern and properties of the ubiquitination sites and their flanking residues, three additional SVM classifiers were constructed using the binary amino acid encoding, the AAindex physicochemical property encoding and the protein aggregation propensity encoding, respectively. Through an integration that relied on logistic regression, the resulting predictor termed hCKSAAP_UbSite achieved an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.770 in 5-fold cross-validation test on a class-balanced training dataset. When tested on a class-balanced independent testing dataset that contains 3419 ubiquitination sites, hCKSAAP_UbSite has also achieved a robust performance with an AUC of 0.757. Specifically, it has consistently performed better than the predictor using the CKSAAP encoding alone and two other publicly available predictors which are not human-specific. Given its promising performance in our large-scale datasets, hCKSAAP_UbSite has been made publicly available at our server (http://protein.cau.edu.cn/cksaap_ubsite/).",

It binds to Ni2\u00a0+-NTA-agarose, and is structurally and functionally very similar to PA2 albumins isolated from legume seeds and the hemopexin fold protein from rice.

The aim of this study was not only to perform the deepest investigation so far of the lemon peel proteome but also to assess the genuineness of the commercial liqueur via a three-pronged attack. First, different extraction techniques have been used for the characterization of the peel (and additionally of the pulp) proteome, secondly a home-made infusion has been analysed and finally the proteome of the commercial drink was checked. The peel (the flavedo, not the underlying layer called albedo) proteome has been evaluated via prior capture with CPLLs at different pH values (2.2 and 7.2). Via mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered fractions, after elution of the captured populations in 4% boiling SDS, we could identify a total of 1011 unique gene products in the peel extracts and 674 in the pulp, 264 proteins in the home-made infusion and just 8 proteins (and protein fragments), together with 12 peptides, in one Italian Limoncello produced in the Sorrento Region, thus proving the genuineness of this product. On the contrary, cheaper Limoncellos were devoid of any protein/peptide, casting doubts on their production from vegetable extracts. This could be the starting point for investigating the genuineness and natural origin of commercial drinks in order to protect consumers from adulterated products.",

Molecular dynamics through structure-based models (SB) is an effective tool for assessing the tridimensional arrangement of chimeric enzymes as well as for inferring the functional practicability before experimental validation. This study describes the computational design of a bifunctional xylanase\u2013lichenase chimera (XylLich) using the xynA and bglS genes from Bacillus subtilis. In silico analysis of the average solvent accessible surface area (SAS) and the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) predicted a fully functional chimera, with minor fluctuations and variations along the polypeptide chains. Afterwards, the chimeric enzyme was built by fusing the xynA and bglS genes. XylLich was evaluated through small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, resulting in scattering curves with a very accurate fit to the theoretical protein model. The chimera preserved the biochemical characteristics of the parental enzymes, with the exception of a slight variation in the temperature of operation and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km). The absence of substantial shifts in the catalytic mode of operation was also verified. Furthermore, the production of chimeric enzymes could be more profitable than producing a single enzyme separately, based on comparing the recombinant protein production yield and the hydrolytic activity achieved for XylLich with that of the parental enzymes.",

We identified seven binding sites for bis-ANS on lipase using computational docking and MD simulation and verified these data using a set of single amino acid substituted mutants. Docking and MD simulation studies indicated that the binding sites were various indentations and grooves on protein surface with hydrophobic characteristics. Both hydrophobic and ionic interactions were involved in each of these binding events. We further examine the fluorescence properties of bis-ANS bound to mutant lipases that either gained or lost a binding site. Our results indicated that neither gain nor loss of single binding site caused any change in fluorescence lifetimes (and their relative amplitudes) of mutant lipase-bound bis-ANS in comparison to that bound to wild type; hence, it suggested that nature of bis-ANS binding to each of the sites in lipase was very similar.",

The hydrolysis activity of BTSA was inhibited by a transition state analogue, 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetyl neuraminic acid, by competitive inhibition with a Ki value of 35\u00a0\u03bcM. The structure of BSTA was determined at a resolution of 2.3\u00a0\u00c5. This structure exhibited a unique carbohydrate-binding domain (CBM) at its N-terminus (a.a. 23\u2013190) that is adjacent to the catalytic domain (a.a. 191\u2013535). The catalytic domain has a conserved arginine triad with a wide-open entrance for the substrate that exposes the catalytic residue to the surface. Unlike other pathogenic sialidases, the polysaccharide-binding site in the CBM is near the active site and possibly holds and positions the polysaccharide substrate directly at the active site. The structural feature of a wide substrate-binding groove and closer proximity of the polysaccharide-binding site to the active site could be a unique signature of the commensal sialidase BTSA and provide a molecular basis for its pharmaceutical application.",

     "abstract": "Specification of the three dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, also called a \u201cGrand Challenge\u201d problem, has eluded a solution for over six decades. A modestly successful strategy has evolved over the last couple of decades based on development of scoring functions (e.g. mimicking free energy) that can capture native or native-like structures from an ensemble of decoys generated as plausible candidates for the native structure. A scoring function must be fast enough in discriminating the native from unfolded/misfolded structures, and requires validation on a large data set(s) to generate sufficient confidence in the score. Here we develop a scoring function called pcSM that detects true native structure in the top 5 with 93% accuracy from an ensemble of candidate structures. If we eliminate the native from ensemble of decoys then pcSM is able to capture near native structure (RMSD\u00a0<\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u01fa) in top 10 with 86% accuracy. The parameters considered in pcSM are a C-alpha Euclidean metric, secondary structural propensity, surface areas and an intramolecular energy function. pcSM has been tested on 415 systems consisting 142,698 decoys (public and CASP\u2014largest reported hitherto in literature). The average rank for the native is 2.38, a significant improvement over that existing in literature. In-silico protein structure prediction requires robust scoring technique(s). Therefore, pcSM is easily amenable to integration into a successful protein structure prediction strategy. The tool is freely available at http://www.scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/pcsm.jsp.",

The mechanism of thermal inactivation of Cel6A is consistent with disulfide bond degradation and thiol\u2013disulfide exchange. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that a thermostable variant lacking free cysteines refolds to a native-like structure and retains activity after heat treatment over the pH range 5\u20139.

Missense mutations in the protein lead to ADSL deficiency, an inborn error of purine metabolism characterized by neurological and physiological symptoms. ADSL deficiency is biochemically diagnosed by elevated levels of succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado), the dephosphorylated derivatives of the substrates. S-Ado/SAICAr ratios have been associated with three phenotypic groups. Different hypotheses to explain these ratios have been proposed. Recent studies have focused on measuring activity on the substrates independently. However, it is important to examine mixtures of the substrates to determine if mutations affect enzyme activity on both substrates similarly in these conditions. The two substrates may experience an indirect communication due to being acted upon by the same enzyme, altering their activities from the non-competitive case. In this study, we investigate this hidden coupling between the two substrates. We chose two mutations that represent extremes of the phenotype, R426H and R303C. We describe a novel electrochemical-detection method of measuring the kinetic activity of ADSL in solution with its two substrates at varying concentration ratios. Furthermore, we develop an enzyme kinetic model to predict substrate activity from a given ratio of substrate concentrations. Our findings indicate a non-linear dependence of the activities on the substrate ratios due to competitive binding, distinct differences in the behaviors of the different mutations, and S-Ado/SAICAr ratios in patients could be explained by inherent properties of the mutant enzyme.",

Activities of Ccm proteins span from the chaperoning of heme b in the periplasm to the specific reduction of oxidized apocytochrome (apoCyt) cysteine residues and to chaperoning and recognition of the unfolded apoCyt before covalent attachment of the heme to the cysteine thiols can occur. We present here the functional characterization of the periplasmic domain of CcmI from the pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa-CcmI*). Pa-CcmI* is composed of a TPR domain and a peculiar C-terminal domain. Pa-CcmI* fulfills both the ability to recognize and bind to P. aeruginosa apo-cytochrome c551 (Pa-apoCyt) and a chaperoning activity towards unfolded proteins, as it prevents citrate synthase aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. Equilibrium and kinetic experiments with Pa-CcmI*, or its isolated domains, with peptides mimicking portions of Pa-apoCyt sequence allow us to quantify the molecular details of the interaction between Pa-apoCyt and Pa-CcmI*. Binding experiments show that the interaction occurs at the level of the TPR domain and that the recognition is mediated mainly by the C-terminal sequence of Pa-apoCyt. The affinity of Pa-CcmI* to full-length Pa-apoCyt or to its C-terminal sequence is in the range expected for a component of a multi-protein complex, whose task is to receive the apoCyt and to deliver it to other components of the apoCyt:heme b ligation protein machinery.",

It is activated by a small oligonucleotide (2\u20135A) whose synthesis is initiated as part of the interferon response. Binding of 2\u20135A to the N-terminal regulatory region, the ANK domain, of RNase L activates its ribonuclease activity and results in cleavage of RNA in the cell, which ultimately leads to apoptosis of the infected cell. The mechanism by which 2\u20135A activates the ribonuclease activity of RNase L is currently unclear but 2\u20135A has been shown to induce dimerization of RNase L. To investigate the importance of dimerization of RNase L, we developed a 15\u00a0kDa dimerization-inducing protein domain that was fused to the N-terminus of RNase L. From these studies we provide direct evidence that dimerization of RNase L occurs at physiologically relevant protein concentrations and correlates with activation of ribonuclease activity. We also show that the binding of 2\u20135A to RNase L promotes dimerization of the ANK domain and suggest how this could transmit a signal to the rest of the protein to activate ribonuclease activity. Finally, we show that the dimerization-inducing domain can be used as a general fusion partner to aid in protein expression and purification.",

Hyperhomocysteinemia has been linked to cardiovascular diseases, and defects in methyl group metabolism, often resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia, are among the key molecular events postulated to play a role in liver injury. We employed proteomics and metabolomics analyses of human hepatocytes in primary cell culture to explore the spectrum of proteins and associated metabolites affected by the disruption of methyl group metabolism. We treated the hepatocytes with homocysteine (Hcy, 0.1\u00a0mM and 2\u00a0mM) to follow the impact of hyperhomocysteinemia, and in parallel, we used a specific inhibitor of betaine\u2013homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) to extend our understanding of the physiological functions of the enzyme. The major effect of BHMT inhibition was a 50% decrease in S-adenosylmethionine levels. The treatments with Hcy resulted in multiple changes in the metabolite levels depending on the treatment modality. The BHMT inhibition and 0.1\u00a0mM Hcy treatment induced only moderate changes in the hepatocyte proteome and secretome, while the changes induced by the 2\u00a0mM Hcy treatment were extensive. Phosphatidylethanolamine carboxykinase and ornithine aminotransferase were up-regulated about two fold indicating an intervention into metabolism. Cellular proliferation was suspended, secretome composition was changed and signs of apoptosis were discernible. We have detected fibrinogen gamma dimers, which might have a role as a potentially new biomarker of early liver injury. Finally, we have demonstrated the failed maturation of apolipoprotein A1, which might be a new mechanism of disruption of cholesterol efflux from tissues.",

The occurrence of sequence microheterogeneity in major fish allergen, parvalbumin (PA), has been explored using bioinformatics approaches. 44% of 111 species with known PA sequence have PA isoforms. 41% of these species exhibit from 1 to 4 cases of PA sequence microheterogeneity, i.e. unique pairs of PA isoforms with sequence identity above 90%. 29% of 210 PA sequences studied are characterized by microheterogeneity. The occurrence of allergens among them is 2.5-fold higher than among other PAs. The incidence of sequence microheterogeneity within more allergenic \u03b2 isoform of PA is 2.0-fold lower than that for its less allergenic \u03b1 isoform. 39 residues affected by PA microheterogeneity are concentrated in the region of helices A, B, F, while helices D and E are the most conservative region. 44% and 11% of the microheterogeneous substitutions are located in the species-specific and cross-reactive IgE-binding epitopes of PAs, respectively. 45% and 48% of the substitution cases are predicted to cause notable changes in protein disorder propensity and protein stability, respectively. Hence, the increased allergenicity rate among PAs having microheterogeneous isoforms can be related to differences in their IgE-binding caused directly or in an allosteric manner. Overall, sequence microheterogeneity is shown to be inherent to many of PAs and likely contributes to PA allergenicity.",

Further, its fibrillar morphology can be altered by externally controlled conditions. Freezing and thawing led to amyloid fibril formation which was accompanied by loss of RsAFP-19 antifungal activity. A second, closely related antifungal peptide displayed no fibril-forming capacity.

There are no definite in vitro systems to support the hypothesis that the vascular basement membrane may act as a scaffold of amyloid \u03b2-peptide carried by perivascular drainage flow and accelerate its amyloid fibril formation in vivo. We previously reported the critical roles of interfaces and agitation on the nucleation of amyloid fibrils at low concentrations of amyloid \u03b2-peptide monomers.

Using the initiation time of fibril growth kinetics (i.e., the lag time of fibril growth during which nuclei, on-pathway oligomers and protofibrils are successively formed) as a parameter of the efficiency of biological molecules to induce amyloid fibril formation, we found that basement membrane components including Matrigel, laminin, fibronectin, collagen type IV and fibrinogen accelerate the initiation of amyloid \u03b2-peptide fibril growth in vitro.

     "abstract": "Nedd4-1 (neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated gene 4-1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with and negatively regulates the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). The WW domains of Nedd4-1 bind to the ENaC subunits via recognition of PY motifs. Human Nedd4-1 (hNedd4-1) contains four WW domains with the third domain (WW3*) showing the strongest affinity to the PY motif. To understand the mechanism underlying this binding affinity, we have carried out NMR structural and dynamics analyses of the hNedd4-1 WW3* domain in complex with a peptide comprising the C-terminal tail of the human ENaC \u03b1-subunit. The structure reveals that the peptide interacts in a similar manner to other WW domain\u2013ENaC peptide structures. Crucial interactions that likely provide binding affinity are the broad XP groove facilitating additional contacts between the WW3* domain and the peptide, compared to similar complexes, and the large surface area buried (83\u00a0\u00c52) between R430 (WW3*) and L647\u2032 (\u03b1ENaC). This corroborates the model-free analysis of the 15N backbone relaxation data, which showed that R430 is the most rigid residue in the domain (S2\u00a0=\u00a00.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01). Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill relaxation dispersion analysis identified two different conformational exchange processes on the \u03bcs\u2013ms time-scale. One of these processes involves residues located at the peptide binding interface, suggesting conformational exchange may play a role in peptide recognition. Thus, both structural and dynamic features of the complex appear to define the high binding affinity. The results should aid interpretation of biochemical data and modeling interfaces between Nedd4-1 and other interacting proteins.",

Occupancy refinement of the catalytic triad in the active site of API free-form showed that ca. 30% of the imidazole ring of H57 and ca. 70% of the hydroxyl group of S194 were deuterated. This observation indicates that a major fraction of S194 is protonated in the absence of a substrate. The protonation state of the catalytic triad in API was compared with the bovine \u03b2-trypsin\u2013BPTI complex. The comparison led to the hypothesis that close contact of a substrate with S194 could lower the acidity of its hydroxyl group, thereby allowing H57 to extract the hydrogen from the hydroxyl group of S194. H210, which is a residue specific to API, does not form a hydrogen bond with the catalytic triad residue D113. Instead, H210 forms a hydrogen bond network with S176, H177 and a water molecule. The close proximity of the bulky, hydrophobic residue W169 may protect this hydrogen bond network, and this protection may stabilize the function of API over a wide pH range.",

     "abstract": "Recent research in the protein intrinsic disorder was stimulated by the availability of accurate computational predictors. However, most of these methods are relatively slow, especially considering proteome-scale applications, and were shown to produce relatively large errors when estimating disorder at the protein- (in contrast to residue-) level, which is defined by the fraction/content of disordered residues. To this end, we propose a novel support vector Regression-based Accurate Predictor of Intrinsic Disorder (RAPID). Key advantages of RAPID are speed (prediction of an average-size eukaryotic proteome takes <\u00a01\u00a0h on a modern desktop computer); sophisticated design (multiple, complementary information sources that are aggregated over an input chain are combined using feature selection); and high-quality and robust predictive performance. Empirical tests on two diverse benchmark datasets reveal that RAPID's predictive performance compares favorably to a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art disorder and disorder content predictors. Drawing on high speed and good predictive quality, RAPID was used to perform large-scale characterization of disorder in 200\u00a0+ fully sequenced eukaryotic proteomes. Our analysis reveals interesting relations of disorder with structural coverage and chain length, and unusual distribution of fully disordered chains. We also performed a comprehensive (using 56000+ annotated chains, which doubles the scope of previous studies) investigation of cellular functions and localizations that are enriched in the disorder in the human proteome.

     "abstract": "The first protein kinase structure, solved in 1991, revealed the fold that is shared by all members of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily and showed how the conserved sequence motifs cluster mostly around the active site. This structure of the PKA catalytic (C) subunit showed also how a single phosphate integrated the entire molecule. Since then the EPKs have become a major drug target, second only to the G-protein coupled receptors. Although PKA provided a mechanistic understanding of catalysis that continues to serve as a prototype for the family, by comparing many active and inactive kinases we subsequently discovered a hydrophobic spine architecture that is a characteristic feature of all active kinases. The ways in which the regulatory spine is dynamically assembled is the defining feature of each protein kinase. Protein kinases have thus evolved to be molecular switches, like the G-proteins, and unlike metabolic enzymes which have evolved to be efficient catalysis. PKA also shows how the dynamic tails surround the core and serve as essential regulatory elements. The phosphorylation sites in PKA, introduced both co- and post-translationally, are very stable. The resulting C-subunit is then packaged as an inhibited holoenzyme with cAMP-binding regulatory (R) subunits so that PKA activity is regulated exclusively by cAMP, not by the dynamic turnover of an activation loop phosphate. We could not understand activation and inhibition without seeing structures of R:C complexes; however, to appreciate the structural uniqueness of each R2:C2 holoenzyme required solving structures of tetrameric holoenzymes. It is these tetrameric holoenzymes that are localized to discrete sites in the cell, typically by A Kinase Anchoring Proteins where they create discrete foci for PKA signaling. Understanding these dynamic macromolecular complexes is the challenge that we now face. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Inhibitors of Protein Kinases (2012).",

     "abstract": "All known protein kinases share a bilobal kinase domain with well conserved structural elements. Because of significant structural similarities of nucleotide binding pocket, the development of highly selective kinase inhibitors is a very challenging task. Flavonols, naturally occurring plant metabolites, have long been known to inhibit kinases by mimicking the adenine moiety. Interestingly, recent data show that some flavonol glycosides are more selective, although underlying mechanisms were unknown. Crystallographic data from our laboratory revealed that the N-terminal kinase domain of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, isoform 2, binds three different flavonol rhamnosides in a highly unusual manner, distinct from other kinase inhibitor interactions. The kinase domain undergoes a reorganization of several structural elements in response to the binding of the inhibitors. Specifically, the main \u03b2-sheet of the N-lobe undergoes a twisting rotation by ~\u00a056\u00b0 around an axis passing through the N- and C-lobes, leading to the restructuring of the canonical ATP-binding pocket into pockets sterically adapted to the inhibitor shape. The flavonol rhamnosides appear to adopt compact, but strained conformations with the rhamnose moiety swept under the B-ring of flavonol, unlike the structure of the free counterparts in solution. These data suggest that the flavonol glycoside scaffold could be used as a template for new inhibitors selective for the RSK family.

     "abstract": "The RIO kinases are essential protein factors required for the synthesis of new ribosomes in eukaryotes. Conserved in archaeal organisms as well, RIO kinases are among the most ancient of protein kinases. Their exact molecular mechanisms are under investigation and progress of this research would be significantly improved with the availability of suitable molecular probes that selectively block RIO kinases. RIO kinases contain a canonical eukaryotic protein kinase fold, but also display several unusual structural features that potentially create opportunity for the design of selective inhibitors. In an attempt to identify structural leads to target the RIO kinases, a series of pyridine caffeic acid benzyl amides (CABA) were tested for their ability to inhibit the autophosphorylation activity of Archeaoglobus fulgidus Rio1 (AfRio1). Screening of a small library of CABA molecules resulted in the identification of four compounds that measurably inhibited AfRio1 activity. Additional biochemical characterization of binding and inhibition activity of these compounds demonstrated an ATP competitive inhibition mode, and allowed identification of the functional groups that result in the highest binding affinity. In addition, docking of the compound to the structure of Rio1 and determination of the X-ray crystal structure of a model compound (WP1086) containing the desired functional groups allowed detailed analysis of the interactions between these compounds and the enzyme. Furthermore, the X-ray crystal structure demonstrated that these compounds stabilize an inactive form of the enzyme. Taken together, these results provide an important step in identification of a scaffold for the design of selective molecular probes to study molecular mechanisms of Rio1 kinases in vitro and in vivo. In addition, it provides a rationale for the future design of potent inhibitors with drug-like properties targeting an inactive form of the enzyme.

This group is also widely represented in other eukaryotes, including causative organisms of human infectious diseases. AGC kinases are involved in diverse cellular functions and are potential targets for the treatment of human diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, neurological disorders, inflammation and viral infections. Small molecule inhibitors of AGC kinases may also have potential as novel therapeutic approaches against infectious organisms. Fundamental in the regulation of many AGC kinases is a regulatory site termed the \u201cPIF-pocket\u201d that serves as a docking site for substrates of PDK1. This site is also essential to the mechanism of activation of AGC kinases by phosphorylation and is involved in the allosteric regulation of N-terminal domains of several AGC kinases, such as PKN/PRKs and atypical PKCs. In addition, the C-terminal tail and its interaction with the PIF-pocket are involved in the dimerization of the DMPK family of kinases and may explain the molecular mechanism of allosteric activation of GRKs by GPCR substrates. In this review, we briefly introduce the AGC kinases and their known roles in physiology and disease and the discovery of the PIF-pocket as a regulatory site in AGC kinases. Finally, we summarize the current status and future therapeutic potential of small molecules directed to the PIF-pocket; these molecules can allosterically activate or inhibit the kinase as well as act as substrate-selective inhibitors.

Specifically, we demonstrated that the backbone torsion-angles of residues in the catalytic loop switch from a \u201crelaxed\u201d to \u201cstrained\u201d conformation upon kinase activation and the strained geometry results in a network of hydrogen bonds involving conserved non-catalytic residues in the ATP and substrate binding lobes. Here, we further explore this activation mechanism by analyzing families that lack the canonical hydrogen bonding interactions with the strained backbone. We find that alternative mechanisms have evolved to maintain catalytic loop strain. In PIM kinase, for example, two water molecules account for the lack of a conserved aspartate in the substrate binding by hydrogen bonds to the strained backbone. We discuss the relevance of these findings in the design of family-specific allosteric inhibitors, and in predicting the structural and functional impact of cancer mutations that alter the strain associated hydrogen bonding network.

     "abstract": "Completion of the life cycle of malaria parasite requires a succession of developmental stages which vary greatly with respect to proliferation status, implying a tightly regulated control of the parasite's cell cycle, which remains to be understood at the molecular level. Progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle is controlled by members of mitotic kinase of the families CDK (cyclin-dependent kinases), Aurora, Polo and NIMA. Plasmodium parasites possess cyclin-dependent protein kinases and cyclins, which strongly suggests that some of the principles underlying cell cycle control in higher eukaryotes also operate in this organism. However, atypical features of Plasmodium cell cycle organization and important divergences in the composition of the cell cycle machinery suggest the existence of regulatory mechanisms that are at variance with those of higher eukaryotes. This review focuses on several recently described Plasmodium protein kinases related to the NIMA and Aurora kinase families and discusses their functional involvement in parasite's biology. Given their demonstrated essential roles in the erythrocytic asexual cycle and/or sexual stages, these enzymes represent novel potential drug targets for antimalarial intervention aiming at inhibiting parasite replication and/or blocking transmission of the disease.

The recently solved structure of the PKG regulatory domain showed the presence of the switch helix (SW), a novel motif that promotes the formation of a domain-swapped dimer in the asymmetric unit. This dimer is mediated by the interaction of a knob motif on the C-terminal locus of the SW, with a hydrophobic nest on the opposing protomer. This nest sits adjacent to the cGMP binding pocket of the B-site. Priming of this site by cGMP may influence the geometry of the hydrophobic nest. Moreover, this unique interaction may have wide implications for the architecture of the inactive and active forms of PKG.

     "abstract": "Since protein kinases have been implicated in numerous human diseases, kinase inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutic agents. Despite this promise, there has been a relative lag in the development of unbiased strategies to validate both inhibitor specificity and the ability to inhibit target activity within living cells. To overcome these limitations, our efforts have been focused on the development of systematic strategies that employ chemical and functional proteomics. We utilized these strategies to evaluate small molecule inhibitors of protein kinase CK2, a constitutively active kinase that has recently emerged as target for anti-cancer therapy in clinical trials. Our chemical proteomics strategies used ATP or CK2 inhibitors immobilized on sepharose beads together with mass spectrometry to capture and identify binding partners from cell extracts. These studies have verified that interactions between CK2 and its inhibitors occur in complex mixtures. However, in the case of CK2 inhibitors related to 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB), our work has also revealed off-targets for the inhibitors. To complement these studies, we devised functional proteomics approaches to identify proteins that exhibit decreases in phosphorylation when cells are treated with CK2 inhibitors. To identify and validate those proteins that are direct substrates for CK2, we have also employed mutants of CK2 with decreased inhibitor sensitivity. Overall, our studies have yielded systematic platforms for studying CK2 inhibitors which we believe will foster efforts to define the biological functions of CK2 and to rigorously investigate its potential as a candidate for molecular-targeted therapy.

Many previous analyses of the glioma kinome have identified key deregulated pathways that converge and activate mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Following the identification and characterization of mTOR-promoting activity in gliomagenesis, data from preclinical studies suggested the targeting of mTOR by rapamycin or its analogs (rapalogs) as a promising therapeutic approach. However, clinical trials with rapalogs have shown very limited efficacy on glioma due to the development of resistance mechanisms. Analysis of rapalog-insensitive glioma cells has revealed increased activity of growth and survival pathways compensating for mTOR inhibition by rapalogs that are suitable for therapeutic intervention. In addition, recently developed mTOR inhibitors show high anti-glioma activity. In this review, we recapitulate the regulation of mTOR signaling and its involvement in gliomagenesis, discuss mechanisms resulting in resistance to rapalogs, and speculate on strategies to overcome resistance.

GFP-based reporters and genetically-encoded FRET biosensors, have been successfully applied to study protein kinases in living cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. In parallel, combined efforts in fluorescence chemistry and in chemical biology have enabled the design of non-genetic, polypeptide biosensors coupled to small synthetic fluorescent probes, which have been applied to monitor protein kinase activities in vitro and in more complex biological samples, with an equally successful outcome. From a biomedical perspective, fluorescent biosensor technology is well suited to development of diagnostic approaches, for monitoring disease progression and for evaluating response to therapeutics. Moreover it constitutes an attractive technology for drug discovery programs, for high content, high throughput screening assays, to assess the potency of new hits and optimize lead compounds, whilst also serving to characterize drugs developed through rational design.

These domains, called PTS regulation domains (PRDs), usually contain two conserved histidines as potential phosphorylation sites. While antiterminators possess two PRDs with four phosphorylation sites, transcription activators contain two PRDs plus two regulatory domains resembling PTS components (EIIA and EIIB). The activity of these transcription regulators is controlled by up to five phosphorylations catalyzed by PTS proteins. Phosphorylation by the general PTS components EI and HPr is usually essential for the activity of PRD-containing transcription regulators, whereas phosphorylation by the sugar-specific components EIIA or EIIB lowers their activity. For a specific regulator, for example the Bacillus subtilis mtl operon activator MtlR, the functional phosphorylation sites can be different in other bacteria and consequently the detailed mode of regulation varies. Some of these transcription regulators are also controlled by an interaction with a sugar-specific EIIB PTS component. The EIIBs are frequently fused to the membrane-spanning EIIC and EIIB-mediated membrane sequestration is sometimes crucial for the control of a transcription regulator. This is also true for the Escherichia coli repressor Mlc, which does not contain a PRD but nevertheless interacts with the EIIB domain of the glucose-specific PTS. In addition, some PRD-containing transcription activators interact with a distinct EIIB protein located in the cytoplasm. The phosphorylation state of the EIIB components, which changes in response to the presence or absence of the corresponding carbon source, affects their interaction with transcription regulators.

Several recent publications have described the characterization of kinase inhibitors via large assay panels, offering a range of generalizations that influenced kinase inhibitor research trends. Since a subset of profiled inhibitors overlap across reports, we evaluated the concordance of activity results for the same compound\u2013kinase pairs across four data sources generated from different kinase biochemical assay technologies. Overall, 77% of all results are within 3 fold or qualitatively in agreement across sources. However, the agreement for active compounds is only 37%, indicating that different profiling panels are in better agreement to determine a compound's lack of activity rather than degree of activity. Low concordance is also found when comparing the promiscuity of kinase targets evaluated from different sources, and the pharmacological similarity of kinases. In contrast, the overall promiscuity of kinase inhibitors was consistent across sources. We highlight the difficulty of drawing general conclusions from such data by showing that no significant selectivity difference distinguishes type I vs. type II inhibitors, and limited kinase space similarity that is consistent across different sources.

This kinase was initially believed to control protein translation in response to amino acids and trophic factors, and this function has become a canonical role for mTOR. However, mTOR can form two separate protein complexes (mTORCs). Recent advances clearly demonstrate that both mTORCs can respond to various stimuli and change myriad cellular processes. Therefore, our current view of the cellular roles of TORCs has rapidly expanded and cannot be fully explained without appreciating recent findings about the new modes of mTOR regulation and identification of non-canonical effectors of mTOR that contribute to transcription, cytoskeleton dynamics, and membrane trafficking. This review discusses the molecular details of these newly discovered non-canonical functions that allow mTORCs to control the cellular environment at multiple levels.

The ability of hydrogen exchange to detect a range of protein dynamics coupled with the accessibility of mass spectrometry to mixtures and large complexes at low concentrations result in an unmatched tool for investigating proteins challenging to many other structural techniques. Recent advances in methodology and data analysis are helping HXMS deliver on its potential to uncover the connection between conformation, dynamics and the biological function of proteins and complexes. This review provides a brief overview of the HXMS method and focuses on four recent reports to highlight applications that monitor structure and dynamics of proteins and complexes, track protein folding, and map the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein unfolding at equilibrium. These case studies illustrate typical data, analysis and results for each application and demonstrate a range of biological systems for which the interpretation of HXMS in terms of structure and conformational parameters provides unique insights into function.

This mutation results in alterations in their higher order structures, with lispro dissociating more easily than human insulin. In our previous study performed using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX/MS), differences were observed in the rates and levels of deuteration among insulin analog products, which were found to be related to their self-association stability. In this study, we carried out peptide mapping of deuterated human insulin and lispro to determine the regions responsible for these deuteration differences and to elucidate the type of structural changes that affect their HDX reactivity. We identified A3\u20136 and B22\u201324 as the 2 regions that showed distinct differences in the number of deuterium atoms incorporated between human insulin and lispro. These regions contain residues that are thought to participate in hexamerization and dimerization, respectively. We also determined that over time, the differences in deuteration levels decreased in A3\u20136, whereas they increased in B22\u201324, suggesting a difference in the dynamics between these 2 regions.

     "abstract": "cAMP signaling is a fundamental cellular process necessary for mediating responses to hormonal stimuli. In contrast to cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA), an important cellular target, far less is known on termination in cAMP signaling, specifically how phosphodiesterases (PDEs) facilitate dissociation and hydrolysis of bound cAMP. In this study, we have probed the dynamics of a ternary complex of PKA and a PDE\u2013RegA with an excess of a PDE-nonhydrolyzable cAMP analog, Sp-cAMPS by amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDXMS). Our results highlight how HDXMS can be used to monitor reactions together with mapping conformational dynamics of transient signaling complexes. Our results confirm a two-state model for active RegA-mediated dissociation of bound cAMP. Further, our results reveal that Sp-cAMPS and RegA mediate mutually exclusive interactions with the same region of PKA and at specific concentrations of Sp-cAMPS, RegA is capable of blocking Sp-cAMPS reassociation to PKA. This provides a molecular basis for how PDEs modulate levels of intracellular cAMP so that PKA is better suited to responding to fluxes rather than constant levels of cAMP. This study underscores how HDXMS can be a powerful tool for monitoring reactions together with mapping conformational dynamics in signaling proteins.

The collection of reproducible peptides was identified from >\u00a030 replicate digestions of the same protein and it was found that the number of reproducible peptides produced during pepsin digestion becomes constant above 5\u20136 replicate digestions. We also investigated a new aspartic protease from the stomach of the rice field eel (Monopterus albus Zuiew) and compared digestion efficiency and specificity to porcine pepsin and aspergillopepsin.

Finding all the OH-labeling sites requires LC/MS/MS analysis of a proteolyzed sample, but data processing is daunting without the help of automated software. We describe here a systematic means for achieving a comprehensive residue-resolved analysis of footprinting data in an efficient manner, utilizing software common to proteomics core laboratories.

     "abstract": "A complex formed by human \u03b1-lactalbumin (\u03b1-LA) and oleic acid (OA), named HAMLET, has been shown to have an apoptotic activity leading to the selective death of tumor cells. In numerous publications it has been reported that in the complex \u03b1-LA is monomeric and adopts a partly folded or \u201cmolten globule\u201d state, leading to the idea that partly folded proteins can have \u201cbeneficial effects\u201d. The protein/OA molar ratio initially has been reported to be 1:1, while recent data have indicated that the OA-complex is given by an oligomeric protein capable of binding numerous OA molecules per protein monomer. Proteolytic fragments of \u03b1-LA, as well as other proteins unrelated to \u03b1-LA, can form OA-complexes with biological activities similar to those of HAMLET, thus indicating that a generic protein can form a cytotoxic complex under suitable experimental conditions. Moreover, even the selective tumoricidal activity of HAMLET-like complexes has been questioned. There is recent evidence that the biological activity of long chain unsaturated fatty acids, including OA, can be ascribed to their effect of perturbing the structure of biological membranes and consequently the function of membrane-bound proteins. In general, it has been observed that the cytotoxic effects exerted by HAMLET-like complexes are similar to those reported for OA alone. Overall, these findings can be interpreted by considering that the protein moiety does not have a toxic effect on its own, but merely acts as a solubilising agent for the inherently toxic fatty acid.",

Generally, toxin molecules act as negative regulators in cell survival and antitoxin molecules as positive regulators. Thus, the expression levels and interactions between toxins and antitoxins should be systematically harmonized so that bacteria can escape such harmful conditions. Since TA systems are able to control the fate of bacteria, they are considered potent targets for the development of new antimicrobial agents. TA systems are widely prevalent with a variety of systems existing in bacteria: there are three types of bacterial TA systems depending on the property of the antitoxin which binds either the protein toxin or mRNA coding the toxin protein. Moreover, the multiplicity of TA genes has been observed even in species of bacteria. Therefore, knowledge on TA systems such as the individual characteristics of TA systems, integrative working mechanisms of various TA systems in bacteria, interactions between toxin molecules and cellular targets, and so on is currently limited due to their complexity. In this regard, it would be helpful to know the structural characteristics of TA modules for understanding TA systems in bacteria. Until now, 85 out of the total structures deposited in PDB have been bacterial TA system proteins including TA complexes or isolated toxins/antitoxins. Here, we summarized the structural information of TA systems and analyzed the structural characteristics of known TA modules from several bacteria, especially focusing on the TA modules of several infectious bacteria.",

The tertiary structures of PNOX with a C-terminal His6-tag and PNOX\u2013pyridoxamine (PM) complex were determined at 2.2\u00a0\u00c5 and at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolutions, respectively. The overall structure consisted of FAD-binding and substrate-binding domains. In the active site, His460, His462, and Pro504 were located on the re-face of the isoalloxazine ring of FAD. PM binds to the active site through several hydrogen bonds. The side chains of His462 and His460 are located at 2.7 and 3.1\u00a0\u00c5 from the N4\u2032 atom of PM. The activities of His460Ala and His462Ala mutant PNOXs were very low, and 460Ala/His462Ala double mutant PNOX exhibited no activity. His462 may act as a general base for the abstraction of a proton from the 4\u2032-hydroxyl of PN. His460 may play a role in the binding and positioning of PN. The C4\u2032 atom in PM is located at 3.2\u00a0\u00c5, and the hydride ion from the C4\u2032 atom may be transferred to the N5 atom of the isoalloxazine ring.

     "abstract": "Recently, it was reported that mutations in the ubiquitin-like protein ubiquilin-2 (UBQLN2) are associated with X-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and that both wild-type and mutant UBQLN2 can co-localize with aggregates of C-terminal fragments of TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Here, we describe a high affinity interaction between UBQLN2 and TDP-43 and demonstrate that overexpression of both UBQLN2 and TDP-43 reduces levels of both exogenous and endogenous TDP-43 in human H4 cells. UBQLN2 bound with high affinity to both full length TDP-43 and a C-terminal TDP-43 fragment (261\u2013414 aa) with KD values of 6.2\u00a0nM and 8.7\u00a0nM, respectively. Both DNA oligonucleotides and 4-aminoquinolines, which bind to TDP-43, also inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43 with similar rank order affinities compared to inhibition of oligonucleotide binding to TDP-43. Inhibitor characterization experiments demonstrated that the DNA oligonucleotides noncompetitively inhibited UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, which is consistent with UBQLN2 binding to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. Interestingly, the 4-aminoquinolines were competitive inhibitors of UBQLN2 binding to TDP-43, suggesting that these compounds also bind to the C-terminal region of TDP-43. In support of the biochemical data, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both TDP-43 and UBQLN2 interact in human neuroglioma H4 cells. Finally, overexpression of UBQLN2 in the presence of overexpressed full length TDP-43 or C-terminal TDP-43 (170\u2013414) dramatically lowered levels of both full length TDP-43 and C-terminal TDP-43 fragments (CTFs). Consequently, these data suggest that UBQLN2 enhances the clearance of TDP-43 and TDP-43 CTFs and therefore may play a role in the development of TDP-43 associated neurotoxicity.",

Additionally, water equilibrium sorption\u2013desorption measurements (ESI) were performed at room temperature. The glass transition of the system was studied by DSC and its complex dependence on hydration water was verified. A critical water fraction of about 18\u00a0wt.% was found, associated with a reorganization of water in the material. Three dielectric relaxations, associated to dynamics related to distinct uncrystallized water populations, were recorded by TSDC and DRS. The low temperature secondary relaxation of hydrophilic polar groups on the protein surface triggered by hydration water for almost dry samples contains contributions from water molecules themselves at higher water fractions (\u03bd relaxation). This particular relaxation is attributed to water molecules in the primary and secondary hydration shells of the protein fibers. At higher temperatures and for water fraction values equal to or higher than 10\u00a0wt.%, a local relaxation of water molecules condensed within small openings in the interior of the protein fibers was recorded. The evolution of this relaxation (w relaxation) with hydration level results in enhanced cooperativity at high water fraction values, implying the existence of \u201cinternal\u201d water confined within the protein structure. At higher temperatures a relaxation associated with water dynamics within clusters between fibers (p relaxation) was also recorded, in the same hydration range.",

     "abstract": "Our previous work showed that purified coagulation factor Xa (FXa) acquires fibrinolysis cofactor activity after plasmin-mediated cleavage. The predominant functional species is a non-covalent heterodimer of 33 and 13\u00a0kDa, termed Xa33/13, which has predicted newly exposed C-terminal lysines that are important for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated plasminogen activation to plasmin. To provide evidence that this mechanism occurs in a physiological context, here we demonstrated the appearance of Xa33 in clotting plasma by western blot analysis. Since the normal fate of FXa is stable association with antithrombin (AT), an AT western blot was conducted, which revealed a band of ~\u00a013\u00a0kDa higher apparent molecular weight than AT that appeared concurrent to Xa33. Sequencing of purified proteins confirmed the generation of Xa13 covalently bound to AT and Xa33 (Xa33/13-AT) by cleavages at Lys\u2013Met339 and Lys\u2013Asp389. Ligand blots demonstrated 125I-plasminogen binding to the Xa33 subunit of plasmin-generated Xa33/13-AT. Purified XaAT added to plasma that was induced to clot enhanced the rate of tPA-mediated fibrinolysis by ~\u00a016-fold. Similarly, purified plasminogen activation by tPA was enhanced by ~\u00a016-fold by XaAT. Plasmin cleaves XaAT and exposes plasminogen binding sites at least 10-fold faster than FXa. Here we demonstrate a novel function for AT, which accelerates the modulation of FXa into the fibrinolytic form, Xa33/13. The consequent exposure of C-terminal lysine binding sites essential for plasminogen activation enhances fibrinolysis. These results are consistent with a model where auxiliary cofactors link coagulation to fibrinolysis by priming the accelerating role of fibrin.",

     "abstract": "We have investigated the interactions between the antimicrobial peptide Novicidin (Nc) and vesicles containing the phospholipid DOPC, with various amounts of DOPG and cholesterol using circular dichroism spectroscopy, calcein release, equilibrium dialysis and isothermal titration calorimetry. Nc adopts a random coil structure in the absence of lipids and in the presence of vesicles containing 100% DOPC. Lipids with 25\u201340% DOPG induce the highest level of helicity in Nc; higher DOPG levels lead to lower helicity levels and an altered tertiary arrangement of the peptide. However, the ability of Nc to permeabilize vesicles correlates not with helicity but rather with its overall membrane affinity, which is enthalpically favorable but opposed by entropy. Permeabilization declines with increasing mole percentage PG. Changes in helicity correlate with changes in enthalpy, reflecting the enthalpy of helix formation, but not with affinity. There is also a large favorable enthalpic interaction between Nc and lipids in the absence of negative charge and structural changes. Cholesterol slightly reduces membrane permeabilization but has little effect on Nc affinity and secondary structure, and probably protects the membrane by inducing the liquid ordered state. We conclude that helicity is not a prerequisite for activity, and charge\u2013charge interactions are not the only major driving force for AMP interactions with membranes. Our data are compatible with a model in which a superficial binding mode with a large membrane surface binding area per peptide is more efficient than a more intimate embedding within the membrane environment.",

The enzymatic activity of recombinant Cu-NirK was detected in both cellular fractions (cytoplasmic fraction and membranes) and in the culture media. The characterization of the enzyme isolated from the cytoplasmic fraction as well as the culture media revealed important differences in the primary structure of both forms indicating that Hfx. mediterranei could carry out a maturation and exportation process within the cell before the protein is exported to the S-layer. Several conserved signals found in Cu-NirK from Hfx. mediterranei sequence indicate that these processes are closely related to the Tat system. Furthermore, the N-terminal sequence of the two Cu-NirK subunits constituting different isoforms revealed that translation of this protein could begin at two different points, identifying two possible start codons.

     "abstract": "Several human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy, have long been associated with, structural and functional changes in disease related proteins leading to aggregation into amyloid fibrils. Such changes can be triggered by post-translational modifications. Methylglyoxal modifications have been shown to induce the formation of small and stable native-like aggregates in the case of the amyloidogenic proteins insulin and \u03b1-synuclein. However, the fundamental biophysical mechanism underlying such methylglyoxal-induced protein aggregation is not yet fully understood. In this work cytochrome c (Cyt c) was used as a model protein for the characterization of specific glycation targets and to study their impact on protein structure, stability, and ability to form native-like aggregates. Our results show that methylglyoxal covalently modifies Cyt c at a single residue and induces early conformational changes that lead to the formation of native-like aggregates. Furthermore, partially unfolded species are formed, but do not seem to be implicated in the aggregation process. This shows a clear difference from the amyloid fibril mechanisms which involve partially or totally unfolded intermediates. Equilibrium-unfolding experiments show that glycation strongly decreases Cyt c conformational stability, which is balanced with an increase of conformational stability upon aggregation. Data collected from analytical and spectroscopic techniques, along with kinetic analysis based on least-squares parameter fitting and statistical model discrimination are used to help to understand the driving force underlying glycation-induced native-like aggregation, and enable the proposal of a comprehensive thermodynamic and kinetic model for native-like aggregation of methylglyoxal glycated Cyt c.",

     "abstract": "Hyperthermophile proteins commonly have higher numbers of surface ionic interactions than homologous proteins from other domains of life. PfuTIM, a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from the hyperthermophile archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, contains an intricate network of 4 ion pairs in its 4th beta/alpha unit, (\u03b2/\u03b1)4, whereas MbuTIM, a triosephosphate isomerase from a psychrophile archaeon, Methanococcoides burtonii, lacks this network. Notably, (\u03b2/\u03b1)4 is the first element of the structure formed during folding of certain TIM-type (beta/alpha)8 barrel proteins. Previously, we have shown that elimination of PfuTIM's ion pair network in PfuTIM significantly decreases its kinetic structural stability. Here, we describe the reciprocal experiment in which this ion pair network is introduced into MbuTIM, to produce MutMbuTIM. Recombinant MbuTIM displays multi-state unfolding with apparent Tm values of autonomous structural elements approaching, or above, 70\u00a0\u00b0C, when a temperature scanning rate of 90\u00a0\u00b0C/h is used. The protein displays significant intrinsic kinetic stability, i.e., there is a marked temperature scan rate-dependence of the Tm values associated with unfolding transitions. The Tm values drop by as much as ~\u00a010\u00a0\u00b0C when the temperature scanning rate is lowered to 5\u00a0\u00b0C/h. MutMbuTIM, incorporating PfuTIM's ion pair network, shows significantly higher apparent Tm values (raised by 4\u20136\u00a0\u00b0C over those displayed by MbuTIM). MutMbuTIM also displays significantly higher kinetic thermal stability. Thus, it appears that the thermal stability of triosephosphate isomerase can be increased, or decreased, by either enhancing, or reducing, the strength of ion pair interactions stabilizing (\u03b2/\u03b1)4, presumably through reduced cooperativity (and increased autonomy) in unfolding transitions.",

Intramolecular allosteric interactions in the phospholipase C (PLC)-\u03b41 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain were investigated by solution NMR spectroscopy for selectively [\u03b1-15N]Lys-labeled proteins. The results of NMR analyses indicated that the binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) to the protein induces local environmental changes at all lysine residues, including residues such as Lys-43 spatially separated from the specific IP3 binding site consisting of Lys-30, Lys-32, and Lys-57. IP3 binding also induces conformational stabilization of a characteristic short \u03b1-helix (\u03b12) from residues 82 to 87. Mutational analyses indicated that an interaction network mainly consisting of the side chains of Lys-30, Lys-32, and Lys-43 exists in the ligand-free protein, and it was therefore predicted that binding of IP3 to the specific site modifies the interaction network, resulting in formation of a new interaction network, in which the side chains of Lys-57 and Phe-87 contribute to stable IP3 binding.

A series of 12 chimeric variants of Escherichia coli CGS (eCGS) and CBL (eCBL) was constructed to probe the roles of two structurally distinct, ~\u00a025-residue segments situated in proximity to the amino and carboxy termini and located at the entrance of the active-site. In vivo complementation of methionine-auxotrophic E. coli strains, lacking the genes encoding eCGS and eCBL, demonstrated that exchange of the targeted regions impairs the activity of the resulting enzymes, but does not produce a corresponding interchange of reaction specificity. In keeping with the in vivo results, the catalytic efficiency of the native reactions is reduced by at least 95-fold, and \u03b1,\u03b2 versus \u03b1,\u03b3-elimination specificity is not modified.

Alanine-substitution variants of residues S32 and S33, as well as K42 of eCBL, situated in proximity to and within, respectively, the targeted amino-terminal region were also investigated to explore their role as determinants of reaction specificity via positioning of key active-site residues. The catalytic efficiency of the S32A, S33A and the K42A site-directed variants of eCBL is reduced by less than 10-fold, demonstrating that, while these residues may participate in positioning S339, which tethers the catalytic base, their role is minor.",

     "abstract": "Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) is a causative agent of the common cold. The nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a major structural protein of CoVs, binds to the viral RNA genome to form the virion core and results in the formation of the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. We have solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of HCoV-OC43 N protein (N-NTD) (residues 58 to 195) to a resolution of 2.0\u00a0\u00c5. The HCoV-OC43 N-NTD is a single domain protein composed of a five-stranded \u03b2-sheet core and a long extended loop, similar to that observed in the structures of N-NTDs from other coronaviruses. The positively charged loop of the HCoV-OC43 N-NTD contains a structurally well-conserved positively charged residue, R106. To assess the role of R106 in RNA binding, we undertook a series of site-directed mutagenesis experiments and docking simulations to characterize the interaction between R106 and RNA. The results show that R106 plays an important role in the interaction between the N protein and RNA. In addition, we showed that, in cells transfected with plasmids that encoded the mutant (R106A) N protein and infected with virus, the level of the matrix protein gene was decreased by 7-fold compared to cells that were transfected with the wild-type N protein. This finding suggests that R106, by enhancing binding of the N protein to viral RNA plays a critical role in the viral replication.

     "abstract": "Since, proteins carry out many functional roles in a cell with different concentrations, proteomics is likely a more appropriate approach to explain biological processes and cellular events than mRNA studies. Although, gene ontology provides a systematic and organized vocabulary of biological terms for proteins, we need more details to decide about the correct duty and annotation of proteins in a specific condition. One can assume that a change of protein concentration is related to a biological process of that protein with negligible error. Therefore, we can obtain more information about the function of proteins by studying these profiles. In this study, we used time-course proteomic data of a twenty day differentiation study of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiating to embryoid bodies (EBs). Hierarchical clustering was used to cluster time-series concentration profile of proteins. Our results demonstrate that there are eleven active processes with distinct concentration profiles in this initial differentiation. According to the concentration profiles of proteins, we suggest new change points (or equivalently, new stages) in the course of embryonic differentiation.",

Lactococcus lactis, a Gram-positive bacterium widely used for the manufacture of fermented dairy products, is subjected to infections by virulent phages, predominantly those of the 936 group, including phage p2. Among the proteins coded by lactococcal phage genomes, of special interest are those expressed early, which are crucial to efficiently carry out the phage lytic cycle. We previously identified and solved the 3D structure of lactococcal phage p2 ORF34, a single stranded DNA binding protein (SSBp2). Here we investigated the molecular basis of ORF34 binding mechanism to DNA. DNA docking on SSBp2 and Molecular Dynamics simulations of the resulting complex identified R15 as a crucial residue for ssDNA binding. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging revealed the inability of the Arg15Ala mutant to bind ssDNA, as compared to the native protein. Since R15 is highly conserved among lactococcal SSBs, we propose that its role in the SSBp2/DNA complex stabilization might be extended to all the members of this protein family.",

     "abstract": "Based on bioinformatics interrogation of the genome, >\u00a0500 mammalian protein kinases can be clustered within seven different groups. Of these kinases, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family forms part of the CMGC group of serine/threonine kinases that includes extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), cJun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs. With the JNKs considered attractive targets in the treatment of pathologies including diabetes and stroke, efforts have been directed to the discovery of new JNK inhibitory molecules that can be further developed as new therapeutics. Capitalizing on our biochemical understanding of JNK, we performed in silico screens of commercially available chemical databases to identify JNK1-interacting compounds and tested their in vitro JNK inhibitory activity. With in vitro and cell culture studies, we showed that the compound, 4\u2032-methyl-N2-3-pyridinyl-4,5\u2032-bi-1,3-thiazole-2,2\u2032-diamine (JNK Docking (JD) compound 123, but not the related compound (4\u2032-methyl-N\u00a0~\u00a02\u00a0~\u00a0-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-4,5\u2032-bi-1,3-thiazole-2,2\u2032-diamine (JD124), inhibited JNK1 activity towards a range of substrates. Molecular docking, saturation transfer difference NMR experiments and enzyme kinetic analyses revealed both ATP- and substrate-competitive inhibition of JNK by JD123. In characterizing JD123 further, we noted its ATP-competitive inhibition of the related p38-\u03b3 MAPK, but not ERK1, ERK2, or p38-\u03b1, p38-\u03b2 or p38-\u03b4. Further screening of a broad panel of kinases using 10\u00a0\u03bcM JD123, identified inhibition of kinases including protein kinase B\u03b2 (PKB\u03b2/Akt\u03b2). Appropriately modified thiazole diamines, as typified by JD123, thus provide a new chemical scaffold for development of inhibitors for the JNK and p38-\u03b3 MAPKs as well as other kinases that are also potential therapeutic targets such as PKB\u03b2/Akt\u03b2.",

Among the deadenylase family, poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN) is unique in its domain composition, which contains three potential RNA-binding domains: the catalytic nuclease domain, the R3H domain and the RRM domain. In this research, we investigated the roles of these RNA-binding domains by comparing the structural features and enzymatic properties of mutants lacking either one or two of the three RNA-binding domains. The results showed that the R3H domain had the ability to bind various oligonucleotides at the micromolar level with no oligo(A) specificity. The removal of the R3H domain dissociated PARN into monomers, which still possessed the RNA-binding ability and catalytic functions. Unlike the critical role of the RRM domain in PARN processivity, the removal of the R3H domain did not affect the catalytic pattern of PARN. Our results suggested that both R3H and RRM domains were essential for the high affinity of long poly(A) substrate, but the R3H domain did not contribute to the substrate recognition of PARN. Compared to the RRM domain, the R3H domain played a more important role in the structural integrity of the dimeric PARN. The multiple RNA-binding domain architecture endows PARN the property of highly efficient catalysis in a highly processive mode.",

One member of the family, Choline Kinase-\u03b1 (ChoK\u03b1) is frequently up-regulated in human cancers, and expression of ChoK\u03b1 is sufficient to transform cells. Consequently ChoK\u03b1 has been studied as a potential target for therapeutic agents in cancer research. Despite great interest in the enzyme, mechanistic studies have not been reported. In this study, a combination of initial velocity and product inhibition studies, together with the kinetic and structural characterisation of a novel ChoK\u03b1 inhibitor is used to support a mechanism of action for human ChoK\u03b1. Substrate and inhibition kinetics are consistent with an iso double displacement mechanism, in which the \u03b3-phosphate from ATP is transferred to choline in two distinct steps via a phospho-enzyme intermediate. Co-crystal structures, and existing site-specific mutation studies, support an important role for Asp306, in stabilising the phospho-enzyme intermediate. The kinetics also indicate a distinct kinetic (isomerisation) step associated with product release, which may be attributed to a conformational change in the protein to disrupt an interaction between Asp306 and the phosphocholine product, facilitating product release. This study describes a mechanism for ChoK\u03b1 that is unusual amongst kinases, and highlights the availability of different enzyme states that can be exploited for drug discovery.",

Herein molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with umbrella sampling technique were utilized to explore the regulation mechanisms of key residues and loops 1 and 2 for the base release. Our results have indicated that the base release process is not the rate-limiting step in the entire hydrolysis process, and the very low barrier of ~\u00a05.6\u00a0kcal/mol can be washed out easily by the notable exothermicity from the substrate hydrolysis step. Moreover, the MD simulations have revealed that Glu82/Trp83 in loop 1 and His247/Arg252 in loop 2 are important to modulate the base release. The partial helix-to-coil change of loop 2 along with the base release process has been observed, showing good agreement with the IAG-NH crystal structures.

     "abstract": "Adaptation of life to low temperatures influences both protein stability and flexibility. Thus, proteins from psychrophilic organisms are excellent models to study relations between these properties. Here we focused on frataxin from Psychromonas ingrahamii (pFXN), an extreme psychrophilic sea ice bacterium that can grow at temperatures as low as \u2212\u00a012\u00a0\u00b0C. This \u03b1/\u03b2 protein is highly conserved and plays a key role in iron homeostasis as an iron chaperone. In contrast to other frataxin homologs, chemical and temperature unfolding experiments showed that the thermodynamic stability of pFXN is strongly modulated by pHs: ranging from 5.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 (pH\u00a06.0) to 0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0kcal\u00a0mol\u2212\u00a01 (pH\u00a08.0). This protein was crystallized and its X-ray structure solved at 1.45\u00a0\u00c5. Comparison of B-factor profiles between Escherichia coli and P. ingrahamii frataxin variants (51% of identity) suggests that, although both proteins share the same structural features, their flexibility distribution is different. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that protonation of His44 or His67 in pFXN lowers the mobility of regions encompassing residues 20\u201330 and the C-terminal end, probably through favorable electrostatic interactions with residues Asp27, Glu42 and Glu99. Since the C-terminal end of the protein is critical for the stabilization of the frataxin fold, the predictions presented may be reporting on the microscopic origin of the decrease in global stability produced near neutral pH in the psychrophilic variant. We propose that suboptimal electrostatic interactions may have been an evolutionary strategy for the adaptation of frataxin flexibility and function to cold environments.",

     "abstract": "Enzymes often work sequentially in pathways; and consecutive reaction steps are typically carried out by molecules associated in the same multienzyme complex. Localization confines the enzymes; anchors them; increases the effective concentration of substrates and products; and shortens pathway timescales; however, it does not explain enzyme coordination or pathway branching. Here, we distinguish between metabolic and signaling multienzyme complexes. We argue for a central role of scaffolding proteins in regulating multienzyme complexes signaling and suggest that metabolic multienzyme complexes are less dependent on scaffolding because they undergo conformational control through direct subunit\u2013subunit contacts. In particular, we propose that scaffolding proteins have an essential function in controlling branching in signaling pathways. This new broadened definition of scaffolding proteins goes beyond cases such as the classic yeast mitogen-activated protein kinase Ste5 and encompasses proteins such as E3 ligases which lack active sites and work via allostery. With this definition, we classify the mechanisms of multienzyme complexes based on whether the substrates are transferred through the involvement of scaffolding proteins, and outline the functional merits to metabolic or signaling pathways. Overall, while co-localization topography helps multistep pathways non-specifically, allosteric regulation requires precise multienzyme organization and interactions and works via population shift, either through direct enzyme subunit\u2013subunit interactions or through active involvement of scaffolding proteins.

We propose and test a null-model of \u201crandom\u201d conformation changes that assumes that the contributions of normal modes to conformation changes are proportional to their contributions to thermal fluctuations. Deviations from this null model are generally small. When they are large and significant, they consist in conformation changes that are represented by very few low frequency normal modes and overcome small energy barriers. We interpret these features as the result of natural selection favoring the intrinsic protein dynamics consistent with functional conformation changes. These \u201cselected\u201d conformation changes are more frequently associated to ligand binding, and in particular phosphorylation, than to pairs of conformations with the same ligands. This deep relationship between the thermal dynamics of a protein, represented by its normal modes, and its functional dynamics can reconcile in a unique framework the two models of conformation changes, conformational selection and induced fit.

     "abstract": "Protein molecules require both flexibility and rigidity for functioning. The fast and accurate prediction of protein rigidity/flexibility is one of the important problems in protein science. We have determined flexible regions for four homologous pairs from thermophilic and mesophilic organisms by two methods: the fast FoldUnfold which uses amino acid sequence and the time consuming MDFirst which uses three-dimensional structures. We demonstrate that both methods allow determining flexible regions in protein structure. For three of the four thermophile\u2013mesophile pairs of proteins, FoldUnfold predicts practically the same flexible regions which have been found by the MD/First method. As expected, molecular dynamics simulations show that thermophilic proteins are more rigid in comparison to their mesophilic homologues. Analysis of rigid clusters and their decomposition provides new insights into protein stability. It has been found that the local networks of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds in thermophiles render their structure more stable with respect to fluctuations of individual contacts. Such network includes salt bridge triads Agr-Glu-Lys and Arg-Glu-Arg, or salt bridges (such as Arg-Glu) connected with hydrogen bonds. This ionic network connects alpha helices and rigidifies the structure. Mesophiles can be characterized by stand alone salt bridges and hydrogen bonds or small ionic clusters. Such difference in the network of salt bridges results in different flexibility of homologous proteins. Combining both approaches allows characterizing structural features in atomic detail that determine the rigidity/flexibility of a protein structure.

     "abstract": "A central question is how the conformational changes of proteins affect their function and the inhibition of this function by drug molecules. Many enzymes change from an open to a closed conformation upon binding of substrate or inhibitor molecules. These conformational changes have been suggested to follow an induced-fit mechanism in which the molecules first bind in the open conformation in those cases where binding in the closed conformation appears to be sterically obstructed such as for the HIV-1 protease. In this article, we present a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with induced-fit binding mechanism. We derive general expressions that specify how the overall catalytic rate of the enzymes depends on the rates for binding, for the conformational changes, and for the chemical reaction. Based on these expressions, we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the conformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition. If the overall catalytic rate is limited by product unbinding, we find that mutations that destabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase the catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor exp(\u0394\u0394GC/RT) where \u0394\u0394GC is the mutation-induced shift of the free-energy difference between the conformations. This increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the conformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and, thus, may help to understand how non-active-site mutations can contribute to the multi-drug-resistance that has been observed for the HIV-1 protease. A comparison to experimental data for the non-active-site mutation L90M of the HIV-1 protease indicates that the mutation slightly destabilizes the closed conformation of the enzyme.

     "abstract": "We present, to our knowledge, the first quantitative analysis of functional site diversity in homologous domain superfamilies. Different types of functional sites are considered separately. Our results show that most diverse superfamilies are very plastic in terms of the spatial location of their functional sites. This is especially true for protein\u2013protein interfaces. In contrast, we confirm that catalytic sites typically occupy only a very small number of topological locations. Small-ligand binding sites are more diverse than expected, although in a more limited manner than protein\u2013protein interfaces. In spite of the observed diversity, our results also confirm the previously reported preferential location of functional sites. We identify a subset of homologous domain superfamilies where diversity is particularly extreme, and discuss possible reasons for such plasticity, i.e. structural diversity. Our results do not contradict previous reports of preferential co-location of sites among homologues, but rather point at the importance of not ignoring other sites, especially in large and diverse superfamilies. Data on sites exploited by different relatives, within each well annotated domain superfamily, has been made accessible from the CATH website in order to highlight versatile superfamilies or superfamilies with highly preferential sites. This information is valuable for system biology and knowledge of any constraints on protein interactions could help in understanding the dynamic control of networks in which these proteins participate. The novelty of our work lies in the comprehensive nature of the analysis \u2013 we have used a significantly larger dataset than previous studies \u2013 and the fact that in many superfamilies we show that different parts of the domain surface are exploited by different relatives for ligand/protein interactions, particularly in superfamilies which are diverse in sequence and structure, an observation not previously reported on such a large scale.

     "abstract": "Proteins evolve through point mutations as well as by insertions and deletions (indels). During the last decade it has become apparent that protein regions that do not fold into three-dimensional structures, i.e. intrinsically disordered regions, are quite common. Here, we have studied the relationship between protein disorder and indels using HMM\u2013HMM pairwise alignments in two sets of orthologous eukaryotic protein pairs. First, we show that disordered residues are much more frequent among indel residues than among aligned residues and, also are more prevalent among indels than in coils. Second, we observed that disordered residues are particularly common in longer indels. Disordered indels of short-to-medium size are prevalent in the non-terminal regions of proteins while the longest indels, ordered and disordered alike, occur toward the termini of the proteins where new structural units are comparatively well tolerated. Finally, while disordered regions often evolve faster than ordered regions and disorder is common in indels, there are some previously recognized protein families where the disordered region is more conserved than the ordered region. We find that these rare proteins are often involved in information processes, such as RNA processing and translation.

     "abstract": "Modularity is a hallmark of molecular evolution. Whether considering gene regulation, the components of metabolic pathways or signaling cascades, the ability to reuse autonomous modules in different molecular contexts can expedite evolutionary innovation. Similarly, protein domains are the modules of proteins, and modular domain rearrangements can create diversity with seemingly few operations in turn allowing for swift changes to an organism's functional repertoire. Here, we assess the patterns and functional effects of modular rearrangements at high resolution. Using a well resolved and diverse group of pancrustaceans, we illustrate arrangement diversity within closely related organisms, estimate arrangement turnover frequency and establish, for the first time, branch-specific rate estimates for fusion, fission, domain addition and terminal loss. Our results show that roughly 16 new arrangements arise per million years and that between 64% and 81% of these can be explained by simple, single-step modular rearrangement events. We find evidence that the frequencies of fission and terminal deletion events increase over time, and that modular rearrangements impact all levels of the cellular signaling apparatus and thus may have strong adaptive potential. Novel arrangements that cannot be explained by simple modular rearrangements contain a significant amount of repeat domains that occur in complex patterns which we term \u201csupra-repeats\u201d. Furthermore, these arrangements are significantly longer than those with a single-step rearrangement solution, suggesting that such arrangements may result from multi-step events. In summary, our analysis provides an integrated view and initial quantification of the patterns and functional impact of modular protein evolution in a well resolved phylogenetic tree.

     "abstract": "Understanding enzymatic evolution is essential to engineer enzymes with improved activities or to generate enzymes with tailor-made activities. The computationally designed Kemp eliminase KE07 carries out an unnatural reaction by converting of 5-nitrobenzisoxazole to cyanophenol, but its catalytic efficiency is significantly lower than those of natural enzymes. Three series of designed Kemp eliminases (KE07, KE70, KE59) were shown to be evolvable with considerable improvement in catalytic efficiency. Here we use the KE07 enzyme as a model system to reveal those forces, which govern enzymatic evolution and elucidate the key factors for improving activity. We applied the Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) method to construct the free energy pathway of the reaction in the original KE07 design and the evolved R7 1/3H variant. We analyzed catalytic effect of residues and demonstrated that not all mutations in evolution are favorable for activity. In contrast to the small decrease in the activation barrier, in vitro evolution significantly reduced the reorganization energy. We developed an algorithm to evaluate group contributions to the reorganization energy and used this approach to screen for KE07 variants with potential for improvement. We aimed to identify those mutations that facilitate enzymatic evolution, but might not directly increase catalytic efficiency. Computational results in accord with experimental data show that all mutations, which appear during in vitro evolution were either neutral or favorable for the reorganization energy. These results underscore that distant mutations can also play role in optimizing efficiency via their contribution to the reorganization energy. Exploiting this principle could be a promising strategy for computer-aided enzyme design.

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells are partitioned into functionally distinct self-organizing compartments. But while the biogenesis of membrane-surrounded compartments is beginning to be understood, the organizing principles behind large membrane-less structures, such as RNA-containing granules, remain a mystery. Here, we argue that protein disorder is an essential ingredient for the formation of such macromolecular collectives. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) do not fold into a well-defined structure but rather sample a range of conformational states, depending on the local conditions. In addition to being structurally versatile, IDRs promote multivalent and transient interactions. This unique combination of features turns intrinsically disordered proteins into ideal agents to orchestrate the formation of large macromolecular assemblies. The presence of conformationally flexible regions, however, comes at a cost, for many intrinsically disordered proteins are aggregation-prone and cause protein misfolding diseases. This association with disease is particularly strong for IDRs with prion-like amino acid composition. Here, we examine how disease-causing and normal conformations are linked, and discuss the possibility that the dynamic order of the cytoplasm emerges, at least in part, from the collective properties of intrinsically disordered prion-like domains.

     "abstract": "Research of a past decade and a half leaves no doubt that complete understanding of protein functionality requires close consideration of the fact that many functional proteins do not have well-folded structures. These intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs) are highly abundant in nature and play a number of crucial roles in a living cell. Their functions, which are typically associated with a wide range of intermolecular interactions where IDPs possess remarkable binding promiscuity, complement functional repertoire of ordered proteins. All this requires a close attention to the peculiarities of biophysics of these proteins. In this review, some key biophysical features of IDPs are covered. In addition to the peculiar sequence characteristics of IDPs these biophysical features include sequential, structural, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of IDPs; their rough and relatively flat energy landscapes; their ability to undergo both induced folding and induced unfolding; the ability to interact specifically with structurally unrelated partners; the ability to gain different structures at binding to different partners; and the ability to keep essential amount of disorder even in the bound form. IDPs are also characterized by the \u201cturned-out\u201d response to the changes in their environment, where they gain some structure under conditions resulting in denaturation or even unfolding of ordered proteins. It is proposed that the heterogeneous spatiotemporal structure of IDPs/IDPRs can be described as a set of foldons, inducible foldons, semi-foldons, non-foldons, and unfoldons. They may lose their function when folded, and activation of some IDPs is associated with the awaking of the dormant disorder. It is possible that IDPs represent the \u201cedge of chaos\u201d systems which operate in a region between order and complete randomness or chaos, where the complexity is maximal.

     "abstract": "Classified into 16 superfamilies, conopeptides are the main component of cone snail venoms that attract growing interest in pharmacology and drug discovery. The conventional approach to assigning a conopeptide to a superfamily is based on a consensus signal peptide of the precursor sequence. While this information is available at the genomic or transcriptomic levels, it is not present in amino acid sequences of mature bioactives generated by proteomic studies. As the number of conopeptide sequences is increasing exponentially with the improvement in sequencing techniques, there is a growing need for automating superfamily elucidation. To face this challenge we have defined distinct models of the signal sequence, propeptide region and mature peptides for each of the superfamilies containing more than 5 members (14 out of 16). These models rely on two robust techniques namely, Position-Specific Scoring Matrices (PSSM, also named generalized profiles) and hidden Markov models (HMM). A total of 50 PSSMs and 47 HMM profiles were generated. We confirm that propeptide and mature regions can be used to efficiently classify conopeptides lacking a signal sequence. Furthermore, the combination of all three-region models demonstrated improvement in the classification rates and results emphasise how PSSM and HMM approaches complement each other for superfamily determination. The 97 models were validated and offer a straightforward method applicable to large sequence datasets.",

The main function of these proteins is to control and regulate cell cycle in response to various cellular signals, and therefore to control the organism's development. The regulatory functions of the p53 family members originate mostly from their highly-conserved and well-structured DNA-binding domains. Many human diseases (including various types of cancer) are related to the missense mutations within this domain. The ordered DNA-binding domains of the p53 family members are surrounded by functionally important intrinsically disordered regions. In this study, substitution rates and propensities in different regions of p53 were analyzed. The analyses revealed that the ordered DNA-binding domain is conserved, whereas disordered regions are characterized by high sequence diversity. This diversity was reflected both in the number of substitutions and in the types of substitutions to which each amino acid was prone. These results support the existence of a positive correlation between protein intrinsic disorder and sequence divergence during the evolutionary process. This higher sequence divergence provides strong support for the existence of disordered regions in p53 in vivo for if they were structured, they would evolve at similar rates as the rest of the protein.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the two main mechanisms used to explain the stabilization of proteins by sugar glasses during drying and subsequent storage: the vitrification and the water replacement theory. Although in literature protein stability is often attributed to either vitrification or water replacement, both mechanisms could play a role and they should be considered simultaneously. A model protein, alkaline phosphatase, was incorporated in either inulin or trehalose by spray drying. To study the storage stability at different glass transition temperatures, a buffer which acts as a plasticizer, ammediol, was incorporated in the sugar glasses. At low glass transition temperatures (<\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C), the enzymatic activity of the protein strongly decreased during storage at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Protein stability increased when the glass transition temperature was raised considerably above the storage temperature. This increased stability could be attributed to vitrification. A further increase of the glass transition temperature did not further improve stability. In conclusion, vitrification plays a dominant role in stabilization at glass transition temperatures up to 10 to 20\u00a0\u00b0C above storage temperature, depending on whether trehalose or inulin is used. On the other hand, the water replacement mechanism predominately determines stability at higher glass transition temperatures.",

Design and selection of mutants are usually driven by tailored spectroscopic properties, but some key aspects of stability, folding and dynamics of selected GFP variants still need to be elucidated. We have prepared, expressed and characterized three H148 mutants of the highly fluorescent variant GFPmut2. H148 is known to be involved in the H-bonding network surrounding the chromophore, and all the three mutants, H148G, H148R and H148K, show increased pKa values of the chromophore. Only H148G GFPmut2 (Mut2G) gave good expression and purification yields, indicating that position 148 is critical for efficient folding in vivo. The chemical denaturation of Mut2G was monitored by fluorescence emission, absorbance and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy. The mutation has little effect on the spectroscopic properties of the protein and on its stability in solution. However, the unfolding kinetics of the protein encapsulated in wet nanoporous silica gels, a system that allows to stabilize conformations that are poorly or only transiently populated in solution, indicate that the unfolding pathway of Mut2G is markedly different from the parent molecule. In particular, encapsulation allowed to identify an unfolding intermediate that retains a native-like secondary structure despite a destructured chromophore environment. Thus, H148 is a critical residue not only for the chromophoric and photodynamic properties, but also for the correct folding of GFP, and its substitution has great impact on expression yields and stability of the mature protein.",

Here we compare proteins identified from pancreatic duct cells (PaDC) following organelle enrichment to those identified from PaDC whole cell lysates to determine if the additional procedures of subcellular fractionation increase proteome coverage.We used differential centrifugation to enrich for nuclear, mitochondrial, membrane, and cytosolic proteins. We then compared \u2013 via mass spectrometry-based analysis \u2013 the number of proteins identified from these four fractions with four biological replicates of PaDC whole cell lysates.We identified similar numbers of proteins among all samples investigated. In total, 1658 non-redundant proteins were identified in the replicate samples, while 2196 were identified in the subcellular fractionation samples, corresponding to a 30% increase. Additionally, we noted that each organelle fraction was in fact enriched with proteins specific to the targeted organelle.Subcellular fractionation of PaDC resulted in greater proteome coverage compared to PaDC whole cell lysate analysis. Although more labor intensive and time consuming, subcellular fractionation provides greater proteome coverage, and enriches for compartmentalized sub-populations of proteins. Application of this subcellular fractionation strategy allows for a greater depth of proteomic analysis and thus a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms of pancreatic disease.",

As their name suggests, they are implicated in molecular recognition, which serves as the initial step for protein\u2013protein interactions. Membrane proteins constitute approximately 30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide variety of cellular functions. The aim of the current study was to identify and analyze MoRFs in membrane proteins. Two datasets of MoRFs, transmembrane and peripheral membrane protein MoRFs, were constructed from the Protein Data Bank, and sequence, structural and functional analysis was performed. Characterization of our datasets revealed their unique compositional biases and membrane protein MoRFs were categorized depending on their secondary structure after the interaction with their partners. Moreover, the position of transmembrane protein MoRFs in relation with the protein's topology was determined. Further studies were focused on functional analyses of MoRF-containing proteins and MoRFs' partners, associating them with protein binding, regulation and cell signaling, indicating half of them as putative hubs in protein\u2013protein interaction networks. In conclusion, we provide insights into the disorder-based protein\u2013protein interactions involving membrane proteins.",

     "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a unique class of proteins that do not require a stable structure for function. The importance of IDPs in many biological processes has been established but there remain unanswered questions about their evolution and conservation of their disordered state within a protein family. Our group has been studying the structural similarities among orthologous FlgM proteins, a model class of IDPs. We have previously shown that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus has more structure at A. aeolicus' physiological temperature (85\u00a0\u00b0C) than is observed for the Salmonella typhimurium FlgM, suggesting that the disordered nature of FlgM varies among organisms and is not universally conserved. In this work, we extend these studies to the FlgM proteins from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that the B. subtilis, E. coli, and S. typhimurium FlgMs exist in a premolten globule-like conformation, though the B. subtilis FlgM is in a more compacted conformation than the other two. The P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis FlgM proteins exist in a currently unknown conformation that is not either coil-like or premolten globule-like. The P. aeruginosa FlgM appears to contain more weak intramolecular contacts given its more compacted state than the P. mirabilis FlgM. These results provide experimental evidence that members of the same protein family can exhibit different degrees of disorder, though understanding how different disordered states evolve in the same protein family will require more study.",

However, the use of tyrosinase is limited by its further oxidation of diphenols to quinones. We recently determined the structure of the Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase revealing a residue, V218, which we proposed to take part in positioning of substrates within the active site. In the structure of catechol oxidase from Ipomoea batatas, the lack of monophenolase activity was attributed to the presence of F261 near CuA. Consequently, we engineered two variants, V218F and V218G. V218F was expected to have a decreased monophenolase activity, due to the bulky residue extending into the active site. Surprisingly, both V218F and V218G exhibited a 9- and 4.4-fold higher monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio, respectively. X-ray structures of variant V218F display a flexibility of the phenylalanine residue along with an adjacent histidine, which we propose to be the source of the change in activity ratio.",

To enhance proteolytic activity, the gene encoding KP-43 was mutagenized by error-prone PCR. Screening identified a Tyr195Cys mutant enzyme that exhibited increased specific activity toward casein between pH 7 and 11. At pH 10, the mutant displayed 1.3-fold higher specific activity for casein compared to the wild-type enzyme, but the activity of the mutant was essentially unchanged toward several synthetic peptides. Furthermore, the Tyr195Cys mutation significantly increased thermal stability and surfactant stability of the enzyme under oxidizing conditions. Examination of the crystal structure of KP-43 revealed that Tyr195 is a solvent exposed residue that forms part of a flexible loop that binds a Ca2\u00a0+ ion. This residue lies 15\u201320\u00a0\u00c5 away from the residues comprising the catalytic triad of the enzyme. These results suggest that the substitution at position 195 does not alter the structure of the active center, but instead may affect a substrate\u2013enzyme interaction. We propose that the Tyr195Cys mutation enhances the interaction with Ca2\u00a0+ and affects the packing of the Ca2\u00a0+ binding loop, consequently increasing protein stability.

     "abstract": "Pseudoperoxidase from Leishmania major (LmPP) catalyzes the breakdown of peroxynitrite though it can hardly react with H2O2. Our modeling structure predicts that a conserved His to Val switch near the distal heme pocket of LmPP may determine the profile of its H2O2 activity. To test this hypothesis, we have generated complementary mutations in the LmPP (V90H) and studied the formation of Compounds I and II. The rate of transition from high spin ferric state of V90H to Compound I by H2O2 is increased by approximately three orders relative to wild-type LmPP, which is consistent with electron donor oxidation data where the V90H mutant enzyme is ~\u00a030 fold more active than wild type. Thus, our data indicate that a lower rate for heterolytic cleavage of the OO bond of H2O2 in wild type LmPP is caused by the His/Val switch in heme distal site. In the catalysis of peroxynitrite scavenging, V90H LmPP has lower catalytic activity compared to the wild type enzyme. In contrast to peroxynitrite scavenging, the second order rate constant of peroxynitrite binding step in mutant enzyme does not change significantly compared to the wild-type. Spectral data suggest that the distal Val90 residue in LmPP prevents the ferryl species formation in the presence of peroxynitrite. The lower peroxynitrite scavenging activity of the mutant reflects increased peroxidase activity rather than isomerase activity.",

Using a modified thin-layer reaction chamber which permits quantitative analysis of the concentration of the reaction product (reduced benzyl viologen) in the reaction volume during the oxidation of H2, we now show that the steady-state concentration of the product displays a strong enzyme concentration dependence. This experimental fact can be explained only if the previously detected autocatalytic step occurs inside the catalytic enzyme-cycle and not in the enzyme activation process. Consequently, both interacting enzyme forms should participate in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. As far as we are aware, this is the first experimental observation of such a phenomenon resulting in an apparent inhibition of the enzyme. It is additionally concluded that the interaction of the two enzyme forms should result in a conformational change in the enzyme\u2013substrate form. This scheme is very similar to that of prion reactions. Since merely a few molecules are involved at some point of the reaction, this process is entirely stochastic in nature. We have therefore developed a stochastic calculation method, calculations with which lent support to the conclusion drawn from the experiment.",

We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to direct imaging single CaFADS molecules bound to mica surfaces, while preserving their catalytic properties. AFM allowed solving individual CaFADS monomers, for which it was even possible to distinguish their sub-molecular individual N- and C-terminal modules in the elongated enzyme. Differences between monomers and higher stoichiometries were easily imaged, enabling us to detect formation of oligomeric species induced by ligand binding. The presence of ATP:Mg2\u00a0+ particularly induced the appearance of the hexameric assembly whose mean molecular volume resembles the crystallographic dimer of trimers.

We name this threshold concentration CFR, the concentration at which fibrillation is retarded. Our data are consistent with a model in which this inhibition is due to the formation of an off-pathway oligomeric species with native-like secondary structure. The oligomeric species dominates at high protein concentrations but exists in dynamic equilibrium with the monomer so that seeding with fibrils can overrule oligomer formation and favors fibrillation under CFR conditions. Thus, fibrillation competes with formation of off-pathway oligomers, probably due to a monomeric conversion step that is required to commit the protein to the fibrillation pathway. The S6 oligomer is resistant to pepsin digestion. We also report that S6 forms different types of fibrils dependent on protein concentration.

In the present work, we used small-angle X-ray scattering and in silico modeling approaches to characterize and assign a function to a predicted LysR-type transcriptional regulator in the X. fastidiosa (XfLysRL) genome. XfLysRL was predicted to be a homologue of BenM, which is a transcriptional regulator involved in the degradation pathway of aromatic compounds. Further functional assays confirmed the structural prediction because we observed that XfLysRL interacts with benzoate and cis,cis-muconic acid (also known as 2E,4E-hexa-2,4-dienedioic acid; hereafter named muconate), both of which are co-factors of BenM. In addition, we showed that the XfLysRL protein is differentially expressed during the different stages of X. fastidiosa biofilm formation and planktonic cell growth, which indicates that its expression responds to a cellular signal that is likely related to the aromatic compound degradation pathway. The assignment of the proper function to a protein is a key step toward understanding the cellular metabolic pathways and pathogenic mechanisms.

Despite their lack of well-defined ordered structure, these proteins and regions are frequently involved in crucial biological processes. Although in recent years these proteins have attracted the attention of many researchers, IDPs represent a significant challenge for structural characterization since these proteins can impact many of the processes in the structure determination pipeline. Here we investigate the effects of IDPs on the structure determination process and the utility of disorder prediction in selecting and improving proteins for structural characterization. Examination of the extent of intrinsic disorder in existing crystal structures found that relatively few protein crystal structures contain extensive regions of intrinsic disorder. Although intrinsic disorder is not the only cause of crystallization failures and many structured proteins cannot be crystallized, filtering out highly disordered proteins from structure-determination target lists is still likely to be cost effective. Therefore it is desirable to avoid highly disordered proteins from structure-determination target lists and we show that disorder prediction can be applied effectively to enrich structure determination pipelines with proteins more likely to yield crystal structures. For structural investigation of specific proteins, disorder prediction can be used to improve targets for structure determination. Finally, a framework for considering intrinsic disorder in the structure determination pipeline is proposed.",

Cell 127 (2006) 1415-24), and strongly binds GTP\u03b3S-MT which is proposed to mimic MT plus ends better than GMPCPP-MT (Maurer S.P. et al. Cell 149 (2012) 371\u201382). Here, we report on the MT binding sites of the CH domain of EB1 as revealed by NMR using the transferred cross-saturation method. In this study, we used GMPCPP-MT and found that the MT binding sites are very similar to the binding site for GTP\u03b3S-MT as suggested by cryo-EM (Maurer S.P. et al. Cell 149 (2012) 371\u201382). Notably, the N-terminal tip of helix \u03b16 of the CH domain did not make contact with GMPCPP-MT, in contrast to the cryo-EM study which showed that it is closely located to a putative switch region of \u03b2-tubulin in GTP\u03b3S-MT (Maurer S.P. et al. Cell 149 (2012) 371-82). Further, we found that the intramolecular interaction site of EB1 overlaps the MT binding sites, indicating that the MT binding sites are masked by interaction with the C-terminal domain. We propose a structural view of autoinhibition and its release mechanism through competition binding with binding partners such as adenomatous polyposis coli protein.",

     "abstract": "Purpose: Crosstalk between Aurora-A kinase and p53 has been proposed. While the genetic amplification of Aurora-A has been observed in many human cancers, how p53 is regulated by Aurora-A remains ambiguous. In this study, Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation of p53 was analyzed by mass spectrometry in order to identify a new phosphorylation site. Subsequently, the functional consequences of such phosphorylation were examined. Experimental design: In vitro phosphorylation of p53 by Aurora-A was performed and the phosphorylated protein was then digested with trypsin and enriched for phosphopeptides by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Subsequently, a combination of \u03b2-elimination and Michael addition was applied to the phosphopeptides in order to facilitate the identification of phosphorylation sites by MS. The functional consequences of the novel phosphorylation of p53 on the protein\u2013protein interactions, protein stability and transactivation activity were then examined using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and reporter assays. Results: Ser-106 of p53 was identified as a novel site phosphorylated by Aurora-A. A serine-to-alanine mutation at this site was found to attenuate Aurora-A-mediated phosphorylation in vitro. In addition, phosphate-sensitive Phos-tag SDS-PAGE was used to confirm that the Ser-106 of p53 is in vivo phosphorylated by Aurora-A. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation studies suggested that Ser-106 phosphorylation of p53 decreases its interaction with MDM2 and prolongs the half-life of p53. Conclusions: The inhibition of the interaction between p53 and MDM2 by a novel Aurora-A-mediated p53 phosphorylation was identified in this study and this provides important information for further investigations into the interaction between p53 and Aurora-A in terms of cancer biology.",

The two most widespread members of the family, AroE and YdiB, function in amino acid biosynthesis and quinate catabolism, respectively. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of an SDH homolog belonging to the RifI class, a group of enzymes with proposed roles in antibiotic biosynthesis. The structure of RifI2 from Pseudomonas putida exhibits a number of distinctive features, including a substantial C-terminal truncation and an atypical mode of oligomerization. The active site of the enzyme contains substrate- and cofactor-binding motifs that are significantly different from those of any previously characterized member of the SDH family. These features are reflected in the novel kinetic properties of the enzyme. RifI2 exhibits much lower activity using shikimate as a substrate than AroE, and a strong preference for NAD+ instead of NADP+ as a cofactor. Moreover, the enzyme has only trace activity using quinate, unlike YdiB. Cocrystallization of RifI2 with NAD+ provided the opportunity to determine the mode of cofactor selectivity employed by the enzyme. We complemented this analysis by probing the role of a strictly conserved residue in the cofactor-binding domain, Asn193, by site directed mutagenesis. This study presents the first crystal structure and formal kinetic characterization of a new NAD+-dependent member of the SDH family.",

We observed that the binding of Grb2 to a bivalent ligand, containing two Sos-derived polyproline-sequences immobilized on a SPR sensor, shows unusual kinetic behavior. SPR-kinetic analysis and supporting data from other techniques show major contributions of an intermolecular bivalent binding mode. Each of the two Grb2 SH3 domains binds to one polyproline-sequence of two different ligand molecules, facilitating binding of a second Grb2 molecule to the two remaining free polyproline binding sites. A molecular model based on the X-ray structure of the Grb2 dimer shows that Grb2 is flexible enough to allow this binding mode. The results fit with a role of Grb2 in protein aggregation, achieving specificity by multivalent interactions, despite the relatively low affinity of single SH3 interactions.",

     "abstract": "Nucleophile mutants of retaining \u03b2-glycosidase can act as glycosynthases to efficiently catalyze the synthesis of oligosaccharides. Previous studies proved that rice BGlu1 mutants E386G, E386S and E386A catalyze the oligosaccharide synthesis with different rates. The E386G mutant gave the fastest transglucosylation rate, which was approximately 3- and 19-fold faster than those of E386S and E386A. To account for the differences of their activities, in this paper, the X-ray crystal structures of BGlu1 mutants E386S and E386A were solved and compared with that of E386G mutant. However, they show quite similar active sites, which implies that their activities cannot be elucidated from the crystal structures alone. Therefore, a combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations were further performed. Our calculations reveal that the catalytic reaction follows a single-step mechanism, i.e., the extraction of proton by the acid/base, E176, and the formation of glycosidic bond are concerted. The energy barriers are calculated to be 19.9, 21.5 and 21.9\u00a0kcal/mol for the mutants of E386G, E386S and E386A, respectively, which is consistent with the order of their experimental relative activities. But based on the calculated activation energies, 1.1\u00a0kcal/mol energy difference may translate to nearly 100 fold rate difference. Although the rate limiting step in these mutants has not been established, considering the size of the product and the nature of the active site, it is likely that the product release, rather than chemistry, is rate limiting in these oligosaccharides synthesis catalyzed by BGlu1 mutants.",

     "abstract": "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic cocco-bacillus and a frequent member of the human oral flora. It produces a leukotoxin, LtxA, belonging to the repeats-in-toxin (RTX) family of bacterial cytotoxins. LtxA efficiently kills neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytes. The known receptor for LtxA on leukocytes is integrin \u03b1L\u03b22 (LFA-1 or CD11a/CD18). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in LtxA-mediated cytotoxicity are poorly understood, partly because LtxA has proven difficult to prepare for experiments as free of contaminants and with its native structure. Here, we describe a protocol for the purification of LtxA from bacterial culture supernatant, which does not involve denaturing procedures. The purified LtxA was monodisperse, well folded as judged by the combined use of synchrotron radiation circular dichroism spectroscopy (SRCD) and in silico prediction of the secondary structure content, and free of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The analysis by SRCD and similarity to a lipase from Pseudomonas with a known three dimensional structure supports the presence of a so-called beta-ladder domain in the C-terminal part of LtxA. LtxA rapidly killed K562 target cells transfected to express \u03b22 integrin. Cells expressing \u03b1M\u03b22 (CD11b/CD18) or \u03b1X\u03b22 (CD11c/CD18) were killed as efficiently as cells expressing \u03b1L\u03b22. Erythrocytes, which do not express \u03b22 integrins, were lysed more slowly. In ligand blotting experiments, LtxA bound only to the \u03b22 chain (CD18). These data support a previous suggestion that CD18 harbors the major binding site for LtxA as well as identifies integrins \u03b1M\u03b22 and \u03b1X\u03b22 as novel receptors for LtxA.",

While the functional properties of YB-1 are extensively studied, little is known about its structural properties. In the present work we focused on studying its secondary structure, rigidity of its tertiary structure, compactness, and oligomerization in vitro by using far UV-CD, DSC, one-dimensional 1H NMR, SAXS, sedimentation and FPLC. It was shown that only the cold shock domain within the entire YB-1 chain has a well-packed tertiary structure undergoing cooperative heat and cold denaturation transitions. In contrast, the rest of the YB-1 molecule is not rigidly packed and consists of PP II-like helical secondary structure elements and coil-like regions. At the same time, the overall dimension of the protein molecule is unexpectedly small. The polypeptide chains of YB-1 have a high tendency to form oligomers at neutral pH, while the extent and structural organization of the oligomers depend on protein concentration and ionic strength varying from compact monomeric units up to high molecular weight oligomers. These oligomers in solution are unstable and dissociate upon protein concentration decrease.",

The structures of full-length PB1-F2 of the influenza strains Pandemic flu 2009 H1N1, 1918 Spanish flu H1N1, Bird flu H5N1 and H1N1 PR8, have been characterized by NMR and CD spectroscopy. The study was conducted using chemically synthesized full-length PB1-F2 protein and fragments thereof. The amino acid residues 30\u201370 of PR8 PB1-F2 were found to be responsible for amyloid formation of the protein, which could be assigned to formation of \u03b2-sheet structures, although \u03b1-helices were the only structural features detected under conditions that mimic a membranous environment. At membranous conditions, in which the proteins are found in their most structured state, significant differences become apparent between the PB1-F2 variants investigated. In contrast to Pandemic flu 2009 H1N1 and PR8 PB1-F2, which exhibit a continuous extensive C-terminal \u03b1-helix, both Spanish flu H1N1 and Bird flu H5N1 PB1-F2 contain a loop region with residues 66\u201371 that divides the C-terminus into two shorter helices. The observed structural differences are located to the C-terminal ends of the proteins to which most of the known functions of these proteins have been assigned. A C-terminal helix\u2013loop\u2013helix motif might be a structural signature for PB1-F2 of the highly pathogenic influenza viruses as observed for 1918 Spanish flu H1N1 and Bird flu H5N1 PB1-F2.

Equilibrium CD studies showed that reduced HEWL when mixed with negatively charged surfactants, such as SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate), gradually regains average helical structure to a level equivalent to that obtained for the oxidized form also in SDS, but both forms lose tertiary structure in such environments. This non-native structure recovery process begins with monomer surfactant interaction but at higher concentrations is in part dependent on micelle formation, with the helical fraction reaching its maximum value with each surfactant only above the CMC. Fluorescence changes were more complex, evidencing an intermediate state at lower surfactant concentration. With positively charged surfactants the degree of helicity recovered was less, and the intermediate state in fluorescence was not seen. Stopped flow dynamics studies showed the CD kinetics fit to two exponentials as did the fluorescence. The faster steps in CD and fluorescence detected kinetics appear to be correlated which suggests formation of an intermediate on rapid interaction of the micelle and protein. The second step then reflected attainment of a stable surfactant solvated state which attains maximum helicity and moves the Trps to a more hydrophobic environment, which may occur in independent steps, as the slower kinetics are not well correlated.",

We identified 66 differentially expressed proteins involved in these five differentiation stages. Together with the results of Western blotting, RT-PCR, and a search of metabolic pathways related to the identified proteins, these results indicated that collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), its phosphorylated forms, and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1) were upregulated from ES cells to Day 4 and NSS cells, to which differentiation stages apoptosis-associated proteins such as caspases were possibly related; Phosphorylated CRMP2s were further upregulated but CRABP1 was downregulated from NSS cells to NS cells, during which differentiation stage considerable axon guidance proteins for development of growth cones, axon attraction, and repulsion were possibly readied; Nonphosphorylated CRMP2 was downregulated but CRABP1 was re-upregulated from NS cells to AstP cells, in which differentiation stage reorganization of actin cytoskeleton linked to focal adhesion was possibly accompanied.

Over time, the slow auto-cleavage of UmuD2 to UmuD\u20322 promotes mutagenesis to ensure cell survival. The intracellular levels of UmuD2 and UmuD\u20322 are further regulated by degradation in vivo, returning the cell to a non-mutagenic state. To further understand the dynamic regulatory roles of the umuD gene products, we monitored the kinetics of exchange and cleavage of the UmuD2 and UmuD\u20322 homodimers as well as of the UmuDD\u2032 heterodimer under equilibrium conditions. We found that the heterodimer is the preferred but not exclusive protein form, and that both the heterodimer and homodimers exhibit slow exchange kinetics which is further inhibited in the presence of interacting partner DinB. In addition, the heterodimer efficiently cleaves to form UmuD\u20322.

We found that Hsp31 undergoes a conformational change via temperature-induced unfolding, generating a high molecular weight (HMW) form with enhanced chaperone activity. Although it has previously been reported that some subunits of the Hsp31 crystal structure show structural heterogeneity with increased hydrophobic surfaces, Hsp31 basically forms a dimer. We found that a C-terminal deletion (C\u039419) of Hsp31 exhibited structurally and functionally similar characteristics to that of the HMW form. Both the C\u039419 and HMW forms achieved a structure with considerably more \u03b2-sheets and less \u03b1-helices than the native dimeric form, exposing a portion of its hydrophobic surfaces. The structural alterations were determined from its spectral changes in circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan residues, and fluorescence of bis-ANS binding to a hydrophobic surface. Interestingly, during thermal transition, the dimeric Hsp31 undergoes a conformational change to the HMW species via the C\u039419 structure, as monitored with near-UV CD spectrum, implying that the C\u039419 resembles an intermediate state between the dimer and the HMW form.

Based on a general, CYP102A1-related template the bulk of predicted substrate/inhibitor-binding determinants were shown to cluster near the distal heme face within the six known substrate recognition sites (SRSs) made up by the \u03b1-helical B\u2032/F/G/I tetrad, the B\u2032\u2013C interhelical loop and strands of the \u03b26-sheet, population density being highest in the structurally flexible SRS-1 and SRS-4 domains, showing a low degree of conservation. Reactivity toward ligands favorably coincides with the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity profile and bulkiness of critical amino acids acting as selective filters. Some decisive elements may also serve in maintenance of catalytic competence via their action as gatekeepers directing substrate access/positioning or stabilizers of the heme environment enabling dioxygen activation. Non-SRS residues seem to control spin state equilibria and attract redox partners by electrostatic forces. Of note, the inhibitory potency of azole-type fungicides is likely to arise from perturbation of the complex interplay of the mechanistic principles addressed above. Knowledge-supported exploitation of the topological data will be helpful in the manufacture of commodity/specialty chemicals as well as therapeutic agents. Also, engineered fungal P450s may be used to improve pollutant-specific bioremediation of contaminated soils.",

     "abstract": "High fidelity DNA polymerases maintain genomic fidelity through a series of kinetic steps that include nucleotide binding, conformational changes, phosphoryl transfer, polymerase translocation, and nucleotide excision. Developing a comprehensive understanding of how these steps are coordinated during correct and pro-mutagenic DNA synthesis has been hindered due to lack of spectroscopic nucleotides that function as efficient polymerase substrates. This report describes the application of a non-natural nucleotide designated 5-naphthyl-indole-2\u2032-deoxyribose triphosphate which behaves as a fluorogenic substrate to monitor nucleotide incorporation and excision during the replication of normal DNA versus two distinct DNA lesions (cyclobutane thymine dimer and an abasic site). Transient fluorescence and rapid-chemical quench experiments demonstrate that the rate constants for nucleotide incorporation vary as a function of DNA lesion. These differences indicate that the non-natural nucleotide can function as a spectroscopic probe to distinguish between normal versus translesion DNA synthesis. Studies using wild-type DNA polymerase reveal the presence of a fluorescence recovery phase that corresponds to the formation of a pre-excision complex that precedes hydrolytic excision of the non-natural nucleotide. Rate constants for the formation of this pre-excision complex are dependent upon the DNA lesion, and this suggests that the mechanism of exonuclease proofreading is regulated by the nature of the formed mispair. Finally, spectroscopic evidence confirms that exonuclease proofreading competes with polymerase translocation. Collectively, this work provides the first demonstration for a non-natural nucleotide that functions as a spectroscopic probe to study the coordinated efforts of polymerization and exonuclease proofreading during correct and translesion DNA synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Background: Bacterial resistance to antibiotic therapies is increasing and new treatment options are badly needed. There is an overlap between these resistant bacteria and organisms classified as likely bioterror weapons. For example, Bacillus anthracis is innately resistant to the anti-folate trimethoprim due to sequence changes found in the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Development of new inhibitors provides an opportunity to enhance the current arsenal of anti-folate antibiotics while also expanding the coverage of the anti-folate class. Methods: We have characterized inhibitors of B. anthracis dihydrofolate reductase by measuring the Ki and MIC values and calculating the energetics of binding. This series contains a core diaminopyrimidine ring, a central dimethoxybenzyl ring, and a dihydrophthalazine moiety. We have altered the chemical groups extended from a chiral center on the dihydropyridazine ring of the phthalazine moiety. The interactions for the most potent compounds were visualized by X-ray structure determination. Results: We find that the potency of individual enantiomers is divergent with clear preference for the S-enantiomer, while maintaining a high conservation of contacts within the binding site. The preference for enantiomers seems to be predicated largely by differential interactions with protein residues Leu29, Gln30 and Arg53. Conclusions: These studies have clarified the activity of modifications and of individual enantiomers, and highlighted the role of the less-active R-enantiomer in effectively diluting the more active S-enantiomer in racemic solutions. This directly contributes to the development of new antimicrobials, combating trimethoprim resistance, and treatment options for potential bioterrorism agents.",

We have used total binding energy to justify the stability of the complex using the MMPBSA method. We found a remarkable increase in the stability of the complex at neutral pH (pH\u00a0~\u00a07) due to the increment of sodium ions. However, at very low pH (pH\u00a0~\u00a04), the total energy of the complex becomes high enough to destabilize the complex. At a specific pH, almost at a range of 6, the stability of the complex is significantly better than the stability of the trimer at neutral pH, which connotes that the trimer is most stable at this pH (pH\u00a0~\u00a06).",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) is an important feature of Alzheimer's disease. There is significant interest in understanding the initial steps of A\u03b2 aggregation due to the recent focus on soluble A\u03b2 oligomers. In vitro studies of A\u03b2 aggregation have been aided by the use of conformation-specific antibodies which recognize shape rather than sequence. One of these, OC antiserum, recognizes certain elements of fibrillar A\u03b2 across a broad range of sizes. We have observed the presence of these fibrillar elements at very early stages of A\u03b2 incubation. Using a dot blot assay, OC-reactivity was found in size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-purified A\u03b2(1\u201342) monomer fractions immediately after isolation (early-stage). The OC-reactivity was not initially observed in the same fractions for A\u03b2(1\u201340) or the aggregation-restricted A\u03b2(1\u201342) L34P but was detected within 1\u20132\u00a0weeks of incubation. Stability studies demonstrated that early-stage OC-positive A\u03b2(1\u201342) aggregates were resistant to 4\u00a0M urea or guanidine hydrochloride but sensitive to 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Interestingly, the sensitivity to SDS diminished over time upon incubation of the SEC-purified A\u03b2(1\u201342) solution at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Within 6\u20138\u00a0days the OC-positive A\u03b242 aggregates were resistant to SDS denaturation. The progression to, and development of, SDS resistance for A\u03b2(1\u201342) occurred prior to thioflavin T fluorescence. In contrast, A\u03b2(1\u201340) aggregates formed after 6\u00a0days of incubation were sensitive to both urea and SDS. These findings reveal information on some of the earliest events in A\u03b2 aggregation and suggest that it may be possible to target early-stage aggregates before they develop significant stability.",

Inhibitor-2 (I2) squelches the ubiquitous protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) enzyme activity by blocking access to the metal-containing active site. I2 Thr74 phosphorylation results in PP1 activation without I2 dissociation from the PP1\u2013I2 complex. The dynamic disordered structure of the 73-residue segment of I2 containing Thr74, prevented visualization by X-ray crystallography of PP1\u2013I2. In this work, I generated structures of this segment using simulated annealing to NMR restraints, fused them to the crystallographic PP1\u2013I2 coordinates, and used molecular dynamics to study the impact of Thr74 phosphorylation on structural alterations leading to PP1 activation. Frequencies of I2 Tyr149 displacement from the PP1 active site, rotation of the phenolic Tyr149 side chain to prevent its reinsertion, and repositioning the I2 inhibitory helix to expose the PP1 active site to solvent and substrates significantly increased upon I2 Thr74 phosphorylation. After these steps, a second metal bound to produce PP1\u2013Mn2\u2013I2, which held the phosphorylated form of I2 to its active site less tightly than it held dephosphorylated I2. I2 Thr74 lies on the edge of variable dynamic communities of residues where it forms various allosteric pathways that induce motions at the PP1 active site 20\u00a0\u00c5 away. These molecular dynamics simulations show how an unstructured region of I2 can harness enhanced rapid movements around phosphorylated Thr74 to pry I2 residues away from the PP1 active site in early steps of PP1\u2013I2 activation.",

Mechanistic and structural investigations of Rca have been hampered by its exceptional thermolability, high degree of size polydispersity and propensity towards subunit aggregation. In this work, we have characterized the thermal stability and self-association behavior of recombinant Rca preparations, and have developed ligand screening methods. Thermal denaturation profiles generated by circular dichroism indicate that creosote and tobacco short-form Rcas are the most stable proteins examined, with an estimated mid-point temperature of 45\u201347\u00a0\u00b0C for protein denaturation. We demonstrate that ADP provides a higher degree of stabilization than ATP, that magnesium ions have a small stabilizing effect on ATP-bound, but a significant destabilizing effect on ADP-bound Rca, and that phosphate provides weak stabilization of the ADP-bound form of the protein. A dimeric species was identified by size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting that the two-subunit module may comprise the basic building block for larger assemblies. Evidence is provided that chromatographic procedures reflect non-equilibrium multimeric states. Dynamic light scattering experiments performed on nucleotide-bearing Rca support the notion that several larger, highly polydisperse assembly states coexist over a broad concentration range. No significant changes in aggregation are observed upon replacement of ADP with ATP. However, in the absence of nucleotides, the major protein population appears to consist of a monodisperse oligomer smaller than a hexamer.",

Here we determined kinetic and structural properties of POP with mutations in loop A, loop B, and in two additional flexible loops (the catalytic His loop, propeller Asp/Glu loop). POP lacking loop A proved to be an inefficient enzyme, as did POP with a mutation in loop B (T590C). Both variants displayed an altered substrate preference profile, with reduced ligand binding capacity. Conversely, the T202C mutation increased the flexibility of loop A, enhancing the catalytic efficiency beyond that of the native enzyme. The T590C mutation in loop B increased the preference for shorter peptides, indicating a role in substrate gating. Loop A and the His loop are disordered in the H680A mutant crystal structure, as seen in previous bacterial POP structures, implying coordinated structural dynamics of these loops. Unlike native POP, variants with a malfunctioning loop A were not inhibited by a 17-mer peptide that may bind non-productively to an exosite involving loop A.

A 171-residue-long fragment (polyE) of the disordered PEVK domain, and an Ig domain (I27) with ordered structure were investigated. FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) and fluorescence spectroscopy combined with a diamond anvil cell were used for investigation of the secondary structures under wide range of pressure and temperature.

Via mass spectrometry analysis of the recovered fractions, after elution of the captured populations in 4% boiling SDS, we could identify a total of 876 unique gene products in the artichoke extracts, 18 in the home-made infusion and no proteins at all in the Italian Cynar liqueur, casting severe doubts on the procedure stated by the manufacturer (that should be made by an infusion of artichoke leaves plus thirteen different herbs). This could be the starting point for investigating the genuineness and natural origin of commercial drinks in order to protect consumers from adulterated products.",

     "abstract": "The monomeric outer membrane protein OmpA from Escherichia coli has long served as a model protein for studying the folding and membrane insertion of \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins. Here we report that when OmpA is refolded in limiting amounts of surfactant (close to the cmc), it has a high propensity to form folded and unfolded oligomers. The oligomers exist both in a folded and (partially) unfolded form which both dissociate under denaturing conditions. Oligomerization does not require the involvement of the periplasmic domain and is not strongly affected by ionic strength. The folded dimers can be isolated and show native-like secondary structure; they are resistant to proteolytic attack and do not dissociate in high surfactant concentrations, indicating high kinetic stability once formed. Remarkably, OmpA also forms significant amounts of higher order structures when refolding in the presence of lipid vesicles. We suggest that oligomerization occurs by domain swapping favored by the high local concentration of OmpA molecules congregating on the same micelle or vesicle. In this model, the unfolded oligomer is stabilized by a small number of intermolecular \u03b2-strand contacts and subsequently folds to a more stable state where these intermolecular contacts are consolidated in a native-like fashion by contacts between complementary \u03b2-strands from different molecules. Our model is supported by the ability of complementary fragments to associate with each other in vitro. Oligomerization is probably avoided in the cell by the presence of cellular chaperones which maintain the protein in a monomeric state.",

     "abstract": "Three yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) variants with apolar distal heme pockets have been constructed. The CcP variants have Arg48, Trp51, and His52 mutated to either all alanines, CcP(triAla), all valines, CcP(triVal), or all leucines, CcP(triLeu). The triple mutants have detectable enzymatic activity at pH 6 but the activity is less than 0.02% that of wild-type CcP. The activity loss is primarily due to the decreased rate of reaction between the triple mutants and H2O2 compared to wild-type CcP. Spectroscopic properties and cyanide binding characteristics of the triple mutants have been investigated over the pH stability region of CcP, pH 4 to 8. The absorption spectra indicate that the CcP triple mutants have hemes that are predominantly five-coordinate, high-spin at pH 5 and six-coordinate, low-spin at pH 8. Cyanide binding to the triple mutants is biphasic indicating that the triple mutants have two slowly-exchanging conformational states with different cyanide affinities. The binding affinity for cyanide is reduced at least two orders of magnitude in the triple mutants compared to wild-type CcP and the rate of cyanide binding is reduced by four to five orders of magnitude. Correlation of the reaction rates of CcP and 12 distal pocket mutants with H2O2 and HCN suggests that both reactions require ionization of the reactants within the distal heme pocket allowing the anion to bind the heme iron. Distal pocket features that promote substrate ionization (basic residues involved in base-catalyzed substrate ionization or polar residues that can stabilize substrate anions) increase the overall rate of reaction with H2O2 and HCN while features that inhibit substrate ionization slow the reactions.",

Here we have examined the effect of concentrated NaCl solutions on structure, stability, dynamics and enzymatic activity of GthGT. The protein exhibited hydrolytic activity over a broad range of NaCl concentrations. Even at 4.0\u00a0M NaCl, GthGT retained more than 90% of the initial activity and showed unaltered fluorescence emission, secondary structure and acrylamide quenching on tryptophan fluorescence. Furthermore, at 2.8\u00a0M and 4.0\u00a0M NaCl the temperature-induced unfolding profiles are dramatically changed with large (>\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C) positive shifts in the denaturation temperature. These features make GthGT an ideal system to be used in industrial processes that require high temperatures and high-salt environments. A general explanation of the NaCl effect by means of a statistical thermodynamic model is also provided, together with an analysis of residue distribution between protein surface and interior in 15 non-redundant families of halophilic and non-halophilic proteins. The results are in line with a comparative sequence and structural analysis between halophilic and non-halophilic \u03b3-glutamyltranspeptidases which revealed that a major role in halotolerance should be played by solvent exposed negatively charged residues.",

     "abstract": "Chemokines encompass a large family of proteins that act as chemoattractants and are involved in many biological processes. In particular, chemokines guide the migration of leukocytes during normal and inflammatory conditions. Recent studies reveal that the heterophilic interactions between chemokines significantly affect their biological activity, possibly representing a novel regulatory mechanism of the chemokine activities. The co-localization of platelet-derived chemokines in vivo allows them to interact. Here, we used nano-spray ionization mass spectrometry to screen eleven different CXC and CC platelet-derived chemokines for possible interactions with the two most abundant chemokines present in platelets, CXCL4 and CXCL7. Results indicate that many screened chemokines, although not all of them, form heterodimers with CXCL4 and/or CXCL7. In particular, a strong heterodimerization was observed between CXCL12 and CXCL4 or CXCL7. Compared to other chemokines, the main structural difference of CXCL12 is in the orientation and packing of the C-terminal alpha-helix in relation to the beta-sheet. The analysis of one possible structure of the CXCL4/CXCL12 heterodimer, CXC-type structure, using molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory reveals that CXCL4 may undergo a conformational transition to alter the alpha helix orientation. In this new orientation, the alpha-helix of CXCL4 aligns in parallel with the CXCL12 alpha-helix, an energetically more favorable conformation. Further, we determined that CXCL4 and CXCL12 physically interact to form heterodimers by co-immunoprecipitations from human platelets. Overall, our results highlight that many platelet-derived chemokines are capable of heterophilic interactions and strongly support future studies of the biological impact of these interactions.",

     "abstract": "O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (OASS) catalyzes the synthesis of l-cysteine in the last step of the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway in microorganisms. Its activity is inhibited by the interaction with serine acetyltransferase (SAT), the preceding enzyme in the metabolic pathway. Inhibition is exerted by the insertion of SAT C-terminal peptide into the OASS active site. This action is effective only on the A isozyme, the prevalent form in enteric bacteria under aerobic conditions, but not on the B-isozyme, the form expressed under anaerobic conditions. We have investigated the active site determinants that modulate the interaction specificity by comparing the binding affinity of thirteen pentapeptides, derived from the C-terminal sequences of SAT of the closely related species Haemophilus influenzae and Salmonella typhimurium, towards the corresponding OASS-A, and towards S. typhimurium OASS-B. We have found that subtle changes in protein active sites have profound effects on protein\u2013peptide recognition. Furthermore, affinity is strongly dependent on the pentapeptide sequence, signaling the relevance of P3\u2013P4\u2013P5 for the strength of binding, and P1\u2013P2 mainly for specificity. The presence of an aromatic residue at P3 results in high affinity peptides with Kdiss in the micromolar and submicromolar range, regardless of the species. An acidic residue, like aspartate at P4, further strengthens the interaction and results in the higher affinity ligand of S. typhimurium OASS-A described to date. Since OASS knocked-out bacteria exhibit a significantly decreased fitness, this investigation provides key information for the development of selective OASS inhibitors, potentially useful as novel antibiotic agents.",

Buffalo/bovine M-proinsulin was also cleaved by trypsin at the K59R60\u2013G61 bond but at the B/C junction cleavage occurred at the R31R32\u2013E33 as well as the R31\u2013R32E33 bond. Thus, the human isoform in the native state, with a 31 residue connecting C-peptide, seems to have a unique structure around the B/C and C/A junctions and cleavage at these sites is predominantly governed by the structure of the proinsulin itself. In the case of both the proinsulin species the cleavage at the B/C junction was preferred (65%) over that at the C/A junction (35%) supporting the earlier suggestion of the presence of some form of secondary structure at the C/A junction. Proinsulin and its derivatives, as natural substrates for trypsin, were used and mass spectrometric analysis showed that the kcat./Km values for the cleavage were most favourable for the scission of the bonds at the two junctions (1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01) and the cleavage of the K29\u2013T30 bond of M-insulin-RR (1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01).

We have recently described the S-nitrosylation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein tyrosine phosphatase A, PtpA, an enzyme that plays an important role in mycobacteria survival inside macrophages. This post-translational modification decreases the activity of the enzyme upon modification of a single Cys residue, C53. The aim of the present work was the investigation of the effect of S-nitrosylation in PtpA kinetic parameters, thermal stability and structure. It was observed that the KM of nitrosylated PtpA was similar to its unmodified form, but the Vmax was significantly reduced. In contrast, treatment of PtpA C53A with GSNO, did not alter either KM or Vmax. These results confirmed that PtpA S-nitrosylation occurs specifically in the non-catalytic C53 and that this modification does not affect substrate affinity. Using circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy techniques it was shown that PtpA S-nitrosylation decreased protein thermal stability and promoted a local effect in the surroundings of the C53 residue, which interfered in both protein stability and function.",

Comparatively, among the known dengue serotypes, we evaluate the effects that these medium variations may induce to the overall structural characteristics of the Domain III of the envelope (E) protein, checking for stereochemical congruences that could lead to the identification of immunologic relevant regions. We used molecular dynamics and principal component analysis to study the protein in solution, for all four dengue serotypes, under distinct pH and temperature. We stated that, while the core of Domain III is remarkably rigid and effectively unaffected by most of the mentioned intensive variations, the loops account for major and distinguishable flexibilities. Therefore, the rigidity of the Domain III core provides a foothold that projects specifically two of these high flexible loop regions towards the inner face of the envelope pores, which are found at every five-fold symmetry axis of the icosahedron-shaped mature virus. These loops bear a remarkable low identity though with high occurrence of ionizable residues, including histidines. Such stereochemical properties can provide very particular serotype-specific electrostatic surface patterns, suggesting a viral fingerprint region, on which other specific molecules and ions can establish chemical interactions in an induced fit mechanism. We assert that the proposed regions share enough relevant features to qualify for further immunologic and pharmacologic essays, such as target peptide synthesis and phage display using dengue patients' sera.",

A third group reported Phl p 1 to act by a non-proteolytic activity mechanism. We report the purification of the natural Phl p 1 by means of hydrophobic interaction, gel filtration and STI-Sepharose affinity chromatographies. The Phl p 1 purity was assessed by silver-stained SDS-PAGE and by \u2018in-gel\u2019 and \u2018gel-free\u2019 approaches associated to mass spectrometry analyses. The proteolytic activity was measured using Boc\u2013Gln\u2013Ala\u2013Arg\u2013AMC and Z-Phe\u2013Arg\u2013AMC as substrates. While amidolytic activity could be measured with Phl p 1 after rechromatography on gel filtration, it however completely disappeared after chromatography on STI-Sepharose. The contaminant activity co-eluting with Phl p 1 was not affected by cysteine proteases inhibitors and other thiol-blocking agents, by metalloproteases inhibitors and by aspartic proteases inhibitors. However, it was completely inhibited by low molecular weight and proteinaceous serine proteases inhibitors. TLCK, but not TPCK, inhibited the contaminant activity, showing a trypsin-like behavior. The pH and temperature optimum were 8.0 and 37\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. These data indicated that Phl p 1 is not a protease. The contaminant trypsin-like activity should be considered when Phl p 1 allergenicity is emphasized.",

     "abstract": "Bacteriophage Mu, which has a contractile tail, is one of the most famous genus of Myoviridae. It has a wide host range and is thought to contribute to horizontal gene transfer. The Myoviridae infection process is initiated by adhesion to the host surface. The phage then penetrates the host cell membrane using its tail to inject its genetic material into the host. In this penetration process, Myoviridae phages are proposed to puncture the membrane of the host cell using a central spike located beneath its baseplate. The central spike of the Mu phage is thought to be composed of gene 45 product (gp45), which has a significant sequence homology with the central spike of P2 phage (gpV). We determined the crystal structure of shortened Mu gp45\u03941-91 (Arg92\u2013Gln197) at 1.5\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and showed that Mu gp45 is a needlelike structure that punctures the membrane. The apex of Mu gp45 and that of P2 gpV contained iron, chloride, and calcium ions. Although the C-terminal domain of Mu gp45 was sufficient for binding to the E. coli membrane, a mutant D188A, in which the Asp amino acid residue that coordinates the calcium ion was replaced by Ala, did not exhibit a propensity to bind to the membrane. Therefore, we concluded that calcium ion played an important role in interaction with the host cell membrane.",

The death receptors contain an intracellular death domain (DD) which is essential to the transduction of the apoptotic signal. The kinase receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) is crucial to programmed necrosis. The cell type interplay between FADD and RIP1, which mediates both necrosis and NF-\u03baB activation, has been evaluated in other studies, but the mechanism of the interaction of the FADD and RIP1 proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we provided evidence indicating that the DD of human FADD binds to the DD of RIP1 in vitro. We developed a molecular docking model using homology modeling based on the structures of FADD and RIP1. In addition, we found that two structure-based mutants (G109A and R114A) of the FADD DD were able to bind to the RIP1 DD, and two mutations (Q169A and N171A) of FADD DD and four mutations (G595, K596, E620, and D622) of RIP1 DD disrupted the FADD\u2013RIP1 interaction. Six mutations (Q169A, N171A, G595, K596, E620, and D622) lowered the stability of the FADD\u2013RIP1 complex and induced aggregation that structurally destabilized the complex, thus disrupting the interaction.",

     "abstract": "The study aimed to define the key factors involved in the modulation of actinomycete mannanases. We focused on the roles of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) and bivalent ions. To investigate the effects of these factors, two actinomycete mannanase genes were cloned from Streptomyces thermoluteus (StManII) and Streptomyces lividans (SlMan). CBMs fused to mannanase catalytic domains do not affect the thermal stability of the proteins. CBM2 of StManII increased the catalytic efficiency toward soluble-mannan and insoluble-mannan by 25%\u201336%, and CBM10 of SlMan increased the catalytic efficiency toward soluble-mannan by 40%\u201350%. Thermal stability of wild-type and mutant enzymes was enhanced by calcium and manganese. Thermal stability of SlMandC was also slightly enhanced by magnesium. These results indicated that bivalent ion-binding site responsible for thermal stability was in the catalytic domains. Thermal stability of mannanase differed in the kinds of bivalent ions. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that the catalytic domain of StManII bound bivalent ions with a Ka of 5.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u20137.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01, and the catalytic domain of SlMan bound bivalent ions with a Ka of 1.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u20133.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.94\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01. The stoichiometry of these bindings was consistent with one bivalent ion-binding site per molecule of enzyme. Circular dichroism spectrum revealed that the presence of bivalent ions induced changes in the secondary structures of the enzymes. The binding of certain bivalent ion responsible for thermal stability was accompanied by a different conformational change by each bivalent ion.

Isotope-assisted infrared vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and absorption (VA) spectroscopy were used for the parent A\u03b2(25\u201335) peptide, along with doubly 13C labeled peptides at the carbonyl groups of residues 29 (Gly) and 30 (Ala) [A\u03b2(25\u201335:13C-29/30)] and at the carbonyl groups of residues 33 (Gly) and 34 (Leu) [A\u03b2(25\u201335:13C-33/34)]. The present results confirm that A\u03b2(25\u201335) peptide fibrils adopt a \u03b2-sheet structure and isotopic dilution experiments suggest a parallel \u03b2-sheet structure.

Inhibition of these HDACs enzymes have been identified as one of the promising approaches for cancer treatment. The type-specific inhibition of class I HDAC enzymes is known to elicit improved therapeutic effects and thus, the search for promising type-specific HDAC inhibitors compounds remains an ongoing research interest in cancer drug discovery. Several different strategies are employed to identify the features that could identify the isoform specificity factors in these HDAC enzymes. This study combines the insilico docking and energy-optimized pharmacophore (e-pharmacophore) mapping of several known HDACi's to identify the structural variants that are significant for the interactions against each of the four class I HDAC enzymes. Our hybrid approach shows that all the inhibitors with at least one aromatic ring in their linker regions hold higher affinities against the target enzymes, while those without any aromatic rings remain as poor binders. We hypothesize the e-pharmacophore models for the HDACi's against all the four Class I HDAC enzymes which are not reported elsewhere. The results from this work will be useful in the rational design and virtual screening of more isoform specific HDACi's against the class I HDAC family of proteins.",

     "abstract": "It is well-known that fibrillogenesis of proteins can be influenced by diverse external parameters, such as temperature, pressure, agitation or chemical agents. The present preliminary study suggests that ultrasonic excitation at moderate intensities has a significant influence on the unfolding and aggregation behaviour of insulin. Irradiation with an average sound intensity of even as low as 70\u00a0mW/cm2 leads to a lowering of the unfolding and aggregation temperature up to 7\u00a0K. The effect could be explained by an increase of the aggregation kinetics due to ultrasonically induced acoustic micro-streaming in the insulin solution that most probably enhances the aggregation rate. The clear and remarkable effect at relatively low sound intensities offers interesting options for further applications of ultrasound in biophysics and biochemistry. On the other hand, a process that causes a change of kinetics equivalent to 7\u00a0K also gives a warning signal concerning the safety of those medical ultrasonic devices that work in this intensity range.",

Here we investigated the structural status of this protein both to provide distinct lines of evidence for its disorder and to point out its transient structure potentially involved in interactions and also its tendency to aggregate. Structural disorder of hNopp140 is apparent by its anomalous electrophoretic mobility, protease sensitivity, heat stability, hydrodynamic behavior on size-exclusion chromatography, 1H NMR spectrum and differential scanning calorimetry scan. hNopp140 has a significant tendency to aggregate and the change of its circular dichroism spectrum in the presence of 0\u201380% TFE suggests a tendency to form local helical structures. Wide-line NMR measurements suggest the overall disordered character of the protein. In all, our data suggest that this protein falls into the pre-molten globule state of IDPs, with a significant tendency to become ordered in the presence of its partner as demonstrated in the presence of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB).",

Hsp90 activity depends on its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, involving various conformational changes that are regulated by co-chaperones, posttranslational modifications and small molecules. Compounds like geldanamycin (GA) and radicicol inhibit the Hsp90 ATPase activity by occupying the ATP binding site, which can lead client protein to degradation and also inhibit cell growth and differentiation in protozoan parasites. Our goal was to produce the recombinant Hsp90 of Leishmania braziliensis (LbHsp90) and construct of its N-terminal (LbHsp90N) and N-domain and middle-domain (LbHsp90NM), which lacks the C-terminal dimerization domain, in order to understand how Hsp90 works in protozoa. The recombinant proteins were produced folded as attested by spectroscopy experiments. Hydrodynamic experiments revealed that LbHsp90N and LbHsp90NM behaved as elongated monomers while LbHsp90 is an elongated dimer. All proteins prevented the in vitro citrate synthase and malate dehydrogenase aggregation, attesting that they have chaperone activity, and interacted with adenosine ligands with similar dissociation constants. The LbHsp90 has low ATPase activity (kcat\u00a0=\u00a00.320\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01) in agreement with Hsp90 orthologs, whereas the LbHsp90NM has negligible activity, suggesting the importance of the dimeric protein for this activity. The GA interacts with LbHsp90 and with its domain constructions with different affinities and also inhibits the LbHsp90 ATPase activity with an IC50 of 0.7\u00a0\u03bcM.

Single and multiple substitution variants targeting highly conserved residues of the I\u2032-helix were generated for intact KatG as well as the stand-alone C-terminal domain (KatGC). Single variants of intact KatG produced only subtle variations in spectroscopic and catalytic properties of the enzyme. However, the double and quadruple variants showed substantial increases in hexa-coordinate low-spin heme and diminished enzyme activity, similar to that observed for the N-terminal domain on its own (KatGN). The analogous variants of KatGC showed a much more profound loss of function as evaluated by their ability to return KatGN to its active conformation. All of the single variants showed a substantial decrease in the rate and extent of KatGN reactivation, but with two substitutions, KatGC completely lost its capacity for the reactivation of KatGN.

Alkylation occurs preferentially at Cys due to its high nucleophilicity, however reactions at other such sites are possible. N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) shows rapid reaction kinetics with Cys and careful definition of reaction conditions results in little reactivity at other sites. Analysis of a protein standard alkylated under differing reaction conditions (pH, NEM concentrations and reaction times) was performed using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) of NEM-modified and unmodified peptide pairs. Mis-alkylation sites at primary and secondary amines were identified and limited to one equivalent of NEM. No evidence for hydroxyl or thioether alkylation was observed. Improved specificity was achieved by restricting the pH below neutral, NEM concentration below 10\u00a0mM and/or reaction time to below 5\u00a0min. Maximal removal of Cys activity was observed in tissue homogenates at 40\u00a0mM NEM within 1\u00a0min, dependent upon efficient protein denaturation. SRM assays identified peptide-specific levels of mis-alkylation, indicating that NEM-modified to unmodified ratios did not exceed 10%, with the exception of Cys alkylation that proceeded to 100%, and some Lys residues that resulted in tryptic missed cleavages. High reactivity was observed for His residues considering their relatively low abundance. These data indicate that rapid and specific Cys alkylation is possible with NEM under relatively mild conditions, with more abrasive conditions leading to increased non-specific alkylation without appreciable benefit for MS-based proteomics.",

The crystal structure of PFTA revealed a unique monomeric subunit with an extended N-terminal region and an N\u2032-domain folded into its own active site\u2014a significantly altered domain configuration relative to that of the conventional dimeric CD-hydrolyzing amylases in glycoside hydrolase family 13. The active site is formed by the interface of the N\u2032-domain and the catalytic domain and exhibits a broad and wide-open geometry without the concave pocket that is commonly found in the active sites of maltogenic amylases. The mutation of a residue (Gly415 to Glu) located at the domain interface between the N\u2032- and catalytic domains yielded an enzyme that produced a significantly higher purity maltoheptaose (G7) from \u03b2-CD, supporting the involvement of this interface in substrate recognition and indicating that this mutant enzyme is a suitable candidate for the production of pure G7. The unique configuration of the active site distinguishes this archaic monomeric enzyme from classical bacterial CD-hydrolyzing amylases and provides a molecular basis for its enzymatic characteristics and for its potential use in industrial applications.",

AICD is the intracellular subdomain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and able to bind the adapter protein FE65 and the histone acetyltransferase TIP60 setting up a nuclear dot-like phenotype. Within this work we readdressed the generation of the complex as a function of its compartments. Subsequently, we studied the proteome of AFT expressing cells vs. controls and identified Stathmin1 significantly down-regulated in AFT cells. Stathmin1 functions as an important regulatory protein of microtubule dynamics and was found associated with neurofibrillary tangles in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. We validated our results using an independent label-free mass spectrometry based method using the same cell culture model. In a reversal model with diminished APP expression, caused by simultaneous knock-down of all three members of the APP family, we further confirmed our results, as Stathmin1 was regulated in an opposite fashion. We hypothesize that AICD-dependent deregulation of Stathmin1 causes microtubule disorganization, which might play an important role for the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease.",

Disulfide bridges in native \u03b33-hordein were almost the same as those found in wheat \u03b346-gliadin, except the bridge involving the cysteine included in the glycosylation site. IgE reacted more strongly towards the recombinant than the natural \u03b33-hordein protein. IgE binding to \u03b33-hordein increased when the protein sample was reduced. Glycosylation and disulfide bridges therefore decrease epitope accessibility.

Originally underreported, and considered a quirk rather than a fundamental property, enzyme promiscuity is now understood to be important as a springboard for adaptive evolution. Owing to the large number of promiscuous enzymes that have been identified over the last decade, and the increased appreciation for promiscuity's evolutionary importance, the focus of research has shifted to developing a better understanding of the mechanistic basis for promiscuity and the origins of tolerant or restrictive specificity. We review the evidence for widespread crosswise promiscuity amongst enzymes that catalyze phosphoryl transfer, including several members of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily, where large rate accelerations between 106 and 1017 are observed for both native and multiple promiscuous reactions.

     "abstract": "The glycerophosphodiesterase from Enterobacter aerogenes (GpdQ) is a highly promiscuous dinuclear metallohydrolase with respect to both substrate specificity and metal ion composition. While this promiscuity may adversely affect the enzyme's catalytic efficiency its ability to hydrolyse some organophosphates (OPs) and by-products of OP degradation have turned GpdQ into a promising candidate for bioremedial applications. Here, we investigated both metal ion binding and the effect of the metal ion composition on catalysis. The prevalent in vivo metal ion composition for GpdQ is proposed to be of the type Fe(II)Zn(II), a reflection of natural abundance rather than catalytic optimisation. The Fe(II) appears to have lower binding affinity than other divalent metal ions, and the catalytic efficiency of this mixed metal center is considerably smaller than that of Mn(II), Co(II) or Cd(II)-containing derivatives of GpdQ. Interestingly, metal ion replacements do not only affect catalytic efficiency but also the optimal pH range for the reaction, suggesting that different metal ion combinations may employ different mechanistic strategies. These metal ion-triggered modulations are likely to be mediated via an extensive hydrogen bond network that links the two metal ion binding sites via residues in the substrate binding pocket. The observed functional diversity may be the cause for the modest catalytic efficiency of wild-type GpdQ but may also be essential to enable the enzyme to evolve rapidly to alter substrate specificity and enhance kcat values, as has recently been demonstrated in a directed evolution experiment.

These enzymes differ widely in protein sequence and three-dimensional structure, as well as in catalytic mechanism, but they also share several common features. All of the enzymes identified as phosphotriesterases are metal-dependent hydrolases that contain a hydrophobic active site with three discrete binding pockets to accommodate the substrate ester groups. Activation of the substrate phosphorus center is achieved by a direct interaction between the phosphoryl oxygen and a divalent metal in the active site.

     "abstract": "Substantial evidence suggests that transient production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling event triggered by the activation of various cell surface receptors. Major targets of H2O2 include protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Oxidation of the active site Cys by H2O2 abrogates PTP catalytic activity, thereby potentially furnishing a mechanism to ensure optimal tyrosine phosphorylation in response to a variety of physiological stimuli. Unfortunately, H2O2 is poorly reactive in chemical terms and the second order rate constants for the H2O2-mediated PTP inactivation are ~\u00a010\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, which is too slow to be compatible with the transient signaling events occurring at the physiological concentrations of H2O2. We find that hydroxyl radical is produced from H2O2 solutions in the absence of metal chelating agent by the Fenton reaction. We show that the hydroxyl radical is capable of inactivating the PTPs and the inactivation is active site directed, through oxidation of the catalytic Cys to sulfenic acid, which can be reduced by low molecular weight thiols. We also show that hydroxyl radical is a kinetically more efficient oxidant than H2O2 for inactivating the PTPs. The second-order rate constants for the hydroxyl radical-mediated PTP inactivation are at least 2\u20133 orders of magnitude higher than those mediated by H2O2 under the same conditions. Thus, hydroxyl radical generated in vivo may serve as a more physiologically relevant oxidizing agent for PTP inactivation.

Relatively little is understood about protein arginine and lysine kinases and the role of phosphorylation of these residues in cellular systems. Protein histidine phosphorylation and the two-component histidine kinases play important roles in cellular signaling systems in bacteria, plants and fungi. Their roles in vertebrates are much less well researched and there are no protein kinases similar to the two-component histidine kinases. The main focus of the review however, is to present current knowledge of the characterization, mechanisms of action and biological roles of the phosphatases that catalyze the hydrolysis of these phosphoamino acids. Very little is known about protein phosphoarginine and phospholysine phosphatases, although their existence is well documented. Some of these phosphatases exhibit very broad specificity in terms of which phosphoamino acids are substrates, however there appear to be one or two quite specific protein phospholysine and phosphoarginine phosphatases. Similarly, there are phosphatases with broad substrate specificities that catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphohistidine in protein substrates, including the serine/threonine phosphatases 1, 2A and 2C. However there are two, more specific, protein phosphohistidine phosphatases that have been well characterized and for which structures are available, SixA is a phosphatase associated with two-component histidine kinase signaling in bacteria, and the other is found in a number of organisms, including mammals.

Amyloid fibrils accommodate rigid core structures composed of regular intra- and intermolecular non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds, and disordered flexible regions exposed to solvents. In contrast to the improved understanding of fibril structures, few studies have investigated the short-living monomeric intermediates which interact with amyloid fibrils for elongation and the self-associated intermediates in the course of amyloidogenesis at the residue level. To study static fibrillar structures and kinetic intermediates, hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDex) coupled with solution-state NMR spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods with a high time and atomic resolution. Here, we review studies on the structural properties of amyloid fibrils based on a combination of dimethylsulfoxide-quenched HDex and NMR spectroscopy.

     "abstract": "Analyses of human phosphoproteome based on primary structure of the aminoacids surrounding the phosphor Ser/Thr suggest that a significant proportion of phosphosites is generated by a restricted number of acidophilic kinases, among which protein kinase CK2 plays a prominent role. Recently, new acidophilic kinases belonging to the Polo like kinase family have been characterized, with special reference to PLK1, PLK2, and PLK3 kinases. While some progress has been made in deciphering the PLK1-dependent phosphoproteome, very little is known about the targets of PLK2 and PLK3 kinases. In this report by using an in vitro approach, consisting of cell lysate phosphorylation, phosphoprotein separation by 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we describe the identification of new potential substrates of PLK2 and PLK3 kinases. We have identified and validated as in vitro PLK2 and PLK3 substrates HSP90, GRP-94, \u03b2-tubulin, calumenin, and 14-3-3 epsilon. The phosphosites generated by PLK3 in these proteins have been identified by mass spectrometry analysis to get new insights about PLKs specificity determinants. These latter have been further corroborated by an in silico analysis of the PLKs substrate binding region.",

In this paper we report our predictions of the likely heparin binding sites for BMP-2 and 14. The N-terminal sequences upstream of TGF-\u03b2-type cysteine-knot domains in BMP-2, 7 and 14 contain the basic residues arginine and lysine, which are key components of the heparin/HS-binding sites, with these residues being highly non-conserved. Importantly, evolutionary conserved surfaces on the beta sheets are required for interactions with receptors and antagonists. Furthermore, BMP-2 has electropositive surfaces on two sides compared to BMP-7 and BMP-14. Molecular docking simulations suggest the presence of high and low affinity binding sites in dimeric BMP-2. Histidines were found to play a role in the interactions of BMP-2 with heparin; however, a pKa analysis suggests that histidines are likely not protonated. This is indicative that interactions of BMP-2 with heparin do not require acidic pH. Taken together, non-conserved amino acid residues in the N-terminus and residues protruding from the beta sheet (not overlapping with the receptor binding sites and the dimeric interface) and not C-terminal are found to be important for heparin\u2013BMP interactions.",

     "abstract": "PED/PEA-15 is a small, non-catalytic, DED containing protein that is widely expressed in different tissues and highly conserved among mammals. PED/PEA-15 has been found to interact with several protein targets in various pathways, including FADD and procaspase-8 (apoptosis), ERK1/2 (cell cycle entry), and PLD1/2 (diabetes). In this research, we have studied the PED/PEA-15 in a complex with ERK2, a MAP kinase, using NMR spectroscopic techniques. MAP Kinase signaling pathways are involved in the regulation of many cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and survival. ERK1/2 are activated by a variety of external stimuli, including growth factors, hormones and neurotransmitters. Inactivated ERK2 is primarily found in the cytosol. Once the ERK/MAPK cascade is initiated, ERK2 is phosphorylated and stimulated, allowing it to redistribute in the cell nucleus and act as a transcription factor. Previous studies have shown that PED/PEA-15 complexes with ERK2 in the cytoplasm and prevents redistribution into the nucleus. Although the NMR structure and dynamics of PED/PEA-15 in the free form have been documented recently, no detailed structural and dynamic information for the ERK2-bound form is available. Here we report NMR chemical shift perturbation and backbone dynamic studies at the fast ps\u2013ns timescale of PED/PEA-15, in its free form and in the complex with ERK2. These analyses characterize motions and conformational changes involved in ERK2 recognition and binding that orchestrate the reorganization of the DED and immobilization of the C-terminal tail.

The proteins encoded by the last three genes ccmFGH are believed to form a lyase complex functioning in the reduction of apocytochrome c and haem attachment. Among them, CcmH is a membrane-associated protein; its N-terminus is a catalytic domain with the active CXXC motif and the C-terminus is predicted as a TPR-like domain with unknown function. By using SCAM (scanning cysteine accessibility mutagenesis) and Gaussia luciferase fusion assays, we provide experimental evidence for the entire topological structure of E. coli CcmH. The mature CcmH is a periplasm-resident oxidoreductase anchored to the inner membrane by two transmembrane segments. Both N- and C-terminal domains are located and function in the periplasmic compartment. Moreover, the N-terminal domain forms a monomer in solution, while the C-terminal domain is a compact fold with helical structures. The NMR solution structure of the catalytic domain in reduced form exhibits mainly a three-helix bundle, providing further information for the redox mechanism. The redox potential suggests that CcmH exhibits a strong reductase that may function in the last step of reduction of apocytochrome c for haem attachment.",

Computational methods to analyze the networks to detect functional modules as protein complexes are becoming more important. However, most of the existing methods only make use of the protein\u2013protein interaction networks without considering the structural limitations of proteins to bind together. In this paper, we design a new protein complex prediction method by extending the idea of using domain\u2013domain interaction information. Here we formulate the problem into a maximum matching problem (which can be solved in polynomial time) instead of the binary integer linear programming approach (which can be NP-hard in the worst case). We also add a step to predict domain\u2013domain interactions which first searches the database Pfam using the hidden Markov model and then predicts the domain\u2013domain interactions based on the database DOMINE and InterDom which contain confirmed DDIs. By adding the domain\u2013domain interaction prediction step, we have more edges in the DDI graph and the recall value is increased significantly (at least doubled) comparing with the method of Ozawa et al. (2010) [1] while the average precision value is slightly better. We also combine our method with three other existing methods, such as COACH, MCL and MCODE.

     "abstract": "Subcellular localization is a key functional characteristic of proteins. It is determined by signals encoded in the protein sequence. The experimental determination of subcellular localization is laborious. Thus, a number of computational methods have been developed to predict the protein location from sequence. However predictions made by different methods often disagree with each other and it is not always clear which algorithm performs best for the given cellular compartment. We benchmarked primary subcellular localization predictors for proteins from Gram-negative bacteria, PSORTb3, PSLpred, CELLO, and SOSUI-GramN, on a common dataset that included 1056 proteins. We found that PSORTb3 performs best on the average, but is outperformed by other methods in predictions of extracellular proteins. This motivated us to develop a meta-predictor, which combines the primary methods by using the logistic regression models, to take advantage of their combined strengths, and to eliminate their individual weaknesses. MetaLocGramN runs the primary methods, and based on their output classifies protein sequences into one of five major localizations of the Gram-negative bacterial cell: cytoplasm, plasma membrane, periplasm, outer membrane, and extracellular space. MetaLocGramN achieves the average Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.806, i.e. 12% better than the best individual primary method. MetaLocGramN is a meta-predictor specialized in predicting subcellular localization for proteins from Gram-negative bacteria. According to our benchmark, it performs better than all other tools run independently.

     "abstract": "Genetic network reverse engineering has been an area of intensive research within the systems biology community during the last decade. With many techniques currently available, the task of validating them and choosing the best one for a certain problem is a complex issue. Current practice has been to validate an approach on in-silico synthetic data sets, and, wherever possible, on real data sets with known ground-truth. In this study, we highlight a major issue that the validation of reverse engineering algorithms on small benchmark networks very often results in networks which are not statistically better than a randomly picked network. Another important issue highlighted is that with short time series, a small variation in the pre-processing procedure might yield large differences in the inferred networks. To demonstrate these issues, we have selected as our case study the IRMA in-vivo synthetic yeast network recently published in Cell. Using Fisher's exact test, we show that many results reported in the literature on reverse-engineering this network are not significantly better than random. The discussion is further extended to some other networks commonly used for validation purposes in the literature. The results presented in this study emphasize that studies carried out using small genetic networks are likely to be trivial, making it imperative that larger real networks be used for validating and benchmarking purposes. If smaller networks are considered, then the results should be interpreted carefully to avoid over confidence.

A computational formula was derived to express the glucose uptake rate by a single cell from two kinds of experimental data, extracellular glucose concentration and cell growth, being simulated by Cell Illustrator. In addition, average concentration of G6P has been measured by CE-MS. The existence of another carbon source was suggested from the computational result. After careful comparison between cell growth, G6P concentration, and the computationally obtained curve of glucose uptake rate, we predicted the consumption of glycogen in lag phase and its accumulation as an energy source in an E. coli cell for the next proliferation. We confirmed our prediction experimentally. This behavior indicates the importance of glycogen participation in the lag phase for the growth of E. coli.

S. boydii-mediated infection assays were performed at both physiological and molecular levels using Caenorhabditis elegans as a host. Continuous exposure of worms to S. boydii showed a reduced life span indicating the pathogenicity of Shigella. Quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis was performed to analyze the expression and regulation of host specific candidate-antimicrobial genes (clec-60, clec-87, lys-7), which were expressed significantly during early infection, but weakened during the latter hours. Increased mortality of mutant RB1285 by S. boydii and Shigella flexneri indicated the role of lys-7 during Shigella infection. Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) database was used to analyze the interaction of immune proteins in both C. elegans and humans. In addition, the expression and regulation were revealed about immune genes (clec-61, clec-62, clec-63, F54D5.3 and ZK1320.2), which encode several intermediate immune protein partners (CLEC-61, CLEC-62, CLEC-63, F54D5.3, ZK1320.2, W03D2.6 and THN-2) that interact with LYS-7 and CLEC-60 and were found to play a role in C. elegans immune defense against S. boydii infections. Similarly, the immune genes that are specific to the human defense system, which encode IGHV4-39, A2M, LTF, and CD79A, were predicted to be expressed with LYZ and MBL2, thus indicating their regulation during Shigella infections.

However, there are few studies to assess the biological significance of binding hot spots. We introduce the notion of biological significance of a contact residue for capturing the probability of the residue occurring in or contributing to protein binding interfaces. We take a statistical Z-score approach to the assessment of the biological significance. The method has three main steps. First, the potential score of a residue is defined by using a knowledge-based potential function with relative accessible surface area calculations. A null distribution of this potential score is then generated from artifact crystal packing contacts. Finally, the Z-score significance of a contact residue with a specific potential score is determined according to this null distribution. We hypothesize that residues at binding hot spots have big absolute values of Z-score as they contribute greatly to binding free energy. Thus, we propose to use Z-score to predict whether a contact residue is a hot spot residue. Comparison with previously reported methods on two benchmark datasets shows that this Z-score method is mostly superior to earlier methods.

Predicting these interactions is a crucial and challenging task. Moreover, discovering new protein\u2013protein interactions through biological experiments is still difficult. Therefore, it is increasingly important to discover new protein interactions. Many studies have predicted protein\u2013protein interactions, using biological features such as Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations and structural domains of two proteins. In this paper, we propose an augmented transitive relationships predictor (ATRP), a new method of predicting potential protein interactions using transitive relationships and annotations of protein interactions. In addition, a distillation of virtual direct protein\u2013protein interactions is proposed to deal with unbalanced distribution of different types of interactions in the existing protein\u2013protein interaction databases. Our results demonstrate that ATRP can effectively predict protein\u2013protein interactions. ATRP achieves an 81% precision, a 74% recall and a 77% F-measure in average rate in the prediction of direct protein\u2013protein interactions. Using the generated benchmark datasets from KUPS to evaluate of all types of the protein\u2013protein interaction, ATRP achieved a 93% precision, a 49% recall and a 64% F-measure in average rate.

     "abstract": "Correlated mutation analysis (CMA) has been used to investigate protein functional sites. However, CMA has suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio caused by meaningless phylogenetic signals or structural constraints. We present a new method, Structure-based Correlated Mutation Analysis (SCMA), which encodes coevolution scores into a protein structure network. A path-based network model is adapted to describe information transfer between residues, and the statistical significance is estimated by network shuffling. This model intrinsically assumes that residues in physical contact have a more reliable coevolution score than distant residues, and that coevolution in distant residues likely arises from a series of contacting and coevolving residues. In addition, coevolutionary coupling is statistically controlled to remove the structural effects. When applied to the rhodopsin structure, the SCMA method identified a much higher percentage of functional residues than the typical coevolution score (61% vs. 22%). In addition, statistically significant residues are used to construct the coevolved residue\u2013residue subnetwork. The network has one highly connected node (retinal bound Lys296), indicating that Lys296 can induce and regulate most other coevolved residues in a variety of locations. The coevolved network consists of a few modular clusters which have distinct functional roles.

Computer simulations have generally obtained good agreement with experimental data and provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of these unusual reactions.

By harnessing radical reactivity, the AdoMet radical enzyme superfamily is responsible for an incredible diversity of chemical transformations. Structural analysis reveals that family members adopt a full or partial Triose-phosphate Isomerase Mutase (TIM) barrel protein fold, containing core motifs responsible for binding a catalytic [4Fe\u20134S] cluster and AdoMet. Here we evaluate over twenty structures of AdoMet radical enzymes and classify them into two categories: \u2018traditional\u2019 and \u2018ThiC-like\u2019 (named for the structure of 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine phosphate synthase (ThiC)).

     "abstract": "The enzyme cofactor and essential vitamin biotin is biosynthesized in bacteria, fungi, and plants through a pathway that culminates with the addition of a sulfur atom to generate the five-membered thiophane ring. The immediate precursor, dethiobiotin, has methylene and methyl groups at the C6 and C9 positions, respectively, and formation of a thioether bridging these carbon atoms requires cleavage of unactivated CH bonds. Biotin synthase is an S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM or AdoMet) radical enzyme that catalyzes reduction of the AdoMet sulfonium to produce 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radicals, high-energy carbon radicals that can directly abstract hydrogen atoms from dethiobiotin. The available experimental and structural data suggest that a [2Fe\u20132S]2\u00a0+ cluster bound deep within biotin synthase provides a sulfur atom that is added to dethiobiotin in a stepwise reaction, first at the C9 position to generate 9-mercaptodethiobiotin, and then at the C6 position to close the thiophane ring. The formation of sulfur-containing biomolecules through a radical reaction involving an iron\u2013sulfur cluster is an unprecedented reaction in biochemistry; however, recent enzyme discoveries suggest that radical sulfur insertion reactions may be a distinct subgroup within the burgeoning Radical SAM superfamily.

     "abstract": "Spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) repairs a special thymine dimer 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, which is commonly called spore photoproduct or SP at the bacterial early germination phase. SP is the exclusive DNA photo-damage product in bacterial endospores; its generation and swift repair by SPL are responsible for the spores' extremely high UV resistance. The early in vivo studies suggested that SPL utilizes a direct reversal strategy to repair the SP in the absence of light. The research in the past decade further established SPL as a radical SAM enzyme, which utilizes a tri-cysteine CXXXCXXC motif to harbor a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster. At the 1\u00a0+ oxidation state, the cluster provides an electron to the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which binds to the cluster in a bidentate manner as the fourth and fifth ligands, to reductively cleave the CS bond associated with the sulfonium ion in SAM, generating a reactive 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl (5\u2032-dA) radical. This 5\u2032-dA radical abstracts the proR hydrogen atom from the C6 carbon of SP to initiate the repair process; the resulting SP radical subsequently fragments to generate a putative thymine methyl radical, which accepts a back-donated H atom to yield the repaired TpT. SAM is suggested to be regenerated at the end of each catalytic cycle; and only a catalytic amount of SAM is needed in the SPL reaction. The H atom source for the back donation step is suggested to be a cysteine residue (C141 in Bacillus subtilis SPL), and the H-atom transfer reaction leaves a thiyl radical behind on the protein. This thiyl radical thus must participate in the SAM regeneration process; however how the thiyl radical abstracts an H atom from the 5\u2032-dA to regenerate SAM is unknown. This paper reviews and discusses the history and the latest progress in the mechanistic elucidation of SPL. Despite some recent breakthroughs, more questions are raised in the mechanistic understanding of this intriguing DNA repair enzyme.

Here we report on 2- and 4-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases which apply a very different method of radical generation. In these enzymes ketyl radicals are formed by one-electron reduction or oxidation and are recycled after each turnover without further energy input. Earlier reviews on 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases were published in 2004 [J. Kim, M. Hetzel, C.D. Boiangiu, W. Buckel, FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 28 (2004) 455\u2013468. W. Buckel, M. Hetzel, J. Kim, Curr.

These enzymes require activation by one-electron transfer from an iron\u2013sulfur protein driven by hydrolysis of ATP. The review further describes the proposed mechanism that is highlighted by the identification of the allylic ketyl radical intermediate and the elucidation of the crystal structure of 2-hydroxyisocapryloyl-CoA dehydratase. With 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase the crystal structure, the complete stereochemistry and the function of several conserved residues around the active site could be identified. Finally potential biotechnological applications of the radical dehydratases are presented.The action of the activator as an \u2018Archerase\u2019 shooting electrons into difficultly reducible acceptors becomes an emerging principle in anaerobic metabolism.

     "abstract": "Thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) is essential in carbohydrate metabolism in all forms of life. TPP-dependent decarboxylation reactions of 2-oxo-acid substrates result in enamine adducts between the thiazolium moiety of the coenzyme and decarboxylated substrate. These central enamine intermediates experience different fates from protonation in pyruvate decarboxylase to oxidation by the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, the pyruvate oxidases, and 2-oxoacid oxidoreductases. Virtually all of the TPP-dependent enzymes, including pyruvate decarboxylase, can be assayed by 1-electron redox reactions linked to ferricyanide. Oxidation of the enamines is thought to occur via a 2-electron process in the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, wherein acyl group transfer is associated with reduction of the disulfide of the lipoamide moiety. However, discrete 1-electron steps occur in the oxidoreductases, where one or more [4Fe\u20134S] clusters mediate the electron transfer reactions to external electron acceptors. These radical intermediates can be detected in the absence of the acyl-group acceptor, coenzyme A (CoASH). The \u03c0-electron system of the thiazolium ring stabilizes the radical. The extensively delocalized character of the radical is evidenced by quantitative analysis of nuclear hyperfine splitting tensors as detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and by electronic structure calculations. The second electron transfer step is markedly accelerated by the presence of CoASH. While details of the second electron transfer step and its facilitation by CoASH remain elusive, expected redox properties of potential intermediates limit possible scenarios.

An example is tryptophan tryptophylquinone (TTQ) found in the enzyme methylamine dehydrogenase (MADH). TTQ biosynthesis requires the cross-linking of the indole rings of two Trp residues and the insertion of two oxygen atoms onto adjacent carbons of one of the indole rings. The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes the completion of TTQ within a precursor protein of MADH. The preMADH substrate contains a single hydroxyl group on one of the tryptophans and no crosslink. MauG catalyzes a six-electron oxidation that completes TTQ assembly and generates fully active MADH. These oxidation reactions proceed via a high valent bis-Fe(IV) state in which one heme is present as Fe(IV)=O and the other is Fe(IV) with both axial heme ligands provided by amino acid side chains. The crystal structure of MauG in complex with preMADH revealed that catalysis does not involve direct contact between the hemes of MauG and the protein substrate. Rather it is accomplished through long-range electron transfer, which presumably generates radical intermediates. Kinetic, spectrophotometric, and site-directed mutagenesis studies are beginning to elucidate how the MauG protein controls the reactivity of the hemes and mediates the long range electron/radical transfer required for catalysis.

Our results indicate that a propensity to form oligomers may be changed by local sequence variation in the A\u03b2 linker region without mutating the charged residues. Strikingly, one A\u03b2 linker variant rapidly formed protofibrillar oligomers, which did not convert to fibrillar aggregates in contrast to A\u03b2 aggregating to fibrils under similar incubation conditions. Moreover, our results suggest that molecular forces critical in oligomerization and fibrillization may differ at least for those involved in the linker region. When co-incubated with A\u03b2, some A\u03b2 linker variants were found to induce accumulation of A\u03b2 oligomers. Our results suggest that engineering of the A\u03b2 linker region as described in this paper may represent a novel approach to control A\u03b2 oligomerization and create A\u03b2 oligomerization modulators.",

Here, we studied alterations in enzymatic activity and aggregation provoked by oxidation of HEL by hypochlorous acid (HOCl), hypobromous acid (HOBr), taurine chloramine (Tau\u2013NHCl), taurine monobromamine (Tau\u2013NHBr), and taurine dibromamine (Tau\u2013NBr2). Addition of only 4-fold molar excess of Tau\u2013NHBr or Tau\u2013NBr2 to HEL caused complete depletion of its intrinsic fluorescence, whereas HOCl and HOBr caused 40%\u201350% bleaching. Tau\u2013NHCl was unable to oxidize lysozyme. The selective effect of bromamines on tryptophan residues had a direct effect on enzymatic activity; bromamines were about two-fold more effective as inhibitors of lysozyme than the acid precursors. The oxidation of HEL by HOCl and HOBr was more effective regarding the aggregation of the protein, which was evidenced by increased turbidity, Rayleigh scattering, and anisotropy. The aggregates presented spectroscopic properties that suggested the formation of amyloid fibrils, as measured by the thioflavin assay. In conclusion, the capacity of Tau\u2013NHBr and Tau\u2013NBr2 as inhibitors of the bactericidal activity of HEL could represent a role in the exacerbation of pulmonary infection, since leukocytes are rich sources of both taurine and HOBr. Moreover, the oxidation of HEL by just a small excess of hypohalous acids, a condition that could be found in inflammatory sites, may represent a new pathway for initiation of aggregation.",

The use of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and other biophysical techniques has permitted to reveal conformational difference between native and thermal denatured states of apo-calmodulin. The results show that secondary and tertiary structures of apo-calmodulin evolve in a synchronous way, indicating the absence in the unfolding pathway of molten-globule state sufficiently stable to affect transition curves. From SANS experiments, at 85\u00a0\u00b0C, apo-calmodulin adopts a polymer chain conformation with some residual local structures. After cooling down, apo-calmodulin recovers a compact state, with a secondary structure close to the native one but with a higher radius of gyration and a different tyrosine environment. In fact on a timescale of few minutes, heat denaturation of apo-calmodulin is partially reversible, but on a time scale of hours (for SANS experiments), the long exposure to heat may lead to a non-reversibility due to some chemical perturbation of the protein. In fact, from Mass Spectrometry measurements, we got evidence of dehydration and deamidation of heated apo-calmodulin.",

     "abstract": "Venturia inaequalis is a hemi-biotrophic fungus that causes scab disease of apple. A recently-identified gene from this fungus, cin1 (cellophane-induced 1), is up-regulated over 1000-fold in planta and considerably on cellophane membranes, and encodes a cysteine-rich secreted protein of 523 residues with eight imperfect tandem repeats of ~\u00a060 amino acids. The Cin1 sequence has no homology to known proteins and appears to be genus-specific; however, Cin1 repeats and other repeat domains may be structurally similar. An NMR-derived structure of the first two repeat domains of Cin1 (Cin1-D1D2) and a low-resolution model of the full-length protein (Cin1-FL) using SAXS data were determined. The structure of Cin1-D1D2 reveals that each domain comprises a core helix\u2013loop\u2013helix (HLH) motif as part of a three-helix bundle, and is stabilized by two intra-domain disulfide bonds. Cin1-D1D2 adopts a unique protein fold as DALI and PDBeFOLD analysis identified no structural homology. A 15N backbone NMR dynamic analysis of Cin1-D1D2 showed that a short stretch of the inter-domain linker has large amplitude motions that give rise to reciprocal domain\u2013domain mobility. This observation was supported by SAXS data modeling, where the scattering length density envelope remains thick at the domain\u2013domain boundary, indicative of inter-domain dynamics. Cin1-FL SAXS data models a loosely-packed arrangement of domains, rather than the canonical parallel packing of adjacent HLH repeats observed in \u03b1-solenoid repeat proteins. Together, these data suggest that the repeat domains of Cin1 display a \u201cbeads-on-a-string\u201d organization with inherent inter-domain flexibility that is likely to facilitate interactions with target ligands.",

We previously reported crystal structures of the cytoplasmic region of MgtE, consisting of 2 domains, that is, N and CBS, in the Mg2+-free and Mg2+-bound forms. The Mg2+-binding sites lay at the interface of the 2 domains, making the Mg2+-bound form compact and globular. In the Mg2+-free structure, however, the domains are far apart, and the Mg2+-binding sites are destroyed. Therefore, it is unclear how Mg2+-free MgtE changes its conformation to accommodate Mg2+ ions. Here, we used paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) to characterize the relative orientation of the N and CBS domains in the absence of Mg2+ in solution. When the residues on the surface of the CBS domain were labeled with nitroxide tags, significant PRE effects were observed for the residues in the N domain. No single structure satisfied the PRE profiles, suggesting that the N and CBS domains are not fixed in a particular orientation in solution. We then conducted ensemble simulated annealing calculations in order to obtain the atomic probability density and visualize the spatial distribution of the N domain in solution. The results indicate that the N domain tends to occupy the space near its position in the Mg2+-bound crystal structure, facilitating efficient capture of Mg2+ with increased intracellular Mg2+ concentration, which is necessary to close the gate.",

To get information on the role played by these covalent links in stability and folding, the conformational stability of SsMTAPII and C262S and C259S/C261S mutants was studied by thermal and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)-induced unfolding and analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and SDS-PAGE. No thermal unfolding transition of SsMTAPII can be obtained under nonreducing conditions, while in the presence of the reducing agent Tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP), a Tm of 100\u00a0\u00b0C can be measured demonstrating the involvement of disulfide bridges in enzyme thermostability. Different from the wild-type, C262S and C259S/C261S show complete thermal denaturation curves with sigmoidal transitions centered at 102\u00a0\u00b0C and 99\u00a0\u00b0C respectively. Under reducing conditions these values decrease by 4\u00a0\u00b0C and 8\u00a0\u00b0C respectively, highlighting the important role exerted by the CXC disulfide on enzyme thermostability. The contribution of disulfide bonds to the conformational stability of SsMTAPII was further assessed by GdmCl-induced unfolding experiments carried out under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Thermal unfolding was found to be reversible if the protein was heated in the presence of TCEP up to 90\u00a0\u00b0C but irreversible above this temperature because of aggregation. In analogy, only chemical unfolding carried out in the presence of reducing agents resulted in a reversible process suggesting that disulfide bonds play a role in enzyme denaturation. Thermal and chemical unfolding of SsMTAPII occur with dissociation of the native hexameric state into denatured monomers, as indicated by SDS-PAGE.",

Using a \u201chost\u2013guest\u201d approach, we measured the effects of short poly-amino-acid tags (guests) on the solubility of a host protein, a simplified bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI), to which they were fused at the C-terminus. We analyzed 10 amino acid types, representing the full range of biophysical properties (acidic, basic, polar, and hydrophobic). As anticipated, positively charged residues significantly increased the solubility of the model protein, at both pH 4.7 and 7.7, whereas very hydrophobic poly-Ile markedly reduced the solubility of BPTI. Poly-Asp and poly-Glu barely affected BPTI solubility at pH 4.7, but induced an eight to ten-fold increase at pH 7.7, attributable to the ionization of their side chains. Although Pro is the most soluble amino acid, poly-Pro did not affect the protein's solubility. The effects of the other tags on BPTI solubility ranged from none to an eight-fold increase. To ensure that the measured solubility values were context independent and could provide a \u201csolubility propensity scale\u201d, we confirmed that the tags remained independent of the structure, thermal stability, and biochemical activity of the host protein. These observations suggest that this approach is valuable for measuring the solubility propensities of amino acids, which could eventually allow the calculation of a polypeptide's relative solubility from its amino acid sequence.",

     "abstract": "Hairpin structure is a common feature of DNA molecules. They are located near functional loci, such as regulation and promotion sites, as well as in cruciform structures, and they provide potential binding sites for endogenous proteins. The effects of different hairpin loops that are composed of one to five thymidines, designated as L1\u2013L5, and have a common self-complementary stem, CTATATAG, on the interactions with Sac7d were studied. In thermostability studies, Sac7d stabilized a tetra-loop hairpin DNA and hairpin DNA with GTTC tetra-loop regions better than it stabilized tri- and penta-loops. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra showed that hairpins retained primarily a B-type conformation upon Sac7d binding. Intermolecular interactions between hairpins were likely decreased, due to the Sac7d-induced kinks, as shown by an increase at 220\u00a0nm in the CD spectra. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) observations suggested that the rates of Sac7d binding to hairpin DNA depend on the loop size of the hairpin duplexes. At a fixed stem length, Sac7d binds to tetra-loop hairpin DNA duplexes with a higher association rate and lower dissociation rate, compared with their tri- and penta-loop counterparts. In addition, the tri-loop and GTC tri-loop hairpin DNA had lower affinity for Sac7d because of the smaller and tighter loop size. Our study indicates that Sac7d binding affinity to hairpin DNA is primarily determined by loop size and stem integrity, and the results presented here provide a model for studies concerning other minor groove DNA-binding proteins that kink hairpin DNA.",

We measured the kinetic and structural determinants for this specificity using a diverse series of small molecule enzyme substrates, including novel fluorogenic esters. These experiments identified two hydrophobic plasticity residues (Pro228, and Ile276) surrounding the nucleophilic serine that impart this specificity of TM0077 for small, straight-chain esters. Substitution of these residues with alanine imparts broader specificity to TM0077 for the hydrolysis of longer and bulkier esters.

     "abstract": "Cav2.3 containing voltage-activated Ca2\u00a0+ channels are expressed in excitable cells and trigger neurotransmitter and peptide-hormone release. Their expression remote from the fast release sites leads to the accumulation of presynaptic Ca2\u00a0+ which can both, facilitate and inhibit the influx of Ca2\u00a0+ ions through Cav2.3. The facilitated Ca2\u00a0+ influx was recently related to hippocampal postsynaptic facilitation and long term potentiation. To analyze Ca2\u00a0+ mediated modulation of cellular processes more in detail, protein partners of the carboxy terminal tail of Cav2.3 were identified by yeast-2-hybrid screening, leading in two human cell lines to the detection of a novel, extended and rarely occurring splice variant of calmodulin-2 (CaM-2), called CaM-2-extended (CaM-2-ext). CaM-2-ext interacts biochemically with the C-terminus of Cav2.3 similar to the classical CaM-2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Functionally, only CaM-2-ext reduces whole cell inward currents significantly. The insertion of the novel 46 nts long exon and the consecutive expression of CaM-2-ext must be dependent on a new upstream translation initiation site which is only rarely used in the tested human cell lines. The structure of the N-terminal extension is predicted to be more hydrophobic than the remaining CaM-2-ext protein, suggesting that it may help to dock it to the lipophilic membrane surrounding.",

The use of pancreatic subcellular fractions in proteomic analysis, simplifies protein maps and helps in the identification of new protein changes and biomarkers characterizing tissue damage. The present study aims to determine the differentially expressed acidic proteins in the pancreatic soluble and lysosomal\u00a0+\u00a0mitochondrial (L\u00a0+\u00a0M) fractions from rats during the early phase of the experimental model of cerulein (Cer)-induced AP. Subcellular pancreatic extracts from diseased and control rats were analyzed by 2-DE (3\u20135.6 pH range) and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Comparative analysis afforded the conclusive identification of 13 (soluble fraction) and 7 (L\u00a0+\u00a0M fraction) proteins or protein fragments ocurring in different amounts between diseased and control pancreas, some of them being newly described in AP. In the soluble fraction, we detected changes related to inflammation and apoptosis (\u03b11-inhibitor-3, \u03b1-1 antitrypsin, \u03b1-1 macroglobulin, haptoglobin, STRAP), oxidative stress and stress response (peroxiredoxin-2, thioredoxin-like 1, GRP94/TRA1, heat shock cognate 71\u00a0kDa protein), digestive proteases (elastase 3B), serine protease inhibition (serpins B6 and A3L) and translation processes (EF 1-\u03b4). In the L\u00a0+\u00a0M fraction, we detected changes mainly related to energy generation or cellular metabolism (ATP synthase \u03b2 subunit, chymotrypsinogen B, triacylglycerol lipase), cell redox homeostasis (iodothyronine 5\u00b4monodeiodinase) and digestive proteases (carboxypeptidase B1).

A group of common hypotheses for the mechanisms of gene regulation involves changes in the structure and structural dynamics of chromatin induced by chromatin modifications. We employed single molecule fluorescence methods to test these hypotheses by monitoring the structure and structural dynamics of nucleosomes before and after histone acetylation and DNA methylation, two of the best-conserved chromatin modifications throughout eukaryotes. Our studies revealed that these modifications induce changes in the structure and structural dynamics of nucleosomes that may contribute directly to the formation of open or repressive chromatin conformation.",

     "abstract": "The major malaria vector in Sub-Saharan Africa is the Anopheles gambiae mosquito. This species is a key target of malaria control measures. Mosquitoes find humans primarily through olfaction, yet the molecular mechanisms associated with host-seeking behavior remain largely unknown. To further understand the functionality of A. gambiae odorant binding protein 1 (AgamOBP1), we combined in silico protein structure modeling and site-directed mutagenesis to generate 16 AgamOBP1 protein analogues containing single point mutations of interest. Circular dichroism (CD) and ligand-binding assays provided data necessary to probe the effects of the point mutations on ligand binding and the overall structure of AgamOBP1. Far-UV CD spectra of mutated AgamOBP1 variants displayed both substantial decreases to ordered \u03b1-helix structure (up to22%) and increases to disordered \u03b1-helix structure(up to 15%) with only minimal changes in random coil (unordered) structure. In mutations Y54A, Y122A and W114Q, aromatic side chain removal from the binding site significantly reduced N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine binding. Several non-aromatic mutations (L15T, L19T, L58T, L58Y, M84Q, M84K, H111A, Y122A and L124T) elicited changes to protein conformation with subsequent effects on ligand binding. This study provides empirical evidence for the in silico predicted functions of specific amino acids in AgamOBP1 folding and ligand binding characteristics.",

Double\u2010layer systems are stable irrespective of whether the peptides within the sheet are oriented parallel or anti-parallel. The lifetime of single sheet systems is determined by the protonation status, nature of association of peptides and the size of the aggregates. For example, single sheet 8-mers are stable with parallel arrangement and neutral termini, or with anti-parallel arrangement and charged termini. This suggests that the residues flanking the amyloidogenic sequence also play an important role in determining the organization of peptides in an aggregate. Twist of the cross-beta sheets is found to be intrinsic to the aggregates. Main chain H-bonds are key determinants of stability and loss of these H-bonds is followed by disorder and/or dissociation of the peptide despite the presence of side chain hydrogen bonds. Aggregates are inherently asymmetric along the fiber axis and dissociation from the C-edge is observed more often. An aggregate can disintegrate into smaller-sized oligomers or the edge peptides can dissociate sequentially. A variety of dissociation and disintegration events are observed pointing to the existence of multiple pathways for association during nucleation. It appears that a heterogeneous mixture of oligomers of different sizes exist prior to the formation of the critical nucleus.",

     "abstract": "The two protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains in bi-domain PTPs share high sequence and structural similarity. However, only one of the two PTP domains is catalytically active. Here we describe biochemical studies on the two tandem PTP domains of the bi-domain PTP, PTP99A. Phosphatase activity, monitored using small molecule as well as peptide substrates, revealed that the inactive (D2) domain activates the catalytic (D1) domain. Thermodynamic measurements suggest that the inactive D2 domain stabilizes the bi-domain (D1\u2013D2) protein. The mechanism by which the D2 domain activates and stabilizes the bi-domain protein is governed by few interactions at the inter-domain interface. In particular, mutating Lys990 at the interface attenuates inter-domain communication. This residue is located at a structurally equivalent location to the so-called allosteric site of the canonical single domain PTP, PTP1B. These observations suggest functional optimization in bi-domain PTPs whereby the inactive PTP domain modulates the catalytic activity of the bi-domain enzyme.",

Although their functions are relatively well-characterized, their conformational stabilities are poorly known. In this work, we have used, as a model for our biophysical and binding studies, the E2-C from Carassius auratus (goldfish), a homologue of the human ubiquitin conjugase UbcH10. E2-Cca was a monomeric protein with an elongated shape; moreover, the protein was only marginally stable within a narrow pH range (from 6.0 to 8.0). We also explored the binding of E2-Cca towards non-canonical E3 ligases. Binding of E2-Cca to the C terminus of murine Ring 1B (C-Ring1B), which does not contain the RING finger of the whole Ring1B, occurred with an affinity of ~\u00a0400\u00a0nM, as shown by fluorescence and ITC. Furthermore, binding of E2-Cca to C-Ring1B did not occur at its canonical E2-loops, since residues M43 and F53, far away from those loops, were involved in binding. Thus, the C-Ring1B-interacting region of E2-Cca comprises the first \u03b2-strand and nearby residues.",

Using UV\u2013visible spectrophotometry, we show that the removal of K+ binding site causes substantial changes in spin states of both the ferric and ferrous forms.

Similarly electron donor oxidation rate was two orders less for the K+ site double mutants compared to the wild type.

     "abstract": "We recently provided the first report that RNase HIII can cleave a DNA-rN1-DNA/DNA substrate (rN1, one ribonucleotide) in vitro. In the present study, mutagenesis analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on RNase HIII from Chlamydophila pneumoniae AR39 (CpRNase HIII). Our results elucidate the mechanism of ribonucleotide recognition employed by CpRNase HIII, indicating that the G95/K96/G97 motif of CpRNase HIII represents the main surface interacting with single ribonucleotides, in a manner similar to that of the GR(K)G motif of RNase HIIs. However, CpRNase HIII lacks the specific tyrosine required for RNase HII to recognize single ribonucleotides in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). Interestingly, MD shows that Ser94 of CpRNase HIII forms a stable hydrogen bond with the deoxyribonucleotide at the (5')RNA\u2013DNA(3') junction, moving this nucleotide away from the chimeric ribonucleotide. This movement appears to deform the nucleic acid backbone at the RNA\u2013DNA junction and allows the ribonucleotide to interact with the GKG motif. Based on the inferences drawn from MD simulations, biochemical results indicated that Ser94 was necessary for catalytic activity on the DNA-rN1-DNA/DNA substrate; mutant S94V could bind this substrate but exhibited no cleavage. Mismatches opposite the single ribonucleotide misincorporated in dsDNA inhibited cleavage by CpRNase HIII to varying degrees but did not interfere with CpRNase/substrate binding. Further MD results implied that mismatches impair the interaction between Ser94 and the deoxyribonucleotide at the RNA\u2013DNA junction. Consequently, recognition of the misincorporated ribonucleotide was disturbed. Our results may help elucidate the distinct substrate-recognition properties of different RNase Hs.",

Binding of O2 to the heme in the sensor domain of HemAT-Bs induces a conformational change in the protein matrix, and this is transmitted to a signaling domain. To characterize the specific mechanism of O2-dependent conformational changes in HemAT-Bs, we investigated time-resolved resonance Raman spectra of the truncated sensor domain and the full-length HemAT-Bs upon O2 and CO dissociation. A comparison between the O2 and CO complexes provides insights on O2/CO discrimination in HemAT-Bs. While no spectral changes upon CO dissociation were observed in our experimental time window between 10\u00a0ns and 100\u00a0\u03bcs, the band position of the stretching mode between the heme iron and the proximal histidine, \u03bd(Fe\u2013His), for the O2-dissociated HemAT-Bs was lower than that for the deoxy form on time-resolved resonance Raman spectra. This spectral change specific to O2 dissociation would be associated with the O2/CO discrimination in HemAT-Bs. We also compared the results obtained for the truncated sensor domain and the full-length HemAT-Bs, which showed that the structural dynamics related to O2 dissociation for the full-length HemAT-Bs are faster than those for the sensor domain HemAT-Bs.

However, role of remote scaffolding residues, which are not involved in religation, was not properly explored. Crystal structures of two engineered winged bean chymotrypsin inhibitor (WCI) complexed with Bovine trypsin (BPT) namely L65R-WCI:BPT and F64Y/L65R-WCI:BPT show that the inhibitory loop of these engineered inhibitors are recognized and rigidified properly at the enzyme active site like other strong trypsin inhibitors. Chimeric protein ETIL-WCIS, having a loop of Erythrina caffra Trypsin Inhibitor, ETI on the scaffold of WCI, was previously shown to behave like substrate. Non-canonical structure of the inhibitory loop and its flexibility are attributed to the presence of smaller scaffolding residues which cannot act as barrier to the inhibitory loop like in ETI. Double mutant A76R/L115Y-(ETIL-WCIS), where the barrier is reintroduced on ETIL-WCIS, shows regaining of inhibitory activity. The structure of A76R/L115Y-(ETIL-WCIS) along with L65R-WCI:BPT and F64Y/L65R-WCI:BPT demonstrate here that the lost canonical conformation of the inhibitory loop is fully restored and loop flexibility is dramatically reduced. Therefore, residues at the inhibitory loop interact with the enzyme playing the primary role in recognition and binding but scaffolding residues having no direct interaction with the enzyme are crucial for rigidification event and the inhibitory potency.

Previously, we clarified the structural and thermodynamic properties of the 11-mer repeating units in G3LEA proteins using synthetic peptides composed of two or four tandem repeats originating from an insect (Polypedilum vanderplanki), nematodes and plants. The purpose of the present study is to test the utility of such 22-mer peptides as protective reagents for aggregation-prone proteins. For lysozyme, desiccation-induced aggregation was abrogated by low molar ratios of a 22-mer peptide, PvLEA-22, derived from a P. vanderplanki G3LEA protein sequence. However, an unexpected behavior was noted for the milk protein, \u03b1-casein. On drying, the resultant aggregation was significantly suppressed in the presence of PvLEA-22 with its molar ratios\u00a0>\u00a025 relative to \u03b1-casein. However, when the molar ratio was <\u00a010, aggregation occurred on addition of PvLEA-22 to aqueous solutions of \u03b1-casein. Other peptides derived from nematode, plant and randomized G3LEA protein sequences gave similar results. Such an anomalous solubility change in \u03b1-casein was shown to be due to a pH shift to ca. 4, a value nearly equal to the isoelectric point (pI) of \u03b1-casein, when any of the 22-mer peptides was mixed. These results demonstrate that synthetic peptides derived from G3LEA protein sequences can reduce protein aggregation caused both by desiccation and, at high molar ratios, also by pH effects, and therefore have potential as stabilization reagents.",

     "abstract": "Several bacterial organisms rely on the two-component alkanesulfonate monooxygenase system for the acquisition of organosulfonate compounds when inorganic sulfur is limiting in the environment. This system is comprised of an FMN reductase (SsuE) that supplies reduced flavin to the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase (SsuD). Desulfonation of alkanesulfonates by SsuD is catalyzed through the activation of dioxygen by reduced flavin. The three-dimensional structure of SsuD exists as a TIM-barrel fold with several discrete insertion regions. An extensive insertion region near the putative active site was disordered in the SsuD structure, suggesting the importance of protein dynamics in the desulfonation mechanism. Three variants containing a partial deletion of the loop region were constructed to evaluate the functional properties of this region. There were no overall gross changes in secondary structure for the three SsuD deletion variants compared to wild-type SsuD, but each variant was found to be catalytically inactive. The deletion variants were unable to undergo the conformational changes necessary for catalysis even though they were able to bind reduced flavin. Rapid kinetic analyses monitoring the reductive and oxidative half-reactions indicated that the SsuD deletion variants failed to protect reduced flavin from unproductive oxidation. These studies define the importance of dynamic loop region for protection and stabilization of reduced flavin and reaction intermediates.",

Enzyme activity of AMP48 was strongly inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and soybean trypsin inhibitor, indicating that the enzyme was a plant serine protease. The N-terminal amino acid sequences (A-Q-E-G-G-K-D-D-D-G-G) of AMP48 had no sequence similarity matches with any sequence databases of BLAST search and other plant serine protease. The secondary structure of this enzyme was composed of high \u03b1-helix (51%) and low \u03b2-sheet (9%). AMP48 had fibrinogenolytic activity with maximal activity between 55 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C at pH 8. The enzyme efficiently hydrolyzed \u03b1 followed by partially hydrolyzed \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits of human fibrinogen. In addition, the fibrinolytic activity was observed through the degradation products by SDS-PAGE and emphasized its activity by monitoring the alteration of secondary structure of fibrin clot after enzyme digestion using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

Results demonstrate that the protein changes dramatically in low pH solution and that the pH-sensing triad (Arg23-Tyr54-Ile125) plays an indispensable role in the structural stability and ligand binding.

Eight CI-producing bacteria have been found; however, CITase from Bacillus circulans T-3040 (CITase-T3040) is the only CI-producing enzyme that has been characterized to date. In this study, we report the gene cloning, enzyme characterization, and analysis of essential Asp and Glu residues of a novel CITase from Paenibacillus sp. 598K (CITase-598K). The cit genes from T-3040 and 598K strains were expressed recombinantly, and the properties of Escherichia coli recombinant enzymes were compared. The two CITases exhibited high primary amino acid sequence identity (67%). The major product of CITase-598K was cycloisomaltoheptaose (CI-7), whereas that of CITase-T3040 was cycloisomaltooctaose (CI-8). Some of the properties of CITase-598K are more favorable for practical use compared with CITase-T3040, i.e., the thermal stability for CITase-598K (\u2264\u00a050\u00a0\u00b0C) was 10\u00a0\u00b0C higher than that for CITase-T3040 (\u2264\u00a040\u00a0\u00b0C); the kcat/KM value of CITase-598K was approximately two times higher (32.2\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01) than that of CITase-T3040 (17.8\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01). Isomaltotetraose was the smallest substrate for both CITases. When isomaltoheptaose or smaller substrates were used, a lag time was observed before the intramolecular transglucosylation reaction began. As substrate length increased, the lag time shortened. Catalytically important residues of CITase-598K were predicted to be Asp144, Asp269, and Glu341. These findings will serve as a basis for understanding the reaction mechanism and substrate recognition of GH66 enzymes.",

Although \u03b2-catenin has been shown to participate in many protein\u2013protein interactions, it is not clear which combinations of \u03b2-catenin-interacting proteins form discrete complexes. We have generated a novel antibody, termed 4B3, which recognizes only a small subset of total cellular \u03b2-catenin. Affinity proteomics using 4B3, in combination with subcellular fractionation, has allowed us to define a discrete trimeric complex of \u03b2-catenin, \u03b1-catenin and the tumor suppressor APC, which forms in the cytoplasm in response to Wnt signaling. Depletion of the limiting component of this complex, APC, implicates the complex in mediating Wnt-induced changes in cell\u2013cell adhesion. APC is also essential for N-terminal phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin within this complex. Each component of \u03b2-catenin/APC/\u03b1-catenin complex co-exists in other protein complexes, thus use of a selective antibody for affinity proteomics has allowed us to go beyond the generation of a list of potential \u03b2-catenin-interacting proteins, and define when and where a specific complex forms.",

We report the crystal structures of mouse IL-34 alone and in complex with the N-terminal three immunoglobulin-like domains (D1-D3) of mouse CSF-1R. IL-34 is structurally related to other helical hematopoietic cytokines, but contains two additional helices integrally associated with the four shared helices. The non-covalently linked IL-34 homodimer recruits two copies of CSF-1R on the sides of the helical bundles, with an overall shape similar to the CSF-1:CSF-1R complex, but the flexible linker between CSF-1R D2 and D3 allows these domains to clamp IL-34 and CSF-1 at different angles. Functional dissection of the IL-34:CSF-1R interface indicates that the hydrophobic interactions, rather than the salt bridge network, dominate the biological activity of IL-34. To degenerately recognize two ligands with completely different surfaces, CSF-1R apparently takes advantage of different subsets of a chemically inert surface that can be tuned to fit different ligand shapes. Differentiated signaling between IL-34 and CSF-1 is likely achieved by the relative thermodynamic independence of IL-34 vs. negative cooperativity of CSF-1 at the receptor-recognition sites, in combination with the difference in hydrophobicity which dictates a more stable IL-34:CSF-1R complex compared to the CSF-1:CSF-1R complex.",

Differences in the zero point vibrational energy in the ordered and disordered bonded states allow direct prediction of the two transition temperatures. While the onset of water mobility induces the same change in heat capacity for both transitions, the order\u2013disorder transition of denaturation also predicts the observed excess enthalpy gain. The kinetics of the water and protein components through the glass transition are predicted and compared with dielectric spectroscopy observations. The energetic approach provides a consistent mechanism for processes such as refolding and aggregation of proteins involved in protein maintenance and adaptability, as the conformational constraints of strong water\u2013amide bonds are lost with increased molecular mobility. Moreover, we suggest that the ordered state of peptide\u2013water bonds is induced at the point of protein synthesis and could play a key role in the function of proteins through the enhancement of electronic activity by ferroelectric domains in the protein hydration shell, which is lost upon denaturation.",

Conformational changes for immobilized enzymes were associated with high and low frequency shifts of the amide I and II bands. CD spectra of native HLADH and KRED 117 characterized with a negative peak at 222\u00a0nm indicating a \u03b1-helical structure. The disappearance of the negative peak in the CD spectra of immobilized enzymes and appearance of a positive peak at 222\u00a0nm supported these observations. These findings demonstrated unfolding of folded enzymes and exposure of the amino acid residues during denaturation with a red shift in tryptophan fluorescence. The decrease in specific activities (by 60\u201370% in all cases) for both immobilized enzymes was correlated to those of conformational changes. Silica-attached enzyme-NADH systems were evaluated for enantioselective reduction of 1-(p-methoxyphenyl)-propan-2-one. Conformational changes enhanced the enantioselectivity of immobilized HLADH with a switch in its stereoselectivity.

A map was implemented in which 62 spots, corresponding to 44 proteins, were identified. Twenty-two spots were modulated upon treatments, and the corresponding proteins proved to be related to photosynthesis, energy metabolism, and stress response. Proteins demonstrated differences between control and acclimation conditions. Most of the acclimation-responsive proteins were either not further modulated or they were down-modulated by freezing treatment, indicating that the levels reached during acclimation were sufficient to deal with freezing. Anabolic metabolism appeared to be down-regulated in favor of catabolic metabolism. Acclimated plants and plants submitted to freezing after acclimation showed greater reciprocal similarity in protein profiles than either showed when compared both to control plants and to plants frozen without acclimation. The response of non-acclimated plants was aimed at re-modulating photosynthetic apparatus activity, and at increasing the levels of proteins with antioxidant-, molecular chaperone-, or post-transcriptional regulative functions. These changes, even less effective than the acclimation strategy, might allow the injured plastids to minimize the production of non-useful metabolites and might counteract photosynthetic apparatus injuries.",

This is the first step in the biosynthesis of hydroxamate-containing siderophores in A. fumigatus. Af SidA is essential for virulence, validating this enzyme as a drug target. Af SidA can accept reducing equivalents from either NADPH or NADH and displays similar kinetic parameters when using either coenzyme. When the enzyme is reduced with NADPH and reacted with molecular oxygen, a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate is observed. When the enzyme is reduced with NADH, the intermediate is 2-fold less stable. Steady-state kinetic isotope effect values of 3 and 2 were determined for NADPH and NADH, respectively. The difference in the isotope effect values is due to differences in the rate of flavin reduction by these coenzymes. A difference in the binding mode between these coenzymes was observed by monitoring flavin fluorescence. Limited proteolysis studies show that NADP+, and not NAD+, protects Af SidA from proteolysis, suggesting that it induces conformational changes upon binding. Together, these results are consistent with NADPH having a role in flavin reduction and in the modulation of conformational changes, which positions NADP+ to also play a role in stabilization of the C4a-hydroperoxyflavin.",

We purified SMP-30 from mouse (Mo) liver and compared its hydrolytic activity towards various esters, lactones, and G-type nerve agents with that of human paraoxonase1 (Hu PON1) and squid diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase). All three enzymes contain one or two metal ions in their active sites and fold into six-bladed \u03b2-propeller structures. While Hu PON1 hydrolyzed a variety of lactones, the only lactone that was a substrate for Mo SMP-30 was d-(+)-gluconic acid \u03b4-lactone. Squid DFPase was much more efficient at hydrolyzing DFP and G-type nerve agents as compared to Mo SMP-30 or Hu PON1. The Km values for DFP were in the following order: Mo SMP-30\u00a0>\u00a0Hu PON1\u00a0>\u00a0squid DFPase, suggesting that the efficiency of DFP hydrolysis may be related to its binding in the active sites of these enzymes. Thus, homology modeling and docking were used to simulate the binding of DFP and selected \u03b4-lactones in the active sites of Hu SMP-30, Hu PON1, and squid DFPase. Results from molecular modeling studies suggest that differences in metal\u2013ligand coordinations, the hydrophobicity of the binding pockets, and limited space in the binding pocket due to the presence of a loop, are responsible for substrate specificities of these enzymes.",

Arabinogalactan-like (AGL) proteins expressed at the symbiotic interface between plant roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi have novel sequences, hypothesized to form polyproline II (PPII) helix structures. The functional nature of these proteins is unknown but they may form structures for the establishment and maintenance of fungal hyphae. Here we show that recombinant AGL1 (rAGL1) and recombinant AGL3 (rAGL3) are extended proteins based upon secondary structural characteristics determined by electronic circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and can self-assemble into fibers and microtubes as observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). CD spectroscopy results of synthetic peptides based on repeat regions in AGL1, AGL2 and AGL3 suggest that the synthetic peptides contain significant amounts of extended PPII helices and that these structures are influenced by ionic strength and, at least in one case, by concentration. Point mutations of a single residue of the repeat region of AGL3 resulted in altered secondary structures. Self-assembly of these repeats was observed by means of AFM and optical microscopy. Peptide (APADGK)6 forms structures with similar morphology to rAGL1 suggesting that these repeats are crucial for the morphology of rAGL1 fibers. These novel self-assembling sequences may find applications as precursors for bioinspired nanomaterials.",

We analyze the three dispersion regions, commonly found in protein solutions, usually termed \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-relaxations. The \u03b2-relaxation, occurring in the frequency range around 10\u00a0MHz and the \u03b3-relaxation around 20\u00a0GHz (at room temperature) can be attributed to the rotation of the polar protein molecules in their aqueous medium and the reorientational motion of the free water molecules, respectively. The nature of the \u03b4-relaxation, which is often ascribed to the motion of bound water molecules, is not yet fully understood. Here we provide data on the temperature dependence of the relaxation times and relaxation strengths of all three detected processes and on the dc conductivity arising from ionic charge transport. The temperature dependences of the \u03b2- and \u03b3-relaxations are closely correlated. We found a significant temperature dependence of the dipole moment of the protein, indicating conformational changes. Moreover we find a breakdown of the Debye\u2013Stokes\u2013Einstein relation in this protein solution, i.e., the dc conductivity is not completely governed by the mobility of the solvent molecules. Instead it seems that the dc conductivity is closely connected to the hydration shell dynamics.",

In the present study the thermal unfolding of the Hc from the marine mollusc Rapana thomasiana (RtH) has been investigated by combining differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and UV\u2013vis absorption spectroscopy. Two important stages in the unfolding pathway of the Hc molecule were discerned. A first event, with nonmeasurable heat absorption, occurring around 60\u00a0\u00b0C, lowers the binding of dioxygen to the type-3 copper groups. This pretransition is reversible and is ascribed to a slight change in the tertiary structure. In a second stage, with midpoint around 80\u00a0\u00b0C, the protein irreversibly unfolds with a loss of secondary structure and formation of amorphous aggregates. Experiments with the monomeric structural subunits, RtH1 and RtH2, indicated that the heterogeneity in the process of thermal denaturation can be attributed to the presence of multiple 50\u00a0kDa functional units with different stability. In accordance, the irreversible unfolding of a purified functional unit (RtH2-e) occurred at a single transition temperature. At slightly alkaline pH (Tris buffer) the C-terminal \u03b2-sheet rich domain of the functional unit starts to unfold before the \u03b1-helix-rich N-terminal (copper containing) domain, triggering the collapse of the global protein structure. Even around 90\u00a0\u00b0C some secondary structure is preserved as shown by the FTIR spectra of all investigated samples, confirming the high thermostability of molluscan Hc.",

We have previously reported the ligand-recognition mode of LOX-1 based on the crystal structure of the ligand binding domain (C-type lectin-like domain, CTLD) and surface plasmon resonance analysis, which suggested that the functional significance of the CTLD dimer (the \u2018canonical\u2019 dimer) is to harbor the characteristic \u201cbasic spine\u201d on its surface. In this study, we have identified the key inter-domain interactions in retaining the canonical CTLD dimer by X-ray structural analysis of the inactive mutant W150A CTLD. The canonical CTLD dimer forms through tight hydrophobic interactions, in which W150 engages in a lock-and-key manner and represents the main interaction. The loss of the Trp ring by mutation to Ala prevents the formation of the canonical dimer, as elucidated from docking calculations using the crystal structure of W150A CTLD. The results emphasize that the canonically formed CTLD dimer is essential for LOX-1 to bind to OxLDL, which supports our proposed view that the basic spine surface present in the correctly formed dimer plays a primal role in OxLDL recognition. This concept provides insight into the pathogenic pattern recognized by LOX-1 as a member of the pattern recognition receptors.",

In this paper, the hydrolysis mechanism of p-nitro-phenyl \u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (pNP-Glc) catalyzed by BtGH97a was firstly studied by using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach. Two possible reaction pathways were considered. In the first pathway, a water molecule deprotonated by a nucleophilic base (here E439 or E508) attacks firstly on the anomeric carbon of pNP-Glc, then a proton from an acid residue (E532) attacks on the glycosidic oxygen to finish the hydrolysis reaction (named as nucleophilic attack-first pathway). In the second pathway, the proton from E532 attacks firstly on the glycosidic oxygen, then the water deprotonated by the nucleophilic base attacks on the anomeric carbon of pNP-Glc (named as proton attack-first pathway). Our calculation results indicate that the nucleophilic attack-first pathway is favorable in energy, in which the nucleophilic attack process is the rate-determining step with an energy barrier of 15.4\u00a0kcal/mol in the case of residue E508 as nucleophilic base. In this rate-determining step, the deprotonation of water and the attack on the anomeric carbon are concerted. In the proton attack-first pathway, the proton attack on the glycosidic oxygen is the rate-determining step, and the energy barrier is 24.1\u00a0kcal/mol. We conclude that the hydrolysis mechanism would follow nucleophilic attack-first pathway.",

Glycerol barely affected the TF spectra of all GKs but decreased kcat, glucose S0.5 and KD values and ATP KM while leaving cooperativity unchanged. Glycerol sensitized all GKs to GKA as shown by TF. Glucose increased TF of GKs without influence of glycerol on the effect. Glycerol and GKA affected kinetics and binding additively. The activation energies for thermal denaturation of GK were a function of glucose with KDs of 3 and 1\u00a0mM without and with glycerol, respectively. High urea denatured wild type GK reversibly at 20 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C and urea treatment of irreversibly heat denatured GK allowed refolding as demonstrated by TF including glucose response. We concluded: Glycerol stabilizes GK indirectly without changing the folding structure of the apoenzyme, by restructuring the surface water of the protein, whereas glucose stabilizes GK directly by binding to its substrate site and inducing a compact conformation. Glucose or glycerol (alone or combined) is unable to prevent irreversible heat denaturation above 40\u00a0\u00b0C. However, urea denatures GK reversibly even at 60\u00a0\u00b0C by binding to the protein backbone and directly interacting with hydrophobic side chains. It prevents irreversible aggregation allowing complete refolding when urea is removed. This study establishes the foundation for exploring numerous instability mutants among the more than 600 variant GKs causing diabetes in animals and humans.",

It is considered a potential drug target due to its involvement in specific physiological processes. However, information is scarce concerning the kinetic characteristics of TPP II and its active site features, which are important for design of efficient inhibitors. To amend this, we probed the active site by determining the pH dependence of TPP II catalysis. Access to pure enzyme is a prerequisite for kinetic investigations and herein we introduce the first efficient purification system for heterologously expressed mammalian TPP II. The pH dependence of kinetic parameters for hydrolysis of two different chromogenic substrates, Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA and Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA, was determined for murine, human and Drosophila melanogaster TPP II as well as mutant variants thereof. The investigation demonstrated that TPP II, in contrast to subtilisin, has a bell-shaped pH dependence of kcatapp/KM probably due to deprotonation of the N-terminal amino group of the substrate at higher pH. Since both the KM and kcatapp are lower for cleavage of AAA-pNA than for AAF-pNA we propose that the former can bind non-productively to the active site of the enzyme, a phenomenon previously observed with some substrates for subtilisin. Two mutant variants, H267A and D387G, showed bell-shaped pH-dependence of kcatapp, possibly due to an impaired protonation of the leaving group. This work reveals previously unknown differences between TPP II orthologues and subtilisin as well as features that might be conserved within the entire family of subtilisin-like serine peptidases.",

In this study, circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence measurements have been used to investigate the structural features and the temperature- and guanidinium hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced unfolding of the mature form of the \u03b3-GT from Geobacillus thermodenitrificans (GthGT) and that of its T353A mutant, which represents a mimic of the precursor protein. Data indicate that a) the mutant and the mature GthGT have a different secondary structure content and a slightly different exposure of hydrophobic regions, b) the thermal unfolding processes of both GthGT forms occur through a three-state model, characterized by a stable intermediate species, whereas chemical denaturations proceed through a single transition, c) both GthGT forms exhibit remarkable stability against temperature, but they do not display a strong resistance to the denaturing action of GdnHCl. These findings suggest that electrostatic interactions significantly contribute to the protein stability and that both the precursor and the mature form of GthGT assume compact and stable conformations to resist to the extreme temperatures where G. thermodenidrificans lives. Owing to its thermostability and unique catalytic properties, GthGT is an excellent candidate to be used as a glutaminase in food industry.",

     "abstract": "The dual functions of the dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin of Amphitrite ornata leads to a paradox. Peroxidase and hemoglobin functions require ferric and ferrous resting states, respectively. Assuming that hemoglobin function is the dominant function, the starting point for peroxidase activation would be the oxyferrous state. Activation of that state leads to the ferryl intermediate, followed by one-electron oxidation of the substrate, which results in the ferric state. Since no exogenous reductant is known, there is no return to the ferrous form or hemoglobin function. The observation that an internal binding site for 4-bromophenol leads to inhibition leads to a further paradox that the enzyme would be inhibited immediately upon activation under ambient conditions in benthic ecosystems where the inhibitor, 4-bromophenol is present in greater concentration than the substrate, 2,4,6-tribromophenol. In this review, we explore the unresolved aspects of the reaction scheme that leads to the apparent paradox. Recent data showing activation of the oxyferrous state, an extremely high reduction potential and exogenous reduction by the 2,6-dibromoquinone product present a potential resolution of the paradox. These aspects are discussed in the context of control of reactivity radical pathways and reactivity by the motion of the distal histidine, H55, which in turn is coupled to the binding of substrate and inhibitor.",

Mutation of interface cysteines, Cys328 and Cys368 to serine, perturbed the monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium in the protein with a small population of monomer being evident in the double mutant. Introduction of negative charge in the form of C328D mutation resulted in stabilization of protein dimer as evident by size exclusion chromatography at high ionic strength buffer and equilibrium unfolding in the presence of urea.

     "abstract": "Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a widely distributed type 3 copper enzyme participating in essential biological functions. Tyrosinases are potential biotools as biosensors or protein crosslinkers. Understanding the reaction mechanism of tyrosinases is fundamental for developing tyrosinase-based applications. The reaction mechanisms of tyrosinases from Trichoderma reesei (TrT) and Agaricus bisporus (AbT) were analyzed using three diphenolic substrates: caffeic acid, L-DOPA (3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine), and catechol. With caffeic acid the oxidation rates of TrT and AbT were comparable; whereas with L-DOPA or catechol a fast decrease in the oxidation rates was observed in the TrT-catalyzed reactions only, suggesting end product inhibition of TrT. Dopachrome was the only reaction end product formed by TrT- or AbT-catalyzed oxidation of L-DOPA. We produced dopachrome by AbT-catalyzed oxidation of L-DOPA and analyzed the TrT end product (i.e. dopachrome) inhibition by oxygen consumption measurement. In the presence of 1.5\u00a0mM dopachrome the oxygen consumption rate of TrT on 8\u00a0mM L-DOPA was halved. The type of inhibition of potential inhibitors for TrT was studied using p-coumaric acid (monophenol) and caffeic acid (diphenol) as substrates. The strongest inhibitors were potassium cyanide for the TrT-monophenolase activity, and kojic acid for the TrT-diphenolase activity. The lag period related to the TrT-catalyzed oxidation of monophenol was prolonged by kojic acid, sodium azide and arbutin; contrary it was reduced by potassium cyanide. Furthermore, sodium azide slowed down the initial oxidation rate of TrT- and AbT-catalyzed oxidation of L-DOPA or catechol, but it also formed adducts with the reaction end products, i.e., dopachrome and o-benzoquinone.",

In this study, we performed structural alignments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 3 CaM-like proteins and 6 CNB-like proteins, and quantified their distinct structural and dynamical features in an effort to establish how their sequences specify their structures and dynamics. Alignments of the EF2\u2013EF3 region of these proteins revealed that several residues (not restricted to the linker between the EF2 and EF3 motifs) differed between the two groups of proteins. A customized inverse folding approach followed by structural assessments and MD simulations established the critical role of these residues in determining the structure of the proteins.

To investigate the relationship between structure of this turn and enzyme activity as well as thermostability of mesophilic subtilisin Carlsberg (sC), we analyzed 6 mutants of sC with a single, double, or triple Gly or Ala substitutions for Pro210Thr211Asn212 at the \u03b28\u2013\u03b29 turn. Among the single Gly substitutions, the P210G substitution most significantly (1.5-fold) increased the specific activity on N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (AAPF) substrate and 12-fold decreased the thermostability. All mutants tested showed the increased kcat for the AAPF substrate and reduced thermostability compared with the wild-type sC. The kcat values of the P210G, P210G/T211G, and P210G/T211G/N212G mutants were 1.5-, 1.7-, and 1.8-fold higher than that of the wild-type sC. There were significant positive correlations between kcat and thermal inactivation rates as well as kcat and Km of the wild-type and mutants. These results demonstrate that the structure of \u03b28\u2013\u03b29 turn, despite its distance from the active site, has significant effects on the catalytic rate and thermostability of sC through a global network of intramolecular interactions and suggest that the lack of flexibility of this turn stabilizes the wild-type sC against thermal inactivation in compensation for some loss of catalytic activity.",

The observed trend towards the exclusive formation of DAU at very high alcohol amounts can be explained on the basis of the change of substrate orientation from normal to inverse. The simple molecular modelling analysis supports that key O/H atoms from TAU and the resulting intermediates display the adequate distances to generate productive binding only when the inverse coordination of TAU is present through the 5\u2032-moiety of TAU, at high ethanol concentrations. At these conditions a possible allosteric-like effect of ethanol, combined with water in an H-network in the catalytic triad and in its neighbourhood, could explain the high selectivity towards the production of DAU at selected conditions.",

Using our method, we have performed a comprehensive search on the UniProt database. We found that the motif is very rare but seems abundant in proteins involved in symbiosis and RNA binding/processing. Although there are related proteins with CSAH segments, the motif shows no deep conservation in protein families. We conclude that CSAH-containing proteins, although rare, are involved in many key biological processes. Their conservation pattern and prevalence in symbiosis-associated proteins suggest that they might be subjects of relatively rapid molecular evolution and thus can contribute to the emergence of novel functions.",

     "abstract": "We study the suicide inactivation of tyrosinase acting on o-aminophenols and aromatic o-diamines and compare the results with those obtained for the corresponding o-diphenols. The catalytic constants follow the order aromatic o-diamines\u00a0<\u00a0o-aminophenols\u00a0<\u00a0o-diphenols, which agrees with the view that the transfer of the proton to the peroxide group of the oxy-tyrosinase form is the slowest step in the catalytic cycle. As regards the apparent inactivation constant, it remains within the same order of magnitude, although slightly lower in the case of the aromatic o-diamines and o-aminophenols than o-diphenols: o-diamines\u00a0<\u00a0o-aminophenols\u00a0<\u00a0o-diphenols. The efficiency of the second nucleophilic attack of substrate on CuA seems to be the determining factor in the bifurcation of the inactivation and catalytic pathways. This attack is more efficient in o-diamines (where it attacks a nitrogen atom) than in o-aminophenols and o-diphenols (where it attacks an oxygen atom), favouring the catalytic pathway and slowing down the inactivation pathway. The inactivation step is the slowest of the whole process. The values of r, the number of turnovers that 1\u00a0mol of enzyme carries out before being inactivated, follows the order aromatic o-diamines\u00a0<\u00a0o-aminophenols\u00a0<\u00a0o-diphenols. As regards the Michaelis constants, that of the o-diamines is slightly lower than that of the o-diphenols, while that of the o-aminophenols is slightly greater than that observed for the o-diphenols. As a consequence of the above, the inactivation efficiency, \u03bbmax/KmS, follows this order: o-diphenols\u00a0>\u00a0o-aminophenols\u00a0>\u00a0aromatic o-diamines.",

A particular structural feature of p6 is the notably high relative content of proline residues, located at positions 5, 7, 10, 11, 24, 30, 37 and 49 in the sequence. Proline cis/trans isomerism was detected for all these proline residues to such an extent that more than 40% of all p6 molecules contain at least one proline in a cis conformation. 2D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of full-length HIV-1 p6 and p6 peptides established that cyclophilin A (CypA) interacts as a peptidyl\u2013prolyl cis/trans isomerase with all proline residues of p6. Only catalytic amounts of CypA were necessary for the interaction with p6 to occur, strongly suggesting that the observed interaction is highly relevant in vivo. In addition, surface plasmon resonance studies revealed binding of full-length p6 to CypA, and that this binding was significantly stronger than any of its N- or C-terminal peptides. This study demonstrates the first identification of an interaction between HIV-1 p6 and the host cellular protein CypA. The mode of interaction involves both transient enzyme\u2013substrate interactions and a more stable binding. The binding motifs of p6 to Tsg-101, ALIX and Vpr coincide with binding regions and catalytic sites of p6 to CypA, suggesting a potential role of CypA in modulating functional interactions of HIV-1.",

     "abstract": "The pleural effusion proteome has been found containing information that directly reflects pathophysiological status and represents a potential diagnostic value for pulmonary diseases. However, the variability in protein composition between malignant and benign effusions is not well understood. Herein, we investigated the changes of proteins in pleural effusions from lung adenocarcinoma and benign inflammatory disease (pneumonia and tuberculosis) patients by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). Twenty-eight protein spots displayed significantly different expression levels were positively identified by MALDI-TOF-MS representing 16 unique proteins. Five identified protein candidates were further validated and analyzed in effusions, sera or tissues. Among them, hemopexin, fibrinogen gamma and transthyretin (TTR) were up-regulated in cancer samples. The effusion concentration of serum amyloid P component (SAP) was significantly lower in lung cancer patients than in benign inflammatory patients, but no differences were found in sera samples. Moreover, a Jumonji C (JmjC)-domain-containing protein, JMJD5, was observed to be down-regulated in malignant effusions, lung cancer tissues and cancer cells. These results shed light on the altered pleural effusion proteins as a useful and important complement to plasma or other routine clinical tests for pulmonary disease diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Many recent high throughput technologies have enabled large-scale discoveries of new phosphorylation sites and phosphoproteins. Although they have provided a number of insights into protein phosphorylation and the related processes, an inclusive analysis on the nature of phosphorylated sites in proteins is currently lacking. We have therefore analyzed the occurrence and occupancy of phosphorylated sites (~\u00a0100,281) in a large set of eukaryotic proteins (~\u00a022,995). Phosphorylation probability was found to be much higher in both the termini of protein sequences and this is much pronounced in transmembrane proteins. A large proportion (51.3%) of occupied sites had a nearby phosphorylation within a distance of 10 amino acids; however, this proportion is very high compared to the expected one (16.9%). The distribution of phosphorylated sites in proteins showed a strong deviation from the expected maximum randomness. An analysis of phosphorylation motifs indicated that just 40 motifs and a much lower number of associated kinases might account for nearly 50% of the known phosphorylations in eukaryotic proteins. Our results provide a broad picture of the phosphorylation sites in eukaryotic proteins.",

     "abstract": "The cation-permeable channel PKD2L1 forms a homomeric assembly as well as heteromeric associations with both PKD1 and PKD1L3, with the cytoplasmic regulatory domain (CRD) of PKD2L1 often playing a role in assembly and/or function. Our previous work indicated that the isolated PKD2L1 CRD assembles as a trimer in a manner dependent on the presence of a proposed oligomerization domain. Herein we describe the 2.7\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of a segment containing the PKD2L1 oligomerization domain which indicates that trimerization is driven by the \u03b2-branched residues at the first and fourth positions of a heptad repeat (commonly referred to as \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d) and by a conserved R\u2013h\u2013x\u2013x\u2013h\u2013E salt bridge motif that is largely unique to parallel trimeric coiled coils. Further analysis of the PKD2L1 CRD indicates that trimeric association is sufficiently strong that no other species are present in solution in an analytical ultracentrifugation experiment at the lowest measurable concentration of 750\u00a0nM. Conversely, mutation of the \u201ca\u201d and \u201cd\u201d residues leads to formation of an exclusively monomeric species, independent of concentration. Although both monomeric and WT CRDs are stable in solution and bind calcium with 0.9\u00a0\u03bcM affinity, circular dichroism studies reveal that the monomer loses 25% more \u03b1-helical content than WT when stripped of this ligand, suggesting that the CRD structure is stabilized by trimerization in the ligand-free state. This stability could play a role in the function of the full-length complex, indicating that trimerization may be important for both homo- and possibly heteromeric assemblies of PKD2L1.",

     "abstract": "D-Serine dehydratase from Escherichia coli is a member of the \u03b2-family (fold-type II) of the pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate-dependent enzymes, catalyzing the conversion of D-serine to pyruvate and ammonia. The crystal structure of monomeric D-serine dehydratase has been solved to 1.97\u00a0\u00c5-resolution for an orthorhombic data set by molecular replacement. In addition, the structure was refined in a monoclinic data set to 1.55\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The structure of DSD reveals a larger pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate-binding domain and a smaller domain. The active site of DSD is very similar to those of the other members of the \u03b2-family. Lys118 forms the Schiff base to PLP, the cofactor phosphate group is liganded to a tetraglycine cluster Gly279\u2013Gly283, and the 3-hydroxyl group of PLP is liganded to Asn170 and N1 to Thr424, respectively. In the closed conformation the movement of the small domain blocks the entrance to active site of DSD. The domain movement plays an important role in the formation of the substrate recognition site and the catalysis of the enzyme. Modeling of D-serine into the active site of DSD suggests that the hydroxyl group of D-serine is coordinated to the carboxyl group of Asp238. The carboxyl oxygen of D-serine is coordinated to the hydroxyl group of Ser167 and the amide group of Leu171 (O1), whereas the O2 of the carboxyl group of D-serine is hydrogen-bonded to the hydroxyl group of Ser167 and the amide group of Thr168. A catalytic mechanism very similar to that proposed for L-serine dehydratase is discussed.",

Out of 18 candidate sequences, three hydroxylases are absent in other available Rhodococcus genomes. In addition, we report the biochemical characterization of 3-hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase (3HB6H), a gentisate-producing enzyme originally mis-annotated as salicylate hydroxylase. R. jostii RHA1 3HB6H expressed in Escherichia coli is a homodimer with each 47\u00a0kDa subunit containing a non-covalently bound FAD cofactor. The enzyme has a pH optimum around pH 8.3 and prefers NADH as external electron donor. 3HB6H is active with a series of 3-hydroxybenzoate analogues, bearing substituents in ortho- or meta-position of the aromatic ring. Gentisate, the physiological product, is a non-substrate effector of 3HB6H. This compound is not hydroxylated but strongly stimulates the NADH oxidase activity of the enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common cause of familial Parkinson's disease. Much research effort has been directed towards the catalytic core region of LRRK2 composed of GTPase (ROC, R as o f c omplex proteins) and kinase domains and a connecting COR ( C -terminus o f R OC) domain. In contrast, the precise functions of the protein\u2013protein interaction domains, such as the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, are not known. In the present study, we modeled the LRRK2 LRR domain (LRRLRRK2) using a template assembly approach, revealing the presence of 14 LRRs. Next, we focused on the expression and purification of LRRLRRK2 in Escherichia coli. Buffer optimization revealed that the protein requires the presence of a zwitterionic detergent, namely Empigen BB, during solubilization and the subsequent purification and characterization steps. This indicates that the detergent captures the hydrophobic surface patches of LRRLRRK2 thereby suppressing its aggregation. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy measured 18% \u03b1-helices and 21% \u03b2-sheets, consistent with predictions from the homology model. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and dynamic light scattering measurements showed the presence of a single species, with a Stokes radius corresponding to the model dimensions of a protein monomer. Furthermore, no obvious LRRLRRK2 multimerization was detected via cross-linking studies. Finally, the LRRLRRK2 clinical mutations did not influence LRRLRRK2 secondary, tertiary or quaternary structure as determined via SEC and CD spectroscopy. We therefore conclude that these mutations are likely to affect putative LRRLRRK2 inter- and intramolecular interactions.",

It consists of a cellulosic backbone (beta-1,4-linked glucosyl residues) that is frequently substituted with side chains. This report describes Aspergillus nidulans strain A773 recombinant secretion of a dimeric xyloglucan-specific endo-\u03b2-1,4-glucanohydrolase (XegA) cloned from Aspergillus niveus. The ORF of the A. niveus xegA gene is comprised of 714 nucleotides, and encodes a 238 amino acid protein with a calculated molecular weight of 23.5\u00a0kDa and isoelectric point of 4.38. The optimal pH and temperature were 6.0 and 60\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. XegA generated a xyloglucan-oligosaccharides (XGOs) pattern similar to that observed for cellulases from family GH12, i.e., demonstrating that its mode of action includes hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages between glucosyl residues that are not branched with xylose. In contrast to commercial lichenase, mixed linkage beta-glucan (lichenan) was not digested by XegA, indicating that the enzyme did not cleave glucan \u03b2-1,3 or \u03b2-1,6 bonds. The far-UV CD spectrum of the purified enzyme indicated a protein rich in \u03b2-sheet structures as expected for GH12 xyloglucanases. Thermal unfolding studies displayed two transitions with mid-point temperatures of 51.3\u00a0\u00b0C and 81.3\u00a0\u00b0C respectively, and dynamic light scattering studies indicated that the first transition involves a change in oligomeric state from a dimeric to a monomeric form. Since the enzyme is a predominantly a monomer at 60\u00a0\u00b0C, the enzymatic assays demonstrated that XegA is more active in its monomeric state.",

     "abstract": "Chemical modification or mutation of proteins may bring about significant changes in the net charge or surface hydrophobicity of a protein structure. Such events may be of major physiological significance and may provide important insights into the genetics of amyloid diseases. In the present study, fibrillation potential of native and chemically-modified forms of bovine carbonic anhydrase II (BCA II) were investigated. Initially, various denaturing conditions including low pH and high temperatures were tested to induce fibrillation. At a low pH of around 2.4, where the protein is totally dissociated, the apo form was found to take up a pre-molten globular (PMG) conformation with the capacity for fibril formation. Upon increasing the pH to around 3.6, a molten globular (MG) form became abundant, forming amorphous aggregates. Charge neutralization and enhancement of hydrophobicity by methylation, acetylation and propionylation of lysine residues appeared very effective in promoting fibrillation of both the apo and holo forms under native conditions, the rates and extents of which were directly proportional to surface hydrophobicity, and influenced by salt concentration and temperature. These modified structures underwent more pronounced fibrillation under native conditions, than the PMG intermediate form, observed under denaturing conditions. The nature of the fibrillation products obtained from intermediate and modified structures were characterized and compared and their possible cytotoxicity determined. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of surface net charge and hydrophobicity in controlling protein aggregation. A discussion on the physiological significance of the observations is also presented.",

They are studied with increasing intensity due to their potential in neurosciences and pharmacology. The number of existing conopeptides is estimated to be 1 million, but only about 1000 have been described to date. Thanks to new high-throughput sequencing technologies the number of known conopeptides is likely to increase exponentially in the near future. There is therefore a need for a fast and accurate computational method for identification and classification of the novel conopeptides in large data sets. 62 profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) were built for prediction and classification of all described conopeptide superfamilies and families, based on the different parts of the corresponding protein sequences. These models showed very high specificity in detection of new peptides. 56 out of 62 models do not give a single false positive in a test with the entire UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein sequence database. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of mature peptide models for automatic classification with accuracy of 96% for the mature peptide models and 100% for the pro- and signal peptide models. Our conopeptide profile HMMs can be used for finding and annotation of new conopeptides from large datasets generated by transcriptome or genome sequencing. To our knowledge this is the first time this kind of computational method has been applied to predict all known conopeptide superfamilies and some conopeptide families.",

Brucipain is closely related to mammalian cathepsin L and currently used as a framework for the development of inhibitors that display anti-parasitic activity. We show that recombinant brucipain lacking the C-terminal extension undergoes inhibition by the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin at concentrations above the Km, but not by benzyloxycarbonyl-VLR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. The allosteric modulation exerted by the substrate is controlled by temperature, being apparent at 25\u00a0\u00b0C but concealed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The behavior of the enzyme in vitro can be explained by discrete conformational changes caused by the shifts in temperature that render it less susceptible to substrate inhibition. Enzyme inhibition by the di-peptydyl substrate impaired the degradation of human fibrinogen at 25\u00a0\u00b0C, but not at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. We also found that heparan sulfate acts as a natural allosteric modulator of the enzyme through interactions that prevent substrate inhibition.

The secondary structure of apo-mpDHFR was stable up to 80\u00a0\u00b0C, as revealed by circular dichroism spectra. The free energy changes due to pressure and urea unfolding of apo-mpDHFR, determined by fluorescence spectroscopy, were smaller than those of ecDHFR, indicating the unstable structure of mpDHFR against pressure and urea despite the three-dimensional crystal structures of both DHFRs being almost the same. The respective volume changes due to pressure and urea unfolding were \u2212\u00a045 and \u2212\u00a053\u00a0ml/mol at 25\u00a0\u00b0C for mpDHFR, which were smaller (less negative) than the corresponding values of \u2212\u00a077 and \u2212\u00a085\u00a0ml/mol for ecDHFR. These volume changes can be ascribed to the difference in internal cavity and surface hydration of each DHFR. From these results, we assume that the native structure of mpDHFR is loosely packed and highly hydrated compared with that of ecDHFR in solution.",

As such, the Ab surface holds information about Ag folding that resides with the Ab\u2013Ag interface residues and how they interact. In order to gain insight into the nature of such interactions, a data set comprised of 53 non-redundant 3D structures of Ag\u2013Ab complexes was analyzed. We assessed the physical and biochemical features of the Ag\u2013Ab interfaces and the degree to which favored interactions exist between amino acid residues on the corresponding interface surfaces. Amino acid compositional analysis of the interfaces confirmed the dominance of TYR in the Ab paratope-containing surface (PCS), with almost two fold greater abundance than any other residue. Additionally TYR had a much higher than expected presence in the PCS compared to the surface of the whole antibody (defined as the occurrence propensity), along with aromatics PHE, TRP, and to a lesser degree HIS and ILE. In the Ag epitope-containing surface (ECS), there were slightly increased occurrence propensities of TRP and TYR relative to the whole Ag surface, implying an increased significance over the compositionally most abundant LYS\u00a0>\u00a0ASN\u00a0>\u00a0GLU\u00a0>\u00a0ASP\u00a0>\u00a0ARG.

     "abstract": "The well-ordered cross \u03b2-strand structure found in amyloid aggregates is stabilized by many different side chain interactions, including hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic charge and the intrinsic propensity to form \u03b2-sheet structures. In addition to the side chains, backbone interactions are important because of the regular hydrogen-bonding pattern. \u03b2-Sheet breaking peptide analogs, such as those formed by N-methylation, interfere with the repetitive hydrogen bonding pattern of peptide strands. Here we test backbone contributions to fibril stability using analogs of the 6\u201310 residue fibril core of human islet amyloid polypeptide, a 37 amino acid peptide involved in the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. The Phe\u2013Gly peptide bond has been replaced by a hydroxyethylene or a ketomethylene group and the nitrogen-atom has been methylated. In addition, we have prepared peptoids where the side chain is transferred to the nitrogen atom. The backbone turns out to be extremely sensitive to substitution, since only the minimally perturbed ketomethylene analog (where only one of the \u2212\u00a0NH\u00a0\u2212 groups has been replaced by \u2212\u00a0CH2\u2212) can elongate wildtype fibrils but cannot fibrillate on its own. The resulting fibrils displayed differences in both secondary structure and overall morphology. No analog could inhibit the fibrillation of the parent peptide, suggesting an inability to bind to existing fibril surfaces. In contrast, side chain mutations that left the backbone intact but increased backbone flexibility or removed stabilizing side-chain interactions had very small effect on fibrillation kinetics. We conclude that fibrillation is very sensitive to even small modifications of the peptide backbone.",

In mammalian liver it reduces S-adenosylmethionine levels by using it to methylate glycine, producing N-methylglycine (sarcosine) and S-adenosylhomocysteine. GNMT is inhibited by binding two molecules of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (mono- or polyglutamate forms) per tetramer of the active enzyme. Inhibition is sensitive to the status of the N-terminal valine of GNMT and to polyglutamation of the folate inhibitor. It is inhibited by pentaglutamate form more efficiently compared to monoglutamate form. The native rat liver GNMT contains an acetylated N-terminal valine and is inhibited much more efficiently compared to the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli where the N-terminus is not acetylated. In this work we used a protein crystallography approach to evaluate the structural basis for these differences. We show that in the folate\u2013GNMT complexes with the native enzyme, two folate molecules establish three and four hydrogen bonds with the protein. In the folate\u2013recombinant GNMT complex only one hydrogen bond is established. This difference results in more effective inhibition by folate of the native liver GNMT activity compared to the recombinant enzyme.",

     "abstract": "The SCO protein from the aerobic bacterium Bacillus subtilis (BsSCO) is involved in the assembly of the cytochrome c oxidase complex, and specifically with the CuA center. BsSCO has been proposed to play various roles in CuA assembly including, the direct delivery of copper ions to the CuA site, and/or maintaining the appropriate redox state of the cysteine ligands during formation of CuA. BsSCO binds copper in both Cu(II) and Cu(I) redox states, but has a million-fold higher affinity for Cu(II). As a prerequisite to kinetic studies, we measured equilibrium stability of oxidized, reduced and Cu(II)-bound BsSCO by chemical and thermal induced denaturation. Oxidized and reduced apo-BsSCO exhibit two-state behavior in both chemical- and thermal-induced unfolding. However, the Cu(II) complex of BsSCO is stable in up to nine molar urea. Thermal or guanidinium-induced unfolding of BsSCO-Cu(II) ensues only as the Cu(II) species is lost. The effect of copper (II) on the folding of BsSCO is complicated by a rapid redox reaction between copper and reduced, denatured BsSCO. When denatured apo-BsSCO is refolded in the presence of copper (II) some of the population is recovered as the BsSCO-Cu(II) complex and some is oxidized indicating that refolding and oxidation are competing processes. The proposed functional roles for BsSCO in vivo require that its cysteine residues are reduced and the presence of copper during folding may be detrimental to BsSCO attaining its functional state.",

The chemical shift of Z-phenylalanine is also increased from 179.5\u00a0ppm to 182.9\u00a0ppm on binding to thermolysin. From pH studies we conclude that the pKa of the inhibitor carboxylate group is lowered by at least 1.5 pKa units when it binds to either enzyme. The signal at ~\u00a0183\u00a0ppm is no longer observed when the active site zinc atom of thermolysin or stromelysin-1 is replaced by cobalt.

The disulfide bond is part of a loop insertion peptide that forms a cap-like structure on top of the core \u03b1-helical fold. We have investigated the contribution of the disulfide bond to thermodynamic stability and (un)folding kinetics in cytochrome c6A from Arabidopsis thaliana by making comparison with a photosynthetic cytochrome c6 from Phormidium laminosum and through a mutant in which the Cys residues have been replaced with Ser residues (C67/73S). We find that the disulfide bond makes a significant contribution to overall stability in both the ferric and ferrous heme states. Both cytochromes c6A and c6 fold rapidly at neutral pH through an on-pathway intermediate. The unfolding rate for the C67/73S variant is significantly increased indicating that the formation of this region occurs late in the folding pathway.

     "abstract": "Maintenance of cellular phosphate homeostasis is crucial for primary and energy metabolism. In plants, low exogenous phosphate availability activates adaptive responses that include the immediate liberation of Pi from phosphorylated metabolites by yet uncharacterized intracellular phosphatases. Based on transcriptional analyses, the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1g17710, a member of the HAD (Haloacid Dehalogenase) superfamily, was one of the most promising candidates. Here, we show by recombinant protein production and analysis of purified protein that the gene At1g17710 encodes a phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.75). Thus, the gene product was termed AtPECP1. The present study demonstrates that the Mg2\u00a0+-dependent enzyme exhibits pronounced specificity for both substrates. The enzyme displays a broad pH optimum ranging from pH 6 to pH 8. Comparison of Km values indicates a slightly higher affinity for phosphocholine (0.44\u00a0mM) than for phosphoethanolamine (1.16\u00a0mM). The catalytic efficiency, however, is markedly higher for phosphoethanolamine than for phosphocholine being 1.06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and 2.34\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, respectively. Size exclusion chromatography, native gel electrophoresis and SAXS experiments with recombinant protein clearly point to a rapid monomer\u2013dimer equilibrium of protein subunits. Given its established substrate specificity the enzyme is likely to be involved in the liberation of inorganic phosphate from intracellular sources and is especially in demand under phosphate-deprived conditions.",

     "abstract": "Streptokinase (SK) is a protein co-factor with a potent capability for human plasminogen (HPG) activation. Our previous studies [1] have indicated a major role of long-range protein\u2013protein contacts between the three domains (alpha, beta, and gamma) of SK and the multi-domain HPG substrate (K1\u2013K5CD). To further explore this phenomenon, we prepared truncated derivatives of HPG with progressive removal of kringle domains, like K5CD, K4K5CD, K3\u2013K5CD (K3K4K5CD), K2\u2013K5CD (K2K3K4K5CD) and K1\u2013K5CD (K1K2K3K4K5CD). While urokinase (uPA) cleaved the scissile peptide in the isolated catalytic domain (\u03bcPG) with nearly the same rate as with full-length HPG, SK-plasmin showed only 1\u20132% activity, revealing mutually distinct mechanisms of HPG catalysis between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic activators. Remarkably, with SK.HPN (plasmin), the \u2018addition\u2019 of both kringles 4 and 5 onto the catalytic domain showed catalytic rates comparable to full length HPG, thus identifying the dependency of the \u201clong-range\u201d enzyme\u2013substrate interactions onto these two CD-proximal domains. Further, chimeric variants of K5CD were generated by swapping the kringle domains of HPG with those of uPA and TPA (tissue plasminogen activator), separately. Surprisingly, although native-like catalytic turnover rates were retained when either K1, K2 or K4 of HPG was substituted at the K5 position in K5CD, these were invariably lost once substituted with the evolutionarily more distant TPA- and uPA-derived kringles. The present results unveil a novel mechanism of SK.HPN action in which augmented catalysis occurs through enzyme\u2013substrate interactions centered on regions in substrate HPG (kringles 4 and 5) that are spatially distant from the scissile peptide bond.",

Similarly, kcat\u2032 for \u03b2-decarboxylation of l-aspartate increased from\u00a0<\u00a00.0001\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 to 0.07\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01, whereas kcat\u2032 for transamination was reduced from 530\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 to 0.13\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. l-Aspartate aminotransferase had thus been converted into an l-cysteine sulfinate desulfinase that catalyzes transamination and l-aspartate \u03b2-decarboxylation as side reactions. The X-ray structures of the engineered l-cysteine sulfinate desulfinase in its pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate and pyridoxamine-5\u2032-phosphate form or liganded with a covalent coenzyme\u2013substrate adduct identified the subtle structural changes that suffice for generating desulfinase activity and concomitantly abolishing transaminase activity toward dicarboxylic amino acids. Apparently, the triple mutation impairs the domain closure thus favoring reprotonation of alternative acceptor sites in coenzyme\u2013substrate intermediates by bulk water.",

     "abstract": "Firefly luciferase is a protein with a large N-terminal and a small C-terminal domain. B-factor analysis shows that its C-terminal is much more flexible than its N-terminal. Studies on hyperthermophile proteins have been shown that the increased thermal stability of hyperthermophile proteins is due to their enhanced conformational rigidity and the relationship between flexibility, stability and function in most of proteins is on debate. Two mutations (D474K and D476N) in the most flexible region of firefly luciferase were designed. Thermostability analysis shows that D476N mutation doesn't have any significant effect but D474K mutation destabilized protein. On the other hand, flexibility analysis using dynamic quenching and limited proteolysis demonstrates that D474K mutation became much more flexible than wild type although D476N doesn't have any significant difference. Intrinsic and ANS fluorescence studies demonstrate that D476N mutation is brought about by structural changes without significant effect on thermostability and flexibility. Molecular modeling reveals that disruption of a salt bridge between D474 and K445 accompanying with some H-bond deletion may be involved in destabilization of D474K mutant.",

Biochemical assays such as exclusion chromatography and RNA-binding by the electrophoretic shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that the purified protein is homogeneous and active. The crystal structure revealed a conserved Sm topology, composed of one N-terminal \u03b1-helix followed by five twisted \u03b2-strands, and a novel \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking intra-subunit interaction of two histidine residues, absent in other Hfq proteins.

To understand how the HCM-causing Asp175Asn and Glu180Gly mutations in \u03b1-tropomyosin affect on actin\u2013myosin interaction during the ATPase cycle, we labeled the SH1 helix of myosin subfragment-1 and the actin subdomain-1 with the fluorescent probe N-iodoacetyl-N\u2032-(5-sulfo-1-naphtylo)ethylenediamine. These proteins were incorporated into ghost muscle fibers and their conformational states were monitored during the ATPase cycle by measuring polarized fluorescence. For the first time, the effect of these \u03b1-tropomyosins on the mobility and rotation of subdomain-1 of actin and the SH1 helix of myosin subfragment-1 during the ATP hydrolysis cycle have been demonstrated directly by polarized fluorimetry. Wild-type \u03b1-tropomyosin increases the amplitude of the SH1 helix and subdomain-1 movements during the ATPase cycle, indicating the enhancement of the efficiency of the work of cross-bridges. Both mutant TMs increase the proportion of the strong-binding sub-states, with the effect of the Glu180Gly mutation being greater than that of Asp175Asn. It is suggested that the alteration in the concerted conformational changes of actomyosin is likely to provide the structural basis for the altered cardiac muscle contraction.",

With the discovery of the lysosome by Christian de Duve it was assumed that cellular proteins are degraded within this organelle. Yet, several independent lines of experimental evidence strongly suggested that intracellular proteolysis was largely non-lysosomal, but the mechanisms involved have remained obscure. The discovery of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system resolved the enigma. We now recognize that degradation of intracellular proteins is involved in regulation of a broad array of cellular processes, such as cell cycle and division, regulation of transcription factors, and assurance of the cellular quality control. Not surprisingly, aberrations in the system have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human disease, such as malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders, which led subsequently to an increasing effort to develop mechanism-based drugs.

     "abstract": "For a long time the lysosomal pathway was thought to be exclusively one for catabolism and recycling of material taken up by endocytosis from the external milieu or from the cytosol by autophagy. At least in the immune system it is clear now that endo/lysosomal proteolysis generates crucially important information, in particular peptides that bind class II MHC molecules to create ligands for survey by the diverse antigen receptors of the T lymphocyte system. This process of antigen processing and presentation is used to display not only foreign but also self peptides and therefore is important for \u2018self\u2019 tolerance as well as immunity to pathogens. Some cells, macrophages and particularly dendritic cells can load peptides on class I MHC molecules in the endosome system through the important, though still not fully characterised, pathway of cross-presentation. Here I try to provide a brief review of how this area developed focussing to some extent our own contributions to understanding the class II MHC pathway. I also mention briefly recent work of others showing that proteolysis along this pathway turns out to regulate immune signalling events in the innate immune system such as the activation of some members of the Toll-like receptor family. Finally, our recent work on the endo/lysosome targeted protease inhibitor cystatin F, suggests that auto-regulation of protease activity in some immune cells occurs.

     "abstract": "Lysosomes are the key degradative compartments of the cell. Lysosomal cathepsins, which are enclosed in the lysosomes, help to maintain the homeostasis of the cell's metabolism by participating in the degradation of heterophagic and autophagic material. Following the targeted lysosomal membrane's destabilization, the cathepsins can be released into the cytosol and initiate the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis through the cleavage of Bid and the degradation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 homologues. Cathepsins can also amplify the apoptotic signaling, when the lysosomal membranes are destabilized at a later stage of apoptosis, initiated by other stimuli. However, the functional integrity of the lysosomal compartment during apoptosis enables efficient autophagy, which can counteract apoptosis by providing the energy source and by disposing the damaged mitochondria, which generate the ROS. Impairing autophagy by disabling the lysosome function is being investigated as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to sensitize cells to apoptosis-inducing agents. Destabilization of the lysosomal membranes by the lysosomotropic detergents seems to be a promising strategy in this context as it would not only disable autophagy, but also promote apoptosis through the initiation of the lysosomal pathway. In contrast, the impaired autophagy and lysosomal degradation linked with the increased oxidative stress underlie degenerative changes in the aging neurons. This further suggests that lysosomes and lysosomal cathepsins have a dual role in cell death.

     "abstract": "Autophagy is a process involved in the proteolytic degradation of cellular macromolecules in lysosomes, which requires the activity of proteases, enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds and play a critical role in the initiation and execution of autophagy. Importantly, proteases also inhibit autophagy in certain cases. The initial steps of macroautophagy depend on the proteolytic processing of a particular protein, Atg8, by a cysteine protease, Atg4. This processing step is essential for conjugation of Atg8 with phosphatidylethanolamine and, subsequently, autophagosome formation. Lysosomal hydrolases, known as cathepsins, can be divided into several groups based on the catalitic residue in the active site, namely, cysteine, serine and aspartic cathepsins, which catalyse the cleavage of peptide bonds of autophagy substrates and, together with other factors, dispose of the autophagic flux. Whilst most cathepsins degrade autophagosomal content, some, such as cathepsin L, also degrade lysosomal membrane components, GABARAP-II and LC3-II. In contrast, cathepsin A, a serine protease, is involved in inhibition of chaperon-mediated autophagy through proteolytic processing of LAMP-2A. In addition, other families of calcium-dependent non-lysosomal cysteine proteases, such as calpains, and cysteine aspartate-specific proteases, such as caspases, may cleave autophagy-related proteins, negatively influencing the execution of autophagic processes. Here we discuss the current state of knowledge concerning protein degradation by autophagy and outline the role of proteases in autophagic processes.

Due to its prominent lysosomal activity and technical ease of handling, the liver has been at the center of continuous and vigorous investigations into autophagy. Many important discoveries, including suppression by insulin and plasma amino acids and stimulation by glucagon, have been made through in vivo and in vitro studies using perfused liver and cultured hepatocytes. The long-term controversy about the origin and nature of the autophagosome membrane has finally led to the conclusion of \u201cphagophore,\u201d through extensive molecular cell biological approaches enlightened by the discovery of autophagy-essential ATG genes. Furthermore, recent studies using liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice have thrown light on the unique role of a selective substrate of autophagy, p62. The stabilized p62 accumulating in autophagy-deficient liver manipulates Nrf2-dependent transcription activation through specific binding to Keap1, which results in the elevated gene expression involved in detoxification. This is the first example of the dysregulation of gene expression under autophagy deficiency. Thus, basal liver autophagy makes a large contribution to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and health. Meanwhile, precise comparisons of wild-type and liver-specific autophagy-deficient mice under starvation conditions have revealed that amino acids released by autophagic degradation can be metabolized to produce glucose via gluconeogenesis for the maintenance of blood glucose, and can also be excreted to the circulation to supply serum amino acids. These results strongly confirm that induced liver autophagy plays a pivotal role in metabolic compensation.

It remains unclear whether this occurs at the cell surface with granzymes moving through a perforin pore in the plasma membrane, or if it involves internalisation of perforin and granzymes and subsequent release from an endocytic compartment.

Their unique reactive-site properties have made it possible to confine the targets simply by the use of appropriate reactive groups. The epoxysuccinyls still dominate the field, but now nitriles seem to be the most appropriate \u201cwarhead\u201d. The view of cysteine cathepsins as lysosomal proteases is changing as there is now clear evidence of their localization in other cellular compartments. Besides being involved in protein turnover, they build an important part of the endosomal antigen presentation. Together with the growing number of non-endosomal roles of cysteine cathepsins is growing also the knowledge of their involvement in diseases such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Finally, cysteine cathepsins are important regulators and signaling molecules of an unimaginable number of biological processes. The current challenge is to identify their endogenous substrates, in order to gain an insight into the mechanisms of substrate degradation and processing. In this review, some of the remarkable advances that have taken place in the past decade are presented.

     "abstract": "Recent new findings indicate significant biological roles of cysteine cathepsin proteases in secretory vesicles for production of biologically active peptides. Notably, cathepsin L in secretory vesicles functions as a key protease for proteolytic processing of proneuropeptides (and prohormones) into active neuropeptides that are released to mediate cell\u2013cell communication in the nervous system for neurotransmission. Moreover, cathepsin B in secretory vesicles has been recently identified as a \u03b2-secretase for production of neurotoxic \u03b2- amyloid (A\u03b2) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD), participating as a notable factor in the severe memory loss in AD. These secretory vesicle functions of cathepsins L and B for production of biologically active peptides contrast with the well-known role of cathepsin proteases in lysosomes for the degradation of proteins to result in their inactivation. The unique secretory vesicle proteome indicates proteins of distinct functional categories that provide the intravesicular environment for support of cysteine cathepsin functions. Features of the secretory vesicle protein systems insure optimized intravesicular conditions that support the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. These new findings of recently discovered biological roles of cathepsins L and B indicate their significance in human health and disease.

     "abstract": "Cathepsin E is an intracellular aspartic proteinase of the pepsin superfamily, which is predominantly expressed in certain cell types, including the immune system cells and rapidly regenerating gastric mucosal and epidermal keratinocytes. The intracellular localization of this protein varies with different cell types. The endosomal localization is primarily found in antigen-presenting cells and gastric cells. The membrane association is observed with certain cell types such as erythrocytes, osteoclasts, gastric parietal cells and renal proximal tubule cells. This enzyme is also found in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex and cytosolic compartments in various cell types. In addition to its intracellular localization, cathepsin E occurs in the culture medium of activated phagocytes and cancer cells as the catalytically active enzyme. Its strategic expression and localization thus suggests the association of this enzyme with specific biological functions of the individual cell types. Recent genetic and pharmacological studies have particularly suggested that cathepsin E plays an important role in host defense against cancer cells and invading microorganisms. This review focuses emerging roles of cathepsin E in immune system cells and skin keratinocytes, and in host defense against cancer cells.

FLIPL, a catalytically defective caspase-8 paralog, can interact with caspase-8 to activate its catalytic function. The caspase-8/FLIPL heterodimer has a restricted substrate repertoire and does not induce apoptosis. In essence, caspase-8 heterodimerized with FLIPL prevents the receptor interacting kinases RIPK1 and -3 from executing the form of cell death known as necroptosis.

     "abstract": "When abundant and activated, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, or matrixins) degrade most, if not all, constituents of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting massive tissue breakdown is best exemplified in humans by the menstrual lysis and shedding of the endometrium, the mucosa lining the uterus. After menstruation, MMP activity needs to be tightly controlled as the endometrium regenerates and differentiates to avoid abnormal tissue breakdown while allowing tissue repair and fine remodelling to accommodate implantation of a blastocyst. This paper reviews how MMPs are massively present and activated in the endometrium at menstruation, and how their activity is tightly controlled at other phases of the cycle. Progesterone represses expression of many but not all MMPs. Its withdrawal triggers focal expression of MMPs specifically in the areas undergoing lysis, an effect mediated by local cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b1, LEFTY-2, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and others. MMP-3 is selectively expressed at that time and activates proMMP-9, otherwise present in latent form throughout the cycle. In addition, a large number of neutrophils loaded with MMPs are recruited at menstruation through induction of chemokines, such as interleukin-8. At the secretory phase, progesterone repression of MMPs is mediated by transforming growth factor-\u03b2. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are abundant at all phases of the cycle to prevent any undue MMP activity, but are likely overwhelmed at menstruation. At other phases of the cycle, MMPs can elude TIMP inhibition as exemplified by recruitment of active MMP-7 to the plasma membrane of epithelial cells, allowing processing of membrane-associated growth factors needed for epithelial repair and proliferation. Finally, receptor-mediated endocytosis through low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) efficiently clears MMP-2 and -9 at the proliferative and secretory phases. This mechanism is probably essential to prevent any excessive ECM degradation by the active form of MMP-2 that is permanently present. However, shedding of the ectodomain of LRP-1 specifically at menstruation prevents endocytosis of MMPs allowing full degradation of the ECM. Thus endometrial MMPs are regulated at the levels of transcription, release from infiltrating neutrophils, activation, binding to the cell membrane, inhibition by TIMPs and endocytic clearance by LRP-1. This allows tight control during endometrial growth and differentiation but results in a burst of activity for menstrual tissue breakdown.

     "abstract": "Visualization of three-dimensional structures is essential to the transmission of information to the general reader and the comparison of related structures. Therefore, it would be useful to provide a common framework. Based on the work of Schechter and Berger, and the finding that most peptidases bind their substrates in extended conformation, we suggest a \u201cstandard orientation\u201d for the overall description of metallopeptidases (MPs) as done before for peptidases of other classes. This entails a frontal view of the horizontally-aligned active-site cleft. A substrate is bound N- to C-terminally from left (on the non-primed side of the cleft) to right (on the primed side), and the catalytic metal ion resides at the cleft bottom at roughly half width. This view enables us to see that most metalloendopeptidases are bifurcated into an upper and a lower sub-domain by the cleft, whose back is framed by a nearly horizontal \u201cactive-site helix.\u201d The latter comprises a short zinc-binding consensus sequence, either HEXXH or HXXEH, which provides two histidines to bind the single catalytic metal and the general-base/acid glutamate required for catalysis. In addition, an oblique \u201cbacking helix\u201d is observed behind the active-site helix, and a mixed \u03b2-sheet of at least three strands is positioned in the upper sub-domain paralleling the cleft. The lowermost \u201cupper-rim\u201d strand of the sheet runs antiparallel to the substrate bound in the cleft and therefore contributes both to delimitating the cleft top and to binding of the substrate main-chain on its non-primed side through \u03b2-ribbon-like interactions. In contrast, in metalloexopeptidases, which chop off N- or C-terminal residues only, extensive binding on both sides of the cleft is not required and a different overall scaffold is generally observed. This consists of an \u03b1\u03b2\u03b1-sandwich, which is reminiscent of, but clearly distinct from, the archetypal \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase fold. Metalloexopeptidases have their active sites at the C-terminal end of a central, eight-stranded twisted \u03b2-sheet, and can contain one or two catalytic metal ions. As the zinc-binding site and the residues engaged in substrate binding and catalysis are mainly provided by loops connecting the \u03b2-sheet strands and the helices on either side, the respective standard orientations vary with respect to the position of the sheets. The standard orientation of eight prototypic MP structures is presented and discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50 years after the discovery of lysosome.",

Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) are the primary factors responsible for hemorrhage and may also interfere with the hemostatic system, thus facilitating loss of blood from the vasculature of the prey. SVMPs are phylogenetically most closely related to mammalian ADAM ( a d isintegrin a nd m etalloproteinase) and ADAMTS ( ADAM with t hrombo s pondin type-1 motif) family of proteins and, together with them, constitute the M12B clan of metalloendopeptidases. Large SVMPs, referred to as the P-III class of SVMPs, have a modular architecture with multiple non-catalytic domains. The P-III SVMPs are characterized by higher hemorrhagic and more diverse biological activities than the P-I class of SVMPs, which only have a catalytic domain. Recent crystallographic studies of P-III SVMPs and their mammalian counterparts shed new light on structure\u2013function properties of this class of enzymes. The present review will highlight these structures, particularly the non-catalytic ancillary domains of P-III SVMPs and ADAMs that may target the enzymes to specific substrates.

Advances in chemical, proteomic and genetic tools that can be applied to parasite biology have led to an increased understanding of the complex events centrally regulated by proteases. In this review, we outline recent advances in our knowledge of specific proteolytic enzymes in two medically relevant apicomplexan parasites: Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. Efforts over the last decade have begun to provide a map of key proteotolyic events that are essential for both parasite survival and propagation inside host cells.

     "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is one of the most common infectious pathogens in humans. Since the IVA genome does not have the processing protease for the viral hemagglutinin (HA) envelope glycoprotein precursors, entry of this virus into cells and infectious organ tropism of IAV are primarily determined by host cellular trypsin-type HA processing proteases. Several secretion-type HA processing proteases for seasonal IAV in the airway, and ubiquitously expressed furin and pro-protein convertases for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, have been reported. Recently, other HA-processing proteases for seasonal IAV and HPAI have been identified in the membrane fraction. These proteases proteolytically activate viral multiplication at the time of viral entry and budding. In addition to the role of host cellular proteases in IAV pathogenicity, IAV infection results in marked upregulation of cellular trypsins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in various organs and cells, particularly endothelial cells, through induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. These host cellular factors interact with each other as the influenza virus\u2013cytokine\u2013protease cycle, which is the major mechanism that induces vascular hyperpermeability and multiorgan failure in severe influenza.

The enzyme is an immunodominant antigen in human chronic Chagas disease and seems to be important in the host/parasite relationship.

Four Plasmodium spp. (P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and the most lethal P. falciparum) are mainly responsible for causing human malaria that affects millions worldwide. Due to the complexity and rate of parasite mutation coupled with regional variations, and the emergence of P. falciparum strains which are resistant to antimalarial agents such as chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, there is constant pressure to find new and lasting chemotherapeutic drug therapies. Since many proteases represent therapeutic targets and PMs have been shown to play an important role in the survival of parasite, these enzymes have recently been identified as promising targets for the development of novel antimalarial drugs. The genome of P. falciparum encodes 10 PMs (PMI, PMII, PMIV-X and histo-aspartic protease (HAP)), 4 of which (PMI, PMII, PMIV and HAP) reside within the food vacuole, are directly involved in degradation of human hemoglobin, and share 50\u201379% amino acid sequence identity. This review focuses on structural studies of only these four enzymes, including their orthologs in other Plasmodium spp.. Almost all original crystallographic studies were performed with PMII, but more recent work on PMIV, PMI, and HAP resulted in a more complete picture of the structure\u2013function relationship of vacuolar PMs. Many structures of inhibitor complexes of vacuolar plasmepsins, as well as their zymogens, have been reported in the last 15\u00a0years.

     "abstract": "Calpain is an intracellular Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease (EC 3.4.22.17; Clan CA, family C02). Recent expansion of sequence data across the species definitively shows that calpain has been present throughout evolution; calpains are found in almost all eukaryotes and some bacteria, but not in archaebacteria. Fifteen genes within the human genome encode a calpain-like protease domain. Interestingly, some human calpains, particularly those with non-classical domain structures, are very similar to calpain homologs identified in evolutionarily distant organisms. Three-dimensional structural analyses have helped to identify calpain's unique mechanism of activation; the calpain protease domain comprises two core domains that fuse to form a functional protease only when bound to Ca2+via well-conserved amino acids. This finding highlights the mechanistic characteristics shared by the numerous calpain homologs, despite the fact that they have divergent domain structures. In other words, calpains function through the same mechanism but are regulated independently. This article reviews the recent progress in calpain research, focusing on those studies that have helped to elucidate its mechanism of action.

     "abstract": "Tripeptidyl peptidase II is the largest known eukaryotic peptidase. It has been described as a multi-purpose peptidase, which, in addition to its house-keeping function in intracellular protein degradation, plays a role in several vital cellular processes such as antigen processing, apoptosis, or cell division, and is involved in diseases like muscle wasting, obesity, and in cancer. Biochemical studies and bioinformatics have identified TPPII as a subtilase, but its structure is very unusual: it forms a large homooligomeric complex (6\u00a0MDa) with a spindle-like shape. Recently, the high-resolution structure of TPPII homodimers (300\u00a0kDa) was solved and a hybrid structure of the holocomplex built of 20 dimers was obtained by docking it into the EM-density. Here, we summarize our current knowledge about TPPII with a focus on structural aspects. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50\u00a0years after the discovery of lysosome.",

     "abstract": "Thrombin is the final protease generated in the blood coagulation cascade. It has multiple substrates and cofactors, and serves both pro- and anti-coagulant functions. How thrombin activity is directed throughout the evolution of a clot and the role of conformational change in determining thrombin specificity are issues that lie at the heart of the haemostatic balance. Over the last 20\u00a0years there have been a great number of studies supporting the idea that thrombin is an allosteric enzyme that can exist in two conformations differing in activity and specificity. However, recent work has shown that thrombin in its unliganded state is inherently flexible in regions that are important for activity. The effect of flexibility on activity is discussed in this review in context of the zymogen-to-protease conformational transition. Understanding thrombin function in terms of \u2018plasticity\u2019 provides a new conceptual framework for understanding regulation of enzyme activity in general.

     "abstract": "The lectin pathway of the complement system is activated following the binding of carbohydrate-based ligands by recognition molecules such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) or ficolins. Engagement of the recognition molecules causes activation of associated MBL-associated serine proteases or MASPs, which in turn activate downstream complement molecules to activate the system. Two MASP genes are alternatively spliced during expression to yield 5 proteins, including three proteases (MASP-1, -2 and -3) and two truncated proteins, MAp19 and MAp44. Here we discuss what is currently known about these proteins in terms of their structure and function. MASP-2 is autoactivated following the initial binding events of the pathway and is able to subsequently activate the C4 and C2 substrates required to activate the rest of the pathway. MASP-1 is able to augment MASP-2 activation, but also appears to play other roles, although the physiological significance of these is not yet clear. The roles of the truncated Map19 and Map44 proteins and the MASP-3 protease are currently unknown. The proteases form an interesting sub-family of proteins that clearly should be the focus of future research in order to establish their biological roles.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Proteolysis 50\u00a0years after the discovery of lysosome.",

The function of BoxA is the transfer of two electrons from NADPH to the epoxidase component BoxB. We could show recently that BoxB is a diiron enzyme, whereas here we demonstrate that BoxA harbors an FAD and two [4Fe\u20134S] clusters per protein monomer. The characterization of BoxA was hampered by severe oxygen sensitivity; the cubane [4Fe\u20134S] clusters degrade already with traces of oxygen. Interestingly, the adventitiously formed [3Fe\u20134S] centers could be reconstituted in vitro by adding Fe(II) and sulfide to retrieve the native cubane centers. BoxA is the first example of a reductase of this type that has an FAD and two bacterial ferredoxin-type [4Fe\u20134S] clusters.

Among mutations selected (T35A, R189G, Y345C, P348L, S358F, S378G, N400D, S424F, F460L, and R474H), eight occurred in the C-terminal half of Sf\u03b2gly and only two were at the active site (R189G and N400D). Tryptophan fluorescence spectra and thermal inactivation showed that the selected mutants and wild-type Sf\u03b2gly are similarly folded. Enzyme kinetics confirmed that these mutations resulted in broadening or narrowing of the preference for the substrate glycone. Structural modeling and interaction maps revealed contact pathways that connect the sites of the selected mutations through up to three interactions to the active site residues E399, W444, and E187, which are involved in substrate binding and catalysis. Interestingly, independently selected mutations (Y345C, P348L, and R189G; S424F and N400D) were placed on the same contact pathway. Moreover, (kcat/Km fucoside)/(kcat/Km glucoside) ratios showed that mutations at intermediate residues of the same contact pathway often had similar effects on substrate specificity. Finally mutations in the same contact pathway caused similar structural disturbance as evidenced by acrylamide quenching of the Sf\u03b2gly fluorescence. Based on these data, it is proposed that the effects of the selected mutations were propagated into the active site through groups of interacting residues (contact pathways) changing the Sf\u03b2gly substrate specificity.",

By gradually decreasing the ambient RH of the insulin crystal, the content of the hydration water in the crystal was quantitatively controlled. Tyrosine (Tyr) residues were very sensitive to the micro-environmental changes, and four Raman features 828\u00a0cm\u22121, 852\u00a0cm\u22121, 1174\u00a0cm\u22121 and 1206\u00a0cm\u22121 of Tyr were employed to monitor the dehydration process. Taking advantage of the ratios I852/I828 at different RH values, the mole fractions of the \u2018exposed\u2019 and \u2018buried\u2019 Tyr residues were estimated. Moreover, using the ratio I1174/I1206 as an indicator of the dehydration process, three RH regions were discriminated. This is believed to imply that different types of the hydration water were lost step by step, i.e. firstly the \u2018second-layer\u2019 and \u2018first-layer\u2019 classes, then the \u2018contact\u2019 class, and finally, the \u2018inside\u2019 class.

Together with their essential structural role, LPSs contribute to the bacterial adherence properties, as well as they are well characterized for the capability to modulate the immuno-response. In H. pylori the core oligosaccharide, one of the three main domains of LPSs, shows a peculiar structure in the branching organization of the repeating units, which displayed further variability when different strains have been compared. We present here the crystal structure of ADP-L-glycero-D-manno-heptose-6-epimerase (HP0859, rfaD), the last enzyme in the pathway that produces L-glycero-D-manno-heptose starting from sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, a crucial compound in the synthesis of the core oligosaccharide. In a recent study, a HP0859 knockout mutant has been characterized, demonstrating a severe loss of lipopolysaccharide structure and a significant reduction of adhesion levels in an infection model to AGS cells, if compared with the wild type strain, in good agreement with its enzymatic role. The crystal structure reveals that the enzyme is a homo-pentamer, and NAD is bound as a cofactor in a highly conserved pocket. The substrate-binding site of the enzyme is very similar to that of its orthologue in Escherichia coli, suggesting also a similar catalytic mechanism.",

We hypothesized that charged residues (Asp36, His38, Glu39, and Arg40), present on one loop essential for catalysis, interact with residues in or near the active site to impart these unique characteristics. Asp36 has a predominant role in the allosteric behavior, as demonstrated through the non-allosteric behavior of the D36S mutant enzyme. In contrast, a double mutant (D36E/R293K) maintained the allostery, indicating that this aspartic acid residue interacts with Arg293, previously shown to be critical in the allostery. Substitution of His38 drastically reduced the substrate inhibition, and substrate specificity of the mutant at Asp36 or His38 showed the influence of these residues to the substrate specificity. These findings confirm the importance of the loop in the enzymatic reaction mechanism and suggest the existence of conformational changes of the loop structure between open and closed states. A variety of mutations at Glu39 and Arg40 showed that these residues influence roles of the loop in the enzyme reaction. On the basis of these results and combined with observations of molecular models of this prolidase, we concluded that Asp36 and His38 interact with the residues in the active site to generate an allosteric subsite and a pseudo-S1\u2032 site, which are responsible for the allosteric behavior and substrate inhibition.",

At pH 7.0 and 25\u00a0\u00b0C, purified Ari1p catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of substrates with the following values (kcat (s\u2212\u00a01), kcat/Km (s\u2212\u00a01\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01), Km (mM)): FFA (23.3, 1.82, 12.8), HMF (4.08, 0.173, 23.6), and dl-glyceraldehyde (2.40, 0.0650, 37.0). When acting on HMF and dl-glyceraldehyde, the enzyme operates through an equilibrium ordered kinetic mechanism. In the physiological direction of the reaction, NADPH binds first and NADP+ dissociates from the enzyme last, demonstrated by kcat of HMF and dl-glyceraldehyde that are independent of [NADPH] and (KiaNADPH/kcat) that extrapolate to zero at saturating HMF or dl-glyceraldehyde concentration.

The purified recombinant enzyme EstA3 turned out to be a monomeric thermostable esterase with optimal activity at 70\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 9.5. The enzyme showed lipolytic activity towards a wide range of ester substrates including p-nitrophenyl esters and triacylglycerides, with the highest activity being observed for p-nitrophenyl caproate at 150 U/mg and for Triacetin at 126\u00a0U/mg, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EstA3 did not show homology to any identified bacterial lipolytic hydrolases. Sequence alignment showed that there was a common pentapeptide CHSMG with a cysteine replacing the first glycine in most esterase and lipase conserved motif GXSXG. The catalytic triad of EstA3 is Ser92, Asp269 and His292, which was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis. Based on the enzymatic properties and sequence alignment we concluded that the esterase EstA3 represented a novel bacterial lipolytic enzyme group and in chorological order this group was assigned as Family XIV.",

Various oligomers assembled from different amyloid proteins share common structures and epitopes. Here we present data indicating that two oligomer-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies isolated from a na\u00efve human scFv library could conformation-dependently recognize oligomers assembled from \u03b1-synuclein, amylin, insulin, A\u03b21\u201340, prion peptide 106\u2013126 and lysozyme, and fibrils from lysozyme.

However, they both promoted the aggregation of lysozyme. Nevertheless, the two scFv antibodies could attenuate the cytotoxicity of all amyloids tested. Moreover, the scFvs recognized the amyloid oligomers in all types of plaques, Lewy bodies and amylin deposits in the brain tissues of AD and PD patients and the pancreas of type 2 diabetes patients respectively, and showed that most amyloid fibril deposits were colocalized with oligomers in the tissues. Such conformation-dependent scFv antibodies may have potential application in the investigation of aggregate structures, the mechanisms of aggregation and cytotoxicity of various amyloids, and in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic reagents for many amyloidoses.",

The Escherichia coli expression system of the catalytic domain (Ala1-Thr256) was constructed, and the protein with N-terminal polyhistidine tag was purified using a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. We analyzed enzymatic properties of the recombinant catalytic domain, its variants, and the Tunicase\u00ae-derived full-length endo-1,3-\u03b2-glucanase. Substitution of Glu119 with Ala and deletion of Met123, both of the residues are located in the catalytic motif, resulted in the loss of hydrolytic activity. In comparison between the full-length enzyme and isolated catalytic domain, their hydrolytic activities for soluble substrates such as laminarin and laminarioligosaccharides were similar. In contrast, the hydrolytic activity of the full-length enzyme for insoluble substrates such as curdlan and yeast-glucan was significantly higher than that of the catalytic domain. It should be noted that the acid stabilities for the hydrolysis of laminarin were clearly different. Secondary structure analysis using circular dichroism showed that the full-length enzyme was more acid stable than was the catalytic domain, possibly because of domain interactions between the catalytic domain and the carbohydrate-binding module.",

Both enzymes showed increasing catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) towards \u03b2-1,4 manno-oligosaccharides with the degree of polymerisation (DP) from 4 to 6 and also hydrolysed konjac glucomannan, guar gum and locust bean gum galactomannans. ManC had up to two-fold higher catalytic efficiency for DP 5 and 6 manno-oligosaccharides and also higher activity than ManA towards mannans. Remarkably, ManC compared to ManA transglycosylated mannotetraose with formation of longer \u03b2-1,4 manno-oligosaccharides 8-fold more efficiently and was able to use mannotriose, melezitose and isomaltotriose out of 36 tested acceptors resulting in novel penta- and hexasaccharides, whereas ManA used only mannotriose as acceptor. ManA and ManC share 39% sequence identity and homology modelling suggesting that they have very similar substrate interactions at subsites +\u00a01 and +\u00a02 except that ManC Trp283 at subsite +\u00a01 corresponded to Ser289 in ManA. Site-directed mutagenesis to ManA S289W lowered KM for manno-oligosaccharides by 30\u201345% and increased transglycosylation yield by 50% compared to wild-type. Conversely, KM for ManC W283S was increased, the transglycosylation yield was reduced by 30\u201345% and furthermore activity towards mannans decreased below that of ManA. This first mutational analysis in subsite +\u00a01 of GH5 endo-\u03b2-1,4-mannanases indicated that Trp283 in ManC participates in discriminating between mannan substrates with different extent of branching and has a role in transglycosylation and substrate affinity.",

However, contradictory literature reports suggest that different molecular chaperones can either stimulate or prevent the formation of amyloid structures from distinct amyloidogenic proteins. In the present work, we concentrated on the effects caused by two molecular chaperonins, ovine TRiC and bacterial GroEL, on the aggregation and conformational state of ovine PrP. Both chaperonins were shown to bind native PrP and to produce amyloid-like forms of ovine PrP enriched with beta-structures but, while GroEL acted in an ATP-dependent manner, TRiC was shown to cause the same effect only in the absence of Mg-ATP (i.e. in the inactive form). In the presence of chaperonin GroEL, ovine PrP was shown to form micellar particles, approximately 100\u2013200\u00a0nm in diameter, which were observed both by dynamic light scattering assay and by electron microscopy. The content of these particles was significantly higher in the presence of Mg-ATP and, only under these conditions, GroEL produced amyloid-like species enriched with beta-structures. TRiC was shown to induce the formation of amyloid fibrils observed by electron microscopy, but only in the absence of Mg-ATP. This study suggests the important role of the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC in the propagation of amyloid structures in vivo during the development of amyloid diseases and the possible role of the bacterial chaperonin GroEL, located in the intestinal microflora, in the induction of these diseases.",

Ligand-binding stimulates proteolytic cleavage of the trans-membrane domain, releasing an active intracellular domain (ICD) that translocates to the nucleus and impacts transcription. In transit, the ICD may interact with regulatory proteins that modulate the expression and transcriptional activity. We have found that Notch4ICD expression is enhanced in the tubule cells of fibrotic kidneys from diabetic mice and humans and identified Notch4ICD interacting proteins that could be pertinent to normal and pathological functions. Using proteomic techniques, several components of the Elongin C complex were identified as candidate Notch4ICD interactors. Elongin C complexes can function as ubiquitin ligases capable of regulating proteasomal degradation of specific protein substrates. Our studies indicate that ectopic Elongin C expression stimulates Notch4ICD degradation and inhibits its transcriptional activity in human kidney tubule HK11 cells. Blocking Elongin C mediated degradation by MG132 indicates the potential for ubiquitin-mediated Elongin C regulation of Notch4ICD. Functional interaction of Notch4ICD and Elongin C provides novel insight into regulation of Notch signaling in epithelial cell biology and disease.",

Aiming to produce the recombinant protein, we obtained jbure-IIb, with different 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends, encoding a 90\u00a0kDa urease. Three peptides unique to the JBURE-II/-IIb protein were detected by mass spectrometry in seed extracts, indicating that jbure-II/-IIb is a functional gene. Comparative modeling indicates that JBURE-IIb urease has an overall shape almost identical to C. ensiformis major urease JBURE-I with all residues critical for urease activity. The cDNA was cloned into the pET101 vector and the recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli. The JBURE-IIb protein, although enzymatically inactive presumably due to the absence of Ni atoms in its active site, impaired the growth of a phytopathogenic fungus and showed entomotoxic properties, inhibiting diuresis of Rhodnius prolixus isolated Malpighian tubules, in concentrations similar to those reported for JBURE-I and canatoxin.

The expression time was much shorter, and the final yield of GLuc-C9D was significantly higher than with our previous pCold expression system.

Among different hypotheses proposed for AD one of the most corroborated is the \u201coxidative stress hypothesis\u201d. Although recent studies extensively demonstrated the specific oxidative modification of selected proteins in the brain of AD patients and how their dysfunction possibly correlates with the pathology, there is still an urgent need to extend these findings to peripheral tissue. So far very few studies showed oxidative damage of proteins in peripheral tissues and current findings need to be replicated. Another limit in AD research is represented by the lack of highly specific diagnostic tools for early diagnosis. For a full screening and early diagnosis, biomarkers easily detectable in biological samples, such as blood, are needed. The search of reliable biomarkers for AD in peripheral blood is a great challenge. A few studies described a set of plasma markers that differentiated AD from controls and were shown to be useful in predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment, which is considered a prodromal stage, to AD. We review the current state of knowledge on peripheral oxidative biomarkers for AD, including proteomics, which might be useful for early diagnosis and prognosis.",

     "abstract": "Mycobacterium leprae is closely related to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, yet causes a very different illness. Detailed genomic comparison between these two species of mycobacteria reveals that the decaying M. leprae genome contains less than half of the M. tuberculosis functional genes. The reduction of genome size and accumulation of pseudogenes in the M. leprae genome is thought to result from multiple recombination events between related repetitive sequences, which provided the impetus to investigate the recombination-like activities of RecA protein. In this study, we have cloned, over-expressed and purified M. leprae RecA and compared its activities with that of M. tuberculosis RecA. Both proteins, despite being 91% identical at the amino acid level, exhibit strikingly different binding profiles for single-stranded DNA with varying GC contents, in the ability to catalyze the formation of D-loops and to promote DNA strand exchange. The kinetics and the extent of single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase and coprotease activities were nearly equivalent between these two recombinases. However, the degree of inhibition exerted by a range of ATP:ADP ratios was greater on strand exchange promoted by M. leprae RecA compared to its M. tuberculosis counterpart. Taken together, our results provide insights into the mechanistic aspects of homologous recombination and coprotease activity promoted by M. lepare RecA, and further suggests that it differs from the M. tuberculosis counterpart. These results are consistent with an emerging concept of DNA-sequence influenced structural differences in RecA nucleoprotein filaments and how these differences reflect on the multiple activities associated with RecA protein.",

We focused here on the highly related transcription factors of the TET sub-class: TLS/FUS, EWS and in particular the least studied member TAF15. An extensive array of immunoprecipitation studies on differentially extracted HeLa nuclei revealed the specific association of TAF15 with the spliceosomal U1 snRNP complex, as deduced by the co-precipitating U1 snRNA, U1-70\u00a0K and Sm proteins. Additionally, application of anti-U1 RNP autoantibodies identified TAF15 in the immunoprecipitates. Minor fractions of nuclear TAF15 and U1 snRNP were involved in this association. Pull-down assays using recombinant TAF15 and U1 snRNP-specific proteins (U1-70\u00a0K, U1A and U1C) provided in vitro evidence for a direct protein\u2013protein interaction between TAF15 and U1C, which required the N-terminal domain of TAF15. The ability of TAF15 to directly contact RNA, most likely RNA pol II transcripts, was supported by in vivo UV cross-linking studies in the presence of \u03b1-amanitin. By all findings, the existence of a functionally discrete subset of U1 snRNP in association with TAF15 was suggested and provided further support for the involvement of U1 snRNP components in early steps of coordinated gene expression.",

To identify strong potent inhibitors against Shigella sonnei (S. sonnei) AHAS, we cloned and characterized the catalytic subunit of S. sonnei AHAS and found two potent chemicals (KHG20612, KHG25240) that inhibit 87\u201393% S. sonnei AHAS activity at an inhibitor concentration of 100\u00a0uM. The purified S. sonnei AHAS had a size of 65\u00a0kDa on SDS-PAGE. The enzyme kinetics revealed that the enzyme has a Km of 8.01\u00a0mM and a specific activity of 0.117\u00a0U/mg. The cofactor activation constant (Ks) for ThDP and (Kc) for Mg++ were 0.01\u00a0mM and 0.18\u00a0mM, respectively. The dissociation constant (Kd) for ThDP was found to be 0.14\u00a0mM by tryptophan fluorescence quenching. The inhibition kinetics of inhibitor KHG20612 revealed an un-competitive inhibition mode with a Kii of 2.65\u00a0mM and an IC50 of 9.3\u00a0\u03bcM, whereas KHG25240 was a non-competitive inhibitor with a Kii of 5.2\u00a0mM, Kis of 1.62\u00a0mM and an IC50 of 12.1\u00a0\u03bcM.

     "abstract": "Neural- (NCAD) and epithelial- (ECAD) cadherin are calcium-dependent cell-adhesive molecules, and are localized at excitatory and inhibitory synapses respectively. They play an important role in synaptogenesis, synapse maintenance and plasticity. The extracellular region plays a critical role in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion, and has five tandemly repeated ectodomains (EC1-EC5). Calcium binding is required for dimer formation between first two N-terminal domains (EC1-EC2). Despite similarity in the primary structure, the extracellular domains of NCAD and ECAD have different intrinsic stability, dimerization affinity and kinetics of disassembly. To investigate the origin of these differences, we are characterizing the modular domains individually. Here, we report studies of NCAD2, EC2 of NCAD. This domain is important for calcium binding and is the physical linkage between the dimerization interface in EC1 and the membrane proximal modular domains. Thermal-denaturation studies show that NCAD2 is less stable than ECAD2 and less influenced by the adjoining 7-residue, N- and C-terminal linker segments. In addition the NCAD2 constructs are less influenced by added salt. This difference is likely due to variation in the overall number and distribution of charges on these anionic proteins. Our studies indicate that despite their sequence similarity and apparently passive role in adhesive dimer formation, EC2 of E- and N-cadherins are distinctly different and may contribute to the differences in energetics and kinetics of dimerization.",

     "abstract": "The human genome contains two genes encoding for two isoforms of the enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase (GNPDA, EC 3.5.99.6). Isoform 1 has been purified from several animal sources and the crystallographic structure of the human recombinant enzyme was solved at 1.75\u00a0\u00c5 resolution (PDB ID: 1NE7). In spite of their great structural similarity, human and Escherichia coli GNPDAs show marked differences in their allosteric kinetics. The allosteric site ligand, N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P), which is an activator of the K-type of E. coli GNPDA has an unusual mixed allosteric effect on hGNPDA1, behaving as a V activator and a K inhibitor (antiergistic or crossed mixed K\u2212V+ effect). In the absence of GlcNAc6P, the apparent kcat of the enzyme is so low, that GlcNAc6P behaves as an essential activator. Additionally, substrate inhibition, dependent on GlcNAc6P concentration, is observed. All these kinetic properties can be well described within the framework of the Monod allosteric model with some additional postulates. These unusual kinetic properties suggest that hGNPDA1 could be important for the maintenance of an adequate level of the pool of the UDP-GlcNAc6P, the N-acetylglucosylaminyl donor for many reactions in the cell. In this research we have also explored the possible functional significance of the C-terminal extension of hGNPDA1 enzyme, which is not present in isoform 2, by constructing and studying two mutants truncated at positions 268 and 275.",

     "abstract": "Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is of significant recent interest as a target for drugs against parasitic and opportunistic infections. Understanding factors which influence DHFR homolog inhibitor specificity is critical for the design of compounds that selectively target DHFRs from pathogenic organisms over the human homolog. This paper presents a novel approach for predicting residues involved in ligand discrimination in a protein family using DHFR as a model system. In this approach, the relationship between inhibitor specificity and amino acid composition for sets of protein homolog pairs is examined. Similar inhibitor specificity profiles correlate with increased sequence homology at specific alignment positions. Residue positions that exhibit the strongest correlations are predicted as specificity determinants. Correlation analysis requires a quantitative measure of similarity in inhibitor specificity (Slig) for a pair of homologs. To this end, a method of calculating Slig values using KI values for the two homologs against a set of inhibitors as input was developed. Correlation analysis of Slig values to amino acid sequence similarity scores \u2013 obtained via multiple sequence alignments \u2013 was performed for individual residue alignment positions and sets of residues on 13 DHFRs. Eighteen alignment positions were identified with a strong correlation of Slig to sequence similarity. Of these, three lie in the active site; four are located proximal to the active site, four are clustered together in the adenosine binding domain and five on the \u03b2F\u03b2G loop. The validity of the method is supported by agreement between experimental findings and current predictions involving active site residues.",

     "abstract": "Peroxiredoxin Q (PrxQ) isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to a family of redox enzymes called peroxiredoxins, which are thioredoxin- or glutaredoxin-dependent peroxidases acting to reduce peroxides and in particular hydrogen peroxide. PrxQ cycles between an active reduced state and an inactive oxidized state during its catalytic cycle. The catalytic mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack of the catalytic cysteine on hydrogen peroxide to generate a sulfonic acid intermediate with a concerted release of a water molecule. This intermediate is subsequently relaxed by the reaction of a second cysteine, denoted the resolving cysteine, generating an intramolecular disulfide bond and release of a second water molecule. PrxQ is recycled to the active state by a thioredoxin-dependent reduction. Previous structural studies of PrxQ homologues have provided the structural basis for the switch between reduced and oxidized conformations. Here, we have performed a detailed study of the activity, structure and dynamics of PrxQ in both the oxidized and reduced states. Reliable and experimentally validated structural models of PrxQ in both oxidation states were generated using homology based modeling. Analysis of NMR spin relaxation rates shows that PrxQ is monomeric in both oxidized and reduced states. As evident from R2 relaxation rates the reduced form of PrxQ undergoes unprecedented dynamics on the slow \u03bcs\u2013ms timescale. The ground state of this conformational dynamics is likely the stably folded reduced state as implied by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We speculate that the extensive dynamics is intimately related to the catalytic function of PrxQ.",

The transcription factor DNA replication-related element binding factor (DREF), is an 80\u00a0kDa polypeptide homodimer that plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation-related genes. Homeodomain genes encode DNA-binding proteins that play crucial roles during development by defining the body plan and determining cell fate. However, until now, the regulation of DREF function by caudal-related homeodomain proteins is poorly understood. In this study, recombinant CDX1/2 homeodomains (CDX1, amino acids [aa] 152\u2013216 and CDX2, aa 184\u2013248) and the DNA-binding domain of Drosophila DREF (dDREF; aa 1\u2013125) were isolated in order to investigate the regulatory mechanism of their interaction.

Models of the CDX1/2 homeodomain and dDREF were constructed using SWISS-MODEL software, a program for relative protein structure modeling. The binding of CDX1/2 and DREF proteins was detected by fluorescence measurement, size-exclusion column (SEC) chromatography, His-tagged pull-down assay, and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (BIAcore). In addition, we identified that four different mutants of CDX1 (S185A, N190A, T194A, and V212A) were bound to dDREF with different degrees of interaction.

The resulting variants had altered quaternary structure, as shown by analytical ultracentrifugation, gel filtration liquid chromatography, and small angle X-ray scattering, and X-ray crystallographic studies confirmed that one variant existed as an independent monomer, but with few changes to the secondary and tertiary structure. Reduction of higher order assembly resulted in a loss of thermal stability, as measured by a variety of methods, and impaired catalytic function. Binding of pyruvate increased the oligomeric status of the variants, with a concomitant increase in thermal stability, suggesting a role for substrate binding in optimizing stable, higher order structures. The results of this work show that the salt bridges located at the tetramerization interface of DHDPS play a significant role in maintaining higher order structures, and demonstrate the importance of quaternary structure in determining protein stability and in the optimization of enzyme catalysis.",

In this study, we estimated the ionizable groups involved in its catalytic mechanism by thermodynamic analysis. pKa of side chains of L-Asp, L-Glu, L-His, L-Cys, L-Tyr, L-Lys, and L-Arg at 25\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C were determined by the pH titration of amino-acid solutions, from which their enthalpy changes, \u2206H\u00b0, of deprotonation were calculated. pKe1 and pKe2 of MMP-7 at 15\u201345\u00a0\u00b0C were determined in the hydrolysis of (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-L-Pro-L-Leu-Gly-L-Leu-[N3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl]-L-Ala-L-Arg-NH2, from which \u2206Ho for pKe1 and pKe2 was calculated.

The mutation of the active-site residue Glu198 into Ala completely abolished the activity, suggesting that Glu198 is the ionizable group for pKe1.

A related enzyme, IDO2 has recently been described. We report the first purification and kinetic characterization of human IDO2 using a facile l-tryptophan consumption assay amenable to high throughput screening. We found that the Km of human IDO2 for l-tryptophan is much higher than that of IDO1. We also describe the identification and characterization of a new IDO1 inhibitor compound, Amg-1, by high throughput screening, and compare the inhibition profiles of IDO1 and IDO2 with Amg-1 and previously described compounds. Our data indicate that human IDO1 and IDO2 have different kinetic parameters and different inhibition profiles.

     "abstract": "Thrombin helps to activate Factor XIII (FXIII) by hydrolyzing the R37-G38 peptide bond. The resultant transglutaminase introduces cross-links into the fibrin clot. With the development of therapeutic coagulation factors, there is a need to better understand interactions involving FXIII. Such knowledge will help predict ability to activate FXIII and thus ability to promote/hinder the generation of transglutaminase activity. Kinetic parameters have been determined for a series of thrombin species hydrolyzing the FXIII (28\u201341) V34X activation peptides (V34, V34L, V34F, and V34P). The V34P substitution introduces PAR4 character into the FXIII, and the V34F exhibits important similarities to the cardioprotective V34L. FXIII activation peptides containing V34, V34L, or V34P could each be accommodated by alanine mutants of thrombin lacking either the W60d or Y60a residue in the 60-insertion loop. By contrast, FXIII V34F AP could be cleaved by thrombin W60dA but not by Y60aA. FXIII V34P is highly reliant on the thrombin W215 platform for its strong substrate properties whereas FXIII V34F AP becomes the first segment that can maintain its Km upon loss of the critical thrombin W215 residue. Interestingly, FXIII V34F AP could also be readily accommodated by thrombin L99A and E217A. Hydrolysis of FXIII V34F AP by thrombin W217A/E217A (WE) was similar to that of FXIII V34L AP whereas WE could not effectively cleave FXIII V34P AP. FXIII V34F and V34P AP show promise for designing FXIII activation systems that are either tolerant of or greatly hindered by the presence of anticoagulant thrombins.",

The roles of apoplastic proteins in pollen germination and in pollen tube growth are comparatively less well understood. To investigate the functions of apoplastic proteins in pollen germination, the global apoplastic proteins of mature and germinated Arabidopsis thaliana pollen grains were prepared for differential analyses by using 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) saturation labeling techniques. One hundred and three proteins differentially expressed (p value\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01) in pollen germinated for 6\u00a0h compared with un-germination mature pollen, and 98 spots, which represented 71 proteins, were identified by LC\u2013MS/MS. By bioinformatics analysis, 50 proteins were identified as secreted proteins. These proteins were mainly involved in cell wall modification and remodeling, protein metabolism and signal transduction. Three of the differentially expressed proteins were randomly selected to determine their subcellular localizations by transiently expressing YFP fusion proteins. The results of subcellular localization were identical with the bioinformatics prediction. Based on these data, we proposed a model for apoplastic proteins functioning in pollen germination and pollen tube growth. These results will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of pollen germination and pollen tube growth.",

The catalytic constants of aromatic monoamines and o-diamines were both low, these results are consistent with our previous mechanism in which the slow step is the transfer of a proton by a hydroxyl to the peroxide in oxy-tyrosinase (Fenoll et al., Biochem. J. 380 (2004) 643\u2013650). In the case of o-aminophenols, the hydroxyl group indirectly cooperates in the transfer of the proton and consequently the catalytic constants in the action of tyrosinase on these compounds are higher. In the case of aromatic monoamines, the Michaelis constants are of the same order of magnitude than for monophenols, which suggests that the monophenols bind better (higher binding constant) to the enzyme to facilitate the \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions between the aromatic ring and a possible histidine of the active site. In the case of aromatic o-diamines, both the catalytic and Michaelis constants are low, the values of the catalytic constants being lower than those of the corresponding o-diphenols. The values of the Michaelis constants of the aromatic o-diamines are slightly lower than those of their corresponding o-diphenols, confirming that the aromatic o-diamines bind less well (lower binding constant) to the enzyme.",

Additionally, water equilibrium sorption isotherm (ESI) measurements were performed at room temperature. The crystallization and melting events were studied by DSC and the amount of uncrystallized water was calculated by the enthalpy of melting during heating. The glass transition of the system was detected by DSC for water contents higher than the critical water content corresponding to the formation of the first sorption layer of water molecules directly bound to primary hydration sites, namely 0.073 (grams of water per grams of dry protein), estimated by ESI. A strong plasticization of the Tg was observed by DSC for hydration levels lower than those necessary for crystallization of water during cooling, i.e. lower than about 0.3 (grams of water per grams of hydrated protein) followed by a stabilization of Tg at about \u2212\u00a080\u00a0\u00b0C for higher water contents. The \u03b1 relaxation associated with the glass transition was also observed in dielectric measurements.

The IET kinetics in neuronal and inducible NOS (nNOS and iNOS) holoenzymes have been previously determined in our laboratories by laser flash photolysis [reviewed in: C.J. Feng, G. Tollin, Dalton Trans., (2009) 6692\u20136700]. Here we report the kinetics of the IET in a bovine endothelial NOS (eNOS) holoenzyme in the presence and absence of added calmodulin (CaM). The IET rate constant in the presence of CaM is estimated to be ~\u00a04.3\u00a0s\u22121. No IET was observed in the absence of CaM, indicating that CaM is the primary factor in controlling the FMN\u00a0\u2212\u00a0heme IET in the eNOS enzyme. The IET rate constant value for the eNOS holoenzyme is approximately 10 times smaller than those obtained for the iNOS and CaM-bound nNOS holoenzymes. Possible mechanisms underlying the difference in IET kinetics among the NOS isoforms are discussed. Because the rate-limiting step in the IET process in these enzymes is the conformational change from input state to output state, a slower conformational change (than in the other isoforms) is most likely to cause the slower IET in eNOS.",

Protein with and without C93-Y157 crosslink migrates as distinct bands in SDS-PAGE, allowing quantification of the relative ratios between the two forms by densitometry of the respective bands. Expression of recombinant rat wild type CDO in Escherichia coli typically produces 40\u201350% with the C93-Y157 crosslink. A strategy was developed to increase the ratio of the non-crosslinked form in an enzyme preparation of reasonable quantity and purity, allowing direct assessment of the activity of non-crosslinked CDO and mechanism of formation of the crosslink. The presence of ferrous iron and oxygen is a prerequisite for C93-Y157 crosslink formation. Absence of oxygen during protein expression increased the fraction of non-crosslinked CDO, while presence of the metal chelator EDTA had little effect. Metal affinity chromatography was used to enrich non-crosslinked content. Both the enzymatic rate of cysteine oxidation and the amount of cross-linking between C93 and Y157 increased significantly upon exposure of CDO to air/oxygen and substrate cysteine in the presence of iron in a hitherto unreported two-phase process. The instantaneous activity was proportional to the amount of crosslinked enzyme present, demonstrating that the non-crosslinked form has negligible enzymatic activity. The biphasic kinetics suggest the existence of an as yet uncharacterised intermediate in crosslink formation and enzyme activation.",

The wide variety of reactions catalyzed by PLP enzymes is enabled by the ability of the covalent aldimine intermediate formed between substrate and PLP to stabilize carbanionic intermediates at C\u03b1 of the substrate. This review attempts to summarize the mechanisms by which reaction specificity can be achieved in PLP enzymes by focusing on three aspects of these reactions: stereoelectronic effects, protonation state of the external aldimine intermediate, and interaction of the carbanionic intermediate with the protein side chains present in the active site.

The high reactivity of the DPL-stabilized glycyl carbanion towards nucleophilic addition to both DPL and the glycine-DPL iminium ion favors the formation of Claisen condensation products at enzyme active sites. The formation of the iminium ion between glycine and DPL is accompanied by a 12-unit decrease in the pKa of 29 for glycine. The complicated effects of formation of glycine iminium ions to DPL and other aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and ketones on carbon acid pKa are discussed. These data provide insight into the contribution of the individual pyridine ring substituents to the catalytic efficiency of DPL. It is suggested that the 5\u2032-phosphodianion group of PLP may play an important role in enzymatic catalysis of carbon deprotonation by providing up to 12\u00a0kcal/mol of binding energy that is utilized to stabilize the transition state for the enzymatic reaction.

We have established hydrogen bond correlations that allow one to estimate hydrogen bond geometries from 15N chemical shifts. It is shown that protonation of the pyridine ring of PLP in aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) is achieved by (i) an intermolecular OHN hydrogen bond with an aspartate residue, assisted by the imidazole group of a histidine side chain and (ii) a local polarity as found for related model systems in a polar organic solvent exhibiting a dielectric constant of about 30. Model studies indicate that protonation of the pyridine ring of PLP leads to a dominance of the ketoenamine form, where the intramolecular OHN hydrogen bond of PLP exhibits a zwitterionic state. Thus, the PLP moiety in AspAT carries a net positive charge considered as a pre-requisite to initiate the enzyme reaction. However, it is shown that the ketoenamine form dominates in the absence of ring protonation when PLP is solvated by polar groups such as water. Finally, the differences between acid\u2013base interactions in aqueous solution and in the interior of proteins are discussed.

Solvent effects lower the free energy of the O-protonated PLP tautomer both in aqueous solution and in the active site, resulting a free energy difference of about \u2212\u00a01\u00a0kcal/mol relative to the N-protonated Schiff base in the enzyme. The external aldimine provides the dominant contribution to lowering the free energy barrier for the spontaneous decarboxylation of l-dopa in water, by a remarkable 16\u00a0kcal/mol, while the enzyme l-dopa decarboxylase further lowers the barrier by 8\u00a0kcal/mol. Kinetic isotope effects were also determined using a path integral free energy perturbation theory on the primary 13C and the secondary 2H substitutions. In the case of alanine racemase, if the pyridine ring is unprotonated as that in the active site, there is destabilizing contribution to the formation of the \u03b1-carbanion in the gas phase, although when the pyridine ring is protonated the contribution is stabilizing. In aqueous solution and in alanine racemase, the \u03b1-carbanion is stabilized both when the pyridine ring is protonated and unprotonated.

Changes in the 5\u2032-phosphate chemical shift can be used to determine changes in tightness of binding of the phosphate as the reaction pathway is traversed, providing information on the dynamics of the enzyme. 31P NMR spectroscopy is thus an important probe of structure, dynamics and mechanism in native and site-directed mutations of PLP-dependent enzymes. Examples of all of the above are provided in this review. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Pyridoxal Phospate Enzymology.",

     "abstract": "The four last steps of biotin biosynthesis, starting from pimeloyl-CoA, are conserved among all the biotin-producing microorganisms. Two enzymes of this pathway, the 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS) and the 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid aminotransferase (DAPA AT) are dependent on pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate (PLP). This review summarizes our current understanding of the structure, reaction mechanism and inhibition on these two interesting enzymes. Mechanistic studies as well as the determination of the crystal structure of AONS have revealed a complex mechanism involving an acylation with inversion of configuration and a decarboxylation with retention of configuration. This reaction mechanism is shared by the homologous 5-aminolevulinate synthase and serine palmitoyltransferase. While the reaction catalyzed by DAPA AT is a classical PLP-dependent transamination, the inactivation of this enzyme by amiclenomycin, a natural antibiotic that is active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, involves the irreversible formation of an adduct between PLP and amiclenomycin. Mechanistic and structural studies allowed the complete description of this unique inactivation mechanism. Several potent inhibitors of these two PLP-dependent enzymes have been prepared and might be useful as starting points for the design of herbicides or antibiotics.

     "abstract": "Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) is an obligatory cofactor for the homodimeric mitochondrial enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS), which controls metabolic flux into the porphyrin biosynthetic pathway in animals, fungi, and the \u03b1-subclass of proteobacteria. Recent work has provided an explanation for how this enzyme can utilize PLP to catalyze the mechanistically unusual cleavage of not one but two substrate amino acid \u03b1-carbon bonds, without violating the theory of stereoelectronic control of PLP reaction-type specificity. Ironically, the complex chemistry is kinetically insignificant, and it is the movement of an active site loop that defines kcat and ultimately, the rate of porphyrin biosynthesis. The kinetic behavior of the enzyme is consistent with an equilibrium ordered induced-fit mechanism wherein glycine must bind first and a portion of the intrinsic binding energy with succinyl-Coenzyme A is then utilized to perturb the enzyme conformational equilibrium towards a closed state wherein catalysis occurs. Return to the open conformation, coincident with ALA dissociation, is the slowest step of the reaction cycle. A diverse variety of loop mutations have been associated with hyperactivity, suggesting the enzyme has evolved to be purposefully slow, perhaps as a means to allow for rapid up-regulation of activity in response to an as yet undiscovered allosteric type effector. Recently it was discovered that human erythroid ALAS mutations can be associated with two very different diseases. Mutations that down-regulate activity can lead to X-linked sideroblastic anemia, which is characterized by abnormally high iron levels in mitochondria, while mutations that up-regulate activity are associated with X-linked dominant protoporphyria, which in contrast is phenotypically identified by abnormally high porphyrin levels.

     "abstract": "The kynurenine pathway is the major route for tryptophan catabolism in animals and some fungi and bacteria. The procaryotic enzyme preferentially reacts with l-kynurenine, while eucaryotic kynureninases exhibit higher activity with 3-hydroxy-l-kynurenine. Crystallography of kynureninases from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfKyn) and Homo sapiens (HsKyn) shows that the active sites are nearly identical, except that His-102, Asn-333, and Ser-332 in HsKyn are replaced by Trp-64, Thr-282, and Gly-281 in PfKyn. Site-directed mutagenesis of HsKyn shows that these residues are, at least in part, responsible for the differences in substrate specificity since the H102W/S332G/N333T triple mutant shows activity with kynurenine but not 3-hydroxykynurenine. PfKyn is strongly inhibited by analogs of a proposed gem-diolate intermediate, dihydrokynurenine, and S-(2-aminophenyl)-l-cysteine S,S-dioxide, with Ki values in the low nanomolar range. Stopped-flow kinetic experiments show that a transient quinonoid intermediate is formed on mixing, which decays to a ketimine at 740\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01. Quench experiments show that anthranilate, the first product, is formed in a stoichiometric burst at 50\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 and thus the rate-determining step in the steady-state is the release of the second product, l-Ala. \u03b2-Benzoylalanine is also a good substrate for PfKyn but does not show a burst of benzoate formation, indicating that the rate-determining step for this substrate is benzoate release. A Hammett plot of rate constants for substituted \u03b2-benzoylalanines is non-linear, suggesting that carbonyl hydration is rate-determining for electron-donating groups, but C\u03b2\u2013C\u03b3 cleavage is rate-determining for electron-withdrawing groups.

Free radical forms of the substrates are created upon H atom abstractions carried out by the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical. In most of these enzymes, the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical is generated by an iron\u2013sulfur cluster-mediated reductive cleavage of S-adenosyl-(S)-methionine. However, in lysine 5,6-aminomutase and ornithine 4,5-aminomutase, the radical is generated by homolytic cleavage of the cobalt\u2013carbon bond of adenosylcobalamin. The imine linkages in the initial radical forms of the external aldimines undergo radical addition to form azacyclopropylcarbinyl radicals as central intermediates in the catalytic cycles. In the case of lysine 2,3-aminomutase, the multistep catalytic mechanism is corroborated by direct spectroscopic observation and characterization of a product radical trapped during steady-state turnover. Analogues of the substrate-related radical having substituents adjacent to the radical center to stabilize the unpaired electron are also observed and characterized spectroscopically. A functional allylic analogue of the 5\u2032-deoxyadenosyl radical is observed spectroscopically. A high-resolution crystal structure fully supports the mechanistic proposals.

Synthesis of d-serine is carried out by serine racemase (SR), a pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate-dependent enzyme. In addition to carry out racemization, SR \u03b1,\u03b2-eliminates water from l- or d-serine, generating pyruvate and NH4+. Here I review the main mechanisms regulating SR activity and d-serine dynamics in the brain. I propose a role for SR in a novel form of astrocyte-neuron communication\u2014the \u201cserine shuttle\u201d, whereby astrocytes synthesize and export l-serine required for the synthesis of d-serine by the predominantly neuronal SR. d-Serine synthesized and released by neurons can be further taken up by astrocytes for storage and activity-dependent release. I discuss how SR \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination with d-serine itself may limit the achievable intracellular d-serine concentration, providing a mechanistic rationale on why neurons do not store as much d-serine as astrocytes. The higher content of d-serine in astrocytes appears to be related to increased d-serine stability, for their low SR expression will prevent substantial d-serine metabolism via \u03b1,\u03b2-elimination. SR and the serine shuttle pathway are therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative diseases in which NMDA receptor dysfunction plays pathological roles.

The data have been correlated with previous clinical and cell biology results, which allow us to (i) highlight the functional differences between AGT-Ma and AGT-Mi, (ii) identify the structural and functional molecular defects of the pathogenic variants, (iii) improve the correlation between the genotype and the enzymatic phenotype, (iv) foresee or understand the molecular basis of the responsiveness to pyridoxine treatment of patients bearing these mutations, and (v) pave the way for new treatment strategies.

Pyridoxal phosphate is biosynthesized de novo by two different pathways (the DXP dependent pathway and the R5P pathway) and can also be salvaged from the environment. It is one of the few cofactors whose catabolic pathway has been comprehensively characterized. It is also known to function as a singlet oxygen scavenger and has protective effects against oxidative stress in fungi. Enzymes utilizing vitamin B6 are important targets for therapeutic agents.

     "abstract": "Vitamin B6 is a generic term referring to pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal and their related phosphorylated forms. Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate is the catalytically active form of vitamin B6, and acts as cofactor in more than 140 different enzyme reactions. In animals, pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate is recycled from food and from degraded B6-enzymes in a \u201csalvage pathway\u201d, which essentially involves two ubiquitous enzymes: an ATP-dependent pyridoxal kinase and an FMN-dependent pyridoxine 5\u2032-phosphate oxidase. Once it is made, pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate is targeted to the dozens of different apo-B6 enzymes that are being synthesized in the cell. The mechanism and regulation of the salvage pathway and the mechanism of addition of pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate to the apo-B6-enzymes are poorly understood and represent a very challenging research field. Pyridoxal kinase and pyridoxine 5\u2032-phosphate oxidase play kinetic roles in regulating the level of pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate formation. Deficiency of pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate due to inborn defects of these enzymes seems to be involved in several neurological pathologies. In addition, inhibition of pyridoxal kinase activity by several pharmaceutical and natural compounds is known to lead to pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate deficiency. Understanding the exact role of vitamin B6 in these pathologies requires a better knowledge on the metabolism and homeostasis of the vitamin. This article summarizes the current knowledge on structural, kinetic and regulation features of the two enzymes involved in the PLP salvage pathway. We also discuss the proposal that newly formed PLP may be transferred from either enzyme to apo-B6-enzymes by direct channeling, an efficient, exclusive, and protected means of delivery of the highly reactive PLP. This new perspective may lead to novel and interesting findings, as well as serve as a model system for the study of macromolecular channeling.

The appKm values for taurocyamine of the K69A, T70A and V71A mutants were significantly increased as compared with wild-type, suggesting that these residues are associated with taurocyamine binding. Of special interest is a property of V71A mutant: its catalytic efficiency for glycocyamine was twice that for taurocyamine, indicating that the V71A mutant acts like a glycocyamine kinase, rather than a TK. The role of the amino acid residue K95 of Arenicola MiTK was also examined. K95 was replaced with R, H, Y, I, A and E. K95R, K95H and K95I have a 3-fold higher affinity for taurocyamine, and activity was largely lost in K95E. On the other hand, the K95Y mutant showed a rather unique feature; namely, an increase in substrate concentration caused a decrease in initial velocity of the reaction (substrate inhibition). This is the first report on the key amino acid residues responsible for taurocyamine binding in mitochondrial TK.",

HACL1 is imported into peroxisomes via the PEX5/PTS1 pathway, and so far, it is the only known peroxisomal TPP-dependent enzyme in mammals. In this study, the effect of mutations in the TPP-binding domain of HACL1 on enzyme activity, subcellular localisation and oligomerisation was investigated. Mutations of the aspartate 455 and serine 456 residues within the TPP binding domain of the human HACL1 did not affect the targeting upon expression in transfected CHO cells, although enzyme activity was abolished. Gel filtration of native and mutated N-His6-fusions, expressed in yeast, revealed that the mutations did not influence the oligomerisation of the (apo)enzyme. Subcellular fractionation of yeast cells expressing HACL1 showed that the lyase activity sedimented at high density in a Nycodenz gradient. In these fractions TPP could be measured, but not when mutated HACL1 was expressed, although the recombinant enzyme was still targeted to peroxisomes. These findings indicate that the binding of TPP is not required for peroxisomal targeting and correct folding of HACL1, in contrast to other TPP-dependent enzymes, and suggest that transport of TPP into peroxisomes is dependent on HACL1 import, without requirement of a specific solute transporter.",

     "abstract": "Elevated homocysteine levels are resulting in N-homocysteinylation of lysyl residues in proteins and they correlate with a number of human pathologies. However, the role of homocysteinylation of lysyl residues is still poorly known. In order to study the features of homocysteinylation of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUP) bovine caseins were used as a model. \u03b1S1-, \u03b2- and \u03ba-caseins, showing different aggregations and micelle formation, were modified with homocysteine-thiolactone and their physico-chemical properties were studied. Efficiency of homocysteine incorporation was estimated to be about 1.5, 2.1 and 1.3 homocysteyl residues per one \u03b2-, \u03b1S1-, and \u03ba-casein molecule, respectively. Use of intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescent markers such as Trp, thioflavin T and ANS, reveal structural changes of casein structures after homocysteinylation reflected by an increase in beta-sheet content, which in some cases may be characteristic of amyloid-like transformations. CD spectra also show an increase in beta-sheet content of homocysteinylated caseins. Casein homocysteinylation leads in all cases to aggregation. The sizes of aggregates and aggregation rates were dependent on homocysteine thiolactone concentration and temperature. DLS and microscopic studies have revealed the formation of large aggregates of about 1\u20133\u00a0\u03bcm. Homocysteinylation of \u03b1S1- and \u03b2-caseins results in formation of regular spheres. Homocysteinylated \u03ba-casein forms thin unbranched fibrils about 400\u2013800\u00a0nm long. In case of \u03ba-casein amyloidogenic effect of homocysteinylation was confirmed by Congo red spectra. Taken together, data indicate that N-homocysteinylation provokes significant changes in properties of native caseins. A comparison of amyloidogenic transformation of 3 different casein types, belonging to the IUP protein family, shows that the efficiency of amyloidogenic transformation upon homocysteinylation depends on micellization capacity, additional disulphide bonds and other structural features.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed in long-lived dermal proteins such as collagen, and that their formation is related to skin aging. To examine the distribution of AGEs in skin tissue, we performed immunofluorescence studies on the human skin using an anti-AGEs antibody. Interestingly, AGEs signals were observed not only in the dermis but also in the epidermis. The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of N\u03b5-(Carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), an AGE structure, in the epidermis and to characterize the CML-modified proteins. The presence of CML in the stratum corneum (SC) was examined using liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Concordance between the retention times of a compound in the SC hydrolysate and authentic CML, as well as with the specific mass transition of CML, was detected. This result showed that CML is present in the epidermis. In order to characterize the CML-modified proteins in the epidermis, protein samples extracted from the SC were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by an amino acid sequence analysis. The clarified peptide sequences covered approximately 27% of the amino acid sequences of cytokeratin 10 (K10). In the immunoblotting experiment following the two-dimensional electrophoresis, where protein samples extracted from whole epidermis were used, the position of the major CML-positive spots corresponded to those of K10. Taken together these results showed that CML is present in the human epidermis, and suggest that K10 is one of the target molecules for CML modification in the epidermis.",

     "abstract": "The structural basis of the extreme pH dependence of oxygen binding to Root effect Hbs is a long-standing puzzle in the field of protein chemistry. A previously unappreciated role of steric factors in the Root effect was revealed by a comparison of pH effects on oxygenation and oxidation processes in human Hb relative to Spot (Leiostomus xanthurus) and Carp (Cyprinodon carpio) Hbs. The Root effect confers five-fold increased pH sensitivity to oxygenation of Spot and Carp Hbs relative to Hb A0 in the absence of anionic effectors, and even larger relative elevations of pH sensitivity of oxygenation in the presence of 0.2\u00a0M phosphate. Remarkably, the Root effect was not evident in the oxidation of the Root effect Hbs. This finding rules out pH-dependent alterations in the thermodynamic properties of the heme iron, measured in the anaerobic oxidation reaction, as the basis of the Root effect. The alternative explanation supported by these results is that the elevated pH sensitivity of oxygenation of Root effect Hbs is attributable to globin-dependent steric effects that alter oxygen affinity by constraining conformational fluidity, but which have little influence on electron exchange via the heme edge. This elegant mode of allosteric control can regulate oxygen affinity within a given quaternary state, in addition to modifying the T\u2013R equilibrium. Evolution of Hb sequences that result in proton-linked steric barriers to heme oxygenation could provide a general mechanism to account for the appearance of the Root effect in the structurally diverse Hbs of many species.",

During retroviral maturation, the CA protein undergoes structural changes and forms exclusive intermolecular interfaces in the mature capsid shell, different from those in the immature precursor. The most conserved region of CA, the major homology region (MHR), is located in the C-terminal domain of CA (CTD). The MHR is involved in both immature and mature virus assembly; however, its exact function during both assembly stages is unknown. To test its conformational preferences and to provide clues on its role during CA assembly, we have used a minimalist approach by designing a peptide comprising the whole MHR (MHRpep, residues Asp152 to Ala174). Isolated MHRpep is mainly unfolded in aqueous solution, with residual structure at its C terminus. MHRpep binds to monomeric CTD with an affinity of ~\u00a030\u00a0\u03bcM (as shown by fluorescence and ITC); the CTD binding region comprises residues belonging to \u03b1-helices 10 and 11.

Metal analyses showed that the purified enzyme only contains two equivalent of zinc per monomer, corresponding to the metal ions responsible for catalytic activity. When these metals were removed by EDTA treatment, the complex dissociated into the same dimeric species as those observed at high pH.

     "abstract": "It is generally accepted that spongiform encephalopathies result from the aggregation into amyloid of a ubiquitous protein, the so-called prion protein. As a consequence, the dynamics of amyloid formation should explain the characteristics of the prion diseases: infectivity as well as sporadic and genetic occurrence, long incubation time, species barriers and strain specificities. The success of this amyloid hypothesis is due to the good qualitative agreement of this hypothesis with the observations. However, a number of difficulties appeared when comparing quantitatively the in vitro experimental results with the theoretical models, suggesting that some differences should hide important discrepancies. We used well defined quantitative models to analyze the experimental results obtained by in vitro polymerization of the recombinant hamster prion protein. Although the dynamics of polymerization resembles a simple nucleus-dependent fibrillogenesis, neither the initial concentration dependence nor off-pathway hypothesis fit with experimental results. Furthermore, seeded polymerization starts after a long time delay suggesting the existence of a specific mechanism that takes place before nucleus formation. On the other hand, polymerization dynamics reveals a highly stochastic mechanism, the origin of which appears to be caused by nucleation heterogeneity. Moreover, the specific structures generated during nucleation are maintained during successive seeding although a clear improvement of the dynamics parameters (polymerization rate and lag time) is observed. We propose that an additional on-pathway reaction takes place before nucleation and it is responsible for the heterogeneity of structures produced during prion protein polymerization in vitro. These amyloid structures behave like prion strains. A model is proposed to explain the genesis of heterogeneity among prion amyloid.",

Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase is a convenient enzyme system for studying mechanisms and kinetics of enzyme deactivation, refolding, and denaturation caused by various external factors, physical or chemical by nature. In this report we present a study of luciferase deactivation caused by increased temperature (i.e., thermal deactivation). We found that deactivation occurs through a reversible intermediate state and can be described by a Transient model that includes active and reversibly inactive states. The model can be used as a general framework for analysis of complex, multiexponential transient kinetics that can be observed for some enzymes by reaction progression assays. In this study the Transient model has been used to develop an analytical model for studying a time course of luciferase deactivation. The model might be applicable toward enzymes in general and can be used to determine if the enzyme exposed to external factors, physical or chemical by nature, undergoes structural transformation consistent with thermal mechanisms of deactivation.",

Several of the known non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors (NNIs) identified by screening approaches show limitations in the coverage of all six major HCV genotypes (GTs). Genotypic profiling therefore has to be implemented early in the screening cascade to discover new broadly active NNIs. This implies knowledge of the specific individual biochemical properties of polymerases from all GTs which is to date limited to GT 1 only. This work gives a comprehensive overview of the biochemical properties of HCV polymerases derived from all major GTs 1\u20136. Biochemical analysis of polymerases from 38 individual sequences revealed that the optima for monovalent cations, pH and temperature were similar between the GTs, whereas significant differences concerning concentration of the preferred cofactor Mg2+ were identified. Implementing the optimal requirements for the polymerases from each individual GT led to significant improvements in their enzymatic activities. However, the specific activity was distributed unequally across the GTs and could be ranked in the following descending order: 1b, 6a\u00a0>\u00a02a, 3a, 4a, 5a\u00a0>\u00a01a.

     "abstract": "We investigated the enzymatic properties of a serralysin-type metalloenzyme, provisionally named as protease B, which is secreted by Xenorhabdus bacterium, and probably is the ortholog of PrA peptidase of Photorhabdus bacterium. Testing the activity on twenty-two oligopeptide substrates we found that protease B requires at least three amino acids N-terminal to the scissile bond for detectable hydrolysis. On such substrate protease B was clearly specific for positively charged residues (Arg and Lys) at the P1 substrate position and was rather permissive in the others. Interestingly however, it preferred Ser at P1 in the oligopeptide substrate which contained amino acids also C-terminal to the scissile bond, and was cleaved with the highest kcat/KM value. The pH profile of activity, similarly to other serralysins, has a wide peak with high values between pH 6.5 and 8.0. The activity was slightly increased by Cu2+ and Co2+ ions, it was not sensitive for serine protease inhibitors, but it was inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline, features shared by many Zn-metalloproteases. At the same time, EDTA inhibited the activity only partially even either after long incubation or in excess amount, and Zn2+ was inhibitory (both are unusual among serralysins). The 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited activity could be restored with the addition of Mn2+, Cu2+ and Co2+ up to 90\u2013200% of its original value, while Zn2+ was inefficient. We propose that both the Zn inhibition of protease B activity and its resistance to EDTA inhibition might be caused by an Asp in position 191 where most of the serralysins contain Asn.",

However, the mechanism of SFN-induced cell death in human hepatic cancer cells is still not well understood. The aim of the present work is to explore the possible mechanisms of SFN-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells using proteomic analysis. A two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE)-based-proteomic analysis was employed for identification of possible target-related proteins of SFN-induced apoptosis. Among eleven proteins identified as regulated, we focused on the down-regulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase4 (PFKFB4) protein, which has been known as a key modulator of glycolysis. We also showed that SFN down-regulated the expression of the transcriptional factor, hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which strongly regulates PFKFB4 expression. In order to obtain a broad understanding of the correlation of HIF-1\u03b1 and SFN, we observed the inhibition of the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinases, regulators of HIF-1\u03b1 activity. Our findings suggest that SFN is a potent inducer of apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via PFKFB4-inhibition pathways. HIF-1 pathway inhibition may be mediated by the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases.",

These features make this enzyme an effective activator of a pro-drug\u2014an application that has been actively pursued for a variety of therapeutic strategies. The catalytic mechanism of this enzyme is governed by a conserved histidine that coordinates a magnesium ion at the active site. Despite substantial structural and biochemical information on NDK, the mechanistic feature of the phospho-transfer that leads to auto-phosphorylation remains unclear. While the role of the histidine residue is well documented, the other active site residues, in particular the conserved serine remains poorly characterized. Studies on some homologues suggest no role for the serine residue at the active site, while others suggest a crucial role for this serine in the regulation and quaternary association of this enzyme in some species. Here we report the biochemical features of the Staphylococcus aureus NDK and the mutant enzymes. We also describe the crystal structures of the apo-NDK, as a transition state mimic with vanadate and in complex with different nucleotide substrates. These structures formed the basis for molecular dynamics simulations to understand the broad substrate specificity of this enzyme and the role of active site residues in the phospho-transfer mechanism and oligomerization. Put together, these data suggest that concerted changes in the conformation of specific residues facilitate the stabilization of nucleotide complexes thereby enabling the steps involved in the ping-pong reaction mechanism without large changes to the overall structure of this enzyme.",

These enzymes, characterized by 50% amino acid sequence identity, show non-common features of thermophilicity and thermostability and are stabilized by intramolecular disulfide bonds. PfPNP is highly specific for 6-oxopurine nucleosides while PfMTAP is characterized by a broad substrate specificity with 6-aminopurine nucleosides as preferred substrates. Amino acid sequence comparison clearly shows that the hypothetical active sites of PfPNP and PfMTAP are almost identical and that, in analogy with human 5\u2032-deoxy-5\u2032-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase and human purine nucleoside phosphorylase, residue changes at level of the same crucial positions could be responsible for the switch of substrate specificity. To validate this hypothesis we changed the putative active site of PfPNP by site-directed mutagenesis. Substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency of PfPNP mutants were then analyzed by kinetic studies and compared with the wild-type enzyme. We carried out the molecular modeling of PfPNP and PfMTAP to obtain a picture of the overall enzyme structure and to identify structural features as well as interactions playing critical roles in thermostability.

The study included triplicates of regenerating liver, control \u201csham-operated\u201d liver, three distinct premalignant stages and hepatomas.

These results show that the thermal stability of StMan and TfMan was enhanced by the presence of Ca2+. StMan, but not TfMan, required Ca2+ for the hydrolysis activity. To identify the Ca2+ sensitive region of StMan, we prepared eight chimeric enzymes. Based on the results of the relationship between Ca2+ and hydrolysis activity, the region of amino-acid residues 244-349 of StMan was responsible for a Ca2+ sensitive site.",

Phosphorylation of SMN can regulate its function, stability, and sub-cellular localization. This study shows that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates SMN both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatic analysis predicts 12 potential PKA phosphorylation sites in human SMN. Mass spectrometric analysis of a tryptic digest of SMN after PKA phosphorylation identified five distinct phosphorylation sites in SMN (serines 4, 5, 8, 187 and threonine 85). Mutagenesis of this subset of PKA-phosphorylated sites in SMN affects association of SMN with Gemin2 and Gemin8. This result indicates that phosphorylation of SMN by PKA may play a role in regulation of the in vivo function of SMN.",

Their relatively low molecular weight makes VLRs an interesting alternative to antibodies in biotechnological applications. A typical VLR comprises several unique motifs called leucine-rich repeats (LRRs).

The designed protein was expressed in Escherichia coli in a soluble, native form and showed very favorable biophysical properties. Recombinant dVLR is monomeric in solution and preserves its secondary structure within the pH range 3.0 to 11.0 and tertiary structure between pH 4.0 and 10.0. It undergoes reversible thermal denaturation in a broad pH range (4.0 to 10.0). The maximal denaturation temperature of 73.9\u00a0\u00b0C is observed at pH 6.0, 0.3\u00a0M NaCl. Chemical denaturation of dVLR at pH 7.5 is a cooperative two-state process with a midpoint at 3.3\u00a0M GdmCl and a very high free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant equal to 14.1\u00a0kcal/mol.

In this research, we studied the effects of a chemically modified \u03b2-CD (BCD07056), on the aggregating and refolding properties of BlaPChBD, a hybrid protein obtained by inserting the chitin binding domain of the human macrophage chitotriosidase into the class A \u03b2-lactamase BlaP from Bacillus licheniformis 749/I during its thermal denaturation. The results show that BCD07056 strongly increases the refolding yield of BlaPChBD after thermal denaturation and constitutes an excellent additive to stabilize the protein over time at room temperature. Our data suggest that BCD07056 acts early in the denaturation process by preventing the formation of an intermediate which leads to an aggregated state.

     "abstract": "Trans-sialidases are surface-located proteins in Trypanosoma cruzi that participate in key parasite\u2013host interactions and parasite virulence. These proteins are encoded by a large multigenic family, with tandem-repeated and individual genes dispersed throughout the genome. While a large number of genes encode for catalytically active enzyme isoforms, many others display mutations that involve catalytic residues. The latter ultimately code for catalytically inactive proteins with very high similarity to their active paralogs. These inactive members have been shown to be lectins, able to bind sialic acid and galactose in vitro, although their cellular functions are yet to be fully established. We now report structural and biochemical evidence extending the current molecular understanding of these lectins. We have solved the crystal structure of one such catalytically inactive trans-sialidase-like protein, after soaking with a specific carbohydrate ligand, sialyl-\u03b12,3-lactose. Instead of the expected trisaccharide, the binding pocket was observed occupied by \u03b1-lactose, strongly suggesting that the protein retains residual hydrolytic activity. This hypothesis was validated by enzyme kinetics assays, in comparison to fully active wild-type trans-sialidase. Surface plasmon resonance also confirmed that these trans-sialidase-like lectins are not only able to bind small oligosaccharides, but also sialylated glycoproteins, which is relevant in the physiologic scenario of parasite infection. Inactive trans-sialidase proteins appear thus to be \u03b2-methyl-galactosyl-specific lectins, evolved within an exo-sialidase scaffold, thus explaining why their lectin activity is triggered by the presence of terminal sialic acid.",

The B. fragilis Ddh ortholog shows low homology with other examples of Ddh and this species belongs to a phylum, the Bacteriodetes, not previously known to contain this enzyme. By contrast, the C. thermocellum ortholog is well conserved with known examples of Ddh. Using in vitro and in vivo assays both the B. fragilis and C. thermocellum enzymes were found to be authentic examples of Ddh, displaying kinetic properties typical of this enzyme. The result indicates that B. fragilis contains a sequence diverged form of Ddh.

The data for all proteins, except apoA-II, fit with the three-state model, thus evidencing two-domain structure. The predicted folding rate of the four apoE in solution correlated with conformational stability. The dependence disappeared at the inclusion of apoA-I and apoA-IV into analysis and the m-values, adjusted for residue number in helices (mrh), differed between those for apoE and apoA-I/apoA-IV.

Currently, limited information is available on the degradation of storage proteins in the soybean during germination. In this study, a combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry approach was utilized to determine the proteome profile of soybean seeds (Glycine max L.; Eunhakong). Comparative analysis showed that the temporal profiles of protein expression are dramatically changed during the seed germination and seedling growth. More than 80% of the proteins identified were subunits of glycinin and \u03b2-conglycinin, two major storage proteins. Most subunits of these proteins were degraded almost completely at a different rate by 120\u00a0h, and the degradation products were accumulated or degraded further. Interestingly, the acidic subunits of glycinin were rapidly degraded, but no obvious change in the basic chains. Of the five acidic subunits, the degradation of G2 subunit was not apparently affected by at least 96\u00a0h but the levels decreased rapidly after that, while no newly appearing intermediate was detected upon the degradation of G4 subunit. On the other hand, the degradation of \u03b2-conglycinin during storage protein mobilization appeared to be similar to that of glycinin but at a faster rate. Both \u03b1 and \u03b1' subunits of \u03b2-conglycinin largely disappeared by 96\u00a0h, while the \u03b2 subunits degraded at the slowest rate. These results suggest that mobilization of subunits of the storage proteins is differentially regulated for seed germination and seedling growth. The present proteomic analysis will facilitate future studies addressing the complex biochemical events taking place during soybean seed germination.",

To understand the molecular mechanisms of selectivity and assess binding of compounds to G\u03b2\u03b3, we used biophysical and biochemical approaches to directly monitor small molecule binding to G\u03b2\u03b3. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis indicated that multiple compounds bound directly to G\u03b2\u03b3 with affinities in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range but with surprisingly slow on and off rate kinetics. While the koff was slow for most of the compounds in physiological buffers, they could be removed from G\u03b2\u03b3 with mild chaotropic salts or mildly dissociating collision energy in a mass-spectrometer indicating that compound-G\u03b2\u03b3 interactions were non-covalent.

In essence, binding of a ligand at an allosteric site affects the function at a distant site exploiting protein flexibility and reshaping protein energy landscape. Both monomeric and oligomeric proteins can be allosteric. In the past decades, the behavior of allosteric systems has been analyzed in many investigations while general theoretical models and variations thereof have been steadily proposed to interpret the experimental data. Allostery has been established as a fundamental mechanism of regulation in all organisms, governing a variety of processes that range from metabolic control to receptor function and from ligand transport to cell motility. A number of studies have shed light on how evolutionary pressures have favored and molded the development of allosteric features in specific macromolecular systems. The widespread occurrence of allostery has been recently exploited for the development and design of allosteric drugs that bind to either physiological or non-physiological allosteric sites leading to gain of function or loss of function.

Despite enormous advances in molecular dynamics techniques and the available computational power, many problems involve long time scales and large-scale molecular rearrangements that are still difficult to sample adequately. In this review we therefore summarise recent efforts to fundamentally improve this situation by decoupling the sampling of the energy landscape from the description of the kinetics of the process. Recent years have seen the emergence of many advanced sampling techniques, which permit efficient characterisation of the relevant family of molecular conformations by dispensing with the details of the short-term kinetics of the process. Because these methods generate thermodynamic information at best, they must be complemented by techniques to reconstruct the kinetics of the process using the ensemble of relevant conformations. Here we review recent advances for both types of methods and discuss their perspectives to permit efficient and accurate modelling of large-scale conformational changes in biomolecules.

     "abstract": "The problem of spontaneous folding of amino acid chains into highly organized, biologically functional three-dimensional protein structures continues to challenge the modern science. Understanding how proteins fold requires characterization of the underlying energy landscapes as well as the dynamics of the polypeptide chains in all stages of the folding process. In recent years, important advances toward these goals have been achieved owing to the rapidly growing interdisciplinary interest and significant progress in both experimental techniques and theoretical methods. Improvements in the experimental time resolution led to determination of the timescales of the important elementary events in folding, such as formation of secondary structure and tertiary contacts. Sensitive single molecule methods made possible probing the distributions of the unfolded and folded states and following the folding reaction of individual protein molecules. Discovery of proteins that fold in microseconds opened the possibility of atomic-level theoretical simulations of folding and their direct comparisons with experimental data, as well as of direct experimental observation of the barrier-less folding transition. The ultra-fast folding also brought new questions, concerning the intrinsic limits of the folding rates and experimental signatures of barrier-less \u201cdownhill\u201d folding. These problems will require novel approaches for even more detailed experimental investigations of the folding dynamics as well as for the analysis of the folding kinetic data. For theoretical simulations of folding, a main challenge is how to extract the relevant information from overwhelmingly detailed atomistic trajectories. New theoretical methods have been devised to allow a systematic approach towards a quantitative analysis of the kinetic network of folding\u2013unfolding transitions between various configuration states of a protein, revealing the transition states and the associated folding pathways at multiple levels, from atomistic to coarse-grained representations.

This review briefly introduces common FRET and force methods, and then explores several areas of protein folding where single-molecule experiments have yielded insights. These include exciting new information about folding landscapes, dynamics, intermediates, unfolded ensembles, intrinsically disordered proteins, assisted folding and biomechanical unfolding.

     "abstract": "Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the investigation of protein\u2013ligand interactions in heme proteins. Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are attractive physiologically relevant ligands because their bond stretching vibrations give rise to strong mid-infrared absorption bands that can be measured with exquisite sensitivity and precision using photolysis difference spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. These stretching bands are fine-tuned by electrostatic interactions with the environment and, therefore, ligands can be utilized as local probes of structure and dynamics. Bound to the heme iron, the ligand stretching bands are susceptible to changes in the iron\u2013ligand bond and the electric field at the active site. Upon photolysis, the vibrational bands display changes due to ligand relocation to docking sites within the protein, rotational motions of the ligand in these sites and protein conformational changes. Photolysis difference spectra taken over a wide temperature range (3\u2013300\u00a0K) using specific temperature protocols for sample photodissociation can provide detailed insights into both protein and ligand dynamics. Moreover, temperature-derivative spectroscopy (TDS) has proven to be a particularly powerful technique to study protein\u2013ligand interactions. The FTIR-TDS technique has been extensively applied to studies of carbon monoxide binding to heme proteins, whereas measurements with nitric oxide are still scarce. Here we describe infrared cryo-spectroscopy and present a variety of applications to the study of protein\u2013ligand interactions in heme proteins.

The biological function is as yet unclear, but the high oxygen affinity makes it unlikely to be involved in oxygen transport. In order to gain insight into possible physiological roles, we have studied CO rebinding kinetics after laser flash photolysis of rHb1 in solution and encapsulated in silica gel. CO rebinding to wt rHb1 in solution occurs through a fast geminate phase with no sign of rebinding from internal docking sites. Encapsulation in silica gel enhances migration to internal cavities. Site-directed mutagenesis of FB10, a residue known to have a key role in the regulation of hexacoordination and ligand affinity, resulted in substantial effects on the rebinding kinetics, partly inhibiting ligand exit to the solvent, enhancing geminate rebinding and enabling ligand migration within the internal cavities. The mutation of HE7, one of the histidyl residues involved in the hexacoordination, prevents hexacoordination, as expected, but also exposes ligand migration through a complex system of cavities.

     "abstract": "Heme proteins represent a diverse class of biomolecules responsible for an extremely diverse array of physiological functions including electron transport, monooxygenation, ligand transport and storage, cellular signaling, respiration, etc. An intriguing aspect of these proteins is that such functional diversity is accomplished using a single type of heme macrocycle based upon iron protoporphyrin IX. The functional diversity originates from a delicate balance of inter-molecular interactions within the protein matrix together with well choreographed dynamics that modulate the heme electronic structure as well as ligand entry/exit pathways from the bulk solvent to the active site. Of particular interest are the dynamics and energetics associated with the entry/exit of ligands as this process plays a significant role in regulating the rates of heme protein activity. Time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry (PAC) has emerged as a powerful tool through which to probe the underlying energetics associated with small molecule dissociation and release to the bulk solvent in heme proteins on time scales from tens of nanoseconds to several microseconds. In this review, the results of PAC studies on various classes of heme proteins are summarized highlighting how different protein structures affect the thermodynamics of ligand migration.

     "abstract": "Biological function involves a series of chemical reactions of biological molecules, and during these reactions, there are numerous spectrally silent dynamic events that cannot be monitored by absorption or emission spectroscopic techniques. Such spectrally silent dynamics include changes in conformation, intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions), inter-protein interactions (oligomer formation, dissociation reactions) and conformational fluctuations. These events might be associated with biological function. To understand the molecular mechanisms of reactions, time-resolved detection of such dynamics is essential. Recently, it has been shown that time-resolved detection of the refractive index is a powerful tool for measuring dynamic events. This technique is complementary to optical absorption detection methods and the signal contains many unique properties, which are difficult to obtain by other methods. The advantages and methods for signal analyses are described in detail in this review.

Recent studies have developed molecular models integrating a set of genes that might have important functions in the control of regenerative cellular plasticity.

     "abstract": "Calpains are Ca2+-dependent, intracellular cysteine proteases involved in many physiological functions. How calpains are activated in the cell is unknown because the average intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is orders of magnitude lower than that needed for half-maximal activation of the enzyme in vitro. Two of the proposed mechanisms by which calpains can overcome this Ca2+ concentration differential are autoproteolysis (autolysis) and subunit dissociation, both of which could release constraints on the core by breaking the link between the anchor helix and the small subunit to allow the active site to form. By measuring the rate of autolysis at different sites in calpain, we show that while the anchor helix is one of the first targets to be cut, this occurs in the same time-frame as several potentially inactivating cleavages in Domain III. Thus autolytic activation would overlap with inactivation. We also show that the small subunit does not dissociate from the large subunit, but is proteolyzed to a 40\u201345\u00a0k heterodimer of Domains IV and VI. It is likely that this autolysis-generated heterodimer has previously been misidentified as the small subunit homodimer produced by subunit dissociation.

In contrast to mammalian immunoglobulin G (IgG), which has complex type N-glycans, chicken immunoglobulin Y (IgY) possesses a monoglucosylated high mannose N-linked glycan, which is a ligand for calreticulin. Here, we have used solid and solution-phase assays to analyze the in vitro binding of calreticulin, purified from human placenta, to human IgG and chicken IgY in order to compare the interactions. In addition, peptides from the respective immunoglobulins were included to further probe the binding specificity of calreticulin. The experiments demonstrate the ability of calreticulin to bind to denatured forms of both IgG and IgY regardless of the glycosylation state of the proteins.

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether nNOS is posttranslationally modified by SUMO proteins. Bioinformatic analyses using SUMOplot and SUMOFI predicted that nNOS had potential SUMO modification sites. When HEK293T cells were transiently co-expressed with nNOS and SUMO-1, two bands corresponding to nNOS-SUMO-1 conjugates were detected. In addition, two nNOS-SUMO-1 conjugates were confirmed by an in vitro sumoylation assay using recombinant proteins.

These findings indicate that nNOS is clearly defined as a SUMO-1 target protein both in vitro and at the cellular level. We next characterized specific enzymes in the nNOS-SUMO-1 conjugation cycle at the cellular level. SUMO-1 conjugation of nNOS depended on Ubc9 (E2). The interaction between nNOS and Ubc9 was facilitated by PIASx\u03b2 (E3). On the other hand, SUMO-1 was deconjugated from nNOS by SENP1 and SENP2. Overall, this study has newly identified that nNOS is posttranslationally modified by SUMO-1.",

     "abstract": "The plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) plays a key role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. It has six potential N-glycosylation sites. To study the impact of these sites on PLTP secretion and activity, six variants containing serine to alanine point mutations were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary Flp-In cells. The apparent size of each of the six PLTP mutants was slightly less than that of wild type by Western blot, indicating that all six sites are glycosylated or utilized. The size of the carbohydrate at each N-glycosylation site ranged from 3.14 to 4.2\u00a0kDa. The effect of site-specific N-glycosylation removal on PLTP secretion varied from a modest enhancement (15% and 60%), or essentially no effect, to a reduction in secretion (8%, 14% and 32%). Removal of N-glycosylation at any one of the six glycosylation sites resulted in a significant 35-78% decrease in PLTP activity, and a significant 29-80% decrease in PLTP specific activity compared to wild type. These data indicate that although no single N-linked carbohydrate chain is a requirement for secretion or activity, the removal of the carbohydrate chains had a quantitative impact on cellular secretion of PLTP and its phospholipid transfer activity.",

Microspectrophotometric measurements using oriented crystals and linearly polarized light are carried out usually off-line with respect to X-ray data collection and are aimed at an in- depth characterization of protein function in the crystal, leading to robust structure\u2013function relationships.

     "abstract": "Raman spectra, obtained using a Raman microscope, offer a unique and incisive approach to follow interactions and reactions inside a single crystal under soak-in or soak-out conditions. The utility of this approach derives from the finding that the Raman spectra from single macromolecular crystals, under normal (non-resonance) conditions, are extremely stable, with a low \u201clight background,\u201d and provide ideal platforms for Raman difference spectroscopy. In turn, this allows the interrogation of sub-molecular changes in very large and complex macromolecular environments. There is often great synergy with X-ray crystallography, with the Raman spectroscopist providing crystallography colleagues with the best soak-in conditions to generate a targeted intermediate for flash freezing and X-ray analysis. On the other hand, X-ray structures at points along a reaction pathway provide invaluable benchmarks for interpreting the Raman data from populations seen by Raman to be changing in real-time. These principles will be illustrated by two reactions: the first involves a complex, branching reaction pathway underlying the inhibition of \u03b2-lactamases by clinically important pharmaceutical compounds, where different combinations of drug and enzyme function in different regions of the pathway. The second shows how temporal data can be derived for several events in the initiation step of RNA synthesis\u2014more specifically, when one GTP molecule is joined to one ATP molecule to form a G\u2219A dimer in the active site of a 115,000\u00a0Dalton crystalline RNA polymerase.

     "abstract": "We consider the application of infrared spectroscopy to protein crystals, with particular emphasis on exploiting molecular orientation through polarization measurements on oriented single crystals. Infrared microscopes enable transmission measurements on individual crystals using either thermal or nonthermal sources, and can accommodate flow cells, used to measure spectral changes induced by exposure to soluble ligands, and cryostreams, used for measurements of flash-cooled crystals. Comparison of unpolarized infrared measurements on crystals and solutions probes the effects of crystallization and can enhance the value of the structural models refined from X-ray diffraction data by establishing solution conditions under which they are most relevant. Results on several proteins are consistent with similar equilibrium conformational distributions in crystal and solutions. However, the rates of conformational change are often perturbed. Infrared measurements also detect products generated by X-ray exposure, including CO2. Crystals with favorable symmetry exhibit infrared dichroism that enhances the synergy with X-ray crystallography. Polarized infrared measurements on crystals can distinguish spectral contributions from chemically similar sites, identify hydrogen bonding partners, and, in opportune situations, determine three-dimensional orientations of molecular groups.

     "abstract": "High resolution protein crystallography using synchrotron radiation is one of the most powerful tools in modern biology. Improvements in resolution have arisen from the use of X-ray beamlines with higher brightness and flux and the development of advanced detectors. However, it is increasingly recognised that the benefits brought by these advances have an associated cost, namely deleterious effects of X-ray radiation on the sample (radiation damage). In particular, X-ray induced reduction and damage to redox centres has been shown to occur much more rapidly than other radiation damage effects, such as loss of resolution or damage to disulphide bridges. Selection of an appropriate combination of in-situ single crystal spectroscopies during crystallographic experiments, such as UV\u2013visible absorption and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS), allows for effective monitoring of redox states in protein crystals in parallel with structure determination. Such approaches are also essential in cases where catalytic intermediate species are generated by exposure to the X-ray beam. In this article, we provide a number of examples in which multiple single crystal spectroscopies have been key to understanding the redox status of Fe and Cu centres in crystal structures.

     "abstract": "X-ray induced radiation damage of protein crystals is well known to occur even at cryogenic temperatures. Redox active sites like metal sites seem especially vulnerable for these radiation-induced reductions. It is essential to know correctly the oxidation state of metal sites in protein crystal structures to be able to interpret the structure\u2013function relation. Through previous structural studies, we have tried to characterise and understand the reactions between myoglobin and peroxides. These reaction intermediates are relevant because myoglobin is proposed to take part as scavenger of reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress, and because these intermediates are similar among the haem peroxidases and oxygenases. We have in our previous studies shown that these different myoglobin states are influenced by the X-rays used. In this study, we have in detail investigated the impact that X-rays have on these different oxidation states of myoglobin. An underlying goal has been to find a way to be able to determine mostly unreduced states. We have by using single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy found that the different oxidation states of myoglobin are to a different extent influenced by the X-rays (e.g. ferric FeIII myoglobin is faster reduced than ferryl FeIV\u2550O myoglobin). We observe that the higher oxidation states are not reduced to normal ferrous FeII or ferric FeIII states, but end up in some intermediate and possibly artificial states. For ferric myoglobin, it seems that annealing of the radiation-induced/reduced state can reversibly more or less give the starting point (ferric myoglobin). Both scavengers and different dose-rates might influence to which extent the different states are affected by the X-rays. Our study shows that it is essential to do a time/dose monitoring of the influence X-rays have on each specific redox-state with spectroscopic techniques like single-crystal light absorption spectroscopy. This will determine to which extent you can collect X-ray diffraction data on your crystal before it becomes too heavily influenced/reduced by X-rays.

Here we present the first structural characterization of a group II 2/2Hb from the soil and phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens (At-2/2HbO). The crystal structure of ferric At-2/2HbO (reported at 2.1\u00a0\u00c5 resolution) shows the location of specific/unique heme distal site residues (e.g., His(42)CD1, a residue distinctive of proteobacteria group II 2/2Hbs) that surround a heme-liganded water molecule. A highly intertwined hydrogen-bonded network, involving residues Tyr(26)B10, His(42)CD1, Ser(49)E7, Trp(93)G8, and three distal site water molecules, stabilizes the heme-bound ligand. Such a structural organization suggests a path for diatomic ligand diffusion to/from the heme. Neither a similar distal site structuring effect nor the presence of distal site water molecules has been so far observed in group I and group III 2/2Hbs, thus adding new distinctive information to the complex picture of currently available 2/2Hb structural and functional data.

     "abstract": "Usually, spectroscopic data on proteins in solution are interpreted at molecular level on the basis of the three-dimensional structures determined in the crystalline state. While it is widely recognized that the protein crystal structures are reliable models for the solution 3D structures, nevertheless it is also clear that sometimes the crystallization process can introduce some \u201cartifacts\u201d that can make difficult or even flaw the attempt to correlate the properties in solution with those in the crystalline state. In general, therefore, it would be desirable to identify some sort of control. In the case of the spectroscopic properties of proteins, the most straightforward check is to acquire data not only in solution but also on the crystals. In this regard, the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is an interesting case in that a massive quantity of data correlating the spectroscopic properties in solution with the structural information in the crystalline state is available in literature. Despite that, a relatively limited amount of spectroscopic studies on single crystals of GFP or related FPs have been described. Here we review and discuss the main spectroscopic (in solution) and structural (in crystals) studies performed on the GFP and related fluorescent proteins, together with the spectroscopic analyses on various FPs members in the crystalline state. One main conclusion is that \u201cin cristallo\u201d spectroscopic studies are useful in providing new opportunities for gathering information not available in solution and are highly recommended to reliably correlate solution properties with structural features.

All four mutants catalyze oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by H2O2 with steady-state activities that are between 250 and 7700 times slower than wild-type CcP at pH 6.0, 0.10\u00a0M ionic strength, 25\u00a0\u00b0C. The rate of Compound I formation is decreased between 3.5 and 5.4 orders of magnitude for the mutants compared to wild-type CcP, with the rate of the reaction between CcP(H52Q) and H2O2 the slowest yet observed for any CcP mutant. A correlation between the rate of Compound I formation and the rate of HCN binding for CcP and various CcP distal pocket mutants provides strong evidence that the rate-limiting step in CcP Compound I formation is deprotonation of H2O2 within the distal heme pocket under the experimental conditions employed in this study. While CcP(H52E) reacts stoichiometrically with H2O2 to form Compound I, only ~\u00a036% of CcP(H52D), ~\u00a021% of CcP(H52Q) and ~\u00a08% of CcP(H52N) appear to be converted to Compound I during their respective reactions with H2O2. This is partially due to the slow rate of Compound I formation and the rapid endogenous decay of Compound I for these mutants. The pathways for the endogenous decay of Compound I for the four mutants used in this study are distinct from that of wild-type CcP Compound I.",

The secondary structure determined by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (around 30% \u03b1-helix and 20% \u03b2-sheets, 12% antiparallel and 8% parallel) reveals a compact and thermally stable structure with a high melting temperature (57\u201359\u00a0\u00b0C). Tryptophan residues are mainly buried and immobilized in the hydrophobic core of the protein as suggested by near-UV CD spectrum, the position of the Trp maximum fluorescence emission (323\u00a0nm) and from the acrylamide quenching constant (2.6\u00a0M\u22121). Urea unfolding equilibrium has been studied by far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy to gain information on the folding/unfolding process of the ectodomain. The analyses suggest the existence of two intermediate states as reported for other TIM barrel-containing proteins rather than an independent unfolding of each domain [A, (\u03b2\u03b1)8 barrel; C, antiparallel \u03b28 sandwich]. Folding seems to be directed by the initial formation of hydrophobic clusters within the first strands of the \u03b2-barrel of domain A followed by additional hydrophobic interactions in domain C.",

Because humans lack the capacity to synthesize ascorbate, the trypanosomal enzymes involved in ascorbate biosynthesis are interesting targets for drug therapy. The terminal step in ascorbate biosynthesis is catalyzed by flavin-dependent aldonolactone oxidoreductases belonging to the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase (VAO) protein family. Here we studied the properties of recombinant T. cruzi galactonolactone oxidoreductase (TcGAL), refolded from inclusion bodies using a reverse micelles system. The refolded enzyme shows native-like secondary structure and is active with both l-galactono-1,4-lactone and d-arabinono-1,4-lactone. At odd with an earlier claim, TcGAL employs a non-covalently bound FAD as redox-active cofactor. Moreover, it is shown for the first time that TcGAL can use molecular oxygen as electron acceptor. This is in line with the absence of a recently identified gatekeeper residue that prevents aldonolactone oxidoreductases from plants to act as oxidases.",

The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) is of particular interest, as it is an endogenous molecule with a possible link to neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson disease. A key pathomolecular mechanism of Parkinson disease is the misfolding and aggregation of the intrinsically unstructured protein \u03b1-synuclein. We performed a biophysical study to investigate an influence between these two molecules. In an isolated in vitro system, 5-HT interfered with \u03b1-synuclein amyloid fiber maturation, resulting in the formation of partially structured, SDS-resistant intermediate aggregates. The C-terminal region of \u03b1-synuclein was essential for this interaction, which was driven mainly by electrostatic forces. 5-HT did not bind directly to monomeric \u03b1-synuclein molecules and we propose a model where 5-HT interacts with early intermediates of \u03b1-synuclein amyloidogenesis, which disfavors their further conversion into amyloid fibrils.",

     "abstract": "The scientific study of protein surfactant interactions goes back more than a century, and has been put to practical uses in everything from the estimation of protein molecular weights to efficient washing powder enzymes and products for personal hygiene. After a burst of activity in the late 1960s and early 1970s that established the general principles of how charged surfactants bind to and denature proteins, the field has kept a relatively low profile until the last decade. Within this period there has been a maturation of techniques for more accurate and sophisticated analyses of protein\u2013surfactant complexes such as calorimetry and small angle scattering techniques. In this review I provide an overview of different useful approaches to study these complexes and identify eight different issues which define central concepts in the field. (1) Are proteins denatured by monomeric surfactant molecules, micelles or both? (2) How does unfolding of proteins in surfactant compare with \u201cproper\u201d unfolding in chemical denaturants? Recent work has highlighted the role of shared micelles, rather than monomers, below the critical micelle concentration (cmc) in promoting both protein denaturation and formation of higher order structures. Kinetic studies have extended the experimentally accessible range of surfactant concentrations to far above the cmc, revealing numerous different modes of denaturation by ionic surfactants below and above the cmc which reflect micellar properties as much as protein unfolding pathways. Uncharged surfactants follow a completely different denaturation strategy involving synergy between monomers and micelles. The high affinity of charged surfactants for proteins means that unfolding pathways are generally different in surfactants versus chemical denaturants, although there are common traits. Other issues are as follows: (3) Are there non-denaturing roles for SDS? (4) How reversible is unfolding in SDS? (5) How do solvent conditions affect the way in which surfactants denature proteins? The last three issues compare SDS with \u201cproper\u201d membranes. (6) Do anionic surfactants such as SDS mimic biological membranes? (7) How do mixed micelles interact with globular proteins? (8) How can mixed micelles be used to measure the stability of membrane proteins? The growing efforts to understand the unique features of membrane proteins have encouraged the development of mixed micelles to study the equilibria and kinetics of this class of proteins, and traits which unite globular and membrane proteins have also emerged. These issues emphasise the amazing power of surfactants to both extend the protein conformational landscape and at the same time provide convenient and reversible short-cuts between the native and denatured state for otherwise obdurate membrane proteins.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms correlate with the concentration of soluble, although not necessarily monomeric forms of A\u03b2 peptide in the brain parenchyma. The RAGE receptor has been implicated as the protein responsible for active transport of A\u03b2 from blood circulation to the brain. In murine models of AD, inhibition of the A\u03b2:RAGE interaction decreases the levels of A\u03b2 in the brain. Inhibition of the A\u03b2:RAGE interaction would be a promising alternative for the therapy of AD. Rational design of an A\u03b2:RAGE interaction blocker requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the complex. However, the binding domain of RAGE is natively unfolded in physiological conditions, which severely hampers the application of classic methods of protein structure analysis to the design of an antagonist. Here, alternative methods are used to characterize the structural properties of the RAGE-ligand binding domain and to monitor the binding of a series of truncated variants of A\u03b2. Using intrinsic RAGE tryptophan fluorescence and mass spectrometry of non-covalent protein\u2013ligand complexes we have identified shorter versions of A\u03b2 that bind to the RAGE V-domain. We have also shown in cell culture experiments that a selected shortened version of A\u03b2 effectively inhibits full-length A\u03b2, RAGE-mediated, cell uptake. Thus, a truncated version of A\u03b2 capable of blocking its receptor-mediated internalization was established, revealing the binding code and providing the lead compound in the process of drug design.",

To investigate the function of glycosylation, each of the two potential glycosylation sites in the rJHBP molecule was examined by site-directed mutagenesis. MS analysis revealed that rJHBP overexpressed in the P. pastoris system may appear in a non-glycosylated as well as in a glycosylated form at both sites. We found that mutation at position Asn94 reduces the level of protein secretion whereas mutation at the Asn4 site has no effect on protein secretion. Purified rJHBP and its mutated forms (N4W and N94A) have the same JH binding activities similar to that of hJHBP. However, both mutants devoid of the carbohydrate chain are more susceptible to thermal inactivation. It is concluded that glycosylation of JHBP molecule is important for its thermal stability and secretion although it is not required for JH binding activity.",

In mesophilic AdSS, both ligand binding and catalysis are facilitated through the coordinated movement of five loops on the protein. The simulation results suggest that thermophilic P. horikoshii preserves structure and catalytic function at high temperatures by using the movement of only a subset of loops (two out of five) for ligand binding and catalysis unlike its mesophilic counterpart in E. coli. The pre-arrangement of the catalytic residues in P. horikoshii is well-preserved and salt bridges remain stable at high temperature (363\u00a0K). The simulations suggest a general mechanism (including pre-arrangement of catalytic residues, increased polar residue content, stable salt bridges, increased rigidity, and fewer loop movements) used by thermophilic enzymes to preserve structure and be catalytically active at elevated temperatures.",

The Arthrobacter globiformis amine oxidase (AGAO) has been widely used as a model to guide the design and development of selective inhibitors of CAOs. In this study, two aryl 2,3-butadienamine analogs, racemic 5- p hen o xy-2,3- p enta d ienyl a mine (POPDA) and racemic 6- p henyl-2,3- h exa d ienyl a mine (PHDA), were synthesized and evaluated as mechanism-based inactivators of AGAO. Crystal structures show that both compounds form a covalent adduct with the amino group of the substrate-reduced TPQ, and that the chemical structures of the rac-PHDA and rac-POPDA modified TPQ differ by the allenic carbon that is attached to the cofactor. A chemical mechanism accounting for the formation of the respective TPQ derivative is proposed. Under steady-state conditions, no recovery of enzyme activity is detected when AGAO pre-treated with rac-PHDA or rac-POPDA is diluted with excess amount of the benzylamine substrate (100-fold Km). Comparing the IC50 values further reveals that the phenoxy substituent in POPDA offers an approximately 4-fold increase in inhibition potency, which can be attributed to a favourable binding interaction between the oxygen atom in the phenoxy group and the active site of AGAO as revealed by crystallographic studies. This hypothesis is corroborated by the observed >\u00a03-fold higher partition ratio of PHDA compared to POPDA. Taken together, the results presented in this study reveal the mechanism by which aryl 2,3-butadienamines act as mechanism-based inhibitors of AGAO, and the potency of enzyme inactivation could be fine-tuned by optimizing binding interaction between the aryl substituent and the enzyme active site.",

During aging, crystallins, the major intra-cellular structural proteins of the lens, aggregate and become water-insoluble. Modifications to crystallins and the lens intermediate filaments have been implicated in this phenomenon. In this study, we examined changes to, and interactions between, human lens crystallins and intermediate filament proteins in lenses from a variety of age groups (0\u201386\u00a0years). Among the lens-specific intermediate filament proteins, filensin was extensively cleaved in all postnatal lenses, with truncated products of various sizes being found in both the lens cortical and nuclear extracts. Phakinin was also truncated and was not detected in the lens nucleus. The third major intermediate filament protein, vimentin, remained intact in lens cortical fiber cells across the age range except for an 86\u00a0year lens, where a single ~\u00a049\u00a0kDa breakdown product was observed. An \u03b1B-crystallin fusion protein (maltose-binding protein-\u03b1B-crystallin) was found to readily exchange subunits with endogenous \u03b1-crystallin, and following mild heat stress, to bind to filensin, phakinin and vimentin and to several of their truncated products. Tryptic digestion of a truncated form of filensin suggested that the binding site for \u03b1-crystallin may be in the N-terminal region. The presence of significant amounts of small peptides derived from \u03b3S- and \u03b2B1-crystallins in the water-insoluble fraction of the lens indicates that these interact tightly with cytoskeletal or membrane components. Interestingly, water-soluble complexes (~\u00a040\u00a0kDa) contained predominantly \u03b3S- and \u03b2B1-crystallins, suggesting that cross-linking is an alternative pathway for modified \u03b2- and \u03b3-crystallins in the lens.",

TMBs are involved in a variety of functions such as mediating flux of metabolites and active transport of siderophores, enzymes and structural proteins, and in the translocation across or insertion into membranes. We present here TMBHMM, a computational method based on a hidden Markov model for predicting the structural topology of putative TMBs from sequence. In addition to predicting transmembrane strands, TMBHMM also predicts the exposure status (i.e., exposed to the membrane or hidden in the protein structure) of the residues in the transmembrane region, which is a novel feature of the TMBHMM method. Furthermore, TMBHMM can also predict the membrane residues that are not part of beta barrel forming strands. The training of the TMBHMM was performed on a non-redundant data set of 19 TMBs. The self-consistency test yielded Q2 accuracy of 0.87, Q3 accuracy of 0.83, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.74 and SOV for beta strand of 0.95. In this self-consistency test the method predicted 83% of transmembrane residues with correct exposure status. On an unseen, non-redundant test data set of 10 proteins, the 2-state and 3-state TMBHMM prediction accuracies are around 73% and 72%, respectively, and are comparable to other methods from the literature.

     "abstract": "The primary aim of this study is the elucidation of the mechanism of disulfide induced alteration of ligand binding in human tear lipocalin (TL). Disulfide bonds may act as dynamic scaffolds to regulate conformational changes that alter protein function including receptor\u2013ligand interactions. A single disulfide bond, (Cys61\u2015Cys153), exists in TL that is highly conserved in the lipocalin superfamily. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies were applied to investigate the mechanism by which disulfide bond removal effects protein stability, dynamics and ligand binding properties. Although the secondary structure is not altered by disulfide elimination, TL shows decreased stability against urea denaturation. Free energy change (\u0394G0) decreases from 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 to 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0kcal/mol with removal of the disulfide bond. Furthermore, ligand binding properties of TL without the disulfide vary according to the type of ligand. The binding of a bulky ligand, NBD-cholesterol, has a decreased time constant (from 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 to 3.3\u00a0s). In contrast, the NBD-labeled phospholipid shows a moderate decrease in the time constant for binding, from 33.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 to 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0s. FRET experiments indicate that the hairpin CD is directly involved in modulation of both ligand binding and flexibility of TL. In TL complexed with palmitic acid (PA\u2013TL), the distance between the residues 62 of strand D and 81 of loop EF is decreased by disulfide bond reduction. Consequently, removal of the disulfide bond boosts flexibility of the protein to reach a CD-EF loop distance (24.3\u00a0\u00c5, between residues 62 and 81), which is not accessible for the protein with an intact disulfide bond (26.2\u00a0\u00c5). The results suggest that enhanced flexibility of the protein promotes a faster accommodation of the ligand inside the cavity and an energetically favorable ligand-protein complex.",

However, previous reports suggest that a cysteine residue in position 81 of EF-Tu from Escherichia coli is essential for its function. To study the functional role of cysteine 81 and to construct a fully active Cys-less EF-Tu, we have analyzed 125 bacterial sequences with respect to sequence variations in this position revealing that in a small number of sequences alanine and methionine can be found. Here we report the detailed comparative biochemical analysis of three Cys-less variants of EF-Tu containing these substitutions as well as the isosteric amino acid serine. By characterizing nucleotide binding, EF-Ts interaction, aminoacyl-tRNA binding, and delivery to the ribosome, we demonstrate that only alanine (or cysteine) can be tolerated in this position and that the serine and methionine substitutions significantly impair aminoacyl-tRNA, but not nucleotide binding. Our findings suggest a critical functional role of the amino acid residue in position 81 of EF-Tu with respect to aminoacyl-tRNA binding. Based on structural considerations, we suggest that position 81 indirectly contributes to aminoacyl-tRNA binding through the accurate positioning of helix B.",

     "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins are highly abundant in nature and play a number of crucial roles in the living cells. They are commonly involved in a wide range of intermolecular interactions, and some of them possess remarkable binding promiscuity, being able to interact specifically with structurally unrelated partners. Although they do not have well-folded structure, some IDPs are known to fold at binding to their specific partners. IDPs are highly pliable and one IDP can form an array of unrelated structures being bound to different partners. It is believed that many IDPs, being mostly disordered, have transient elements of the preformed secondary structure which are highly interaction prone and is used by IDPs for binding to specific partners. The overall disordered nature of IDPs, their high conformational dynamics and flexibility, the presence of sticky preformed binding elements, and their ability to morph into differently-shaped bound configurations raised a very important question about the mechanisms preventing IDPs from unwanted interactions with non-native partners. In this review, a concept of functional misfolding is introduced. Accumulated to date data on the conformational behavior and fine structure of several IDPs suggest that the preformed binding elements might be involved in a set of non-native intramolecular interactions. In other words, there is a chance that a polypeptide chain misfolds to sequester the preformed elements inside the non-interactive or less-interactive cage, therefore preventing these elements from the unnecessary and unwanted interactions with non-native binding partners.",

     "abstract": "The milk protein \u03b2-lactoglobulin (\u03b2LG) dominates the properties of whey aggregates in food products. Here we use spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to elucidate how anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactants interact with bovine \u03b2LG and modulate its heat-induced aggregation. Alkyl trimethyl ammonium chlorides (xTAC) strongly promote aggregation, while sodium alkyl sulfates (SxS) and alkyl maltopyranosides (xM) reduce aggregation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) binds to non-aggregated \u03b2LG in several steps, but reduction of aggregation was associated with the first binding step, which occurs far below the critical micelle concentration. In contrast, micellar concentrations of xMs are required to reduce aggregation. The ranking order for reduction of aggregation (normalized to their tendency to self-associate) was C10\u2013C12>C8>C14 for SxS and C8>C10>C12>C14>C16 for xM. xTAC promote aggregation in the same ranking order as xM reduce it. We conclude that SxS reduce aggregation by stabilizing the protein's ligand-bound state (the melting temperature tm increases by up to 10\u00a0\u00b0C) and altering its charge potential. xM monomers also stabilize the protein's ligand-bound state (increasing tm up to 6\u00a0\u00b0C) but in the absence of charged head groups this is not sufficient by itself to prevent aggregation. Although micelles of both anionic and non-ionic surfactants destabilize \u03b2LG, they also solubilize unfolded protein monomers, leaving them unavailable for protein\u2013protein association and thus inhibiting aggregation. Cationic surfactants promote aggregation by a combination of destabilization and charge neutralization. The food compatible surfactant sodium dodecanoate also inhibited aggregation well below the cmc, suggesting that surfactants may be a practical way to modulate whey protein properties.",

Knowledge for the conformation of VIP bound to membrane is important because the receptor activation is initiated by membrane binding of VIP. We have previously observed that VIP-G (glycine-extended VIP) is unstructured in solution, as evidenced by the limited NMR chemical shift dispersion. In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structures of VIP-G in two distinct membrane-mimicking environments. Although these are basically similar structures composed of a disordered N-terminal region and a long \u03b1-helix, micelle-bound VIP-G has a curved \u03b1-helix. The side chains of residues Phe6, Tyr10, Leu13, and Met17 found at the concave face form a hydrophobic patch in the micelle-bound state. The structural differences in two distinct membrane-mimicking environments show that the micelle-bound VIP-G localized at the water\u2013micelle boundary with these side chains toward micelle interior. In micelle-bound PACAP-38 (one of the glucagon/secretin superfamily peptide) structure, the identical hydrophobic residues form the micelle-binding interface.

The formation rates of the ferryloxo (Fe(IV)\u00a0=\u00a0O) species by H2O2 under air were about the same for WT and C110A methMbs, whereas the protein decomposed more in the case of WT than C110A hMb. With the addition of GSH, hMb consumed H2O2 faster and decomposition of the protein decreased, where the effects were more prominent in WT than C110A hMb. The radicals produced by the reaction with H2O2 decreased significantly due to the addition of 1\u00a0mM GSH in the case of WT hMb, but not in the case of C110A hMb.

However, the question as to whether PDI and PDIp can directly attack the native disulfide bonds in substrate proteins is still not answered, which is the subject of the present study. We found that RNase can be thermally unfolded at 65\u00a0\u00b0C under non-reductive conditions while its native disulfide bonds remain intact, and the unfolded RNase can refold and reactivate during cooling. Co-incubation of RNase with PDI or PDIp during thermal unfolding can inactivate RNase in a PDI/PDIp concentration-dependent manner. The alkylated PDI and PDIp, which are devoid of enzymatic activities, cannot inactivate RNase, suggesting that the inactivation of RNase results from the disruption of its native disulfide bonds catalyzed by the enzymatic activities of PDI/PDIp. In support of this suggestion, we show that both PDI and PDIp form stable disulfide-linked complexes only with thermally-unfolded RNase, and RNase in the complexes can be released and reactivated dependently of the redox conditions used. The N-terminal active site of PDIp is essential for the inactivation of RNase. These data indicate that PDI and PDIp can perform thiol-disulfide exchange reactions with native disulfide bonds in unfolded RNase via formation of stable disulfide-linked complexes, and from these complexes RNase is further released.",

Applying multiple sequence alignment, we revealed that the protein structure has characteristics of the eukaryotic members of the ribosomal protein S13p family with additional extensions in the N-terminal and central parts that contain \u03b1-helices according to our prediction.

With magnesium ion concentration close to cellular conditions (2\u00a0mM), protein binding caused substantial rearrangements in the rRNA transcript making it compact in such a manner that helices H29/H30 and H41\u2013H43 form a bundle resembling their arrangement in the ribosome.

Since the structure\u2013function relationships of SELENBP1 are unknown, we have performed computational and experimental studies to have insight on the structural features of this protein focusing our attention on the properties of cysteines to assess their ability to interact with selenium. We have performed CD studies on the purified protein, modeled its three-dimensional structure, studied the energetic stability of the protein by molecular dynamics simulations, and titrated the cysteines by DTNB (5,5\u2032-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). The secondary structure content evaluated by CD has been found similar to that of 3D model. Our studies demonstrate that (i) SELENBP1 is an alpha-beta protein with some loop regions characterized by the presence of intrinsically unordered segments, (ii) only one cysteine (Cys57) is enough exposed to solvent, located on a loop and surrounded by charged and hydrophobic residues, and can be the cysteine able to bind the selenium. Furthermore, during the molecular dynamics simulation at neutral pH the loop containing Cys57 opens and exposes this residue to solvent, confirming that it is the best candidate to bind the selenium. Experimentally we found that only one cysteine is titratable by DTNB. This supports the hypothesis that Cys57 is a residue functionally important and this may open new pharmacological perspectives.",

These residues are in the NOS distal substrate access channel. The effect of the (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) cofactor and l-arginine (Arg) substrate on the rates of CO rebinding have also been assessed. Addition of l-Arg to the iNOSoxy N115L mutant results in much faster CO rebinding rates, compared to the wild type. The results indicate that modifications to the iNOS channel in which the hydrophilic residue N115 is replaced by leucine (to resemble its nNOS cognate) open the channel somewhat, thereby improving access to the axial heme ligand binding position. On the other hand, introduction of a hydrophilic residue (L337N) or a bulky rigid aromatic residue (L337F) in the nNOS isoform does not significantly affect the kinetics profile, suggesting that the geometry of the substrate access pocket is not greatly altered. The bimolecular CO rebinding rate data indicate that the opening of the substrate access channel in the iNOS N115L mutant may be due to more widespread structural alterations induced by the mutation.",

A subset of FLC, as amyloidogenic ones, possess intrinsic pathogenicity. Because of their complex purification, little is known on the biochemical features of serum FLC, possibly related to their pathogenic spectrum. We developed an immunopurification approach to isolate serum FLC from patients with monoclonal gammopathies, followed by proteomic characterization. Serum monoclonal FLC were detected and quantified by immunofixation and immunonephelometry. Immunoprecipitation was performed by serum incubation with agarose beads covalently linked to polyclonal anti-\u03ba or \u03bb FLC antibodies. Isolated FLC were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, 2D-PAGE, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry (MS). Serum FLC were immunoprecipitated from 15 patients with AL\u03bb amyloidosis (serum \u03bb FLC range: 98\u20132350\u00a0mg/L), 5 with AL\u03ba amyloidosis and 1 with \u03ba light chain (LC) myeloma (\u03ba FLC range: 266\u20132660\u00a0mg/L), and 3 controls. Monoclonal FLC were the prevalent eluted species in patients. On 2D-PAGE, both \u03bb and \u03ba FLC originated discrete spots with multiple pI isoforms. The nature of eluted FLC and coincidence with the LC sequence from the bone marrow clone was confirmed by MS, which also detected post-translational modifications, including truncation, tryptophan oxidation, cysteinylation, peptide dimerization. Serum FLC were purified in soluble form and adequate amounts for proteomics, which allowed studying primary sequence and detecting post-translational modifications. This method is a novel instrument for studying the molecular bases of FLC pathogenicity, allowing for the first time the punctual biochemical description of the circulating forms.",

     "abstract": "Cycloisomaltooligosaccharide glucanotransferase (CITase) belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 66. According to the sequence alignment of enzymes in the same family, we divided the structure of CITase into five regions from the N terminus to the C terminus: an N-terminal conserved region (Ser1\u2013Gly403), an insertion region (R1; Tyr404\u2013Tyr492), two conserved regions (R2; Glu493\u2013Ser596 and R3; Gly597\u2013Met700), and a C-terminal variable region (R4; Lys701\u2013Ser934). CITase catalyzes the synthesis of cycloisomaltooligosaccharides (CIs) with 7\u201317 glucose units (CI-7 to CI-17) from dextran. In order to clarify the functions of these C-terminal regions (R1\u2013R4), we constructed 15 deletion mutant enzymes. M123\u0394 (R4-deleted), M\u0394234 (R1-deleted), and M\u039423\u0394 (R1/R4-deleted) catalyzed CI synthesis, but other mutants were inactive. M123\u0394, M\u0394234, and M\u039423\u0394 increased their Km values against dextran 40. The wild-type enzyme and M123\u0394 produced CI-8 predominantly, but M\u0394234 and M\u039423\u0394 lost CI-8 production specificity. The kcat values of M\u0394234 and M\u039423\u0394 decreased, and these mutants showed narrowed temperature and pH stability ranges. Our deletion analysis suggests that (i) R2 and R3 are crucial for CITase to generate an active form; (ii) both R1 and R4 contribute to substrate binding; and (iii) R1 also contributes to preference of CI-8 production and enzyme stability.",

     "abstract": "The papilla of the mammalian kidney must tolerate greatly varying degrees of hyperosmotic stress during urine concentration and depending on whole organism hydration state. To identify proteome adaptations supporting cell function and survival in such a harsh environment we compared the proteome of a) the hyperosmotic renal papilla with that of adjacent iso-osmotic cortex tissue and b) the renal papilla of diuretic versus that of anti-diuretic mice. Though functionally distinct the papilla is in close physical proximity to the renal cortex, an iso-osmotic region. Proteomic differences between the papilla and cortex of C57BL6 mice were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. We found 37 different proteins characteristic of the cortex and 16 proteins over-represented in the papilla. Regional specificity was confirmed by Western blot and further substantiated by immunohistochemistry for selected proteins. Proteins that are characteristic of the renal papilla include \u03b1B crystallin, Hsp beta-1, Hsp90, 14-3-3 protein, glutathione S-transferase, aldose reductase, actin and tropomyosin. Gene ontology analysis confirmed a significant increase in molecular functions associated with protein chaperoning and cell stabilization. Proteins over-represented in the cortex were largely related to routine metabolism. During antidiuresis 15 different proteins changed significantly while 18 different proteins changed significantly during diuresis relative to normally hydrated controls. Changes were confirmed by Western blot for selected proteins. Proteins that are significantly altered by diuretic state are associated with cell structure (actin, tubulin), signaling (Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor, abhydrolase domain-containing protein 14B), chaperone functioning (Hsp beta-1, \u03b1B crystallin, T complex protein-1) and anti-oxidant functions (\u03b1-enolase, GAPDH and LDH). Taken together our study reveals that specific proteins involved in protein folding, cytoskeletal stabilization, antioxidant responses, and stress signaling contribute greatly to the unique hyperosmotic stress resistant phenotype of the kidney papilla.",

     "abstract": "In order to clarify the role of the C-terminal domain of the ilvH protein (the regulatory subunit of enterobacterial AHAS isozyme III, whose structure has been solved and reported by Kaplun et al., J Mol Biol 357, 951, 2006) in the process of valine inhibition of AHAS III, we developed a procedure that randomly mutagenizes a specific segment of a gene through error-prone PCR and screens for mutants on the basis of the properties of the holoenzymes reconstituted in vivo (REM-ivrs). Previous work showed that the N-terminal domain includes the valine-binding ACT domain of the regulatory subunit and is sufficient to completely activate the catalytic subunit, but that this domain cannot confer valine sensitivity on the reconstituted enzyme. It appeared that the C-terminal domain of the ilvH is involved in some way in \u201csignal transmission\u201d of the inhibition by valine. As knowledge of the structure of AHAS holoenzymes and the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory subunits is very limited, a procedure that focuses on the C-terminal domain in the ilvH gene could add to the understanding of the mechanism by which the binding of valine to the regulatory subunit is coupled to inhibition of the catalytic activity. In the REM-ivrs procedure, a medium copy (~\u00a040 copies) plasmid expressing ilvH with a Valr mutation confers the Valr phenotype upon bacteria. All the single missense mutations produced by REM-ivrs were found to be localized to the interface between the C-terminal domains of two monomers in the ilvH dimer. The loss of specific contacts involved in inter-monomer interactions in this region might conceivably disrupt the structure of the C-terminal domain itself. Biochemical study of an isolated Valr mutant elicited by the REM-ivrs method detected no binding of radioactively labeled valine, as previously found in a truncation mutant. The idea that the C-terminal domain has a specific \u201csignal-transmission\u201d role was also contradicted by examination of the thermal stability of the Valr REM-ivrs variants by the Thermofluor method, which does not detect any signs of biphasic melting behavior for any of the mutants. We propose that the mutants of ilvH isolated by the REM-ivrs method differ from the wild-type in the equilibrium between two states of the enzyme. Without the specific interdomain contacts of the wild-type ilvH protein, the holoenzyme reconstituted from mutant regulatory subunits is apparently in a state with uninhibited activity and low affinity for valine.",

     "abstract": "Understanding neurogenesis is valuable for the treatment of nervous system disorders. However, there is currently limited information about the molecular events associated with the transition from primate ES cells to neural cells. We therefore sought to identify the proteins involved in neurogenesis, from Macaca fascicularis ES cells (CMK6 cell line) to neural stem (NS) cells to neurons using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF), and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). During the differentiation of highly homogeneous ES cells to NS cells, we identified 17 proteins with increased expression, including fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), and cellular retinoic acid binding protein 1 (CRABP1), and seven proteins with decreased expression. In the differentiation of NS cells to neurons, we identified three proteins with increased expression, including CRMP2, and 10 proteins with decreased expression. Of these proteins, FABP7 is a marker of NS cells, CRMP2 is involved in axon guidance, and CRABP1 is thought to regulate retinoic acid access to its nuclear receptors. Western blot analysis confirmed the upregulation of FABP7 and CRABP1 in NS cells, and the upregulation of CRMP2 in NS cells and neurons. RT-PCR results showed that CRMP2 and FABP7 mRNAs were also upregulated in NS cells, while CRABP1 mRNA was unchanged. These results provide insight into the molecular basis of monkey neural differentiation.",

The interplay of PRMT3-RPS2 homologs in yeast is important for regulating the ribosomal subunit ratio and assembly. Prmt3\u2013null mice display slower embryonic growth and development, although this phenotype is milder than in mouse RP gene knockouts. Defects in ribosome maturation are the hallmark of Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA). Sequencing of the PRMT3 gene in patients from the Czech DBA registry revealed a heterozygous mutation encoding the Tyr87Cys substitution. Although later analysis excluded this mutation as the cause of disease, we anticipated that this substitution might be important for PRMT3 function and decided to study it in detail. Tyr87 resides in a highly conserved substrate binding domain and has been predicted to be phosphorylated. To address the impact of putative Tyr87 phosphorylation on PRMT3 properties, we constructed two additional PRMT3 variants, Tyr87Phe and Tyr87Glu PRMT3, mimicking non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Tyr87, respectively. The Tyr87Cys and Tyr87Glu-PRMT3 variants had markedly decreased affinity to RPS2 and, consequently, reduced enzymatic activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. The activity of the Tyr87Phe-PRMT3 mutant remained unaffected. No evidence of Tyr87 phosphorylation was found using mass spectrometric analysis of purified PRMT3, although phosphorylation of serines 25 and 27 was observed. In conclusion, Tyr87 is important for the interaction between PRMT3 and RPS2 and for its full enzymatic activity.",

Then, recombinant SSL was expressed in E. coli and mutants were produced at positions Cys72 and Cys149. The SSL preparations were purified by metal-affinity chromatography and shown to be functional by carbohydrate-affinity chromatography. The recombinant SSL formed oligomers, which were evident by non-reducing covalent cross-linking and non-reducing SDS-PAGE; however, the band patterns were different for the mutants, with the maximal and predominant multimer sizes distinct from the wild-type recombinant lectin. Further examination of oligomerization by size exclusion chromatography revealed a subunit number from 35 to at least 110 for the wild-type recombinant SSL and subunit numbers below 9 for each mutant SSL oligomer.

Direct irradiation increased the expression of annexin max 3, creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in both strains and reduced annexin A4 in wild-type medaka only. In bystander fish, same strain pairings increased CK and LDH in both strains and increased annexin max 3 and annexin A4 in radiosensitive medaka. Mixed strain pairings revealed that, in bystander fish, annexin max 3 was only increased by a bystander signal originating from a radiosensitive source, annexin A4 was increased in radiosensitive bystanders irrespective of the signal source, and CK and LDH were increased if either the bystander signal origin or the recipient bystander fish was radiosensitive. Warm-temperature acclimation related 65-kDa protein (Wap65) was increased in all bystander medaka, whether they were paired with the same or opposite strain and chromosome 5 SR-like CTD-associated factor (SR\u00a0=\u00a0serine\u2013argenine-rich, CTD\u00a0=\u00a0C-terminal domain) (SCAF) protein was increased in radiosensitive bystander medaka only. Annexin A4, CK and LDH are associated with apoptosis and mirror the increase in apoptotic bodies previously reported in irradiated and bystander medaka, whereas increased Wap65 and LDH suggest a protective response. Thus the proteomic changes reported here could indicate both immediate protection and longer term adaptation to subsequent radiation exposure. In addition this investigation provides further evidence to show that the bystander signal can override the intrinsic genetically determined response and also that signal production and response can be modulated independently.",

Because the fusion of myoblasts is a unique phenomenon observed in skeletal muscle differentiation, the present study focused on the expression and activities of PRMTs during myoblast fusion in primary rat skeletal muscle. NG, NG-asymmetric dimethylarginines (aDMA) and NG, N\u2032G-symmetric dimethylarginines (sDMA) were both found consistently throughout myoblast fusion. However, PRMT1 exhibited the highest activity during myoblast fusion and maintained the elevated activity thereafter, whereas PRMT5 reached its highest activity only after myoblast fusion. To identify the proteins modified by such PRMTs, we conducted 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) of total proteins before and after myoblast fusion, and protein spots on the 2-DE gel immunoreactive for aDMA and sDMA were identified by mass spectrometric analysis. Among the proteins identified, lamin C2 was in particular observed to be dimethylated. Arginine methylation of lamin may therefore be important for muscle development and maintenance.",

     "abstract": "Mouse period homolog 2 (mPer2), an important transcriptional regulatory factor associated with circadian rhythms, is composed of two N-terminal PAS (PAS-A and PAS-B) domains and a C-terminal domain. The PAS-A domain of mPer2 binds the heme iron via a Cys axial ligand. A corresponding transcriptional regulatory factor, neuronal PAS 2 protein (NPAS2), also contains PAS-A and PAS-B domains at the N-terminus with heme-binding capability. In particular, the PAS-B domain appears important for protein\u2013protein interactions critical for transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we examined the heme-binding characteristics of the isolated PAS-B domain of mPer2. Our experiments show that the Fe(III) heme binds the isolated PAS-B domain with a heme to protein stoichiometry of 1:1. The Fe(III) protein complex is suggested to consist of an admixture of 6-coordinated His-bound high-spin and low-spin complexes. Marked pH-dependent spectral changes were observed, in contrast to the spectrum of the Fe(III) bound PAS-A domain of mPer2, which appeared pH-resistant. Treatment with diethylpyrocarbonate abolished the heme-binding ability of this protein, supporting the proposal that His is the axial ligand. Heme dissociation was composed of two phases with rate constants of 4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a04\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 (50%) and 4.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a03\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01 (50%), which were markedly higher than that (1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a07\u00a0s\u2212\u00a01) of the prototype heme protein, myoglobin. The Soret CD band of the H454A PAS-B mutant was significantly different from those of wild-type and other His mutant proteins, strongly suggesting that His454 is one of the axial ligands for the Fe(III) complex.",

In this article, we characterized individual residues in both non-myristoylated (non-myr) and myristoylated (myr) neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) that access alternate states by measuring nonlinear temperature dependence of the backbone amide-proton (1HN) chemical shifts. We found that ~\u00a020% of the residues in the protein access alternative conformations in non-myr case, which increases to ~\u00a028% for myr NCS-1. These residues are spread over the entire polypeptide stretch and include the edges of \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands, flexible loop regions, and the Ca2+-binding loops. Besides, residues responsible for the absence of Ca2+\u2013myristoyl switch are also found accessing alternative states. The C-terminal domain is more populated with these residues compared to its N-terminal counterpart. Individual EF-hands in NCS-1 show significantly different number of alternate states. This observation prompts us to conclude that this may lead to differences in their individual conformational flexibility and has implications on the functionality. Theoretical simulations reveal that these low-energy excited states are within an energy band of 2\u20134\u00a0kcal/mol with respect to the native state.",

LOX-1 exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer on the cell surface, which contains a pair of the ligand-binding domains (CTLD; C-type lectin-like domain). Recent research using living cells has suggested that the clustered state of LOX-1 dimer on the cell is functionally required. These results questioned how LOX-1 exists on the cell to achieve OxLDL binding. In this study, we revealed the functional significance of the clustered organization of the ligand-binding domain of LOX-1 with surface plasmon resonance. Biotinylated CTLD was immobilized on a streptavidin sensor chip to make CTLD clusters on the surface. In this state, the CTLD had high affinity for OxLDL with a dissociation constant (KD) in the nanomolar range. This value is comparable to the KD measured for LOX-1 on the cell. In contrast, a single homodimeric LOX-1 extracellular domain had lower affinity for OxLDL in the supra-micromolar range of KD. Monomeric CTLD showed marginal binding to OxLDL. In combination with the analyses on the loss-of-binding mutant W150A, we concluded that the clustered organization of the properly formed homodimeric CTLD is essential for the strong binding of LOX-1 to OxLDL.",

ProT\u03b1 is phosphorylated by a protein kinase (ProT\u03b1K), the activity of which is dependent on phosphorylation. ProT\u03b1 phosphorylation also correlates with cell proliferation. Mass spectrometric analysis of ProT\u03b1K purified from human tumor lymphocytes (NC37 cells) enabled us to identify this enzyme as the M2-type isoenzyme of pyruvate kinase. A study on the relationship between ProT\u03b1K activity and pyruvate kinase isoforms in NC37 cells and in other cell types confirmed that the M2 isoform is the enzyme responsible for ProT\u03b1K activity in proliferating cells. Yet, about 10% of the cellular pool of the M2 isoform shows specific affinity for ProT\u03b1 and is responsible for ProT\u03b1K activity. This pool of M2 protein possesses no observable pyruvate kinase activity and changes its responses to various effectors of pyruvate kinase activity; however, these responses to PK effectors are maintained by the main cellular fraction containing the M2 isoform. Acquisition of ProT\u03b1K activity by M2 seems to be due to the phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, which, besides being essential for its catalytic activity, induces a trimeric association of ProT\u03b1K. This association can be shifted to a tetrameric form by fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, which results in a decrease in ProT\u03b1K activity.",

It is a disulfide bridged dimer with each monomer containing a light and a heavy polypeptide and its biosynthesis and intracellular transport includes several posttranslational processing steps. By contrast, MPO recombinantly produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines is monomeric, partially unprocessed and contains a N-terminal propeptide (proMPO). It mirrors a second form of MPO constitutively secreted from normal bone marrow myeloid precursors. In order to clarify the impact of posttranslational modifications on the structural integrity and enzymology of these two forms of human myeloperoxidase, we have undertaken an investigation on the conformational and thermal stability of leukocyte MPO and recombinant proMPO by using complementary biophysical techniques including UV-Vis, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy as well as differential scanning calorimetry. Mature leucocyte MPO exhibits a peculiar high chemical and thermal stability under oxidizing conditions but is significantly destabilized by addition of dithiothreitol. Unfolding of secondary and tertiary structure occurs concomitantly with denaturation of the heme cavity, reflecting the role of three MPO-typical heme to protein linkages and of six intra-chain disulfides for structural integrity by bridging N- and C-terminal regions of the protein. Recombinant monomeric proMPO follows a similar unfolding pattern but has a lower conformational and thermal stability.

Kinetic constants for nucleation and extension phases of aggregation were then estimated by direct measurement and mathematical simulation. Kinetic analysis revealed that pseudophosphorylation increased tau aggregation rate by increasing the rate of filament nucleation. In addition, it increased aggregation propensity by stabilizing mature filaments against disaggregation. The data suggest that incorporation of negative charge into the T212 site can directly promote tau filament formation at multiple steps in the aggregation pathway.",

     "abstract": "To gain more complete insight into flexibility and malleability of five forms of human liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, which play major roles in drug metabolism (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4), we employed UV/VIS and resonance Raman spectroscopy in combination with all-atomic molecular dynamics simulations under normal and high pressure conditions (300\u00a0MPa). In general, the high pressure reduces the flexibility of CYPs, which become more dense and compact as their radii of gyration and temperature B-factors diminish. The flexibility of CYPs spans the regions, which are localized in solvent exposed loops. A considerable degree of flexibility is also observed at amino-acids making the pw2 and solvent channels, which are suggested to serve for substrate access and/or product release. The number of water molecules as well as the number of protein backbone atoms of the active site in close proximity of heme cofactor generally increases under high pressure. This finding provides new insights regarding the interpretation of pressure-related Soret band red shifts. Presented results also point towards considerable differences between the CYP forms studied: CYP2A6 and CYP1A2 have the least malleable active sites while those of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 have considerably greater degrees of flexibility or malleability. In addition, the number of water molecules in the active site cavity of CYP3A4 anomalously decreases under high pressure due to opening of the active site. These results correlate with the known substrate promiscuity of the respective CYP forms, with CYP3A4 displaying the highest substrate promiscuity, corresponding to the most open and malleable active site, whereas CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 show a high substrate-specificity and have a small and rigid active sites.",

CYP144 demonstrates heme thiolate coordination in its ferric form, but the cysteinate is protonated to thiol in both the carbon monoxide-bound and ligand-free ferrous forms (forming P420 in the former). Tight binding of various azole drugs was shown, with affinity for miconazole (Kd\u00a0=\u00a00.98\u00a0\u03bcM), clotrimazole (0.37\u00a0\u03bcM) and econazole (0.78\u00a0\u03bcM) being highest. These azoles are also the trio with the highest affinity for the essential CYP121 and for the cholesterol oxidase CYP125 (essential for host infection), and have high potency as anti-mycobacterial drugs. Construction of a Mtb gene knockout strain demonstrated that CYP144 is not essential for growth in vitro. However the deletion strain was more sensitive to azole inhibition in culture suggesting an important role for CYP144 in cell physiology and/or in mediating azole resistance. The biophysical and genetic features of CYP144 are compared to those of other characterized Mtb P450s, identifying both commonality in properties (including thiolate protonation in ferrous P450s) and intriguing differences in thermodynamic and spectroscopic features.

     "abstract": "Cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic pathways contain several branching points towards physiologically active molecules, such as coenzyme Q, vitamin D, glucocorticoid and steroid hormones, oxysterols, or bile acids. Sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are involved in maintenance of the homeostasis of not only cholesterol but also other cholesterogenic molecules. In addition to endogenous cues, cholesterol homeostasis needs to accommodate also to exogenous cues that are imported into the body, such as chemicals and medications. Steroid and nuclear receptors together with sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) mediate the fine tuning of biosynthetic and metabolic routes as well as transports of cholesterol and its derivatives. Similarly, drug/xenobiotic metabolism is the subject to the feedback regulation of cytochrome P450 enzymes and transporters. The regulatory mechanisms that maintain the homeostasis of cholesterogenic molecules and are involved in drug metabolism share similarities. Cholesterol and cholesterogenic compounds (bile acids, glucocorticoids, vitamin D, etc.) regulate the xenosensor signaling in drug-mediated induction of the major drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes. The key cellular receptors, pregnane X receptor (PXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) provide a functional cross-talk between the pathways maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and controlling the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes. These receptors serve as metabolic sensors, resulting in a coordinate regulation of cholesterogenic compounds metabolism and of the defense against xenobiotic and endobiotic toxicity.

Since it is not exclusively expressed in the fetus but also in a significant number of adults, CYP3A7 has been moving into the focus of investigation on adverse drug reactions and interindividual differences in drug metabolism in the last few years. In addition, CYP3A7 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to the elimination of drugs. We here report the development of a convenient and reliable whole-cell system for testing CYP3A7 activity using recombinant fission yeast. As expected, catalytic properties of wild type CYP3A7.1 and its polymorphic form CYP3A7.2 towards DHEA and testosterone resembled those reported previously. Interestingly, both isoforms of CYP3A7 did not metabolize the anti-cancer drug sorafenib (which is approved for the treatment of HCC), while CYP3A4 produced the N-oxide in our system, as expected. This finding suggests that CYP3A7 activity does not influence the effectiveness of this anti-cancer drug against HCC. Furthermore, CYP3A7-expressing fission yeast cells specifically converted a luciferin-derivate (luciferin-PFBE) to a luminescent product and this activity can conveniently be monitored by spectrometry, which allowed the determination of IC50-values for the broad-range P450 inhibitors econazole and miconazole, respectively. We believe that these new tools for a fast and easy investigation of substrates and inhibitors of human CYP3A7 will contribute to the gain of important insights for drug metabolism, efficacy and safety.",

     "abstract": "Several epidemiological studies associate certain CYP1A1 genotypes, alone or in combination, with an increased risk of estrogen-related cancers. Previously we demonstrated that metabolic activation of estrogens by CYP1A1 is a genotype-dependent reaction with the CYP1A1.2 (Ile462Val) variant being the most efficient catalyst (Kisselev et al.). To answer the question whether genotype-dependent inhibition of activation of estrogens by CYP1A1 could also contribute, we studied the inhibition of hydroxylation activity of the most common allelic variants of human CYP1A1 towards 17\u03b2-estradiol. We expressed and purified CYP1A1.1 (wild-type), CYP1A1.2 (Ile462Val), and CYP1A1.4 (Thr461Asn) and performed inhibition assays by natural polyphenols of our diet and drugs of NADPH-dependent estradiol hydroxylation in reconstituted CYP1A1 systems. From the polyphenols studied, a St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) extract, some of its main single constituents hypericin, pseudohypericin, and quercetin, as well as the flavonols kaempferol, myricetin and the phytoestrogens resveratrol and tetramethyl-stilbene exhibited strong inhibition. For the St. John's Wort extract and its single constituents hypericin, pseudohypericin, and quercetin, inhibition exhibited a remarkable dependency on the CYP1A1 genotype. Whereas (wild-type) CYP1A1.1 was most inhibited by the whole crude extract, the variant CYP1A1.2 (Ile462Val) was significantly stronger inhibited by the constituents in its pure form: IC50 values for 2-hydroxylation was more than two times lower compared with the wild-type enzyme and the variant CYP1A1.4 (Thr461Asn). Besides this, the inhibition exhibited a remarkable regioselectivity.

     "abstract": "An antineoplastic alkaloid ellipticine is a prodrug, whose pharmacological efficiency is dependent on its cytochrome P450 (CYP)- and/or peroxidase-mediated activation in target tissues. The aim of this review was to summarize our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of ellipticine action in the cancer cells. The CYP-mediated ellipticine metabolites 9-hydroxy- and 7-hydroxyellipticine and the product of ellipticine oxidation by peroxidases, the ellipticine dimer, are the detoxication metabolites of this compound. In contrast, two carbenium ions, ellipticine-13-ylium and ellipticine-12-ylium, derived from two activation ellipticine metabolites, 13-hydroxyellipticine and 12-hydroxyellipticine, generate two major deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA found in the human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells, leukemia HL-60 and CCRF-CEM cells, neuroblastoma IMR-32, UKF-NB-3, and UKF-NB-4 cells and glioblastoma U87MG cells in vitro and in rat breast carcinoma in vivo. Formation of these covalent DNA adducts by ellipticine is the predominant mechanism of its cytotoxicity and anti-tumor activity to these cancer cell lines. Ellipticine is also an inducer of CYP1A, 1B1, and 3A4 enzymes in the cancer cells and/or in vivo in rats exposed to this compound, thus modulating its own pharmacological efficiencies. The study forms the basis to further predict the susceptibility of human cancers to ellipticine and suggests that this alkaloid for treatment in combination with CYP and/or peroxidase gene transfer increasing the anticancer potential of this prodrug. It also suggests ellipticine reactive metabolites 13-hydroxyellipticine and 12-hydroxyellipticine to be good candidates for targeting to tumors absent from the CYP and peroxidase activation enzymes.",

     "abstract": "From earliest development on, the vitamin D receptor (VDR) is expressed in most cells of the mammalian body. The VDR is a nuclear, ligand-induced transcription factor that regulates in complex with hormonally active vitamin D the expression of more than 900 genes involved in a wide array of physiological functions (e.g. calcium homeostasis, growth control, differentiation, cognition, immune response, etc.). Accordingly, severe health problems are associated to vitamin deficiencies. Synthesis of the major active form 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 from vitamin D and subsequent metabolism are exclusively controlled by specific P450-forms. Synthesis, a two-step process, starts with a 25-hydroxylation primarily by CYP2R1 (CYP27A1, CYP2J2, and CYP3A4 may also contribute) and a subsequent 1\u03b1-hydroxylation via CYP27B1. Circulating in the bloodstream, 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 acts at sites of VDR expression (target sites) in an endocrine way. However, it is also capable of autocrine/paracrine functions since various target tissues are fully competent in 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis, as illustrated by three examples. 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3 levels are short-lived: the hormone upregulates its rapid metabolism by CYP24A1 that attacks repeatedly the vitamin D C20\u201327 side chain, thereby producing a complex cascade of transient metabolites with increasing polarity. Most of these metabolites still retain 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3-like activities on the VDR, contributing to the overall effect that is commonly attributed to 1\u03b1,25(OH)2D3. As selective inhibitors of CYP24A1 increase the lifetime and thereby the function of vitamin D metabolites, they will help exploring whether and which intrinsic activities distinct metabolites possess. It appears likely that this strategy may unmask important regulators of new functions.",

As discussed in the present review, virtually all of the major AA metabolizing CYP isoforms accept a variety of other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including linoleic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA), as efficient alternative substrates. The metabolites of these alternative PUFAs also elicit profound biological effects. The CYP enzymes respond to alterations in the chain-length and double bond structure of their substrates with remarkable changes in the regio- and stereoselectivity of product formation. The omega-3 double bond that distinguishes EPA and DHA from their omega-6 counterparts provides a preferred epoxidation site for CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP2J and CYP2E subfamily members. CYP4A enzymes that predominantly function as AA \u03c9-hydroxylases show largely increased (\u03c9-1)-hydroxylase activities towards EPA and DHA. Taken together, these findings indicate that CYP-dependent signaling pathways are highly susceptible to changes in the relative bioavailability of the different PUFAs and may provide novel insight into the complex mechanisms that link essential dietary fatty acids to the development of cardiovascular disease.",

Significant improvements in homogeneity and stability of these preparations open new possibilities for detailed analysis of equilibrium and steady-state kinetic characteristics of catalytic mechanisms of human cytochromes P450 involved in xenobiotic metabolism and in steroid biosynthesis.

XplA along with its partnering reductase XplB are plasmid encoded and the gene xplA has now been found in divergent genera across the globe with near sequence identity. Importantly, it has only been detected at explosives contaminated sites suggesting rapid dissemination of this novel catabolic activity, possibly within the 50-year period since the introduction of RDX into the environment. The X-ray structure of XplA-heme has been solved, providing fundamental information on the heme binding site. Interestingly, oxygen is not required for the degradation of RDX, but its presence determines the final degradation products, demonstrating that the degradation chemistry is flexible with both anaerobic and aerobic pathways resulting in the release of nitrite from the substrate. Transgenic plants expressing xplA are able to remove saturating levels of RDX from soil leachate and may provide a low cost sustainable remediation strategy for contaminated military sites.",

     "abstract": "Improving the electrochemical performance of cytochrome P450 enzymes is highly desirable due to their versatility in the recognition of different biological and xenobiotic compounds. The task poses an exciting challenge because it leads not only to the acquisition of fundamental knowledge on the redox properties of these enzymes, but it also opens opportunities for technological and commercial applications. Interfacing these enzymes to electrode surfaces and electrochemically driving their catalytic cycle has proven to be very difficult. Initial attempts made by several groups included the direct immobilisation of these enzymes on electrode surfaces and omission of their redox partners for simplification of their electron transfer pathway. The data obtained in these cases generally resulted in a high heterogeneous electron transfer rate but without success in terms of detectable substrate turnover. The breakthrough in electrocatalysis has been made when both the electrode and the enzyme have been engineered, in some cases mimicking the natural environment of the microsomal enzymes and the inclusion of their electron transfer partners. This paper reviews and discusses the recent literature on this subject, and highlights the different approaches that have led to an unprecedented advancement of this area of research.",

One of the successful applications of P450 reactions is the bioconversion of vitamin D3 to 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Recently, a cytochrome P450 gene encoding a vitamin D hydroxylase from the CYP107 family was cloned from Pseudonocardia autotrophica and is now applied in the bioconversion process that produces 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In addition, the directed evolution study of CYP107 has significantly enhanced its activity. On the other hand, we found that Streptomyces griseolus CYP105A1 can convert vitamin D3 to 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Site-directed mutagenesis of CYP105A1 based on its crystal structure dramatically enhanced its activity. To date, multiple vitamin D hydroxylases have been found in bacteria, fungi, and mammals, suggesting that vitamin D is a popular substrate of the enzymes belonging to the P450 superfamily. A combination of these cytochrome P450s would produce a large number of compounds from vitamin D and its analogs. Therefore, we believe that the bioconversion of vitamin D and its analogs is one of the most promising P450 reactions in terms of practical application.",

E. coli flavodoxin reductase (FdR) was used as a redox partner, since flavodoxin reductase CacFdR (CAC0196) from C. acetobutylicum could not be purified in a functional form. CacFld1 was shown to accept electrons from FdR and transfer them to CYP152A2. Since H2O2 was generated by uncoupling at different stages of the reconstituted electron transfer chain, catalase was used as H2O2 scavenger in order to exclude peroxygenation by CYP152A2. The reconstituted P450 system with CacFld1 and FdR oxidized myristic acid with a KM of 137\u00a0\u03bcM and a kcat of 36\u00a0min\u22121. Furthermore, the hydroxylase activity of CYP152A2 towards myristic acid with CacFld1 was 17-fold higher than without CacFld1. Along with CYP152A2 and a physiological flavodoxin reductase, CacFld1 is therefore likely to be involved in oxygen detoxification in C. acetobutylicum.

We show that different degrees of structural order are present in the different regions of HES-1. The isolated bHLH domain is only marginally stable in solution, and partially folds upon dimerization. Binding to DNA promotes folding, stabilization, and protection from proteolysis of the bHLH domain. The Orange domain, on the contrary, is well folded in all conditions, forms stable dimers, and greatly increases protein resistance to thermal denaturation. The isolated proline-rich C-terminal region is mainly disordered in solution, and remains unstructured also in the full length protein. Measurements of binding constants show that HES-1 recognizes dsDNA synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to several functional DNA targets with high affinity, but with relatively little specificity. We propose that order/disorder transitions in the different domains are associated not only with binding to DNA, but also with protein homo- and hetero-dimerization.",

     "abstract": "In order to fully explore the structure\u2013function relationship of a Proteus lipase (LipK107) that was screened from the soil in our previous study, we have modeled the three-dimensional (3-D) structures of the enzyme in its active and inactive conformations on the basis of crystal structures of Burkholderia glumae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipases in the present study. Both homology models suggested that LipK107 possessed a catalytic triad (Ser79\u2013Asp232\u2013H254), an oxyanion hole (Leu13 and Gln80) which was used to stabilize the reaction tetrahedral intermediates, and a lid substructure that controlled the access of the substrate to the active site. The existence of the lid was further verified by carrying out the interfacial activation experiment. The conformational change of LipK107 which was caused by lid opening action was predicted by superimposing the two theoretical models for the first time. Finally, both 3-D structures were used to predict the enantioselectivity of LipK107 when the enzyme was used to catalyze the resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol. Lid-open model of LipK107 identified the R-enantiomer as the preferred enantiomer, while lid-closed mode showed that the S-enantiomer was more favored. However, only the lid-open conformational model could led to predictions that agreed with the following the experimental result of real biocatalysis reaction of 1-phenylethanol.",

Such an activity on innate immune cells triggers a synovial fluid Th17 response. Here we report the crystal structure of NapA, determined at 2.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution, which shows that the quaternary structure of the protein is that of a dodecamer with 23 symmetry, typical of the proteins of the family. We also demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal tails, which are flexible and not visible in the crystal, are not relevant for its pro-Th17 activity. Based on the crystal structure and on the comparison with the structure of the orthologous protein from Helicobacter pylori, HP-NAP, we hypothesize that the charge distributions on the two proteins' surfaces are responsible for the interaction with TLR2 and for the different behaviors in modulating the immune response.",

     "abstract": "In mammals, the pyrimidines uracil and thymine are metabolised by a three-step reductive degradation pathway. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) catalyses its first and rate-limiting step, reducing uracil and thymine to the corresponding 5,6-dihydropyrimidines in an NADPH-dependent reaction. The enzyme is an adjunct target in cancer therapy since it rapidly breaks down the anti-cancer drug 5-fluorouracil and related compounds. Five residues located in functionally important regions were targeted in mutational studies to investigate their role in the catalytic mechanism of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase from pig. Pyrimidine binding to this enzyme is accompanied by active site loop closure that positions a catalytically crucial cysteine (C671) residue. Kinetic characterization of corresponding enzyme mutants revealed that the deprotonation of the loop residue H673 is required for active site closure, while S670 is important for substrate recognition. Investigations on selected residues involved in binding of the redox cofactors revealed that the first FeS cluster, with unusual coordination, cannot be reduced and displays no activity when Q156 is mutated to glutamate, and that R235 is crucial for FAD binding.",

Expression of human GAPDS in E.coli cells yields inactive and insoluble protein. Presumably, the N-terminal domain prevents correct folding of the full-length recombinant enzyme. To obtain GAPDS in a soluble and active form, a recombinant enzyme lacking in 68 amino acids of the N-terminal domain (dN-GAPDS) was expressed in E.coli cells. Purified dN-GAPDS was shown to be a protein of 9.3\u00a0nm in diameter (by dynamic light scattering), which is close to the size of the muscle tetrameric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (8.6\u00a0nm). The catalytic properties of the protein differed a little from those of the muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phoshate dehydrogenase. However, compared to muscle glyceraldehyde-3-phoshate dehydrogenase, dN-GAPDS exhibited enhanced thermostability (the transition midpoints values are 60.8 and 67.4\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively) and was much more resistant towards action of guanidine hydrochloride (inactivation constants are 2.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.018 and 0.118\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.008\u00a0min\u2212\u00a01, respectively). The enhanced stability of dN-GAPDS is likely to be related to some specific features of the GAPDS structure compared to that of the muscle enzyme: 1) reduced number of solvent-exposed salt bridges; 2) 2 additional buried salt bridges; and 3) 6 additional proline residues in GAPDS meeting the \u201cproline rule\u201d. It is assumed that high stability of the sperm-specific GAPDS is of importance for the efficiency of fertilization.",

     "abstract": "AtTDX is an enzyme present in Arabidopsis thaliana which is composed of two domains, a thioredoxin (Trx)-motif containing domain and a tetratricopeptide (TPR)-repeat domain. This enzyme has been shown to function as both a thioredoxin and a chaperone. The midpoint potential (Em) of AtTDX was determined by redox titrations using the thiol-specific modifiers, monobromobimane (mBBr) and mal-PEG. A NADPH/Trx reductase (NTR) system was used both to validate these Em determination methods and to demonstrate that AtTDX is an electron-accepting substrate for NTR. Titrations of full-length AtTDX revealed the presence of a single two-electron couple with an Em value of approximately \u2212260\u00a0mV at pH 7.0. The two cysteines present in a typical, conserved Trx active site (WCGPC), which are likely to play a role in the electron transfer processes catalyzed by AtTDX, have been replaced by serines by site-directed mutagenesis. These replacements (i.e., C304S, C307S, and C304S/C307S) resulted in a complete loss of the redox process detected using either the mBBr or mal-PEG method to monitor disulfide/dithiol redox couples. This result supports the conclusion that the couple with an Em value of \u2212260\u00a0mV is a disulfide/dithiol couple involving Cys304 and Cys307. Redox titrations for the separately-expressed Trx-motif containing C-domain also revealed the presence of a single two-electron couple with an Em value of approximately \u2212260\u00a0mV at 20\u00a0\u00b0C. The fact that these two Em values are identical, provides additional support for assignment of the redox couple to a disulfide/dithiol involving C304 and C307. It was found that, while the disulfide/dithiol redox chemistry of AtTDX was not affected by increasing the temperature to 40\u00a0\u00b0C, no redox transitions were observed at 50\u00a0\u00b0C and higher temperatures. In contrast, Escherichia coli thioredoxin was shown to remain redox-active at temperatures as high as 60\u00a0\u00b0C. The temperature-dependence of the AtTDX redox titration is similar to that observed for the redox activity of the protein in enzymatic assays.",

The Gly28:Ser mutation produces a dramatic four-fold increase in its kcat and a remarkable increase in its stability. While the increase in kcat is temperature-independent, the increase in stability shows that the resultant interactions of this mutation have a strong enthalpic component. Thermal dependence of stability, kcat, KM and kcat/KM were analysed to gain insight on the structural effects of mutations on BplA. Our results are consistent with a gain in enzyme mobility for those mutants displaying enhanced catalytic properties; the analysis of thermal dependence of kinetic parameters indicates that the mutations did not change either the catalytic mechanism or the rate-limiting step of catalysis.",

     "abstract": "Cytosolic glutathione transferases (GSTs) are major detoxification enzymes in aerobes. Each subunit has two distinct domains and an active site consisting of a G-site for binding GSH and an H-site for an electrophilic substrate. While the active site is located at the domain interface, the role of the stability of this interface in the catalytic function of GSTs is poorly understood. Domain 1 of class alpha GSTs has a conserved tryptophan (Trp21) in helix 1 that forms a major interdomain contact with helices 6 and 8 in domain 2. Replacing Trp21 with an alanine is structurally non-disruptive but creates a cavity between helices 1, 6 and 8 thus reducing the packing density and van der Waals contacts at the domain interface. This results in destabilization of the protein and a marked reduction in catalytic activity. While functionality at the G-site is not adversely affected by the W21A mutation, the H-site becomes more accessible to solvent and less favorable for the electrophilic substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). Not only does the mutation result in a reduction in the energy for stabilizing the transition state formed in the SNAr reaction between the substrates GSH and CDNB, it also compromises the ability of the enzyme to form and stabilize a transition state analogue (Meisenheimer complex) formed between GSH and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (TNB). The study demonstrates that the stability of the domain\u2013domain interface plays a role in mediating the catalytic functionality of the active site, particularly the H-site, of class alpha GSTs.",

     "abstract": "Glycolysis represents one of the best-understood and most ancient metabolic pathways. In skeletal muscle fibres, energy for contraction is supplied by adenosine triphosphate via anaerobic glycolysis, the phosphocreatine shuttle and oxidative phosphorylation. In this respect, the anaerobic glycolytic pathway supports short duration performances of contractile tissues of high intensity. The catalytic elements associated with glycolysis are altered during development, muscle differentiation, physiological adaptations and many pathological mechanisms, such as muscular dystrophy, diabetes mellitus and age-related muscle weakness. Although gel electrophoresis-based proteomics is afflicted with various biological and technical problems, it is an ideal analytical tool for studying the abundant and mostly soluble enzymes that constitute the glycolytic system. This review critically examines the proteomic findings of recent large-scale studies of glycolytic enzymes and associated components in normal, transforming and degenerating muscle tissues. In the long term, proteins belonging to the glycolytic pathway may be useful as biomarkers of muscle adaptations and pathophysiological mechanisms and can be employed to improve diagnostics and in the identification of novel therapeutic targets in neuromuscular disorders.",

To compare the phenolase (monooxygenase) reactivity, the reactivity of the isolated subunits has been examined quantitatively by using a simplified catalytic system, where the initial product catechol is trapped with borate anion of the buffer solution to prevent following catecholase reaction (Yamazaki and Itoh, 2003). The far-UV region CD spectra were measured in order to clarify the relationship between the content of the secondary structure and the phenolase reactivity.

Over 500 nuclear encoded proteins are imported into the organelle that is now recognized as an important therapeutic target. These proteins contain an N-terminal transit peptide sequence essential for apicoplast targeting during which the P. falciparum Hsp70-1 plays an important role. In the present study, we have focused on the in vitro interactions of PfHsp70-1 with synthetic peptides endowed with transit peptide like features. The peptides exhibit higher affinity for PfHsp70-1 in the presence of ADP compared to ATP. The results highlight the positional importance of selected residues in the designed peptides for affinity. They suggest that better peptide affinity for the protein requires a Lys at second position, retention of aromatic residue at the last position, and absence of acidic residues at any position in the transit peptides. Overall, the present work is the first in vitro fluorescence-based study of PfHsp70-1 with peptides possessing transit peptide-like features.",

Consequently, imatinib is used as front-line therapy for this disease. A major concern in imatinib treatment is the emergence of resistance to the drug. Here we used the imatinib-resistant KCL22R and imatinib-sensitive KCL22S cells in which none of the known resistance mechanisms has been detected and hence novel Bcr-Abl activity-independent mechanisms could be envisaged. We characterized proteins that were differentially expressed between the KCL22R and KCL22S cells. Using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis we identified 51 differentially expressed proteins: 27 were over-expressed and 24 were under-expressed in KCL22R versus KCL22S cells. Several of these proteins are likely to be involved in such survival mechanisms as modulation of redox balance and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways mediated by NF-\u03baB and Ras-MAPK signaling. The data reported may be useful for further studies on mechanisms of imatinib resistance and for the screening of biomarkers to develop new combinatorial therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "The clam Lucina pectinalis supports its symbiotic bacteria by H2S transport in the open and accessible heme pocket of Lucina Hb I and by O2 transport in the narrow and crowded heme pocket of Lucina Hb II. Remarkably, air-equilibrated samples of Lucina Hb I were found to be more rapidly oxidized by nitrite than any previously studied Hb, while those of Lucina Hb II showed an unprecedented resistance to oxidation induced by nitrite. Nitrite-induced oxidation of Lucina Hb II was enabled only when O2 was removed from its active site. Structural analysis revealed that O2 \u201cclams up\u201d the active site by hydrogen bond formation to B10Tyr and other distal-side residues. Quaternary effects further restrict nitrite entry into the active site and stabilize the hydrogen-bonding network in oxygenated Lucina Hb II dimers. The dramatic differences in nitrite reactivities of the Lucina Hbs are not related to their O2 affinities or anaerobic redox potentials, which were found to be similar, but are instead a result of differences in accessibility of nitrite to their active sites; i.e. these differences are due to a kinetic rather than thermodynamic effect. Comparative studies revealed heme accessibility to be a factor in human Hb oxidation by nitrite as well, as evidenced by variations of rates of nitrite-induced oxidation that do not correlate with R and T state differences and inhibition of oxidation rate in the presence of O2. These results provide a dramatic illustration of how evolution of active sites with varied heme accessibility can moderate the rates of inner-sphere oxidative reactions of Hb and other heme proteins.",

Comparison of similarly liganded complexes of Plasmodium falciparum, mouse and Escherichia coli AdSS reveals H-bonding interactions involving nonconserved catalytic loop residues (Asn429, Lys62 and Thr307) that are unique to the parasite enzyme. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to examine the role of these interactions in catalysis and structural organization of P. falciparum adenylosuccinate synthetase (PfAdSS). Mutation of Asn429 to Val, Lys62 to Leu and Thr307 to Val resulted in an increase in Km values for IMP, GTP and aspartate, respectively along with a 5 fold drop in the kcat value for N429V mutant suggesting the role of these residues in ligand binding and/or catalysis. We have earlier shown that the glycolytic intermediate, fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, which is an inhibitor of mammalian AdSS is an activator of the parasite enzyme. Enzyme kinetics along with molecular docking suggests a mechanism for activation wherein F16BP seems to be binding to the Asp loop and inducing a conformation that facilitates aspartate binding to the enzyme active site. Like in other AdSS, a conserved arginine residue (Arg155) is involved in dimer crosstalk and interacts with IMP in the active site of the symmetry related subunit of PfAdSS. We also report on the biochemical characterization of the arginine mutants (R155L, R155K and R155A) which suggests that unlike in E. coli AdSS, Arg155 in PfAdSS influences both ligand binding and catalysis.",

A detailed analysis from diverse viewpoints including the influence of the particular amino acid sequence, conformational aspects as well as the associated motions yields a global picture that is consistent with experimental evidence and theoretical studies published elsewhere. Patterns of modes that remain stable over a range of temperatures might serve as an additional diagnostic to identify conformations that have reliably adopted a native fold.

Con-Alz consists of 3 copies of the 43 residues of the A\u03b2 peptide separated by the P2 and P30 T-cell epitopes from the tetanus toxin. Even in the presence of high concentrations of denaturants or fluorinated alcohols, Con-Alz has a very high propensity to form aggregates which slowly coalesce over time with changes in secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. Only micellar concentrations of SDS were able to inhibit aggregation. The increase in the ability to bind the fibril-binding dye ThT increases without lag time, which is characteristic of relatively amorphous aggregates. Confirming this, electron microscopy reveals that Con-Alz adopts a morphology resembling truncated protofibrils after prolonged incubation, but it is unable to assemble into classical amyloid fibrils. Despite its high propensity to aggregate, Con-Alz does not show any significant ability to permeabilize vesicles, which for fibrillating proteins is taken to be a key factor in aggregate cytotoxicity and is attributed to oligomers formed at an early stage in the fibrillation process. Physically linking multiple copies of the A\u03b2-peptide may thus sterically restrict Con-Alz against forming cytotoxic oligomers, forcing it instead to adopt a less well-organized assembly of intermeshed polypeptide chains.",

Here we report the crystal structure of CtCBM42A together with the biochemical characterization of two other members of family 42 CBMs from Clostridium thermocellum. CtCBM42A, CtCBM42B and CtCBM42C bind specifically to the arabinose side-chains of arabinoxylans and arabinan, suggesting that various cellulosomal components are targeted to these regions of the plant cell wall. The structure of CtCBM42A displays a beta-trefoil fold, which comprises 3 sub-domains designated as \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3. Each one of the three sub-domains presents a putative carbohydrate-binding pocket where an aspartate residue located in a central position dominates ligand recognition. Intriguingly, the \u03b3 sub-domain of CtCBM42A is pivotal for arabinoxylan binding, while the concerted action of \u03b2 and \u03b3 sub-domains of CtCBM42B and CtCBM42C is apparently required for ligand sequestration. Thus, this work reveals that the binding mechanism of CBM42 members is in contrast with that of homologous CBM13s where recognition of complex polysaccharides results from the cooperative action of three protein sub-domains presenting similar affinities.",

The replacement of the seven charged amino acid residues with a hydrophobic amino acid around the zinc ion did not cause any significant changes in Km values or in the substrate specificity.

     "abstract": "Zinc metallopeptidases are ubiquitous enzymes with diverse cellular functions that can be found in most organisms. Leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H; E.C. 3.3.2.6) is an unusual zinc metallopeptidase of the M1 family that also possesses an epoxide hydrolase activity; however, the role of its peptidase activity remains unknown. To further characterize the peptidase activity of LTA4H and other closely related metallopeptidases, a multiple sequence alignment and predicted structure were used to target three amino acid residues of yeast LTA4H for mutagenesis: Asn362, Trp365, and Asp399. Although mutating Trp365 and Asp399 had little effect on catalysis, altering Asn362 had varying effects on catalysis, depending on the replacement residue. Mutation of Asn362 to glutamine (N362Q) caused minor catalytic defects, while mutation to leucine (N362L) or glutamate (N362E) caused large reductions in activity. Both N362L and N362E also exhibited an altered pH dependence of catalysis, reduced chloride activation, and reduced zinc affinity and content, indicating that Asn362 may interact with the nearby zinc coordinating residue His344, and possibly with Glu363 as well, to polarize and/or orient these residues.",

Deposits of \u03b1-synuclein called Lewy bodies are a hallmark of this disorder, which is implicated in its progression. In order to understand the mechanism of amyloid fibril formation of \u03b1-synuclein in more detail, in this study we have isolated a specific, ~\u00a020 residue peptide region of the \u03b1-synuclein fibril core, using a combination of Edman degradation and mass-spectroscopy analyses of protease-resistant samples. Starting from this core peptide sequence, we then synthesized a series of peptides that undergo aggregation and fibril formation under similar conditions. Interestingly, in a derivative peptide where a crucial phenylalanine residue was changed to a glycine, the ability to initiate spontaneous fibril formation was abolished, while the ability to extend from preexisting fibril seeds was conserved. This fibril extension occurred irrespective of the source of the initial fibril seed, as demonstrated in experiments using fibril seeds of insulin, lysozyme, and GroES. This interesting ability suggests that this peptide might form the basis for a possible diagnostic tool useful in detecting the presence of various fibrillogenic factors.",

     "abstract": "The functional characterization of proteins represents a daily challenge for biochemical, medical and computational sciences. Although finally proved on the bench, the function of a protein can be successfully predicted by computational approaches that drive the further experimental assays. Current methods for comparative modeling allow the construction of accurate 3D models for proteins of unknown structure, provided that a crystal structure of a homologous protein is available. Binding regions can be proposed by using binding site predictors, data inferred from homologous crystal structures, and data provided from a careful interpretation of the multiple sequence alignment of the investigated protein and its homologs. Once the location of a binding site has been proposed, chemical ligands that have a high likelihood of binding can be identified by using ligand docking and structure-based virtual screening of chemical libraries. Most docking algorithms allow building a list sorted by energy of the lowest energy docking configuration for each ligand of the library. In this review the state-of-the-art of computational approaches in 3D protein comparative modeling and in the study of protein\u2013ligand interactions is provided. Furthermore a possible combined/concerted multistep strategy for protein function prediction, based on multiple sequence alignment, comparative modeling, binding region prediction, and structure-based virtual screening of chemical libraries, is described by using suitable examples. As practical examples, Abl-kinase molecular modeling studies, HPV-E6 protein multiple sequence alignment analysis, and some other model docking-based characterization reports are briefly described to highlight the importance of computational approaches in protein function prediction.",

     "abstract": "Dystrophin is one of a number of large cytoskeleton associated proteins that connect between various cytoskeletal elements and often are tethered to the membrane through other transmembrane protein complexes. These cytolinker proteins often provide structure and support to the cells where they are expressed, and mutations in genes encoding these proteins frequently gives rise to disease. Dystrophin is no exception in any of these respects, providing connections between a transmembrane complex known as the dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex and the underlying cytoskeleton. The most established connection and possibly the most important is that to F-actin, but more recently evidence has been forthcoming of connections to membrane phospholipids, intermediate filaments and microtubules. Moreover it is becoming increasingly clear that the multiple spectrin-like repeats in the centre of the molecule, that had hitherto been thought to be largely redundant, harbour binding activities that have a significant impact on dystrophin functionality. This functionality is particularly apparent when assessed by the ability to rescue the dystrophic phenotype in mdx mice. This review will focus on the relatively neglected but functionally vital coiled-coil region of dystrophin, highlighting the structural relationships and interactions of the coiled-coil region and providing new insights into the functional role of this region.",

Atomic force microscopy allows single-molecule imaging and monitorization of the status of FurA under different redox conditions mimicking a physiological environment. The estimated FurA average diameter was of 4\u00a0nm. In the absence of reducing agents, the purified FurA is mainly associated as trimers, being 40\u00b0 the prevalent angle \u03b1 conformed by protein monomers. Reducing conditions induces trimer rearrangement to protein monomers and a major fraction of FurA dimers. Disruption of the dimeric assemblies and appearance of higher order aggregates, namely trimers and tetramers are induced by oxidation with diamide or hydrogen peroxide. The homogeneity of the angles exhibited by the trimeric particles, as well as the occurrence of dimers in the presence of DTT, suggests the participation of relatively specific hydrophobic interactions maintaining the dimer. Direct visualization of the regulator under liquid phase at molecular resolution unravels the importance of non-polar interactions in FurA dynamics and shows that in Anabaena disulphide bridges are not essential for the dimerization of FurA.",

     "abstract": "The bacterial protein streptokinase (SK) contains three independently folded domains (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3), interconnected by two flexible linkers with noticeable sequence homology. To investigate their primary structure requirements, the linkers were swapped amongst themselves i.e. linker 1 (between \u03b1 and \u03b2 domains) was swapped with linker 2 (between \u03b2 and \u03b3 domains) and vice versa. The resultant construct exhibited very low activity essentially due to an enhanced proteolytic susceptibility. However, a SK mutant with two linker 1 sequences, which was proteolytically as stable as WT-rSK retained about 10% of the plasminogen activator activity of rSK When the native sequence of each linker was substituted with 9 consecutive glycine sequences, in case of the linker 1 substitution mutant substantial activity was seen to survive, whereas the linker 2 mutant lost nearly all its activity. The optimal length of linkers was then studied through deletion mutagenesis experiments, which showed that deletion beyond three residues in either of the linkers resulted in virtually complete loss of activator activity. The effect of length of the linkers was then also examined by insertion of extraneous pentapeptide sequences having a propensity for adopting either an extended conformation or a relatively rigid conformation. The insertion of poly-Pro sequences into native linker 2 sequence caused up to 10-fold reduction in activity, whereas its effect in linker 1 was relatively minor. Interestingly, most of the linker mutants could form stable 1:1 complexes with human plasminogen. Taken together, these observations suggest that (i) the functioning of the inter-domain linkers of SK requires a critical minimal length, (ii) linker 1 is relatively more tolerant to insertions and sequence alterations, and appears to function primarily as a covalent connector between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 domains, and (iii) the native linker 2 sequence is virtually indispensable for the activity of SK probably because of structural and/or flexibility requirements in SK action during catalysis.",

Spectroscopic analysis indicated that purified CgThyX lacked the cofactor FAD. The 2.3\u00a0\u00c5 resolution crystal structure of CgThyX-FAD demonstrated a loose tetramer, in which FAD is chelated between the subunits via a manner distinct from that of other flavin-dependent thymidylate synthases.

These proteins bind F-actin in a complex manner that depends on a variety of parameters such as stoichiometry and ionic strength. Calponin binds G-actin and F-actin, bundling the latter primarily through two distinct and adjacent binding sites (ABS1 and ABS2). Calponin binds other proteins that bind F-actin and considerable disagreements exist as to how calponin is located on the filament, especially in the presence of other proteins. A study (Galkin, V.E., Orlova, A., Fattoum, A., Walsh, M.P. and Egelman, E.H. (2006) J. Mol. Biol. 359, 478\u2013485.), using EM single-particle reconstruction has shown that there may be four modes of interaction, but how these occur is not yet known. We report that two distinct regions of calponin are capable of binding some of the same sites on actin (such as 18\u201328 and 360\u2013372 in subdomain 1). This accounts for the finding that calponin binds the filament with different apparent geometries. We suggest that the four modes of filament binding account for differences in stoichiometry and that these, in turn, arise from differential binding of the two calponin regions to actin. It is likely that the modes of binding are reciprocally influenced by other actin-binding proteins since members of the \u03b1-actinin group also adopt different actin-binding positions and bind actin principally through a domain that is similar to calponin's ABS1.",

     "abstract": "Amelogenins are the dominant proteins present in ameloblasts during the early stages of enamel biomineralization, making up >\u00a090% of the matrix protein. Along with the full-length protein there are several splice-variant isoforms of amelogenin present including LRAP (Leucine-Rich Amelogenin Protein), a protein that consists of the first 33 and the last 26 residues of full-length amelogenin. Using solution-state NMR spectroscopy we have assigned the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of murine LRAP (rp(H)LRAP) in 2% acetic acid at pH 3.0 by making extensive use of previous chemical shift assignments for full-length murine amelogenin (rp(H)M180). This correlation was possible because LRAP, like the full-length protein, is intrinsically disordered under these solution conditions. The major difference between the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of rp(H)M180 and rp(H)LRAP was an additional set of amide resonances for each of the seven non-proline residues between S12* and Y12 near the N-terminus of rp(H)LRAP indicating that the N-terminal region of LRAP exists in two different conformations. Analysis of the proline carbon chemical shifts suggests that the molecular basis for the two states is not a cis-trans isomerization of one or more of the proline residues in the N-terminal region. Starting from 2% acetic acid, where rp(H)LRAP was monomeric in solution, NaCl addition effected residue specific changes in molecular dynamics manifested by the reduction in intensity and disappearance of 1H-15N HSQC cross peaks. As observed for the full-length protein, these perturbations may signal early events governing supramolecular self-assembly of rp(H)LRAP into nanospheres. However, the different patterns of 1H-15N HSQC cross peak perturbation between rp(H)LRAP and rp(H)M180 in high salt suggest that the termini may behave differently in their respective nanospheres, and perhaps, these differences contribute to the cell signaling properties attributable to LRAP but not to the full-length protein.",

The ratio of the specific activities of Mn- to Fe-reconstituted enzyme increased from 0.006 in the wild-type to 0.044 in the mutant SOD; therefore, the metal-specific SOD was converted to a metal-tolerant SOD.

How their mutations affect phospholipid phosphatase activity and tumor suppressor function of PTEN has been defined. In this study, we investigated how their mutations affect the kinetics and catalytic mechanism of PTEN phosphoprotein phosphatase activity. Our data suggest that PTEN catalysis of phosphoprotein dephosphorylation follows a two-step mechanism with Cys-124 transiently phosphorylated to form the phosphoenzyme intermediate. In spite of this, we were unable to trap the genuine phosphoenzyme intermediate; instead, we unexpectedly discovered a novel phosphotransfer reaction in which the phosphate group is transferred from a tyrosyl phosphopeptide to PTEN to form a unique phosphorylated protein. Even though the finding is novel, the phosphotransfer reaction is likely an in vitro non-enzymatic reaction. Kinetic analysis revealed that mutation of Asp-92 has negligible impacts on phosphopeptide phosphatase activity of PTEN, suggesting that Asp-92 does not participate in the phosphopeptide dephosphorylation reaction. The results also imply that allosteric regulators facilitating the recruitment of Asp-92 to participate in catalysis will increase the activity of PTEN in dephosphorylating phosphoprotein and phosphopeptide substrates. Furthermore, kinetic analysis revealed that the G129E mutation has different effects on phospholipid and phosphoprotein phosphatase activities. Taken together, the data show that while the two phosphatase activities of PTEN follow a similar catalytic mechanism, they have notable differences in the requirements of the active site structure.",

     "abstract": "We have conducted a biophysical scan of the rod region of dystrophin, targeting all 24 single spectrin type repeat, STR, motifs and 23 2-STR tandem motifs. Of these 47 targets, we were able to express and purify 39 and have characterized them with regard to various stability metrics: thermodynamic stability as assessed by thermal and solvent denaturation, as well as resistance to proteolysis. We find that while all measured parameters varied greatly throughout the rod, there was no general stabilization of the 2-STR motifs over single STR motifs. However, stabilization by thermodynamic interaction was seen in six regions: strongly in D16:17 and D21:22 and to a lesser extent in D2:3, D4:5, D6:7 and D20:21. This indicates that these STRs interact structurally. In the rest of the rod, no cooperativity was seen and STRs appear to be thermodynamically independent. Stability also varied widely along the rod, with some motifs that are barely stable, beginning to unfold at physiological temperatures; these are largely found in the central rod region from D7 to D15. Regions of high stability were found in the interacting motifs, as well as a general trend toward increasing stability at the C-terminus of the rod. Interestingly, the rod region nNOS binding site occurs at such an interacting, very stable site, D16:17. Overall this describes a highly heterogeneous rod region.",

     "abstract": "Prefoldin is a co-chaperone that captures an unfolded protein substrate and transfers it to the group II chaperonin for completion of protein folding. Group II chaperonin of a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus strain KS-1, interacts and cooperates with archaeal prefoldins. Although the interaction sites within chaperonin and prefoldin have been analyzed, the binding mode between jellyfish-like hexameric prefoldin and the double octameric ring group II chaperonin remains unclear. As prefoldin binds the chaperonin \u03b2 subunit more strongly than the \u03b1 subunit, we analyzed the binding mode between prefoldin and chaperonin in the context of Thermococcus group II chaperonin complexes of various subunit compositions and arrangements. The oligomers exhibited various affinities for prefoldins according to the number and order of subunits. Binding affinity increased with the number of Cpn\u03b2 subunits. Interestingly, chaperonin complexes containing two \u03b2 subunits adjacently exhibited stronger affinities than other chaperonin complexes containing the same number of \u03b2 subunits. The result suggests that all four \u03b2 tentacles of prefoldin interact with the helical protrusions of CPN in the PFD\u2013CPN complex as the previously proposed model that two adjacent PFD \u03b2 subunits seem to interact with two CPN adjacent subunits.",

     "abstract": "Because of their central role in programmed cell death, the caspases are attractive targets for developing new therapeutics against cancer and autoimmunity, myocardial infarction and ischemic damage, and neurodegenerative diseases. We chose to target caspase-3, an executioner caspase, and caspase-8, an initiator caspase, based on the vast amount of information linking their functions to diseases. Through a structure-based drug design approach, a number of novel \u03b2-strand peptidomimetic compounds were synthesized. Kinetic studies of caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibition were carried out with these urazole ring-containing irreversible peptidomimetics and a known irreversible caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk. Using a stopped-flow fluorescence assay, we were able to determine individual kinetic parameters of caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibition by these inhibitors. Z-VAD-fmk and the peptidomimetic inhibitors inhibit caspase-3 and caspase-8 via a three-step kinetic mechanism. Inhibition of both caspase-3 and caspase-8 by Z-VAD-fmk and of caspase-3 by the peptidomimetic inhibitors proceeds via two rapid equilibrium steps followed by a relatively fast inactivation step. However, caspase-8 inhibition by the peptidomimetics goes through a rapid equilibrium step, a slow-binding reversible step, and an extremely slow inactivation step. The crystal structures of inhibitor complexes of caspases-3 and -8 validate the design of the inhibitors by illustrating in detail how they mimic peptide substrates. One of the caspase-8 structures also shows binding at a secondary, allosteric site, providing a possible route to the development of noncovalent small molecule modulators of caspase activity.",

Tendency of the H12 to swing up upon ligand binding, which is consistent with X-ray structures and earlier MD simulations, is reproduced by the calculation of the conformational fluctuation in apo state and the response to the external perturbation. Our study thus provides an interpretation of the positional change of the H12 such that it is derived by the preexistent swing-up motion where the ligand binding works only as a trigger. Our finding, which illustrates underlying mechanism of the H12 motion, would contribute to finding a way to regulate the transcriptional activity by synthesized ligands because the transcriptional activity of the NR is governed by the position of the H12.",

But unambiguous way of identification of the strategies, which will be preferred for a protein, is still not achieved. We have performed comparative thermodynamic studies using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) on thermostable variants of a lipase from Bacillus subtilis. These variants are products of 1, 2, 3 and 4 rounds of directed evolution and harbor mutations having definite contribution in thermostability unlike natural thermophilic proteins. We have shown that upward and rightward shift in stability curves are prime strategies in this lipase.

In this paper we have compared the protein composition of tER isolated from dissected liver tumor nodules of aflatoxin B1-treated rats with that of tER from control liver. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS), peptide counts and immunoblot validation were used to identify and determine the relative expression level of proteins. Inhibitors of apoptosis (i.e. PGRMC1, tripeptidyl peptidase II), proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis (i.e. nucleophosmin, nucleolin), proteins involved in translation (i.e. eEF-2, and subunits of eIF-3), proteins involved in ubiquitin metabolism (i.e. proteasome subunits, USP10) and proteins involved in membrane traffic (i.e. SEC13-like 1, SEC23B, dynactin 1) were found overexpressed in tumor tER. Transcription factors (i.e. Pur-beta, BTF3) and molecular targets for C-Myc and NF-kappa B were observed overexpressed in tER from tumor nodules. Down-regulated proteins included cytochrome P450 proteins and enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism and in steroid metabolism. Unexpectedly expression of the protein folding machinery (i.e. calreticulin) and proteins of the MHC class I peptide-loading complex did not change. Proteins of unknown function were detected in association with the tER and the novel proteins showing differential expression are potential new tumor markers. In many cases differential expression of proteins in tumor tER was comparable to that of corresponding genes reported in the Oncomine human database. Thus the molecular profile of tumor tER is different and this may confer survival advantage to tumor cells in cancer.",

These could be sorted into 5 functional groups: glycometabolism, cell proliferation, anti-oxidative stress, inflammatory response and cytoskeleton. Western blot and real-time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the down-regulation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) and up-regulation of moesin identified by 2D-DIGE.

Direct binding of IgG fragments to PSP94 showed maximal binding with F(ab\u2032)2 followed by Fab, while Fc displayed least binding in ELISA. Binding kinetics of PSP94\u2013IgG interaction using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed high-affinity binding of IgG to PSP94 with a dissociation constant (KD) of 8.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221211\u00a0M. PSP94\u2013IgG interaction was found to be through the Fab domains of IgG. Real-time interaction kinetics revealed association constants for binding of IgG, Fab, and F(ab\u2032)2 towards PSP94 to be of the same order but with altered dissociation constants. IgG and its F(ab\u2032)2 fragment once complexed to PSP94 demonstrated negligible dissociation, while dissociation rate of Fab fragment was 6.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124. In silico molecular modeling of PSP94\u2013IgG complex identified N- and C-terminal \u03b2-strands of PSP94 to be the most plausible region involved in IgG interaction.

In this study, chemical-denaturation experiments of BARD1\u2013BRCT domain suggest that its low thermodynamic stability (\u0394G\u00a0=\u00a02.5\u00a0kcal/mol) at room temperature, may affect some of its biochemical properties, such as its interaction with phosphopeptides. The stability of BARD1\u2013BRCT domain at 10\u00a0\u00b0C, increases to 7.5\u00a0kcal/mol and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments at this lower temperature showed binding to the BRIP1 phosphopeptide via an enthalpy-driven interaction, which appears to be specific to the pSer-X-X-Phe peptide-binding motif. Substitution of either pSer at position 0 with Ser (non-phosphorylated peptide) or Phe with Val at position +\u00a03, leads to no-binding ITC results. While these findings are indicative that BRIP1 is a potential BARD1 binding partner, it becomes evident that in vitro binding assays involving the entire BARD1 protein and in vivo experiments are also needed to establish its binding partners and its potential role in tumor suppression pathways.",

Here we report the expression and purification of functional recombinant CRAMOLL 1 (rCRAMOLL 1) in Escherichia coli. This was accomplished by introducing a chemically synthesized DNA encoding the mature CRAMOLL 1 amino acid sequence into a bacterial expression vector under T7 promoter control. Most of the recombinant lectin was found in insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies), but we were able to recover reasonable amounts of soluble lectin in the active form by decreasing the protein induction temperature.

A1, alginate is degraded by alginate lyases to its constituent monosaccharides, which are nonenzymatically converted to an \u03b1-keto acid, namely, 4-deoxy-l-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH). The properties of the DEH-metabolizing enzyme and its gene in strain A1 were characterized. In the presence of alginate, strain A1 cells inducibly produced an NADPH-dependent DEH reductase (A1-R) in their cytoplasm. Molecular cloning of the enzyme gene indicated that A1-R belonged to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily and catalyzed the conversion of DEH to 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-gluconic acid most efficiently at around pH 7.0 and 50\u00a0\u00b0C. Crystal structures of A1-R and its complex with NADP were determined at around 1.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme consists of three layers (\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1), with a coenzyme-binding Rossmann fold. NADP is surrounded by positively charged residues, and Gly-38 and Arg-39 are crucial for NADP binding. Site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest that Ser-150, Tyr-164, and Lys-168 located around the Rossmann fold constitute the catalytic triad. To our knowledge, this is the first report on molecular cloning and structure determination of a bacterial DEH reductase responsible for alginate metabolism.",

Recent studies have also suggested that sirtuins are downstream targets of calorie restriction (CR), which mediate CR-induced beneficial effects including life span extension in an NAD+-dependent manner. CR extends life span in many species and has been shown to ameliorate many age-associated disorders such as diabetes and cancers. Understanding the mechanisms of CR as well as the regulation of sirtuins will therefore provide insights into the molecular basis of these age-associated metabolic diseases. This review focuses on discussing advances in studies of sirtuins and NAD+ metabolism in genetically tractable model system, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These studies have unraveled key metabolic longevity factors in the CR signaling and NAD+ biosynthesis pathways, which may also contribute to the regulation of sirtuin activity. Many components of the NAD+ biosynthesis pathway and CR signaling pathway are conserved in yeast and higher eukaryotes including humans.

In mammals, the SIR2 ortholog SIRT1 coordinates important metabolic responses to nutritional availability in multiple tissues. Most recently, it has been demonstrated that SIRT1 regulates the amplitude and the duration of circadian gene expression through the interaction and the deacetylation of key circadian clock regulators, such as BMAL1 and PER2. More strikingly, we and others have discovered a novel circadian clock feedback loop in which both the rate-limiting enzyme in mammalian NAD biosynthesis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), and NAD levels display circadian oscillations and modulate CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated circadian transcriptional regulation through SIRT1, demonstrating a new function of NAD as a \u201cmetabolic oscillator.\u201d These findings reveal a novel system dynamics of a recently proposed systemic regulatory network regulated by NAMPT-mediated NAD biosynthesis and SIRT1, namely, the NAD World.

     "abstract": "Sirtuins catalyze the NAD+-dependent deacetylation of target proteins, which are regulated by this reversible lysine modification. During deacetylation, the glycosidic bond of the nicotinamide ribose is cleaved to yield nicotinamide and the ribose accepts the acetyl group from substrate to produce O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPr), which exists as an \u223c\u00a050:50 mixture of 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 isomers at neutral pH. Discovery of this metabolite has fueled the idea that OAADPr may play an important role in the biology associated with sirtuins, acting as a signaling molecule and/or an important substrate for downstream enzymatic processes. Evidence for OAADPr-metabolizing enzymes indicates that at least three distinct activities exist that could modulate the cellular levels of this NAD+-derived metabolite. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, NUDIX hydrolase Ysa1 cleaves OAADPr to AMP and 2- and 3-O-acetylribose-5-phosphate, lowering the cellular levels of OAADPr. A buildup of OAADPr and ADPr has been linked to a metabolic shift that lowers endogenous reactive oxygen species and diverts glucose towards preventing oxidative damage. In vitro, the mammalian enzyme ARH3 hydrolyzes OAADPr to acetate and ADPr. A third nuclear-localized activity appears to utilize OAADPr to transfer the acetyl-group to another small molecule, whose identity remains unknown. Recent studies suggest that OAADPr may regulate gene silencing by facilitating the assembly and loading of the Sir2\u20134 silencing complex onto nucleosomes. In mammalian cells, the Trpm2 cation channel is gated by both OAADPr and ADP-ribose. Binding is mediated by the NUDIX homology (NudT9H) domain found within the intracellular portion of the channel. OAADPr is capable of binding the Macro domain of splice variants from histone protein MacroH2A, which is highly enriched at heterochromatic regions. With recently developed tools, the pace of new discoveries of OAADPr-dependent processes should facilitate new molecular insight into the diverse biological processes modulated by sirtuins.",

Its role in mammals is incompletely understood, but includes modulation of at least 34 distinct targets through its nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase activity. Recent experiments using small molecule activators and genetically engineered mice have provided new insight into the role of this enzyme in mammalian biology and helped to highlight some of the potentially relevant targets. The most widely employed activator is resveratrol, a small polyphenol that improves insulin sensitivity and vascular function, boosts endurance, inhibits tumor formation, and ameliorates the early mortality associated with obesity in mice. Many of these effects are consistent with modulation of SIRT1 targets, such as PGC1\u03b1 and NF\u03baB, however, resveratrol can also activate AMPK, inhibit cyclooxygenases, and influence a variety of other enzymes. A novel activator, SRT1720, as well as various methods to manipulate NAD+ metabolism, are emerging as alternative methods to increase SIRT1 activity, and in many cases recapitulate effects of resveratrol. At present, further studies are needed to more directly test the role of SIRT1 in mediating beneficial effects of resveratrol, to evaluate other strategies for SIRT1 activation, and to confirm the specific targets of SIRT1 that are relevant in vivo. These efforts are especially important in light of the fact that SIRT1 activators are entering clinical trials in humans, and \u201cnutraceutical\u201d formulations containing resveratrol are already widely available.",

Mammalian SIRT1 \u2013 a homolog of yeast Sir2, the prototypical member of the sirtuin family \u2013 is an important regulator of metabolism, cell differentiation and senescence, stress response, and cancer. As an NAD+-dependent enzyme, SIRT1 regulates gene expression programs in response to cellular metabolic status, thereby coordinating metabolic adaptation of the whole organism. Several important mechanisms have emerged for SIRT1-dependent regulation of transcription. First, SIRT1 can modulate chromatin function through direct deacetylation of histones as well as by promoting alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to the repression of transcription. The latter is accomplished through the recruitment of other nuclear enzymes to chromatin for histone methylation and DNA CpG methylation, suggesting a broader role of SIRT1 in epigenetic regulation. Second, SIRT1 can interact and deacetylate a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression both positively and negatively. Cellular energy state, specifically NAD+ metabolism, plays a major role in the regulation of SIRT1 activity. Recent studies on the NAD+ biosynthetic enzymes in the salvage pathway, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT-1), have revealed important functions for these enzymes in SIRT1-dependent transcription regulation. The collective molecular actions of SIRT1 control specific patterns of gene expression that modulate a wide variety of physiological outcomes.",

Residue N84 of yeast CBS (yCBS), predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl moiety of the PLP cofactor, was mutated to alanine, aspartate and histidine. The truncated form of yCBS (ytCBS, residues 1-353) was employed in this study to eliminate any effects of the C-terminal, regulatory domain. The kcat/Kml-Ser of the N84A, N84D and N84H mutants for the \u03b2-replacement reaction is reduced by a factor of 230, 11000 and 640, respectively. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residue(s) of the enzyme and the PLP cofactor, observed in the wild-type enzyme and N84A mutant, is altered in N84H and absent in N84D. PLP saturation values of 73%, 30% and 67% were observed for the alanine, aspartate and histidine mutants, respectively, compared to 98% for the wild-type enzyme. A marginal \u03b2-elimination activity was detected for N84D (kcat/Kml-Ser\u00a0=\u00a00.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0M-1 s-1) and N84H (kcat/Kml-Ser\u00a0=\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0M-1 s-1), in contrast with wild-type ytCBS and the N84A mutant, which do not catalyze this reaction. The ytCBS-N84D enzyme is also inactivated upon incubation with l-serine, via an aminoacrylate-mediated mechanism. These results demonstrate that residue N84 is essential in maintaining the orientation of the pyridine ring of the PLP cofactor and the equilibrium between the open and closed conformations of the active site.",

We have extensively compared them with the other known structures of plant seed 11S and 7S globulins. In general, the disordered regions in the crystal structures among the 11S globulins correspond to their five variable regions. Variable region III of procruciferin is relatively short and is in a loop conformation. This region is highly disordered in other pro-11S globulin crystals. Local helical and strand variations also occur across the group despite general structure conservation. We showed how these variations may alter specific physicochemical, functional and physiological properties. Aliphatic hydrophobic residues on the molecular surface correlate well with Tm values of the globulins. We also considered other structural features that were reported to influence thermal stability but no definite conclusion was drawn since each factor has additive or subtractive effect. Comparison between proA3B4 and mature A3B4 revealed an increase in r.m.s.d. values near variable regions II and IV. Both regions are on the IE face. Secondary structure based alignment of 11S and 7S globulins revealed 16 identical residues.

The alkyl tails of the C8S molecules are centered in the middle of the tetrameric cluster of sPLA2 subunits. Three of the four sPLA2 subunits also contain a C8S molecule in the active site pocket. The sulfate oxygen of a C8S ligand is complexed to the active site calcium in three of the four protein active sites. The interactions of the alkyl sulfate head group with Arg-6 and Lys-10, as well as the backbone amide of Met-20, are analogous to those observed in the previously solved sPLA2 crystal structures with bound phosphate and sulfate anions. The cluster of three anions found in the present structure is postulated to be the site for nucleating the binding of anionic amphiphiles to the interfacial surface of the protein, and therefore this binding interaction has implications for interfacial activation of the enzyme.",

We identified oxidative modification of the 10th cysteine of TTR through S-sulfonation in vitro. Based on mass spectrometric analysis, we determined the spectrophotometric, western blotting, and fluororescent microscopic properties of TTR incubated with and without cysteine-S-sulfonate in acidic (pH 4) and alkaline (pH 8) conditions at 37\u00b0. The absorption of the aggregated TTR molecules increased more with incubation time and the concentration of cysteine-S-sulfonate at pH 4 than at pH 8. The Congo red binding to the S-sulfonated TTR at pH 4 was saturated with an apparent Bmax of 2.01 mol per mole of the S-sulfonated TTR and apparent KD of 7.75\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u00a0M.

Moreover, we detected positive amyloid fibril staining using Thioflavin T and Congo red with the S-sulfonated TTR but not with untreated or reduced TTR by microscopic fluororescent analysis. After modification of TTR in vitro, oligomers resisted reduction and denaturation was irreversibly induced, and which contributed differences in the Western blotting patterns obtained with four anti-TTR antibodies. In conclusion, this study showed that the formation of S-sulfonation of TTR through oxidative modifications of the thiol residue on the 10th cysteine of TTR is an important trigger step in the formation of transthyretin-related amyloid fibril.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the nature and function of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) over the past 10\u00a0years have demonstrated the importance of IDPs in normal cellular function. Although many proteins predicted to be IDPs have been experimentally characterized on an individual basis, the conservation of disorder between homologous proteins from different organisms has not been fully studied. We now demonstrate that the FlgM protein from the thermophile Aquifex aeolicus exhibits a more ordered conformation at 20\u00a0\u00b0C than the previously characterized FlgM protein from Salmonella typhimurium. FlgM is an inhibitor of the RNA transcription factor \u03c328, which is involved in regulation of the late-stage genes involved in flagella synthesis. Previous work has shown that the S. typhimurium FlgM protein is an intrinsically disordered protein, though the C-terminus becomes ordered when bound to \u03c328 or under crowded solution conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that at 20\u00a0\u00b0C the A. aeolicus FlgM protein exhibits alpha-helical character in circular dichroism (CD) experiments, though the percentage of alpha-helical content decreases with increased temperature, consistent with the FlgM assuming a less folded conformation. We also show that the A. aeolicus FlgM exhibits cooperativity in chemical denaturation experiments, consistent with a globular nature. Furthermore, we use the fluorescent probe FlAsH to show that the H2 helix is ordered, even in the unbound state and that the H1 and H2 helices appear to be associated with each other in the absence of the \u03c328 protein. Finally, we demonstrate that the H2 helix assumes an extended conformation at 85\u00a0\u00b0C. Based on our results, we propose that at 20\u00a0\u00b0C the A. aeolicus FlgM assumes a four-helix bundle-like conformation that becomes a more extended conformation at the A. aeolicus' physiological temperature of 85\u00a0\u00b0C.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative modification of Trigonopsis variabilisd-amino acid oxidase in vivo is traceable as the conversion of Cys108 into a stable cysteine sulfinic acid, causing substantial loss of activity and thermostability of the enzyme. To simulate native and modified oxidase each as a microheterogeneity-resistant entity, we replaced Cys108 individually by a serine (C108S) and an aspartate (C108D), and characterized the purified variants with regard to their biochemical and kinetic properties, thermostability, and reactivity towards oxidation by hypochlorite. Tandem MS analysis of tryptic peptides derived from a hypochlorite-treated inactive preparation of recombinant wild-type oxidase showed that Cys108 was converted into cysteine sulfonic acid, mimicking the oxidative modification of native enzyme as isolated. Colorimetric titration of protein thiol groups revealed that in the presence of ammonium benzoate (0.12\u00a0mM), the two muteins were not oxidized at cysteines whereas in the wild-type enzyme, one thiol group was derivatized. Each site-directed replacement caused a conformational change in d-amino acid oxidase, detected with an assortment of probes, and resulted in a turnover number for the O2-dependent reaction with D-Met which in comparison with the corresponding wild-type value was decreased two- and threefold for C108S and C108D, respectively. Kinetic analysis of thermal denaturation at 50\u00a0\u00b0C was used to measure the relative contributions of partial unfolding and cofactor dissociation to the overall inactivation rate in each of the three enzymes. Unlike wild-type, C108S and C108D released the cofactor in a quasi-irreversible manner and were therefore not stabilized by external FAD against loss of activity. The results support a role of the anionic side chain of Cys108 in the fine-tuning of activity and stability of d-amino acid oxidase, explaining why C108S was a surprisingly poor mimic of the native enzyme.",

Results indicate that PV2 is a compact and well folded oligomer of 130\u00a0\u00d7\u00a044\u00a0\u00c5. It is an octamer of four 98\u00a0kDa heterodimers composed of 67 and 31\u00a0kDa subunits. Subunits are held together by disulfide bonds. Dimers are assembled into native PV2 by non-covalent forces. The larger subunit is more susceptible to proteolysis, indicating it is less compactly folded and/or more exposed. Quenching of tryptophan fluorescence showed a single class of tryptophyl side chains occluded in hydrophobic regions. Native structure shows loss of secondary structure (\u03b1+\u03b2) at 6\u00a0M urea or 60\u201370\u00a0\u00b0C; the effects on the quaternary structure suggest an unfolding without disassembling of the protein.

This reaction is part of the biosynthetic pathway to 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate, a component of the lipopolysaccharide of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall. Two distinct groups of KDO8PSs exist, differing by the absolute requirement of a divalent metal ion. In this study Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans KDO8PS has been expressed and purified and shown to require a divalent metal ion, with Mn2+, Co2+ and Cd2+ (in decreasing order) being able to restore activity to metal-free enzyme. Cd2+ significantly enhanced the stability of the enzyme, raising the Tm by 14\u00a0\u00b0C. d-Glucose 6-phosphate and d-erythrose 4-phosphate were not substrates for A. ferrooxidans KDO8PS, whereas 2-deoxy-d-ribose 5-phosphate was a poor substrate and there was negligible activity with d-ribose 5-phosphate. The 243AspGlyPro245 motif is absolutely conserved in the metal-independent group of synthases, but the Gly and Pro sites are variable in the metal-dependent enzymes. Substitution of the putative metal-binding Asp243 to Ala in A. ferrooxidans KDO8PS gave inactive enzyme, whereas substitutions Asp243Glu or Pro245Ala produced active enzymes with altered metal-dependency profiles. Prior studies indicated that exchange of a metal-binding Cys for Asn converts metal-dependent KDO8P synthase into a metal-independent form.

The enzyme isomerizes the phospho-Ser-Pro linkages in the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Its human homolog, Pin1, has been implicated in a wide range of human diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Crystallographic and NMR studies have demonstrated that the sequence linking the catalytic isomerase domain and the substrate binding WW domain of Pin1 is unstructured and that the two domains are only loosely associated in the absence of the substrate. In contrast, the crystal structure of C. albicans Ess1 revealed a highly ordered linker that contains a three turn \u03b1-helix and extensive association between the two tightly juxtaposed domains. In part to address the concern that the marked differences in the domain interactions for the human and fungal structures might reflect crystal lattice effects, NMR chemical shift analysis and 15N relaxation measurements have been employed to confirm that the linker of the fungal protein is highly ordered in solution. With the exception of two loops within the active site of the isomerase domain, the local backbone geometry observed in the crystal structure appears to be well preserved throughout the protein chain. The marked differences in interdomain interactions and linker flexibility between the human and fungal enzymes provide a structural basis for therapeutic targeting of the fungal enzymes.",

According to the published X-ray structure of Nicotiana tabacum PPO, Gly210 is adjacent to, not in, the PPO active site, so it is a matter of interest to determine why its deletion imparts resistance to herbicides. In our kinetic experiments, this deletion did not affect the affinity of protoporphyrinogen IX nor the FAD content, but decreased the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. The suboptimal Kcat was compensated by a significant increase in the Kis for inhibitors and a switch in their interactions from competitive to mixed-type inhibition. In our protein modeling studies on herbicide-susceptible PPO and resistant PPO, we show that Gly210 plays a key role in the \u03b1L helix-capping motif at the C-terminus of the \u03b1-8 helix which helps to stabilize the helix. In molecular dynamics simulations, the deletion had significant architecture consequences, destabilizing the \u03b1-8 helix-capping region and unraveling the last turn of the helix, leading to enlargement of the active site cavity by \u223c\u00a050%. This seemingly innocuous deletion of Gly210 of the mitochondrial PPO imparts herbicide resistance to this dual-targeted protein without severely affecting its normal physiological function, which may explain why this unusual mutation was the favored evolutionary path for achieving resistance to PPO inhibitors.",

The formation of large oligomeric protein complexes is critical to the activation of caspases in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways. These oligomeric protein complexes function as a platform to recruit caspases, which leads to caspase activation via a proximity-induced mechanism. One well-known oligomeric caspase-activating complex is the PIDDosome for caspase-2 activation, which is composed of 3 protein components, PIDD, RAIDD and Caspase-2. Despite the significant role that caspase-2 activated by PIDDosome plays during genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis, the oligomerization mechanism and the method by which the caspase-activating process is mediated by the formation of PIDDosome is currently not well understood. Here, we show that the assembly mechanism of the core of PIDDosome is time-dependent and salt concentration-dependent. In addition, we demonstrate that point mutations on RAIDD (R147E) and on PIDD (Y814A) exert a dominant negative effect on the formation of the PIDDosome, and that this effect cannot be applied after the PIDDosome has been formed.",

Instead, these intriguing proteins/regions exist as dynamic ensembles within which atom positions and backbone Ramachandran angles exhibit extreme temporal fluctuations without specific equilibrium values. Many of these intrinsically disordered proteins are known to carry out important biological functions which, in fact, depend on the absence of a specific 3-D structure. The existence of such proteins does not fit the prevailing structure\u2013function paradigm, which states that a unique 3-D structure is a prerequisite to function. Thus, the protein structure\u2013function paradigm has to be expanded to include intrinsically disordered proteins and alternative relationships among protein sequence, structure, and function. This shift in the paradigm represents a major breakthrough for biochemistry, biophysics and molecular biology, as it opens new levels of understanding with regard to the complex life of proteins. This review will try to answer the following questions: how were intrinsically disordered proteins discovered? Why don't these proteins fold? What is so special about intrinsic disorder? What are the functional advantages of disordered proteins/regions? What is the functional repertoire of these proteins? What are the relationships between intrinsically disordered proteins and human diseases?",

This value is named the standard or stability value. The standard value is reached irrespective of sequences and 3D folds. Peptides are too short to follow the rule and frequently exist as populations of conformers; one exception is peptides in amyloid fibrils. Fibrils surpass the standard value in accordance with their uppermost stability. In parallel, we calculate median MFP values of amino acids in stably folded PDB models of proteins: median values vary from \u201325 for Gly to \u2013115\u00a0kcal/aa for Trp. These median values are used to score primary sequences of proteins: all sequences converge to a mean value of \u221263.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5\u00a0kcal/aa, i.e., only 1.5\u00a0kcal less than the folded model standard. Sequences from unfolded proteins have lower values. This supports the conclusion that sequences carry in an important message and more specifically that diversity of amino acids in sequences is mandatory for stability. We also use the median amino acid MFP to score residue stability in 3D folds. This demonstrates that 3D folds are compromises between fragments of high and fragments of low scores and that functional residues are often but not always in the extreme score values. The approach opens to possibilities of evaluating any 3D model and of detecting functional residues and should help in conducting mutation assays.",

The thermophilic enzyme bstSHMT was found to be more resistant to alkaline denaturation compared to its mesophilic counterpart, bsSHMT. Unfolding studies using domain-swapped chimera, constructed by swapping the C-terminal domain of these two wild-type proteins, revealed that C-terminal domain plays a pivotal role in the folding, stability and subunit interaction of these proteins. Primary amino acid sequence analysis of the proteins showed that bsSHMT has six unconserved lysine residues in C-terminal domain, which are absent in bstSHMT. Chemical modification of lysine side chains resulted in stabilization of monomers, only in case of bsSHMT. Moreover, comparison between homology model of bsSHMT with the crystal structure of bstSHMT revealed that a small stretch of 11 amino acids at the end of C-terminal domain was found protruding outside the molecule as a flexible coiled structure in bsSHMT. Taken together these findings suggest that possibly the presence of these non-identical lysine moieties and a small extension of C-terminal domain may be responsible for low stability of bsSHMT under alkaline pH condition.",

As anticipated, a low dose (0.015 mg/mL) of S.miltiorrhiza aqueous extract (SMAE) significantly inhibited (>\u00a060%) the growth of a rat smooth muscle cell line (A10) under Hcy stimulation and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration obviously decreased after SMAE treatment in terms of reducing p47phox translocation and increasing catalase activity. Signaling profile suggests that SMAE inhibited Hcy-induced A10 cell growth via the PKC/MAPK-dependent pathway. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with mass spectrometry revealed statistically significant changes in the intensity of 14 proteins in response to Hcy and Hcy/SMAE. Meanwhile, SMAE attenuated carbonyl-modification of specific cytoskeleton and chaperone proteins leading to cell type transformation. Moreover, a network analysis using MetaCore\u2122 shed more light on the molecular basis associated with SMAE efficacy. SMAE exerts its protective effect through the scavenging of ROS and subsequent modulation of protein carbonylation to inhibit cell proliferation.

In opposite, pressurization at 20\u00a0\u00b0C did not change significantly SEA superantigenicity and immunoreactivity, indicating some toxin baro-resistance. Exposure of SEA to 8\u00a0M urea at atmospheric pressure or at 600\u00a0MPa and 20\u00a0\u00b0C, also led to a marked increase of superantigenicity (but not of immunoreactivity). In contrast, exposure of SEA to sodium-dodecylsulfate (30\u00a0mM) led to an increase of immunoreactivity with some effect on superantigenicity after pressurization at 45\u00a0\u00b0C only. High pressure up to 600\u00a0MPa induced spectral changes which at 20\u00a0\u00b0C were fully reversible upon decompression. At 45\u00a0\u00b0C, however, a sharp break of the centre of spectral mass mainly due to tryptophan residues was observed at 300\u00a0MPa, and irreversible spectral changes mainly related to tyrosine residues subsisted after pressure release, indicating a marked protein conformational transition. Urea 8\u00a0M further increased SEA structural changes at 600\u00a0MPa and 20\u00a0\u00b0C.

Expanded CTG repeats are toxic since they are transcribed into an RNA molecule which is then sequestered within the nucleus in the form of foci. RNA cytotoxicity is linked to the aberrant splicing of several developmentally regulated genes. DMPK transcripts undergo alternative splicing giving rise to many isoforms but do not seem to be involved in the splicing dysregulation of DM1. However, decreased levels of DMPK in DM1 patients and DMPK involvement in muscle weakness and cardiac dysfunction in animal models have been reported. The variability in phenotypic expression of DMPK together with its differential subcellular targeting, suggests that different splicing isoforms may be involved in different signalling pathways, possibly through DMPK-interacting proteins. To gain better insight into the DMPK function, we used mass spectrometry to identify proteins co-segregating with DMPK in soluble complexes isolated from high-speed supernatant of rat muscles. We carried out experiments with native DMPK to preserve the physiological stoichiometry with potential partners. DMPK-containing complexes were isolated and immuno-detected by non-denaturing electrophoresis, gel filtration, ionic-exchange chromatography and immunoprecipitation. DMPK peptides were identified by high-resolution mass spectrometry together with several putative DMPK-binding proteins, including several heat shock proteins such as HSP20/HSPB6, HSP60/CPN60, HSP70 and HSP90.

One of the most distinctive features of Pg/Pm is the presence of five homologous kringle (K) domains. These structural elements possess conserved Lys-binding sites (LBS) that facilitate interactions with substrates, activators, inhibitors and receptors. In human Pg (hPg), K2 displays weak Lys affinity, however the LBS of this domain has been implicated in an atypical interaction with the N-terminal region of a bacterial surface protein known as PAM ( P g-binding group A streptococcal M -like protein). A direct correlation has been established between invasiveness of group A streptococci and their ability to bind Pg. It has been previously demonstrated that a 30-residue internal peptide (VEK-30) from the N-terminal region of PAM competitively inhibits binding of the full-length parent protein to Pg. We have attempted to determine the effects of this ligand\u2013protein interaction on the regulation of Pg zymogen activation and conformation.

     "abstract": "The switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration in the bacterium Paracoccus denitrificans is orchestrated by the action of three FNR-type transcription regulators FnrP, NNR and NarR, which are sensors for oxygen, nitric oxide and nitrite, respectively. In this work, we analyzed the protein composition of four strains (wild type, FnrP-, NNR- and NarR-mutant strains) grown aerobically, semiaerobically and semiaerobically in the presence of nitrate to discover the global role of FNR-family transcription regulators using proteomics, with data validation at the transcript and genome levels. Expression profiles were acquired using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis for 737 protein spots, in which 640 proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. The annotated 2-D proteome map provided the most comprehensive coverage of P. denitrificans proteome available to-date and can be accessed on-line at http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE/. Our results revealed several types of regulation under the conditions tested: (1) FnrP-controlled regulation of nitrous oxide reductase, UspA and OmpW as confirmed at protein, transcript and DNA level (position of FNR boxes). (2) Proteins regulated via additional regulators, including proteins involved in NNR and NarR regulons: nitrate reductase \u03b2-subunit, TonB-dependent receptors, nitrite reductase, a TenA-type transcription regulator, and an unknown protein with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. (3) Proteins whose expression was affected mainly by the growth condition. This group contains SSU ribosomal protein S305 / \u03c354 modulation protein, and two short-chain reductase\u2013dehydrogenase proteins.",

Bacillus pallidus (B. pallidus) d-AI can catalyze isomerization of d-altrose to d-psicose, as well as d-arabinose and l-fucose. Three X-ray structures of B. pallidusd-AI in complexes with 2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol, glycerol and an inhibitor, l-fucitol, were determined at resolutions of 1.77, 1.60 and 2.60\u00a0\u00c5, respectively. B. pallidusd-AI forms a homo-hexamer, and one subunit has three domains of almost equal size; two Rossmann fold domains and a mimic of the (\u03b2/\u03b1) barrel fold domain. A catalytic metal ion (Mn2+) was found in the active site coordinated by Glu342, Asp366 and His532, and an additional metal ion was found at the channel for the passage of a substrate coordinated by Asp453. The X-ray structures basically supported the ene-diol mechanism for the aldose\u2013ketose isomerization by B. pallidusd-AI, as well as Escherichia coli (E. coli) l-FI, in which Glu342 and Asp366 facing each other at the catalytic metal ion transfer a proton from C2 to C1 and O1 to O2, acting as acid/base catalysts, respectively. However, considering the ionized state of Asp366, the catalytic reaction also possibly occurs through the negatively charged ene-diolate intermediate stabilized by the catalytic metal ion. A structural comparison with E. colil-FI showed that B. pallidusd-AI possibly interconverts between \u201copen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d forms, and that the additional metal ion found in B. pallidusd-AI may help to stabilize the channel region.",

To develop novel anti-anthracis drugs that inhibit AHAS, a chemical library was screened, and four chemicals, AVS2087, AVS2093, AVS2387, and AVS2236, were identified as potent inhibitors of catalytic subunit with IC50 values of 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02, 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04, 2.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, and 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively.

However, both these cationic macromolecules differently modulate the active site environment of the enzyme. The steady-state kinetic data revealed that whereas polylysine exhibited no influence on dansylamide (DNSA) dependent inhibition of the enzyme, Qds+ overcame such an inhibitory effect, leading to almost 70% restoration of the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

We altered T. litoralis Sh1B DNA polymerase's ability to read through the template-strand uracils by applying SDCM. Specific modification of individual cysteine residues in U-binding pocket \u2014 targets introduced into certain positions by site-directed mutagenesis \u2014 enables the enzyme to effectively replicate DNA containing uracils.

Data from MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS experiments confirmed the predicted N-terminal signal peptide cleavage site at residue A51 and the C-terminal cell wall anchor site at residue T1086. The protein was also derivatized with N-succinimidyloxycarbonyl-methyl-tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl) phosphonium bromide (TMPP-Ac-OSu) to assess the presence of additional N-terminal sites of mature SasG. TMPP-derivatized SasG peptides featured m/z peaks with a 572\u00a0Da mass increase over the equivalent underivatized peptides. Multiple N-terminal peptides, all of which were observed in the 150 amino acid segment following the signal peptide cleavage at the residue A51, were characterized from MS and MS/MS data, suggesting a series of successive N-terminal truncations of SasG. A strategy combining TMPP derivatization, multiple enzyme digestions to generate overlapping peptides and detailed MS analysis will be useful to determine and understand functional implications of PTMs in bacterial cell wall-anchored proteins, which are frequently involved in the modulation of virulence-associated bacterial surface properties.",

High-fidelity DNA polymerases, such as the enzyme responsible for the replication of bacteriophage T7 DNA, discriminate against similar substrates with an accuracy that approaches one error in a million base pairs while copying DNA at a rate of approximately 300 base pairs per second. When the polymerase does make an error, it stalls, giving time for the slower proofreading exonuclease to remove the mismatch so that the overall error frequency approaches one in a billion. Structural analysis reveals a large change in conformation after nucleotide binding from an open to a closed state. Kinetic analysis has shown that the substrate-induced structural change plays a key role in the discrimination between correct and incorrect base pairs by governing whether a nucleotide will be retained and incorporated or rapidly released.",

     "abstract": "DNA is a remarkable macromolecule that functions primarily as the carrier of the genetic information of organisms ranging from viruses to bacteria to eukaryotes. The ability of DNA polymerases to efficiently and accurately replicate genetic material represents one of the most fundamental yet complex biological processes found in nature. The central dogma of DNA polymerization is that the efficiency and fidelity of this biological process is dependent upon proper hydrogen-bonding interactions between an incoming nucleotide and its templating partner. However, the foundation of this dogma has been recently challenged by the demonstration that DNA polymerases can effectively and, in some cases, selectively incorporate non-natural nucleotides lacking classic hydrogen-bonding capabilities into DNA. In this review, we describe the results of several laboratories that have employed a variety of non-natural nucleotide analogs to decipher the molecular mechanism of DNA polymerization. The use of various non-natural nucleotides has lead to the development of several different models that can explain how efficient DNA synthesis can occur in the absence of hydrogen-bonding interactions. These models include the influence of steric fit and shape complementarity, hydrophobicity and solvation energies, base-stacking capabilities, and negative selection as alternatives to rules invoking simple recognition of hydrogen-bonding patterns. Discussions are also provided regarding how the kinetics of primer extension and exonuclease proofreading activities associated with high-fidelity DNA polymerases are influenced by the absence of hydrogen-bonding functional groups exhibited by non-natural nucleotides.",

     "abstract": "Most classical DNA polymerases, which function in normal DNA replication and repair, are unable to synthesize DNA opposite damage in the template strand. Thus in order to replicate through sites of DNA damage, cells are equipped with a variety of nonclassical DNA polymerases. These nonclassical polymerases differ from their classical counterparts in at least two important respects. First, nonclassical polymerases are able to efficiently incorporate nucleotides opposite DNA lesions while classical polymerases are generally not. Second, nonclassical polymerases synthesize DNA with a substantially lower fidelity than do classical polymerases. Many nonclassical polymerases are members of the Y-family of DNA polymerases, and this article focuses on the mechanisms of the four eukaryotic members of this family: polymerase eta, polymerase kappa, polymerase iota, and the Rev1 protein. We discuss the mechanisms of these enzymes at the kinetic and structural levels with a particular emphasis on how they accommodate damaged DNA substrates. Work over the last decade has shown that the mechanisms of these nonclassical polymerases are fascinating variations of the mechanism of the classical polymerases. The mechanisms of polymerases eta and kappa represent rather minor variations, while the mechanisms of polymerase iota and the Rev1 protein represent rather major variations. These minor and major variations all accomplish the same goal: they allow the nonclassical polymerases to circumvent the problems posed by the template DNA lesion.",

None of these enzymes possesses a proofreading subdomain, and their intrinsic fidelity of DNA synthesis is much lower than that of a polymerase that functions in cellular DNA replication. In this review, we discuss the similarities and differences of three members of Family X: polymerases \u03b2, \u03bb, and \u03bc. We focus on biochemical mechanisms, structural variation, fidelity and lesion bypass mechanisms, and cellular roles. Remarkably, although these enzymes have similar three-dimensional structures, their biochemical properties and cellular functions differ in important ways that impact cellular function.",

     "abstract": "Nearly every DNA polymerase characterized to date exclusively catalyzes the incorporation of mononucleotides into a growing primer using a DNA or RNA template as a guide to direct each incorporation event. There is, however, one unique DNA polymerase designated terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase that performs DNA synthesis using only single-stranded DNA as the nucleic acid substrate. In this chapter, we review the biological role of this enigmatic DNA polymerase and the biochemical mechanism for its ability to perform DNA synthesis in the absence of a templating strand. We compare and contrast the molecular events for template-independent DNA synthesis catalyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase with other well-characterized DNA polymerases that perform template-dependent synthesis. This includes a quantitative inspection of how terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase binds DNA and dNTP substrates, the possible involvement of a conformational change that precedes phosphoryl transfer, and kinetic steps that are associated with the release of products. These enzymatic steps are discussed within the context of the available structures of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in the presence of DNA or nucleotide substrate. In addition, we discuss the ability of proteins involved in replication and recombination to regulate the activity of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Finally, the biomedical role of this specialized DNA polymerase is discussed focusing on its involvement in cancer development and its use in biomedical applications such as labeling DNA for detecting apoptosis.",

Although many of the Pols encoded by most organisms are largely accurate, and participate in DNA replication and DNA repair, a sizeable fraction display a reduced fidelity, and act to catalyze potentially error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) past lesions that persist in the DNA. Striking the proper balance between use of these different enzymes during DNA replication, DNA repair, and TLS is essential for ensuring accurate duplication of the cell's genome. This review highlights mechanisms that organisms utilize to manage the actions of their different Pols.

By replenishing telomeric DNA lost during the cell cycle, telomerase overcomes one of the many hurdles facing cellular immortalization. Functionally, telomerase is a reverse transcriptase, and it shares structural and mechanistic features with this class of nucleotide polymerases. Telomerase is a very unusual reverse transcriptase because it remains stably associated with its template and because it reverse transcribes multiple copies of its template onto a single primer in one reaction cycle. Scope of review: Here, we review recent findings that illuminate our understanding of telomerase. Even though the specific emphasis is on structure and mechanism, we also highlight new insights into the roles of telomerase in human biology. General significance: Recent advances in the structural biology of telomerase, including high resolution structures of the catalytic subunit of a beetle telomerase and two domains of a ciliate telomerase catalytic subunit, provide new perspectives into telomerase biochemistry and reveal new puzzles.",

Likewise, the lower processivity of HIV-1 RT raises the issue of polymerization site targeting, should the enzyme re-engage its nucleic acid substrate several hundred nucleotides from the primer terminus. Although X-ray crystallography has clearly contributed to our understanding of RT-containing nucleoprotein complexes, it provides a static picture, revealing few details regarding motion of the enzyme on the substrate. Recent development of site-specific footprinting and the application of single molecule spectroscopy have allowed us to follow individual steps in the reverse transcription process with significantly greater precision.

     "abstract": "Abnormal replication of DNA is associated with many important human diseases, most notably viral infections and neoplasms. Existing approaches to chemotherapeutics for diseases associated with dysfunctional DNA replication classically involve nucleoside analogues that inhibit polymerase activity due to modification in the nucleobase and/or ribose moieties. These compounds must undergo multiple phosphorylation steps in vivo, converting them into triphosphosphates, in order to inhibit their targeted DNA polymerase. Nucleotide monophosphonates enable bypassing the initial phosphorylation step at the cost of decreased bioavailability. Relatively little attention has been paid to higher nucleotides (corresponding to the natural di- and triphosphate DNA polymerase substrates) as drug platforms due to their expected poor deliverability. However, a better understanding of DNA polymerase mechanism and fidelity dependence on the triphosphate moiety is beginning to emerge, aided by systematic incorporation into this group of substituted methylenebisphosphonate probes. Meanwhile, other bridging, as well as non-bridging, modifications have revealed intriguing possibilities for new drug design.

For this, we used state-of-the-art proteomic methods combined with a label-free quantitative strategy to define protein expression differences in kidney tubules from transgenic OVE26 type 1 diabetic and control mice. The analysis was performed with diabetic samples that displayed a pro-fibrotic phenotype. We have identified 476 differentially expressed proteins. Bioinformatic analysis indicated several clusters of regulated proteins in relevant functional groups such as TGF-\u03b2 signaling, tight junction maintenance, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism. Mass spectrometry detected expression changes of four physiologically relevant proteins were confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Of these, the Grb2-related adaptor protein (GRAP) was up-regulated in kidney tubules from diabetic mice and fibrotic kidneys from diabetic patients, and subsequently confirmed as a novel component of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in cultured human renal tubule cells. Thus, indicating a potential novel role for GRAP in TGF-\u03b2-induced tubule injury in diabetic kidney disease.

The catalytic properties of the wild-type enzyme and three mutants of strictly conserved residues (Ser13Ala, Asn48Ala and Pro49Ala) were studied in 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) conjugation reaction.

To identify the structural determinants that bring about transglycosylation activity, we mutated two aromatic residues, Phe166 and Trp197, which are likely located in the acceptor binding site, and the mutated enzymes (F166A, W197A) were characterized. When the time-courses of the enzymatic reaction toward chitin oligosaccharides were monitored by HPLC, the specific activity was decreased to about 5\u201310% of that of the wild type and the amounts of transglycosylation products were significantly reduced by the individual mutations. From comparison between the reaction time-courses obtained by HPLC and real-time ESI-MS, we found that the transglycosylation reaction takes place under the conditions used for HPLC but not under the ESI-MS conditions. The higher substrate concentration (5\u00a0mM) used for the HPLC determination is likely to bring about chitinase-catalyzed transglycosylation. Kinetic analysis of the time-courses obtained by HPLC indicated that the sugar residue affinity of +\u00a01 subsite was strongly reduced in both mutated enzymes, as compared with that of the wild type. The IC50 value for the inhibitor allosamidin determined by real-time ESI-MS was not significantly affected by the individual mutations, indicating that the state of the allosamidin binding site (from \u2212\u00a03 to \u2212\u00a01 subsites) was not changed in the mutated enzymes.

     "abstract": "Due to its potential as an antibiotic target, E. coli peptide deformylase (PDFEc) serves as a model enzyme system for inhibitor design. While investigating the structural\u2013functional and inhibitory features of this enzyme, we unexpectedly discovered that 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3,4-thiadiazole (AMT) served as a slow-binding inhibitor of PDFEc when the above compound was dissolved only in dimethylformamide (DMF), but not in any other solvent, and allowed to age. The time dependent inhibitory potency of the DMF-dissolved AMT was correlated with the broadening of the inhibitor's 295\u00a0nm spectral band toward the visible region, concomitant with the increase in the mass of the parent compound by about 2-fold. These data led to the suggestion that DMF facilitated the slow dimerization of AMT (via the formation of a disulfide bond), and that the dimeric form of AMT served as an inhibitor for PDFEc. The latter is not caused by the simple oxidation of sulfhydryl groups by oxidizing agents such as H2O2. Newly synthesized dimeric/dithiolated form of AMT (\u201cbis-AMT\u201d) exhibited similar spectral and inhibitory features as given by the parent compound when incubated with DMF.

     "abstract": "Studies on the aggregation of mutant proteins have provided new insights into the genetics of amyloid diseases and the role of the net charge of the protein on the rate, extent, and type of aggregate formation. In the present work, hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) was employed as the model protein. Acetylation and (separately) citraconylation were employed to neutralize the charge on lysine residues. Acetylation of the lysine residues promoted amyloid formation, resulting in more pronounced fibrils and a dramatic decline in the nucleation time. In contrast, citraconylation produced the opposite effect. In both cases, native secondary and tertiary structures appeared to be retained. Studies on the effect of pH on aggregation suggested greater possibilities for amorphous aggregate formation rather than fibrillation at pH values closer to neutrality, in which the protein is known to take up a conformation more similar to its native form. This is in accord with reports in the literature suggesting that formation of amorphous aggregates is more favored under relatively more native conditions. pH 5 provided a critical environment in which a mixture of amorphous and fibrillar structures were observed. Use of Tango and Aggrescan software which describe aggregation tendencies of different parts of a protein structure suggested critical importance of some of the lysine residues in the aggregation process. Results are discussed in terms of the importance of the net charge in control of protein\u2013protein interactions leading to aggregate formation and possible specific roles of lysine residues 96 and 97.",

     "abstract": "We previously showed that coagulation factor Xa (FXa) enhances activation of the fibrinolysis zymogen plasminogen to plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Implying that proteolytic modulation occurs in situ, intact FXa (FXa\u03b1) must be sequentially cleaved by plasmin or autoproteolysis, producing FXa\u03b2 and Xa33/13, which acquire necessary plasminogen binding sites. The implicit function of Xa33/13 in plasmin generation has not been demonstrated, nor has FXa\u03b1/\u03b2 or Xa33/13 been studied in clot lysis experiments. We now report that purified Xa33/13 increases tPA-dependent plasmin generation by at least 10-fold. Western blots confirmed that in situ conversion of FXa\u03b1/\u03b2 to Xa33/13 correlated to enhanced plasmin generation. Chemical modification of the FXa\u03b1 active site resulted in the proteolytic generation of a product distinct from Xa33/13 and inhibited the enhancement of plasminogen activation. Identical modification of Xa33/13 had no effect on tPA cofactor function. Due to its overwhelming concentration in the clot, fibrin is the accepted tPA cofactor. Nevertheless, at the functional level of tPA that circulates in plasma, FXa\u03b1/\u03b2 or Xa33/13 greatly reduced purified fibrin lysis times by as much as 7-fold. This effect was attenuated at high levels of tPA, suggesting a role when intrinsic plasmin generation is relatively low. FXa\u03b1/\u03b2 or Xa33/13 did not alter the apparent size of fibrin degradation products, but accelerated the initial cleavage of fibrin to fragment X, which is known to optimize the tPA cofactor activity of fibrin. Thus, coagulation FXa\u03b1 undergoes proteolytic modulation to enhance fibrinolysis, possibly by priming the tPA cofactor function of fibrin.",

     "abstract": "Collagens of either soft connective or mineralized tissues are subject to continuous remodeling and turnover. Undesired cleavage can be the result of an imbalance between proteases and their inhibitors. Owing to their superhelical structure, collagens are resistant to many proteases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are required to initiate further degradation by other enzymes. Several MMPs are known to degrade collagens, but the action of MMP-12 has not yet been studied in detail. In this work, the potential of MMP-12 in recognizing sites in human skin collagen types I and III has been investigated. The catalytic domain of MMP-12 binds to the triple helix and cleaves the typical sites -Gly775-Leu776- in \u03b1-2 type I collagen and -Gly775-Ile776- in \u03b1-1 type I and type III collagens and at multiple other sites in both collagen types. Moreover, it was observed that the region around these typical sites contains comparatively less prolines, of which some have been proven to be only partially hydroxylated. This is of relevance since partial hydroxylation in the vicinity of a potential scissile bond may have a local effect on the conformational thermodynamics with probable consequences on the collagenolysis process. Taken together, the results of the present work confirm that the catalytic domain of MMP-12 alone binds and degrades collagens I and III.",

The size of this isotope effect suggests that the reaction is concerted. From the X-ray structure of a related enzyme, it appears that the only residue capable of acting as the general acid needed for removal of the hydroxyl group is threonine-172, which is contained in a conserved TRF motif. The more favorable entropy of activation for the enzyme-catalyzed process (25 eu larger than for the acid-catalyzed reaction) has been explained by a preorganized microenvironment that obviates the need for extensive solvent reorganization. This is consistent with forced planarity of the ring and side chain, which would place the leaving carboxyl and hydroxyl out of plane. Such distortion of the substrate may be a major contributor to catalysis.",

In the present study, we characterize the role of CTD in the function of Uup, on its overall stability and in DNA binding. To this end, we expressed and purified isolated CTD and we investigated the structural and functional role of this domain. The results underline that CTD is essential for the function of Uup, is stable and able to fold up autonomously. We compared the DNA binding activities of three versions of the protein (Uup, Uup\u0394CTD and CTD) by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. CTD is able to bind DNA although less efficiently than intact Uup and Uup\u0394CTD. These observations suggest that CTD is an essential domain that contributes directly to the DNA binding ability of Uup.",

Its active site consists of a non-heme ferrous center in an unusual [Fe(NHis)4 (SCys)1] square pyramidal pentacoordination that efficiently reduces superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. In previous works, the reaction mechanism of the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii enzyme, studied by pulse radiolysis, was shown to involve the formation of two reaction intermediates T1 and T2. However, the absorption spectrum of T2 was reported with an unusual sharp band at 625\u00a0nm, very different from that reported for other SORs. In this work, we show that the sharp band at 625\u00a0nm observed by pulse radiolysis reflects the presence of photochemical processes that occurs at the level of the transient species formed during the reaction of SOR with superoxide. These processes do not change the stoichiometry of the global reaction. These data highlight remarkable photochemical properties for these reaction intermediates, not previously suspected for iron-peroxide species formed in the SOR active site. We have reinvestigated the reaction mechanism of the SOR from D. baarsii by pulse radiolysis in the absence of these photochemical processes. The T1 and T2 intermediates now appear to have absorption spectra similar to those reported for the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SOR enzymes. Although for some enzymes of the family only one transient was reported, on the whole, the reaction mechanisms of the different SORs studied so far seem very similar, which is in agreement with the strong sequence and structure homologies of their active sites.",

The derived equations were used for the analysis of cross-linking by glutardialdehyde of four protein hexamers: beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), jack bean urease, hemocyanin from the spiny lobster Panulirus pencillatus (PpHc), Escherichia coli glutamate decarboxylase (GDC) and for analysis of published data on the cross-linking of hexameric E. coli rho by dimethyl suberimidate. Best fit models showed that the subunits in the first four proteins are arranged according to D3 symmetry in two layers, each subunit able to cross-link to three neighboring subunits for GDH and urease, or to four for PpHc and GDC. The findings indicate a dimer-of-trimers eclipsed arrangement of subunits for GDH and urease and a trimer-of-dimers staggered one for PpHc and GDC. In rho, the subunits are arranged according to D3 symmetry in a trimer-of-dimers ring.

     "abstract": "Many small cationic peptides, which are unstructured in aqueous solution, have antimicrobial properties. These properties are assumed to be linked to their ability to permeabilize bacterial membranes, accompanied by the transition to an \u03b1-helical folding state. Here we show that there is no direct link between folding of the antimicrobial peptide Novicidin (Nc) and its membrane permeabilization. N-terminal acylation with C8\u2013C16 alkyl chains and the inclusion of anionic lipids both increase Nc's ability to form \u03b1-helical structure in the presence of vesicles. Nevertheless, both acylation and anionic lipids reduce the extent of permeabilization of these vesicles and lead to slower permeabilization kinetics. Furthermore, acylation significantly decreases antimicrobial activity. Although acyl chains of increasing length also increase the tendency of the peptides to aggregate in solution, this cannot rationalize our results since permeabilization and antimicrobial activities are observed well below concentrations where aggregation occurs. This suggests that significant induction of \u03b1-helical structure is not a prerequisite for membrane perturbation in this class of antimicrobial peptides. Our data suggests that for Nc, induction of \u03b1-helical structure may inhibit rather than facilitate membrane disruption, and that a more peripheral interaction may be the most efficient permeabilization mechanism. Furthermore, acylation leads to a deeper embedding in the membrane, which could lead to an anti-permeabilizing \u201cplugging\u201d effect.",

     "abstract": "We have studied the effects on alkaline phosphatase of adding high concentrations (normally 1.0\u00a0M) of simple salts. It is necessary to allow for significant effects of salts on the extinction coefficient of the reaction product, and on the apparent pH of the buffer. Both activity and stability of the enzyme correlate well with the Hofmeister series in terms of the salt's kosmotropic/chaotropic properties, which are assessed by the Jones\u2013Dole viscosity B coefficients (B+ for cations and B\u2212 for anions). The catalytic activity or Vmax/Km of the enzyme showed a bell-shaped relationship with the (B\u2212\u00a0\u2212\u00a0B+) values of the salts present, being optimal with salts (such as NaCl, KCl, and KNO3) where the anion and cation have similar kosmotropic/chaotropic properties. This effect is believed to be enzyme-specific and relates to the impact of both cations and anions on the enzyme's surface pH, active site, and catalytic mechanism. Anions play a more predominant role than cations in affecting enzyme stability. The rate of irreversible thermal inactivation is strongly reduced by addition of kosmotropic anions like SO42\u2212 (half-life increased from 8 to 580\u00a0min at 60\u00a0\u00b0C). This effect is general and the mechanism probably involves the ability of the ions to affect the water solvation layer around the enzyme molecule and to interact with both the surface and internal structure of the enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Human lens proteins (HLP) become chemically modified by kynurenines and advanced glycation end products (AGEs) during aging and cataractogenesis. We investigated the effects of kynurenines on AGE synthesis in HLP. We found that incubation with 5\u00a0mM ribose or 5\u00a0mM ascorbate produced significant quantities of pentosidine, and this was further enhanced in the presence of two different kynurenines (200\u2013500\u00a0\u00b5M): N-formylkynurenine (Nfk) and kynurenine (Kyn). Another related compound, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-Kyn), had disparate effects; low concentrations (10\u2013200\u00a0\u00b5M) promoted pentosidine synthesis, but high concentrations (200\u2013500\u00a0\u00b5M) inhibited it. 3OH-Kyn showed similar effects on pentosidine synthesis from Amadori-enriched HLP or ribated lysine. Chelex-100 treatment of phosphate buffer reduced pentosidine synthesis from Amadori-enriched HLP by \u223c\u00a090%, but it did not inhibit the stimulating effect of 3OH-Kyn and EDTA. 3OH-Kyn (100\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcM) spontaneously produced copious amounts of H2O2 (10\u201325\u00a0\u03bcM), but externally added H2O2 had only a mild stimulating effect on pentosidine but had no effect on N\u03b5-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) synthesis in HLP from ribose and ascorbate. Further, human lens epithelial cells incubated with ribose and 3OH-Kyn showed higher intracellular pentosidine than cells incubated with ribose alone. CML synthesis from glycating agents was inhibited 30 to 50% by 3OH-Kyn at concentrations of 100\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcM. Argpyrimidine synthesis from 5\u00a0mM methylglyoxal was slightly inhibited by all kynurenines at concentrations of 100\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcM. These results suggest that AGE synthesis in HLP is modulated by kynurenines, and such effects indicate a mode of interplay between kynurenines and carbohydrates important for AGE formation during lens aging and cataract formation.",

     "abstract": "We have previously shown that glutaredoxin 2 (Grx2) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae localizes at 3 different subcellular compartments, cytosol, mitochondrial matrix and outer membrane, as the result of different postranslational processing of one single gene. Having set the mechanism responsible for this remarkable phenomenon, we have now aimed at defining whether this diversity of subcellular localizations correlates with differences in structure and function of the Grx2 isoforms. We have determined the N-terminal sequence of the soluble mitochondrial matrix Grx2 by mass spectrometry and have determined the exact cleavage site by Mitochondrial Processing Peptidase (MPP). As a consequence of this cleavage, the mitochondrial matrix Grx2 isoform possesses a basic tetrapeptide extension at the N-terminus compared to the cytosolic form. A functional relationship to this structural difference is that mitochondrial Grx2 displays a markedly higher activity in the catalysis of GSSG reduction by the mitochondrial dithiol dihydrolipoamide. We have prepared Grx2 mutants affected on key residues inside the presequence to direct the protein to one single cellular compartment; either the cytosol, the mitochondrial membrane or the matrix and have analyzed their functional phenotypes. Strains expressing Grx2 only in the cytosol are equally sensitive to H2O2 as strains lacking the gene, whereas those expressing Grx2 exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix are more resistant. Mutations on key basic residues drastically affect the cellular fate of the protein, showing that evolutionary diversification of Grx2 structural and functional properties are strictly dependent on the sequence of the targeting signal peptide.",

The couplings of the distal residues to the ones in the active site have been analyzed using site-directed mutants. To expand our understanding of the structural and functional influences of distal residue mutation, we explored the structural stability and enzymatic activity of deletion mutants. Deletion has greater structural and dynamical impacts on the corresponding part than site-directed mutation does. Thus, deletion amplifies the effects caused by distal mutations, which should make the mutual couplings among the distant residues more apparent. We focused on residues 52, 67, 121, and 145 in the four distinct loops of DHFR. All the single-residue deletion mutants showed marked reduction in stability, except for \u039452 in an \u03b1C\u2013\u03b2C loop. Double deletion mutants showed that the loop \u03b1C\u2013\u03b2C has nonadditive couplings with the \u03b2F\u2013\u03b2G and \u03b2G\u2013\u03b2H loops regarding stability. Single deletion to the loops \u03b1C\u2013\u03b2C or \u03b2C\u2013\u03b2D resulted in considerable activity reduction, demonstrating that the loops couple to the residues near the active site.

     "abstract": "F508del-CFTR, the most common mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, disrupts intracellular trafficking leading to cystic fibrosis (CF). The trafficking defect of F508del-CFTR can be rescued by simultaneous inactivation of its four RXR motifs (4RK). Proteins involved in the F508del-CFTR trafficking defect and/or rescue are therefore potential CF therapeutic targets. We sought to identify these proteins by investigating differential proteome modulation in BHK cells over-expressing wt-CFTR, F508del-CFTR or the revertant F508del/4RK-CFTR. By 2-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics and western blot approaches we demonstrated that over-expression of F508del/4RK-CFTR modulates the expression of a large number of proteins, many of which are reported interactors of CFTR and/or 14-3-3 with potential roles in CFTR trafficking. GRP78/BiP, a marker of ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR), is up-regulated in cells over-expressing either F508del-CFTR or F598del/4RK-CFTR. However, over-expression of F508del/4RK-CFTR induces the up-regulation of many other UPR-associated proteins (e.g. GRP94, PDI, GRP75/mortalin) and, interestingly, the down-regulation of proteasome components associated with CFTR degradation, such as the proteasome activator PA28 (PSME2) and COP9 signalosome (COPS5/CSN5). Moreover, the F508del-CFTR-induced proteostasis imbalance, which involves some heat shock chaperones (e.g. HSP72/Hpa2), ER-EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (calumenin) and the proteasome activator PA28 (PSME2), tends to be \u2018restored\u2019, i.e., in BHK cells over-expressing F508del/4RK-CFTR those proteins tend to have expression levels similar to the wild-type ones. These findings indicate that a particular cellular environment orchestrated by the UPR contributes to and/or is compatible with F508del/4RK-CFTR rescue.",

About half of the SR398/GroES cages encapsulated target protein molecules.

Here we report systematic characterization of a new two-domain peptide (named MeuTXK\u03b21) belonging to the TsTXK\u03b2 molecular subfamily from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus by molecular cloning, biochemical purification, recombinant expression, functional assays, CD and NMR studies. Its full-length bioactive form as well as 1\u201321 and 22\u201372 fragments (named N(1\u201321) and C(22\u201372), respectively) was produced in Escherichia coli by an on-column refolding approach. Recombinant peptide (rMeuTXK\u03b21) exhibited a low affinity for K+ channels and cytolytic effects against bacteria and several eukaryotic cells. N(1\u201321) was found to preserve anti-Plasmodium activity in contrast to haemolytic activity, whereas C(22\u201372) retains these two activities. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that rMeuTXK\u03b21 presents a typical scorpion toxin scaffold in water and its \u03b1-helical content largely increases in a membrane-mimicking environment, consistent with the NMR structure of N(1\u201321) and an ab initio structure model of MeuTXK\u03b21 predicted using I-TASSER algorithm.

The aim of the present study was to clarify whether such phosphorylation may occur in molluscan muscles. We detected three kinases endogenous to molluscan catch muscle, namely, to the complex of surface thick filament proteins that consists of twitchin, myosin, and myorod. The first kinase was a protein kinase A because it was inhibited by a specific inhibitor; the second one was associated with twitchin and phosphorylated myorod at its N-terminal unique region independently of Ca2+; and the third kinase was bound to myosin and phosphorylated myorod as well as myosin in the C-terminal part of both proteins. The myosin-associated kinase was inhibited by micromolar concentration of calcium ions. This enzyme could be separated from myosin by chromatography, whereas the kinase associated with twitchin could not be separated from twitchin. Since twitchin has a MLCK-like domain, it is possible that this domain was responsible for myorod phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of myorod within the twitchin\u2013myosin\u2013myorod complex increased the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin. Taken together, these results indicate that phosphorylation of myorod by kinases associated with key proteins of catch contraction may contribute to the functional activity of myorod in molluscan smooth muscle.",

Two of them (TvL and ThL) are high redox potential and two (RvL and r-MaL) are low redox potential laccases. The outline of this work is focused on the determination of catalytic and bioelectrochemical properties of these four enzymes in homogenous solution as well as immobilized onto electrode surface in the presence of a set of different redox mediators. The results measured in the homogenous reaction system correlated well with those measured with the immobilized enzymes. In addition, they are in good agreement with those reported with reference techniques, suggesting that the electrochemical methods employed in this work can be applied well in place of the traditional techniques commonly used for the kinetic characterization of laccases.

The present work reports the kinetics of the interaction of l-lysine and some of its derivatives with SSAO.

It was also specific, since d-lysine, l-lysine ethyl ester and \u03b5-acetyl-l-lysine, for example, did not bind to the enzyme. The lysine-rich protein soluble elastin bound to the enzyme relatively tightly, which may have relevance to the reported roles of SSAO in maintaining the extracellular matrix (ECM) and in the maturation of elastin. Our data show that lysyl residues are not oxidized by SSAO, but they bind tightly to the enzyme in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.

     "abstract": "Metronidazole (MTZ) is an antibiotic commonly used to treat anaerobic bacterial infections in humans and animals. Antibiotic resistance toward this class of 5-nitroimidazole (5-Ni) drug derivatives has been related to the Nim genes thought to encode a reductase. Here we report the biophysical characteristics of the NimA protein from Deinococcus radiodurans (DrNimA) binding to MTZ and three other 5-Ni drugs. The interaction energies of the protein and antibiotic are studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and with free energy and linear interaction energy (LIE) calculations, where the latter method revealed that the antibiotic binding is mainly of hydrophobic character. ITC measurements further found that one DrNimA dimer has two antibiotic binding sites which were not affected by mutation of the reactive His71. The observed association constants (Ka) were in the range of 5.1\u201349\u00a0\u204e\u00a0104\u00a0M\u2212\u00a01 and the enthalpy release upon binding to DrNimA for the four drugs studied was relatively low (\u223c \u2212\u00a01\u00a0kJ/mol) but still measurable. The drug binding is mainly entropy driven and along with the hydrophobic drug binding site found by crystallography, this possibly explains the low observed enthalpy values. The effect of the His71 mutation and the presence of MTZ were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Native DrNimA is a yellow colored protein where the interaction from His71 to the cofactor is thought to be responsible for the coloring. Mutations of His71 to Ala, Ser, Leu or Asp all gave transparent, colorless protein solutions, and the two mutant crystal structures of DrNimA-H71A and DrNimA-H71S presented revealed no cofactor binding.",

Targets were those amino acids identified to be important by 3D structure analysis of BsXynA in complex with substrate bound in the glycon subsites and the +\u00a01 aglycon subsite. Several aromatic residues in the aglycon subsites that make strong substrate\u2013protein interactions and that are indispensable for enzyme activity, were also important for the specificity of the xylanase. In the +\u00a02 subsite of BsXynA, Tyr65 and Trp129 were identified as residues that are involved in the binding of decorated substrates. Most interestingly, replacement of Tyr88 by Ala in the +\u00a03 subsite created an enzyme able to produce a wider variety of hydrolysis products than wild type BsXynA. The contribution of the +\u00a03 subsite to the substrate specificity of BsXynA was established more in detail by mapping the enzyme binding site of the wild type xylanase and mutant Y88A with labelled xylo-oligosaccharides. Also, the length of the cord \u2013 a long loop flanking the aglycon subsites of GH11 xylanases \u2013 proved to impact the hydrolytic action of BsXynA.

The biological membranes or other interfaces as well as the convection of the extracellular fluids in the brain may influence A\u03b2 amyloid fibril formation in vivo. Here, we examined the polymerization kinetics of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 in the presence or absence of air\u2013water interface (AWI) using fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy with the amyloid specific dye, thioflavin T. When the solutions were incubated with AWI and in quiescence, amyloid fibril formation was observed at all A\u03b2 concentrations examined. In contrast, when incubated without AWI, amyloid fibril formation was observed only at higher A\u03b2 concentrations (10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM). Importantly, when the 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 solution was incubated with AWI, a ThT-reactive film was first observed at AWI without any other ThT-reactive aggregates in the bulk. When 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 solutions were voltexed or rotated with AWI, amyloid fibril formation was considerably accelerated, where a ThT-reactive film was first observed at AWI before ThT-reactive aggregates were observed throughout the mixture. When 5\u00a0\u03bcM A\u03b2 solutions containing a polypropylene disc were rotated without AWI, amyloid fibril formation was also considerably accelerated, where fine ThT-reactive aggregates were first found attached at the edge of the disc. These results indicate the critical roles of interfaces and agitation for amyloid fibril formation. Furthermore, elimination of AWI may be essential for proper evaluation of the roles of various biological molecules in the amyloid formation studies in vitro.",

     "abstract": "Protein intrinsic disorder is becoming increasingly recognized in proteomics research. While lacking structure, many regions of disorder have been associated with biological function. There are many different experimental methods for characterizing intrinsically disordered proteins and regions; nevertheless, the prediction of intrinsic disorder from amino acid sequence remains a useful strategy especially for many large-scale proteomic investigations. Here we introduced a consensus artificial neural network (ANN) prediction method, which was developed by combining the outputs of several individual disorder predictors. By eight-fold cross-validation, this meta-predictor, called PONDR-FIT, was found to improve the prediction accuracy over a range of 3 to 20% with an average of 11% compared to the single predictors, depending on the datasets being used. Analysis of the errors shows that the worst accuracy still occurs for short disordered regions with less than ten residues, as well as for the residues close to order/disorder boundaries. Increased understanding of the underlying mechanism by which such meta-predictors give improved predictions will likely promote the further development of protein disorder predictors.

     "abstract": "The bikunin proteins are composed of heavy chains (HCs) covalently linked to a chondroitin sulfate chain originating from Ser-10 of bikunin. Tumor necrosis factor stimulated gene-6 protein (TSG-6)/heavy chain 2 (HC2) cleaves this unique cross-link and transfers the HCs to hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans via a covalent HC\u2022TSG-6 intermediate. In the present study, we have investigated if this reaction is evolutionary conserved based on the hypothesis that it is of fundamental importance. The results revealed that plasma/serum samples from mammal, bird, and reptile were able to form TSG-6 complexes suggesting the presence of proteins with the same function as the human bikunin proteins. To substantiate this, the complex forming protein from Gallus gallus (Gg) plasma was purified and identified as a Gg homolog of human HC2\u2022bikunin. In addition, Gg pre-\u03b1-inhibitor and smaller amount of high molecular weight forms composed of bikunin and two HCs were purified. Like the human bikunin proteins, the purified Gg proteins were all stabilized by a protein\u2013glycosaminoglycan\u2013protein cross-link, i.e. the HCs were covalently attached to a chondroitin sulfate originating from bikunin. Furthermore, the complex formed between Gg HC2\u2022bikunin and human TSG-6 appeared to be identical to that of the human proteins. Akin to human, Gg HC2 was further transferred to hyaluronan when present, and when incubated in vitro, Gg pre-\u03b1-inhibitor and TSG-6, failed to form the intermediate covalent complex, essential for HC transfer. Significantly, Gg HC2, analogous to human HC2, promoted complex formation between human HC3 and human TSG-6, substantiating the evolutionary conservation of these interactions. The present study demonstrates that the unique interactions between bikunin proteins, glycosaminoglycans, and TSG-6 are evolutionary conserved, emphasizing the physiological importance of the TSG-6/HC2-mediated HC-transfer reaction. In addition, the data show that the evolution of HC transfer is likely to predate the role of HC\u00b7HA complexes in female fertility and thus has evolved in the context of inflammation rather than fertility.",

     "abstract": "Peptide XT-7 (GLLGP5LLKIA10AKVGS15NLL.NH2) is a cationic, leucine-rich peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog, Silurana tropicalis (Pipidae). The peptide shows potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its therapeutic potential is limited by haemolytic activity (LC50\u00a0=\u00a0140\u00a0\u00b5M). The analogue [G4K]XT-7, however, retains potent antimicrobial activity but is non-haemolytic (LC50\u00a0>\u00a0500\u00a0\u00b5M). In order to elucidate the molecular basis for this difference in properties, the three dimensional structures of XT-7 and the analogue have been investigated by proton NMR spectroscopy and molecular modelling. In aqueous solution, both peptides lack secondary structure. In a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE-d3)-H2O mixed solvent system, XT-7 is characterised by a right handed \u03b1-helical conformation between residues Leu3 and Leu17 whereas [G4K]XT-7 adopts a more restricted \u03b1-helical conformation between residues Leu6 and Leu17. A similar conformation for XT-7 in 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DHPC) micellular media was observed with a helical segment between Leu3 and Leu17. However, differences in side chain orientations restricting the hydrophilic residues to a smaller patch resulted in an increased hydrophobic surface relative to the conformation in TFE-H2O. Molecular modelling of the structures obtained in our study demonstrates the amphipathic character of the helical segments. It is proposed that the marked decrease in haemolytic activity produced by the substitution Gly4\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Lys in XT-7 arises from a decrease in both helicity and hydrophobicity. These studies may facilitate the development of potent but non-toxic anti-infective agents based upon the structure of XT-7.",

     "abstract": "Recent years have observed significant advances in our understanding of how the serine/threonine kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) controls key cellular processes such as cell survival, growth and proliferation. Consistent with its role in cell proliferation, the mTOR pathway is frequently hyperactivated in a number of human malignancies and is thus considered to be an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. Rapamycin and its analogs (rapalogs) function as allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 and are currently used in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Rapamycin and its derivatives bind to the small immunophilin FKBP12 to inhibit mTORC1 signalling through a poorly understood mechanism. Rapamycin/FKBP12 efficiently inhibit some, but not all, functions of mTOR and hence much interest has been placed in the development of drugs that target the kinase activity of mTOR directly. Several novel active-site inhibitors of mTOR, which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, were developed in the last year. In this manuscript, we provide a brief outline of our current understanding of the mTOR signalling pathway and review the molecular underpinnings of the action of rapamycin and novel active-site mTOR inhibitors as well as potential advantages and caveats associated with the use of these drugs in the treatment of cancer.",

Here we review the profile of nilotinib as a protein kinase inhibitor. Although an ATP-competitive inhibitor of Abl, nilotinib binds to a catalytically inactive conformation (DFG-out) of the activation loop. As a consequence of this, nilotinib exhibits time-dependent inhibition of Abl kinase in enzymatic assays, which can be extrapolated to other targets to explain differences between biochemical activity and cellular assays. Although these differences confound assessment of kinase selectivity, as assessed using a combination of protein binding and transphosphorylation assays, together with cellular autophosporylation and proliferation assays, well established kinase targets of nilotinib in rank order of inhibitory potency are DDR-1\u00a0>\u00a0DDR-2\u00a0>\u00a0BCR-Abl (Abl)\u00a0>\u00a0PDGFR\u03b1/\u03b2\u00a0>\u00a0KIT\u00a0>\u00a0CSF-1R.

These two new drugs, albeit very efficient against most of the imatinib-resistant mutants of Bcr\u2013Abl, fail to effectively suppress the Bcr\u2013Abl activity of the T315I (or gatekeeper) mutation. Generating new ATP site-binding drugs that target the T315I in Abl has been hampered, amongst others, by target selectivity, which is frequently an issue when developing ATP-competitive inhibitors. Recently, using an unbiased cellular screening approach, GNF-2, a non-ATP-competitive inhibitor, has been identified that demonstrates cellular activity against Bcr\u2013Abl transformed cells. The exquisite selectivity of GNF-2 is due to the finding that it targets the myristate binding site located near the C-terminus of the Abl kinase domain, as demonstrated by genetic approaches, solution NMR and X-ray crystallography. GNF-2, like myristate, is able to induce and/or stabilize the clamped inactive conformation of Abl analogous to the SH2-Y527 interaction of Src.

Over the past 2 decades, molecular profiling of low- and high-grade malignant brain tumours has led to the identification and molecular characterisation of mechanisms leading to brain cancer development, maintenance and progression. Genetic alterations occurring during gliomagenesis lead to uncontrolled tumour growth stimulated by deregulated signal transduction pathways. The characterisation of hyperactivated signalling pathways has identified many potential molecular targets for therapeutic interference in human gliomas. Overexpressed or mutated and constitutively active kinases are attractive targets for low-molecular-weight inhibitors.

     "abstract": "At the first glance CK2\u03b1, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase CK2, is a rigid molecule: in contrast to many eukaryotic protein kinases in CK2\u03b1 the canonical regulatory key elements like the activation segment occur exclusively in their typical active conformations. This observation fits well to the constitutive activity of the enzyme, meaning, its independence from phosphorylation or other characteristic control factors. Most CK2\u03b1 structures are based on the enzyme from Zea mays, supplemented by an increasing number of human CK2\u03b1 structures. In the latter a surprising plasticity of important ATP-binding elements \u2013 the interdomain hinge region and the glycine-rich loop \u2013 was discovered. In fully active CK2\u03b1 the hinge region is open and does not anchor the ATP ribose, but alternatively it can adopt a closed conformation, form hydrogen bonds to the ribose moiety and thus retract the \u03b3-phospho group from its functional position. In addition to this partially inactive state human CK2\u03b1 was recently found in a fully inactive conformation. It is incompatible with ATP-binding due to a combination of a closed hinge and a collapse of the glycine-rich loop into the ATP cavity. These conformational transitions are apparently correlated with the occupation state of a remote docking site located at the interface to the non-catalytic subunit CK2\u03b2: if CK2\u03b2 blocks this site, the fully active conformation of CK2\u03b1 is stabilized, while the binding of certain small molecule seems to favour the partially and fully inactive states. This observation may be exploited to design effective and selective CK2 inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "At variance with most oncogenic protein kinases whose malignancy is generally due to genetic alterations conferring constitutive activity, CK2 is a highly pleiotropic Ser/Thr protein kinase naturally endowed with constitutive activity and lacking gain-of-function mutants. Nonetheless CK2 is abnormally elevated in a wide variety of tumors and there is strong evidence that it operates as a cancer driver by creating a cellular environment favorable to neoplasia: notably, CK2 plays a global role as an anti-apoptotic and pro-survival agent, it enhances the multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, it assists the chaperone machinery which protects the \u201conco-kinome\u201d and it promotes neo-angiogenesis. Based on this scenario we propose that the implication of CK2 in neoplasia is an example of \u201cnon oncogene addiction\u201d, i.e. over reliance of the perturbed cellular signaling network on high CK2 level for its own maintenance. Consistent with this, an ample spectrum of diverse types of cancer cells have been already shown to rely on high CK2 level for their survival, as judged from their response to specific CK2 inhibitors and silencing of endogenous CK2 catalytic subunits. Remarkably, among these are cells whose cancer phenotype arises from the genetic alteration of onco-kinases (e.g. Abl and Alk) different from CK2 and insensitive to the CK2 inhibitors used in those experiments. Based on these premises, CK2 could represent a \u201cmulti-purpose\u201d target for the treatment of different kinds of tumors.",

Perturbations in regulatory protein kinase and caspase networks induce alterations in cell survival and frequently accompany transformation and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, recent studies have documented that caspases or their substrates are subject to phosphorylation in cells illustrating a potential convergence of protein kinase and caspase signaling pathways. Interestingly, a number of caspase substrates are protected from cleavage when they are phosphorylated at sites that are adjacent to caspase cleavage sites. While it is theoretically possible that many distinct protein kinases could protect proteins from caspase-mediated cleavage, protein kinase CK2 is of particular interest because acidic amino acids, including aspartic acid residues that are recognized by caspases, are its dominant specificity determinants.",

DT-2, a peptidic inhibitor of PKG, has played a central role in determining the molecular mechanisms of vascular control involving PKG and its signaling partners. Here, we report the development of (d)-amino acid DT-2 derivatives, namely the retro-inverso ri-(d)-DT-2 and the all (d)-amino acid analog, (d)-DT-2. Both peptide analogs were potent PKG I\u03b1 inhibitors with Ki values of 5.5\u00a0nM (ri-(d)-DT-2) and 0.8\u00a0nM ((d)-DT-2) as determined using a hyperbolic mixed-type inhibition model. Also, both analogs were proteolytically stable in vivo, showed elevated selectivity, and displayed enhanced membrane translocation properties. Studies on isolated arteries from the resistance vasculature demonstrated that intraluminally perfused (d)-DT-2 significantly inhibited vasodilation induced by 8-Br-cGMP. Furthermore, in vivo application of (d)-DT-2 established a uniform translocation pattern in the resistance vasculature, with exception of the brain. Thus, (d)-DT-2 caused significant increases in mean arterial blood pressure in unrestrained, awake mice. Further, mesenteric arteries isolated from (d)-DT-2 treated animals showed a markedly reduced dilator response to 8-Br-cGMP in vitro. Our results clearly demonstrate that (d)-DT-2 is a superior inhibitor of PKG I\u03b1 and its application in vivo leads to sustained inhibition of PKG in vascular smooth muscle cells. The discovery of (d)-DT-2 may help our understanding of how blood vessels constrict and dilate and may also aid the development of new strategies and therapeutic agents targeted to the prevention and treatment of vascular disorders such as hypertension, stroke and coronary artery disease.",

Our programmatic approach focuses on the construction of intracellular probes, including sensors, inhibitors, and functionally unique proteins that can be temporally and spatially controlled by the investigator even after they have entered the cell. We have designed and evaluated protein kinase sensors that furnish a fluorescent readout upon phosphorylation. In addition, since the sensors are inert (i.e., cannot be phosphorylated) until activated by light, they can be carried through the various stages of any given cell-based behavior without being consumed. Using this strategy, we have shown that PKC\u03b2 is essential for nuclear envelope breakdown and thus the transition from prophase to metaphase in actively dividing cells. Photoactivatable proteins furnish the means to initiate cellular signaling pathways with a high degree of spatial and temporal control. We have used this approach to demonstrate that cofilin serves as a component of the steering apparatus of the cell. Finally, inhibitors are commonly used to assess the participation of specific enzymes in signaling pathways that control cellular behavior. We have constructed a photo-deactivatable inhibitor, an inhibitory species that can be switched off with light. In the absence of light, the target enzyme is inactive due to the presence of the potent inhibitory molecule. Upon photolysis, the inhibitory molecule is destroyed and enzymatic activity is released.",

As a result of their effectiveness in treating non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) driven by somatic mutations in the EGFR kinase, gefitinib and erlotinib were the first EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) approved for clinical use.

Here we review recent structural and enzymological studies that explore the exquisite sensitivity of a subset of these lung cancer mutants to gefitinib and erlotinib. We discuss available structural evidence for the mechanisms of activation of the EGFR kinase by these mutants, and compare it to physiologic activation of the kinase by ligand-induced dimerization.

VEGFRs are activated upon ligand-induced dimerization mediated by the extracellular domain (ECD). A study using receptor constructs carrying artificial dimerization-promoting transmembrane domains (TMDs) showed that receptor dimerization is necessary, but not sufficient, for receptor activation and demonstrates that distinct orientation of receptor monomers is required to instigate transmembrane signaling. Angiogenic signaling by VEGF receptors also depends on cooperation with specific coreceptors such as neuropilins and HSPG. A number of VEGF isoforms differ in binding to coreceptors, and ligand-specific signal output is apparently the result of the specific coreceptor complex assembled by a particular VEGF isoform.

     "abstract": "Malaria still remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases, and has a tremendous morbidity and mortality impact in the developing world. The propensity of the parasites to develop drug resistance, and the relative reluctance of the pharmaceutical industry to invest massively in the developments of drugs that would offer only limited marketing prospects, are major issues in antimalarial drug discovery. Protein kinases (PKs) have become a major family of targets for drug discovery research in a number of disease contexts, which has generated considerable resources such as kinase-directed libraries and high throughput kinase inhibition assays. The phylogenetic distance between malaria parasites and their human host translates into important divergences in their respective kinomes, and most Plasmodium kinases display atypical properties (as compared to mammalian PKs) that can be exploited towards selective inhibition. Here, we discuss the taxon-specific kinases possessed by malaria parasites, and give an overview of target PKs that have been validated by reverse genetics, either in the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum or in the rodent model Plasmodium berghei. We also briefly allude to the possibility of attacking Plasmodium through the inhibition of human PKs that are required for survival of this obligatory intracellular parasite, and which are targets for other human diseases.",

Different types of Tyr-kinases have been identified in bacteria and a large number of them are similar to ATP-binding proteins with Walker motifs. These enzymes have been grouped in the same family (BY-kinases) and the crystal structures of two of them have been recently characterized. Phosphoproteome analysis suggest that BY-kinases are involved in several cellular processes and to date, the best-characterized role of BY-kinases concerns the control of extracellular polysaccharide synthesis. Knowing the role of these compounds in the virulence of bacterial pathogens, BY-kinases can be considered as promising targets to combat some diseases.

Borrowing from FBDD, the process involves fragmentation of known actives, proposition of binding mode hypotheses for the fragments, and model-driven recombination using a pharmacophore derived from known kinase inhibitor structures. The support vector machine method, using Merck atom pair derived fingerprint descriptors, was used to build models from activity from 6 kinase assays. These models were qualified prospectively by selecting and testing compounds from the internal compound collection. Overall hit and enrichment rates of 82% and 2.5%, respectively, qualified the models for use in library design.

Here, we review the reasons this discovery has been underappreciated, as well as discuss the robust results supporting its premier biological importance and utility for current research. We highlight our understanding of SOD function gained through structural biology analyses, which reveal important hydrogen-bonding schemes and metal-binding motifs. These structural features create remarkable enzymes that promote catalysis at faster than diffusion-limited rates by using electrostatic guidance. These architectures additionally alter the redox potential of the active site metal center to a range suitable for the superoxide disproportionation reaction and protect against inhibition of catalysis by molecules such as phosphate. SOD structures may also control their enzymatic activity through product inhibition; manipulation of these product inhibition levels has the potential to generate therapeutic forms of SOD. Markedly, structural destabilization of the SOD architecture can lead to disease, as mutations in Cu,ZnSOD may result in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a relatively common, rapidly progressing and fatal neurodegenerative disorder. We describe our current understanding of how these Cu,ZnSOD mutations may lead to aggregation/fibril formation, as a detailed understanding of these mechanisms provides new avenues for the development of therapeutics against this so far untreatable neurodegenerative pathology.",

In the oxidized state, we observe all the non-ligand His side chains and in the reduced state we can account for all the signals in the imidazole spectral region in terms of the non-ligand His\u2032, paramagnetically displaced signals from two backbone amides, and the side chain of glutamine 69 (Gln69). We also observe signals from the His\u2032 that ligate FeII. These confirm that neither the Q69H nor the Q69E mutation strongly affects the FeII electronic structure, despite the 250\u00a0mV and >\u00a0660\u00a0mV increases in Em they produce, respectively. In the Q69H mutant, we observe two new signals attributable to the His introduced into the active site in place of Gln69. One corresponds to a protonated N and the other is strongly paramagnetically shifted, to 500\u00a0ppm. The strong paramagnetic effects support the existence of an H-bond between His69 and the solvent molecule coordinated to FeII, as proposed based on crystallography. Based on previous information that His69 is neutral, we infer that the shifted N is not protonated. Therefore, we propose that this N represents a site of H-bond acceptance from coordinated solvent, representing a reversal of the polarity of this H-bond from that in WT (wild-type) FeSOD protein. We also present evidence that substrate analogs bind to FeIISOD outside the FeII coordination sphere, affecting Gln69 but without direct involvement of His30.",

These enzymes share the same unique catalytic site, an iron ion bound to four histidines and a cysteine that, in its reduced form, reacts with superoxide anion with a diffusion-limited second order rate constant of \u223c109 M\u22121 s\u22121.

This review summarizes our findings on the Mn(II) electronic structure of SODs and related synthetic models using high-field high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (HFEPR), a technique that is able to achieve a very detailed and quantitative information about the electronic structure of the Mn(II) ions. We have used HFEPR to compare eight different SODs, including iron, manganese and cambialistic proteins. This comparative approach has shown that in spite of their high structural homology each of these groups have specific spectroscopic and biochemical characteristics. This has allowed us to develop a model about how protein and metal interactions influence protein pK, inhibitor binding and the electronic structure of the manganese center. To better appreciate the thermodynamic prerequisites required for metal discriminatory SOD activity and their relationship to HFEPR spectroscopy, we review the work on synthetic model systems that functionally mimic Mn-and FeSOD. Using a single ligand framework, it was possible to obtain metal-discriminatory \u201cactivity\u201d as well as variations in the HFEPR spectra that parallel those found in the proteins.

Recent developments in mass spectrometry have enabled detailed structural analyses of covalent modifications of proteins and also have shed light on the post-translational modification of superoxide dismutase. In this review, we introduce some covalent modifications of superoxide dismutase, nitration, phosphorylation, glutathionylaion, and glycation. Nitration has been the most extensively analyzed modification both in vitro and in vivo. Reaction of human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) with reactive nitrogen species resulted in nitration of a single tryptophan residue to 6-nitrotryptophan, which could be a new biomarker of a formation of reactive nitrogen species. On the other hand, tyrosine 34 of human MnSOD was exclusively nitrated to 3-nitrotyrosine and almost completely inactivated by the reaction with peroxynitrite. The nitrated MnSOD has been found in many diseases caused by ischemia/reperfusion, inflammation, and others and may have a pivotal role in the pathology of the diseases. Most of the post-translational modifications have given rise to a reduced activity of SOD. Since phosphorylation and nitration of SOD have been shown to have a possible reversible process, these modifications may be related to a redox signaling process in cells. Finally we briefly introduce a metal insertion system of SOD, focusing particularly on the iron misincorporation of nSOD, as a part of post-translational modifications.",

     "abstract": "Recent QM/MM analyses of proton transfer function of human carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) are briefly reviewed. The topics include a preliminary analysis of nuclear quadrupole coupling constant calculations for the zinc ion and more detailed analyses of microscopic pKa of the zinc-bound water and free energy profile for the proton transfer. From a methodological perspective, our results emphasize that performing sufficient sampling is essential to the calculation of all these quantities, which reflects the well solvated nature of CAII active site. From a mechanistic perspective, our analyses highlight the importance of electrostatics in shaping the energetics and kinetics of proton transfer in CAII for its function. We argue that once the pKa for the zinc-bound water is modulated to be in the proper range (~\u00a07.0), proton transfer through a relatively well solvated cavity towards/from the protein surface (His64) does not require any major acceleration. Therefore, although structural details like the length of the water wire between the donor and acceptor groups still may make a non-negligible contribution, our computational results and the framework of analysis suggest that the significance of such \u201cfine-tuning\u201d is likely secondary to the modulation of pKa of the zinc-bound water. We encourage further experimental analysis with mutation of (charged) residues not in the immediate neighborhood of the zinc ion to quantitatively test this electrostatics based framework; in particular, \u03a6 analysis based on these mutations may shed further light into the relative importance of the classical Grotthus mechanism and the \u201cproton hole\u201d pathway that we have proposed recently for CAII.",

It is known that these fluctuations may extend over several decades of time ranging from a few femtoseconds to a few milliseconds.

The archetype (Cam) from the Archaea domain is a homotrimer of which the crystal structure reveals monomers with a distinctive left-handed parallel \u03b2-helix fold. Histidines from adjacent monomers ligate the three active site metals surrounded by residues in a hydrogen bond network essential for activity. Cam is most active with iron, the physiologically relevant metal. Although the active site residues bear little resemblance to the other classes, kinetic analyses indicate a two-step mechanism analogous to all carbonic anhydrases investigated. Phylogenetic analyses of Cam homologs derived from the databases show that Cam is representative of a minor subclass with the great majority belonging to a subclass (CamH) with significant differences in active site residues and apparent mechanism from Cam. A physiological function for any of the Cam and CamH homologs is unknown, although roles in transport of carbon dioxide and bicarbonate across membranes has been proposed.",

The final step of this process takes place in polyhedral protein microcompartments known as carboxysomes, which contain the majority of the CO2-fixing enzyme, RubisCO. The efficiency of CO2 fixation by the sequestered RubisCO is enhanced by co-localization with a specialized carbonic anhydrase that catalyzes dehydration of the cytoplasmic bicarbonate and ensures saturation of RubisCO with its substrate, CO2. There are two genetically distinct carboxysome types that differ in their protein composition and in the carbonic anhydrase(s) they employ.

     "abstract": "Isoform IX of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1), CA IX, is a transmembrane protein involved in solid tumor acidification through the HIF-1\u03b1 activation cascade. CA IX has a very high catalytic activity for the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons, even at acidic pH values (of around 6.5), typical of solid, hypoxic tumors, which are largely unresponsive to classical chemo- and radiotherapy. Thus, CA IX is used as a marker of tumor hypoxia and as a prognostic factor for many human cancers. CA IX is involved in tumorigenesis through many pathways, such as pH regulation and cell adhesion control. The X-ray structure of the catalytic domain of CA IX has been recently reported, being shown that CA IX has a typical \u03b1-CA fold. However, the CA IX structure differs significantly from the other CA isozymes when the protein quaternary structure is considered. Thus, two catalytic domains of CA IX associate to form a dimer, which is stabilized by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. The active site clefts and the proteoglycan (PG) domains are located on one face of the dimer, while the C-termini are located on the opposite face to facilitate protein anchoring to the cell membrane. As all mammalian CAs, CA IX is inhibited by several main classes of inhibitors, such as the inorganic anions, the sulfonamides and their bioisosteres (sulfamates, sulfamides, etc.), the phenols, and the coumarins. The mechanism of inhibition with all these classes of compounds is understood at the molecular level, but the sulfonamides and their congeners have important applications. It has been recently shown that both in vitro, in cell cultures, as well as in animals with transplanted tumors, CA IX inhibition with sulfonamides lead to a return of the extracellular pH to more normal values, which leads to a delay in tumor growth. As a consequence, CA IX represents a promising antitumor target for the development of anticancer agents with an alternative mechanism of action.",

     "abstract": "The soluble enzyme carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) plays an important role in CO2 influx and efflux by red blood cells (RBCs), a process initiated by changes in the extracellular [CO2] (CO2-initiated CO2 transport). Evidence suggests that CAII may be part of a macromolecular complex at the inner surface of the RBC membrane. Some have suggested CAII specifically binds to a motif on the cytoplasmic C terminus (Ct) of the Cl\u2013HCO3 exchanger AE1 and some other members of the SLC4 family of HCO3\u2212 transporters, a transport metabolon. Moreover, others have suggested that this bound CAII enhances the transport of HCO3\u2212-related species\u2014HCO3\u2212, CO3, or CO3 ion pairs\u2014when the process is initiated by altering the activity of the transporter (HCO3\u2212-initiated HCO3\u2212 transport). In this review, I assess the theoretical roles of CAs in the transport of CO2 and HCO3\u2212-related species, concluding that although the effect of bound CAII on CO2-initiated CO2 transport is expected to be substantial, the effect of bound CAs on HCO3\u2212-initiated HCO3\u2212 transport is expected to be modest at best. I also assess the experimental evidence for CAII binding to AE1 and other transporters, and the effects of this binding on HCO3\u2212-initiated HCO3\u2212 transport. The early conclusion that CAII binds to the Ct of AE1 appears to be the result of unpredictable effects of GST in the GST fusion proteins used in the studies. The early conclusion that bound CAII speeds HCO3\u2212-initiated HCO3\u2212 transport appears to be the result of CAII accelerating the pH changes used as a read-out of transport. Thus, it appears that CAII does not bind directly to AE1 or other SLC4 proteins, and that bound CAII does not substantially accelerate HCO3\u2212-initiated HCO3\u2212 transport.",

For example, hydrophobic residues at these positions favor an inward orientation of His64 and a low pKa for its imidazole side chain. It appears that the predominant manner in which this fine tuning is achieved in rate constants for proton transfer is through the difference in pKa between His64 and the zinc-bound solvent molecule. Other properties of the active-site cavity, such as inward and outward conformers of His64, appear associated with the change in \u0394pKa; however, there is no strong evidence to date that the inward and outward orientations of His64 are in themselves requirements for facile proton transfer in carbonic anhydrase.",

     "abstract": "The protein dynamical transition and its connection with the liquid-glass transition (GT) of hydration water and aqueous solvents are reviewed. The protein solvation shell exhibits a regular glass transition, characterized by steps in the specific heat and the thermal expansion coefficient at the calorimetric glass temperature TG\u00a0\u2248\u00a0170\u00a0K. It implies that the time scale of the structural \u03b1-relaxation has reached the experimental time window of 1\u2013100\u00a0s. The protein dynamical transition, identified from elastic neutron scattering experiments by enhanced amplitudes of molecular motions exceeding the vibrational level [1], probes the \u03b1-process on a shorter time scale. The corresponding liquid-glass transition occurs at higher temperatures, typically 240\u00a0K. The GT is generally associated with diverging viscosities, the freezing of long-range translational diffusion in the supercooled liquid. Due to mutual hydrogen bonding, both, protein- and solvent relaxational degrees of freedom slow down in paralled near the GT. However, the freezing of protein motions, where surface-coupled rotational and librational degrees of freedom are arrested, is better characterized as a rubber-glass transition. In contrast, internal protein modes such as the rotation of side chains are not affected. Moreover, ligand binding experiments with myoglobin in various glass-forming solvents show, that only ligand entry and exit rates depend on the local viscosity near the protein surface, but protein-internal ligand migration is not coupled to the solvent. The GT leads to structural arrest on a macroscopic scale due to the microscopic cage effect on the scale of the intermolecular distance. Mode coupling theory provides a theoretical framework to understand the microcopic nature of the GT even in complex systems. The role of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-process in the dynamics of protein hydration water is evaluated. The protein-solvent GT is triggered by hydrogen bond fluctuations, which give rise to fast \u03b2-processes. High-frequency neutron scattering spectra indicate increasing hydrogen bond braking above TG.",

For all samples, the DSC measurements display a glass transition that extends over a large temperature range. Both the temperature of the transition and its broadness decrease rapidly with increasing amount of solvent in the system. The dielectric measurements show several dynamical processes, due to both protein and solvent relaxations, and in the case of pure water as solvent the main protein process (which most likely is due to conformational changes of the protein structure) exhibits a dynamic glass transition (i.e. reaches a relaxation time of 100\u00a0s) at about the same temperature as the calorimetric glass transition temperature Tg is found. This glass transition is most likely caused by the dynamic crossover and the associated vanishing of the \u03b1-relaxation of the main water relaxation, although it does not contribute to the calorimetric Tg. This is in contrast to myoglobin in water\u2013glycerol, where the main solvent relaxation makes the strongest contribution to the calorimetric glass transition. For all samples it is clear that several proteins processes are involved in the calorimetric glass transition and the broadness of the transition depends on how much these different relaxations are separated in time.",

Incoherent elastic neutron scattering experiments were carried out at various temperature between 10\u00a0K and 300\u00a0K on IN10 and IN13 installed at ILL.

Quasi-elastic neutron spectroscopy of a large globular soy-protein, glycinin, reveals that a similar moisture-content dependence exists for the microscopic dynamics as well. We find evidence of a transition analogous to those found in smaller proteins, when investigated as a function of temperature, at the so-called dynamical transition. In contrast, the glass transition seems to be unrelated. Small proteins are good model systems for the much larger proteins because the relaxation characteristics are rather similar despite the change in scale. For dry samples, which do not show the dynamical transition, the dynamics of the methyl group is probably the most important contribution to the QENS spectra, however a simple rotational model is not able to explain the data. Our results indicate that the dynamics that occurs above the transition temperature is unrelated to that at lower temperatures and that the transition is not simply related to the relaxation rate falling within the spectral window of the spectrometer.",

The results show that the dynamical behaviors of the hydration waters are similar for these proteins when using comparable hydration levels of h\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u20130.43. Since water dynamics is characterized by strongly nonexponential correlation functions, we use a Cole\u2013Cole spectral density for spin-lattice relaxation analysis, leading to correlation times, which are in nice agreement with results for the main dielectric relaxation process observed for various proteins in the literature. The temperature dependence can roughly be described by an Arrhenius law, with the possibility of a weak crossover in the vicinity of 220\u00a0K. Near ambient temperatures, the results substantially depend on the exact shape of the spectral density so that deviations from an Arrhenius behavior cannot be excluded in the high-temperature regime. However, for the studied proteins, the data give no evidence for the existence of a sharp fragile-to-strong transition reported for lysozyme at about 220\u00a0K. Line-shape analysis reveals that the mechanism for the rotational motion of hydration waters changes in the vicinity of 220\u00a0K. For myoglobin, we observe an isotropic motion at high temperatures and an anisotropic large-amplitude motion at low temperatures. Both mechanisms coexist in the vicinity of 220\u00a0K. 13C CP MAS spectra show that hydration results in enhanced elastin dynamics at ambient temperatures, where the enhancement varies among different amino acids. Upon cooling, the enhanced mobility decreases. Comparison of 2H and 13C NMR data reveals that the observed protein dynamics is slower than the water dynamics.",

     "abstract": "In the present paper a procedure for the biomolecular motion characterization based on the evaluation of the Mean Square Displacement (MSD), through the Self Distribution Function (SDF), is presented. In particular it will be shown how the MSD, which represents a good observable for the characterization of the dynamical properties in disordered systems, can be decomposed into partial contributions associated to the system dynamical processes within a specific spatial scale. It will be shown how the SDF procedure allows to evaluate both the total MSD and the partial MSDs through the total SFD and the partial SDFs. As a result, the total MSD is the weighed sum of the partial MSD contributions in which the weights are obtained by the fitting procedure of measured EINS intensity data. We apply the SDF procedure at EINS data collected, by the IN13 backscattering spectrometer at the Institute Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, on aqueous mixtures of two homologous disaccharides (sucrose and trehalose) and on dry myoglobin in trehalose environment. It emerges that the hydrogen bond imposed network of the water\u2013trehalose mixture appears to be stronger with respect to that of the water\u2013sucrose mixture and this result can justify the highest bioprotectant effectiveness of trehalose in comparison with sucrose. Furthermore it emerges that, the partial MSD behaviours of sucrose and trehalose are equivalent in the low Q domain (0\u20131.7) \u00c5\u2212\u00a01 whereas they are different in the high Q domain (1.7\u20134) \u00c5-\u00a01.

     "abstract": "The internal molecular dynamics of proteins plays an important role in a number of functional processes in native photosystems. Prominent examples include the photocycle of bacteriorhodopsin and electron transfer in the reaction center of plant photosystem II. In this regard, the recently developed technique of time-resolved quasielastic neutron scattering with laser excitation opens up new perspectives for the study of protein/membrane dynamics in specific functional states of even complex systems. The first direct observation of a functionally modulated protein dynamics has just recently been reported for the model system bacteriorhodopsin (Pieper et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 2008, 228103.), where a transient softening of the protein was observed on a timescale of \u223c\u00a01\u00a0ms along with the large-scale structural change in the M-intermediate of bacteriorhodopsin. In contrast, photosystem II membrane fragments with inhibited electron transfer show a suppression of protein dynamics \u223c160\u00a0\u03bcs after the actinic laser flash (Pieper and Renger, Biochemistry 48, 2009, 6111). This effect may reflect aggregation-like conformational changes capable of dissipation of excess excitation energy to prevent photodamage in the absence of QA\u2192QB electron transfer. These findings indicate that proteins exhibit a remarkable flexibility to accommodate different functional processes. This contribution will discuss methodical aspects, challenges, and recent applications of laser-excited, time-resolved quasielastic neutron scattering.",

     "abstract": "This review describes our current understanding of the \u201ctraffic lights\u201d that regulate sulfur flow through the methionine bionetwork in liver, which supplies two major homeostatic systems governing cellular methylation and antioxidant potential. Theoretical concepts derived from mathematical modeling of this metabolic nexus provide insights into the properties of this system, some of which seem to be paradoxical at first glance. Cellular needs supported by this network are met by use of parallel metabolic tracks that are differentially controlled by intermediates in the pathway. A major task, i.e. providing cellular methylases with the methylating substrate, S-adenosylmethionine, is met by flux through the methionine adenosyltransferase I isoform. On the other hand, a second important function, i.e., stabilization of the blood methionine concentration in the face of high dietary intake of this amino acid, is achieved by switching to an alternative isoform, methionine adenosyltransferase III, and to glycine N-methyl transferase, which together bypass the first two reactions in the methionine cycle. This regulatory strategy leads to two metabolic modes that differ in metabolite concentrations and metabolic rates almost by an order of magnitude. Switching between these modes occurs in a narrow trigger zone of methionine concentration. Complementary experimental and theoretical analyses of hepatic methionine metabolism have been richly informative and have the potential to illuminate its response to oxidative challenge, to methionine restriction and lifespan extension studies and to diseases resulting from deficiencies at specific loci in this pathway.",

Mutation of the conserved cysteine at position 54 in SsuD to either serine or alanine had little effect on FMNH2 binding. The kcat/Km value for the C54S SsuD variant increased 3-fold, whereas the kcat/Km value for C54A SsuD decreased 6-fold relative to wild-type SsuD. An initial fast phase was observed in kinetic traces obtained for the oxidation of flavin at 370\u00a0nm when FMNH2 was mixed against C54S SsuD (kobs, 111 s\u2212\u00a01) in oxygenated buffer that was 10-fold faster than wild-type SsuD (kobs, 12.9 s\u2212\u00a01). However, there was no initial fast phase observed in similar kinetic traces obtained for C54A SsuD. This initial fast phase was previously assigned to the formation of the C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin in studies with wild-type SsuD. There was no evidence for the formation of the C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin with either SsuD variant when octanesulfonate was included in rapid reaction kinetic studies, even at low octanesulfonate concentrations. The absence of any C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin accumulation correlates with the increased catalytic activity of C54S SsuD. These results suggest that the conservative serine substitution is able to effectively take the place of cysteine in catalysis. Conversely, decreased accumulation of the C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate with the C54A SsuD variant may be due to decreased activity. The data described suggest that Cys54 in SsuD may be either directly or indirectly involved in stabilizing the C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin intermediate formed during catalysis through hydrogen bonding interactions.",

The light-responsive surfactant undergoes a photoisomerization from the relatively hydrophobic trans isomer under visible light to the relatively hydrophilic cis isomer upon UV illumination, providing a means to photoreversibly control enzyme\u2013surfactant interactions. Small-angle neutron scattering and dynamic light scattering measurements, along with fluorescence spectroscopy, indicate that carbonic anhydrase unfolds upon addition of the surfactant under visible light, while only a small degree of unfolding is observed under UV light. Therefore, the enzyme is completely inactivated in the presence of the trans surfactant, while 40% of the native activity is preserved under UV light, providing a photoreversible \u201con/off switch\u201d of enzyme activity. Small-angle neutron scattering data provide details of the in vitro conformational changes of the enzyme in response to the photosurfactant and light, with the enzyme found to aggregate as a result of photosurfactant-induced unfolding.

The ACBP of Moniliophthora perniciosa is composed of 104 amino acids and is possibly a non-classic isoform exclusively from Basidiomycetes. The M. perniciosa acbp gene was cloned, and the protein was expressed and purified. Acyl-CoA ester binding was analyzed by isoelectric focusing, native gel electrophoresis and isothermal titration calorimetry. Our results suggest an increasing affinity of ACBP for longer acyl-CoA esters, such as myristoyl-CoA to arachidoyl-CoA, and best fit modeling indicates two binding sites. ACBP undergoes a shift from a monomeric to a dimeric state, as shown by dynamic light scattering, fluorescence anisotropy and native gel electrophoresis in the absence and presence of the ligand. The protein's structure was determined at 1.6\u00a0\u00c5 resolution and revealed a new topology for ACBP, containing five \u03b1-helices instead of four. \u03b1-helices 1, 2, 3 and 4 adopted a bundled arrangement that is unique from the previously determined four-helix folds of ACBP, while \u03b1-helices 1, 2, 4 and 5 formed a classical four-helix bundle.

In this study, a destructive CWP purification procedure was adopted using wheat seedling roots and the purity of the CWP extract was confirmed by minimizing the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytoplasmic marker enzyme. To determine differentially expressed CWPs under flooding stress, gel-based proteomic and LC-MS/MS-based proteomic techniques were applied. Eighteen proteins were found to be significantly regulated in response to flood by gel-based proteomics and 15 proteins by LC MS/MS-based proteomics. Among the flooding down-regulated proteins, most were related to the glycolysis pathway and cell wall structure and modification. However, the most highly up-regulated proteins in response to flooding belong to the category of defense and disease response proteins. Among these differentially expressed proteins, only methionine synthase, \u03b2-1,3-glucanases, and \u03b2-glucosidase were consistently identified by both techniques. The down-regulation of these three proteins suggested that wheat seedlings respond to flooding stress by restricting cell growth to avoid energy consumption; by coordinating methionine assimilation and cell wall hydrolysis, CWPs played critical roles in flooding responsiveness.",

     "abstract": "We report on the response of reaction center (RC) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides (an archetype of membrane proteins) to the exposure at high temperature. The RCs have been solubilized in aqueous solution of the detergent N,N-dimethyldodecylamine-N-oxide (LDAO). Changes in the protein conformation have been probed by monitoring the variation in the absorbance of the bacteriochlorine cofactors and modification in the efficiency of energy transfer from tryptophans to cofactors and among the cofactors (through fluorescence measurements). The RC aggregation taking place at high temperature has been investigated by means of dynamic light scattering. Two experimental protocols have been used: (i) isothermal kinetics, in which the time evolution of RC after a sudden increase of the temperature is probed, and (ii) T-scans, in which the RCs are heated at constant rate. The analysis of the results coming from both the experiments indicates that the minimal kinetic scheme requires an equilibrium step and an irreversible process. The irreversible step is characterized by a activation energy of 205\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0kJ/mol and is independent from the detergent concentration. Since the temperature dependence of the aggregation rate was found to obey to the same law, the aggregation process is unfolding-limited. On the other hand, the equilibrium process between the native and a partially unfolded conformations was found to be strongly dependent on the detergent concentration. Increasing the LDAO content from 0.025\u00a0to 0.5\u00a0wt.% decreases the melting temperature from 49\u00a0to 42\u00a0\u00b0C. This corresponds to a sizeable (22\u00a0kJ/mol at 25\u00a0\u00b0C) destabilization of the native conformation induced by the detergent. The nature of the aggregates formed by the denatured RCs depends on the temperature. For temperature below 60\u00a0\u00b0C compact aggregates are formed while at 60\u00a0\u00b0C the clusters are less dense with a scaling relation between mass and size close to that expected for diffusion-limited aggregation. The aggregate final sizes formed at different temperatures indicate the presence of an even number of proteins suggesting that these clusters are formed by aggregation of dimers.",

Here we chose to locate the thermostability determinants distinguishing the thermophilic domain 1 from a mesophilic domain 1. By an approach of systematically swapping protein regions differing between G-domains from mesophilic Bacillus subtilis and thermophilic B. stearothermophilus, we demonstrate that a small portion of the protein, the N-terminal 12 amino acid residues, plays a key role in the thermostability of this domain. We suggest that the thermostabilizing effect of the N-terminal region could be mediated by stabilizing the functionally important effector region. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of the N-terminal region is significant also for the thermostability of the full-length EF-Tu.",

The present study aimed to determine the underlying reasons for the site requirement using Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing recombinant variants of rat matriptase. A full-length variant with glutamine substitution at Asn772 appeared to be unable to undergo activation because of its catalytic incompetence (i.e., decreased availability of the soluble catalytic domain and/or of the correctly folded domain). This was evidenced by the observations that (i) a recombinant catalytic domain of matriptase with glutamine substitution at the site corresponding to matriptase Asn772 [N772Q-CD-Myc(His)6] was not detected in the medium conditioned by transfected cells but was on the cell surface and (ii) purified N772Q-CD-Myc(His)6 exhibited markedly reduced activity toward a peptide substrate.

Common mechanisms and structural properties of amyloids are thought to be involved in aggregation-related cytotoxicity. In this context we propose an experimental study on Concanavalin A (Con A) aggregation and use it as a model to study the relationship between cell toxicity and aggregation processes. Depending on solution conditions, Con A aggregation has been monitored by static and dynamic light scattering, Thioflavin T emission, and FTIR absorption. The morphology of different aggregate species was verified by means of Atomic Force Microscopy and Confocal Microscopy. During the aggregation pathway the native protein conformation is destabilized and as a consequence, the simultaneous occurrence of conformational changes and protein aggregation is observed in both conditions. The effects of the extracellular addition of native protein, oligomers and mature fibrils were tested on LAN5 neuroblastoma cells by MTS assay. Results showed the toxicity of the first two species while a negligible effect was detected for amyloid fibrils. Both native and oligomeric aggregates were found to be able to activate apoptosis exclusively by extrinsic pathway through caspase 8 activation. Those results suggest that cytotoxicity mechanisms arise from specific membrane interactions with reactive conformations of destabilized molecules occurring during the amyloidal aggregation pathway. Those conformations, populated when native or preformed oligomers are incubated, are unavailable to bind cell membrane proteins. This happens because they are recruited in the mature fibrillar structure which\u2013as a consequence\u2013turns out to be non-toxic.",

RhAmidase belongs to amidase signature (AS) family, a group of amidase families, and is responsible for the degradation of amides produced from nitriles by nitrile hydratase. Recombinant RhAmidase exists as a dimer of about 107\u00a0kDa. RhAmidase can hydrolyze acetamide, propionamide, acrylamide and benzamide with kcat/Km values of 1.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01, 4.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01, 0.087\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01 and 153.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1\u00a0mM\u2212\u00a01s\u2212\u00a01, respectively.

RhAmidase has three domains: an N-terminal \u03b1-helical domain, a small domain and a large domain. The N-terminal \u03b1-helical domain is not found in other AS family enzymes. This domain is involved in the formation of the dimer structure and, together with the small domain, forms a narrow substrate-binding tunnel. The large domain showed high structural similarities to those of other AS family enzymes. The Ser-cis Ser-Lys catalytic triad is located in the large domain. But the substrate-binding pocket of RhAmidase is relatively narrow, due to the presence of the helix \u03b113 in the small domain. The hydrophobic residues from the small domain are involved in recognizing the substrate. The small domain likely participates in substrate recognition and is related to the difference of substrate specificities among the AS family amidases.",

     "abstract": "Using peptides based on the amino acid sequences surrounding the two histidine residues in histone H4, we have investigated the kinetics of the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions of their histidine residues, when reacted with potassium phosphoramidate, by 1H NMR. We have been able to estimate rate constants for the reactions and have shown that there are differences in the kinetics between the two peptides. The kinetics of hydrolysis of phosphoramidate was measured by 31P NMR and protein histidine phosphatase (PHP) was shown to catalyse the reaction. We have shown that the dephosphorylation of the phosphohistidine of the phosphopeptides is catalysed by PHP. In terms of substrate specificity, there is a small preference for 1-phosphohistidine compared to 3-phosphohistidine, although the rate accelerations for hydrolysis induced by the enzyme were 1100- and 33,333-fold, respectively. The kinetics of both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions depend on the amino acid sequence surrounding the histidine. PHP shows greater substrate specificity for the peptide whose sequence is similar to that around histidine 18 of histone H4. PHP was unable to catalyse the dephosphorylation of histone H4 that had been phosphorylated with a histone H4 histidine kinase.",

     "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that reversible phosphorylation of histidine residues regulates numerous important cellular processes. The first protein histidine phosphatase (PHP) from vertebrates was discovered just recently. Here, we report on amino acids and domains essential for activity of PHP. Point mutations of conserved residues and deletions of the N- and C-termini of PHP were analyzed using [32P-his]ATP-citrate lyase as a substrate. Individual or joint replacement of all cysteine residues by alanine did not affect PHP activity. Deletion of 9 N-terminal amino acids resulted in inactive PHP. Furthermore, only 4 C-terminal residues could be deleted without losing PHP activity. Single or multiple mutations of the glycine-rich domain (Gly75, Gly77) of a putative nucleotide binding site of PHP (GxGxxG/S) caused inactivation of PHP. Wildtype PHP could be labeled with [\u03b1-32P]ATP. Such radiolabeling was not detectable for catalytically inactive PHP-G75A and PHP-G77A. These data suggest further studies on the interaction between PHP and ATP.",

     "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus encodes an autoprotease, NS2-3, which is required for processing of the viral polyprotein between the non-structural NS2 and NS3 proteins. This protease activity is vital for the replication and assembly of the virus and therefore represents a target for the development of anti-viral drugs. The mechanism of this auto-processing reaction is not yet clear but the protease activity has been shown to map to the C-terminal region of NS2 and the N-terminal serine protease region of NS3. The NS2-3 precursor can be expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, purified as denatured protein and refolded, in the presence of detergents and the divalent metal ion zinc, into an active form capable of auto-cleavage. Here, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence has been used to assess refolding in the wild-type protein and specific active site mutants. We also investigate the effects on protein folding of alterations to the reaction conditions that have been shown to prevent auto-cleavage. Our data demonstrate that these active site mutations do not solely affect the cleavage activity of the HCV NS2-3 protease but significantly affect the integrity of the global protein fold.",

     "abstract": "Conversion of peptides and proteins from their native states into amyloid fibrillar aggregates is the hallmark of a number of pathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and amyloidosis. Evidence is accumulating that soluble oligomers, as opposed to mature fibrils, mediate cellular dysfunction, ultimately leading to disease onset. In this study, we have explored the ability of alkaline pH solutions, which have remained relatively unexplored so far, to form a partially folded state of the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli protein HypF (HypF-N), which subsequently assembles to form stable soluble oligomers. Results showed that HypF-N unfolds at high pH via a two-state process. Characterization of the resulting alkaline-unfolded state by near- and far-UV circular dichroism, intrinsic and ANS-derived fluorescence and DLS indicated characteristics of a monomeric, premolten globule state. Interestingly, alkaline-unfolded HypF-N aggregates, at high concentration in the presence of low concentrations of TFE, into stable oligomers. These are able to bind amyloid-specific dyes, such as Congo red, ThT, and ANS, contain extensive \u03b2-sheet structure, as detected with far-UV circular dichroism, and have a height of 2.0\u20133.9\u00a0nm when analysed using atomic force microscopy. This study, which complements our previous one in which morphologically, structurally, and tinctorially similar oligomers were formed at low and nearly neutral pH values by the same protein, offers opportunities to explore the fine differences existing in the mechanism of formation of these species under different conditions, in their precise molecular structure and in their ability to cause cellular dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "3\u03b1-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase reversely catalyzes the oxidation of androsterone with NAD+ to form androstanedione and NADH. In this study, we investigated the function of active site residues N86, Y155, and K159 in NADH binding and catalysis in the reduction of androstanedione, using site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetics, fluorescence quenching, and anisotropy measurements. The N86A, Y155F, and K159A mutant enzymes decreased the catalytic constant by 37- to 220-fold and increased the dissociation constant by 3- to 75-fold, respectively. Binding of NADH with wild-type and mutant enzymes caused different levels of fluorescence resonance energy transfer, implying a different orientation of nicotinamide ring versus W173. In addition, the enzyme-bound NADH decreased the fluorescence anisotropy value in the order WT\u00a0>\u00a0N86A\u00a0>\u00a0Y155F\u00a0>\u00a0K159A, indicating an increase in the mobility of the bound NADH for the mutants. Data suggest that hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl group of nicotinamide ribose by K159 and Y155 is important to maintain the orientation of NADH and contributes greatly to the transition-state binding energy to facilitate the catalysis. N86 is important for stabilizing the position of K159. Substitution of alanine for N86 has a minor effect on NADH binding through K159, resulting in a slight increase in the mobility of the bound NADH and decreases in affinity and catalytic constant.",
