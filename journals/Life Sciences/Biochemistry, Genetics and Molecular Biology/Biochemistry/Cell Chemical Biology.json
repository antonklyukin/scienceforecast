Using CHIP-RIP, we demonstrate that GAS5 binds to promoter of insulin receptor to regulate its expression, and its depletion inhibits glucose uptake and insulin signaling. Toward stabilizing GAS5 levels in T2DM, we incorporated a strategy to limit the degradation of GAS5 by blocking the interaction of GAS5 and UPF1 with a small molecule identified using OBTC screening strategy. NP-C86 binds to GAS5 with high affinity, and increases GAS5 levels\u00a0and glucose uptake in diabetic patient adipocytes.

To explore the vast chemical space, a robust method that recapitulates the complex cancer-immune microenvironment in a high-throughput format is essential. To address this critical gap, we developed a high-throughput immunomodulator phenotypic screening platform, HTiP, which integrates the immune and cancer cell co-culture system with imaging- and biochemical-based multiplexed readouts. Using the HTiP platform, we have demonstrated its capability in modeling an oncogenic KRAS mutation-driven immunosuppressive phenotype.

Alternative therapeutics against GBM are urgently needed in the clinic. We report herein the discovery of a class of inhibitors (YZ129 and its derivatives) of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway that exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against GBM. YZ129-induced GBM cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. At the molecular level, YZ129 directly engaged HSP90 to antagonize its chaperoning effect on calcineurin to abrogate NFAT\u00a0nuclear translocation, and also suppressed other proto-oncogenic pathways including hypoxia, glycolysis, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. Our data highlight the potential for targeting the cancer-promoting HSP90 chaperone network to treat GBM.",

FB-targeted inhibition of Prx1 and Grx3 results in a decrease in cellular glutathione levels, an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and concomitant inhibition of cancer cell growth, largely by activating the peroxisome-bound tuberous sclerosis complex to inhibit mTORC1/4E-BP1 signaling axis.

Here, we report small-molecule TEAD\u22c5Yap inhibitors that rapidly and selectively form a covalent bond with a conserved cysteine located within the unique deep hydrophobic palmitate-binding pocket of TEADs. Inhibition of TEAD4 binding to Yap1 by these compounds was irreversible and occurred on a longer time scale. In mammalian cells, the compounds formed a covalent complex with TEAD4, inhibited its binding to Yap1, blocked its transcriptional activity, and suppressed expression of connective tissue growth factor. The compounds inhibited cell viability of patient-derived glioblastoma spheroids, making them suitable as chemical probes to explore Hippo signaling in cancer.",

Through clustering analysis of a large kinome profiling dataset, we found a cluster of eight promiscuous kinases that on average bind more than\u00a0five times more kinase inhibitors than the other 398 kinases in the dataset. To understand the structural basis of promiscuous inhibitor binding, we determined the co-crystal structure of the receptor tyrosine kinase DDR1 with the type I inhibitors dasatinib and VX-680. Surprisingly, we find that DDR1 binds these type I inhibitors in an inactive conformation typically reserved for type II inhibitors. Our computational and biochemical studies show that DDR1 is unusually stable in this inactive conformation, giving a mechanistic explanation for inhibitor promiscuity. This phenotypic clustering analysis provides a strategy to obtain functional insights not available by sequence comparison alone.",

To delineate TrkA subcircuits in PC12 cell differentiation, we developed an optogenetic system whereby light was used to specifically activate TrkA signaling in the absence of nerve growth factor. By using tyrosine mutants of the optogenetic TrkA in combination with pathway-specific pharmacological\u00a0inhibition, we find that Y490 and Y785 each contributes to PC12 cell differentiation through the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway in an additive manner. Optogenetic activation of TrkA eliminates the confounding effect of p75NTR and other potential off-target effects of\u00a0the ligand.

Among Plasmodium's protein kinases, those characterized as atypical represent attractive drug targets as they lack sequence similarity to human proteins.

PfPK9 phosphorylates the Plasmodium E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme PfUBC13, which mediates K63-linkage-specific polyubiquitination. Takinib is a potent human TAK1 inhibitor, thus we developed the Plasmodium-selective takinib analog HS220. We demonstrate that takinib and HS220 decrease K63-linked ubiquitination in P.\u00a0falciparum, suggesting PfPK9 inhibition in cells. Takinib and HS220 induce a unique phenotype where parasite size in hepatocytes increases, yet high compound concentrations decrease the number of parasites.

     "abstract": "The initiation and execution of cell death can be regulated by various lipids. How the levels of environmental (exogenous) lipids impact cell death sensitivity is not well understood. We find that exogenous monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) potently inhibit the non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, oxidative cell death process of ferroptosis. This protective effect is associated with the suppression of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation at the plasma membrane and decreased levels of phospholipids containing oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids. Treatment with exogenous MUFAs reduces the sensitivity of plasma membrane lipids to oxidation over several hours. This effect requires MUFA activation by acyl-coenzyme A synthetase long-chain family member 3 (ACSL3) and is independent of lipid droplet formation. Exogenous MUFAs also protect cells from apoptotic lipotoxicity caused by the accumulation of saturated fatty acids, but in an\u00a0ACSL3-independent manner. Our work demonstrates that ACSL3-dependent MUFA activation promotes a ferroptosis-resistant cell state.",

While maintenance of mitochondrial thiol redox state is thought vital for cell survival, this was not testable due to the difficulty of manipulating the organelle's thiol systems independently of those in other cell compartments. To overcome this constraint we modified the glutathione S-transferase substrate and Trx reductase (TrxR) inhibitor, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) by conjugation to the mitochondria-targeting triphenylphosphonium cation. The result, MitoCDNB, is taken up by mitochondria where it selectively depletes the mitochondrial GSH pool, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases, and directly inhibits mitochondrial TrxR2 and peroxiredoxin 3, a peroxidase. Importantly, MitoCDNB inactivates mitochondrial thiol redox homeostasis in isolated cells and in\u00a0vivo, without affecting that of the cytosol.

Indeed, the hybrid compound preferentially accumulated within rodent and human islets in a zinc-dependent manner and increased the selectivity of replication-promoting activity toward \u03b2 cells. These data resolve the fundamental question of whether intracellular accumulation of zinc-chelating compounds is influenced by zinc content. Furthermore, application of this principle yielded a proof-of-concept method for \u03b2-cell-targeted drug delivery and bioactivity.",

Our screening identified sodium phenylbutyrate, currently in clinical trials, and BET Bromodomain inhibitors as modifiers of poly(PR) toxicity in cell lines and developing zebrafish embryos.

Here, we explore the possibility of inactivating the C.\u00a0difficile toxin B (TcdB) by triggering its auto-proteolysis in the gut lumen prior to cell uptake using gain-of-function small molecules. We anticipated that high calcium concentrations typically found in the gut would strongly chelate IP6, precluding it from pre-emptively inducing toxin auto-proteolysis if administered exogenously. We therefore designed IP6 analogs with reduced susceptibility to complexation by calcium, which maintained allosteric activity at physiological calcium concentrations.

We have used biophysical measurements and X-ray crystallography to investigate the ATP-competitive inhibitor binding properties of cyclin-free and cyclin-bound CDK1 and CDK2. We show that these kinases can readily be distinguished by such inhibitors when cyclin-free, but not when cyclin-bound.

Here we use this information to reprogram the cellular response to high salt by introducing point mutations in the Kozak sequence of key regulators for the cell wall MAP-kinase, filamentation, or DNA repair pathways. This stimulates their translation upon genetic, or salt-induced Rps26 depletion from ribosomes. Stress resistance assays show activation of the targeted pathways in an Rps26- and salt-dependent manner. Genomic alterations in diverse yeast populations indicate that analogous tuning occurs during adaptation to ecological niches. Thus, evolution shapes translational control across the genome by taking advantage of the accumulation of diverse ribosome populations.",

A proof-of-principle study on human cancer cells demonstrates that deep labeling can identify hundreds of endogenous metabolites as well as active and inactive pathways. For example, protein and nucleic acids were almost exclusively de novo synthesized, while lipids were partly derived from serum; synthesis of cysteine, carnitine, and creatine was absent, suggesting metabolic dependencies; and branched-chain keto acids (BCKAs) were formed and metabolized to short-chain acylcarnitines, but did not enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Additionally, Az impairs autophagy in cancer cells owing to its ability to disrupt the lysosomal function.

At low-nanomolar concentrations, these covalent peptidomimetics produce a fast, specific, and sustained inactivation of POP, both in\u00a0vitro and in human cells. More importantly, they are >1,000-fold selective against two family-related proteases (DPPIV and FAP) and display high BBB permeability, as shown in both lipid membranes and MDCK cells.",

Existing methods also have other limitations, such as cell type restrictions. Using our discovery that mCherryFP fluorescence depends on residue Trp98, we replaced this codon with a stop codon to generate a mutation biosensor (termed CherryOFF), with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) as an internal control. We found that the red fluorescence of this biosensor is activated by a specific A/T-G/C nucleotide transition. Compared with the established hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase assay, our reporter has similar or better ability to detect changes of mutation frequency induced by physical/chemical mutagens or manipulation of mutation-related genes. Furthermore, CherryOFF-GFP can report mutagenesis independently of cell-death events, can be adapted to many cell types, and can generate readouts within 1\u00a0day for the measurement of acute or time-dependent events.",

We have analyzed co-translational events experienced by secretory proteins carrying efficient versus inefficient signal sequencing, using an assay based on Xbp1 peptide-mediated translational arrest. With this method we were able to measure the functional efficiency of ER signal sequences. We show that an efficient signal sequence experiences a two-phase event whereby the nascent chain is pulled from the ribosome during its translocation, thus resuming translation and yielding full-length products.

     "abstract": "In eukaryotes, mitochondria have been hypothesized to generate sulfur species required for tRNA thiolation in the cytosol, although no direct evidence thus far exists. Here we have detected these sulfur species, making use of our observation that isolated yeast cytosol alone is unable to thiolate tRNAs but can do so upon addition of mitochondria. Mitochondria were found to utilize the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1 to produce sulfur-containing species with masses ranging from 700 to 1,100 Da. Mitochondria exported these species via the Atm1 transporter in the inner membrane. Once exported to the cytosol, these sulfur species promoted cytosolic tRNA thiolation with no further requirement of mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that the Isu1/2 scaffolds but not the Ssq1 chaperone of the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster machinery were required for cytosolic tRNA thiolation, and thus the sulfur utilization pathway bifurcates at the Isu1/2 site for intra-organellar use in mitochondria or export to the cytosol.",

Using lipid mediator profiling, human primary cells and recombinant enzymes we found that human 15-lipoxygenases initiate the PDn-3 DPA pathway catalyzing the formation of an allylic epoxide. The complete stereochemistry of this epoxide was determined using stereocontrolled total organic synthesis as 16S,17S-epoxy-7Z,10Z,12E,14E,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid (16S,17S-ePDn-3 DPA).

Comparative metabolomic analysis of wild-type and Ppa-uar-1 mutants showed that Ppa-uar-1 is required specifically for the biosynthesis of ubas#1 and related metabolites. Heterologous expression of Ppa-UAR-1 in C. elegans yielded a non-endogenous ascaroside, whose structure confirmed that Ppa-uar-1 is involved in modification of a specific position in ascarosides.

The \u03b1345(IV) trimer assay, which satisfied the acceptance criteria for HTS, enabled the\u00a0characterization of intracellular- and secretion-dependent\u00a0defects of mutant \u03b15(IV). Small interfering RNA-based and chemical screening targeting the ER identified several chemical chaperones that have potential to promote \u03b1345(IV) trimer formation. This split luciferase-based trimer formation assay is a functional HTS platform that realizes the feasibility of targeting \u03b1345(IV) trimers to treat Alport syndrome.",

A global metabolomics approach was applied to unravel metabolite and pathway modifications. The results clearly showed that the combined effects of palbociclib and letrozole on cellular metabolism were far more pronounced than that of each agent alone and potently influenced by xenoestrogens. This behavior was confirmed in proliferation experiments and functional assays. Specifically, amino acids and central carbon metabolites were attenuated, while higher abundances were observed for fatty acids and most nucleic acid-related metabolites. Interestingly, exposure to model xenoestrogens appeared to counteract these effects.",

Ideal protein targets are required for viability across many species, are unique to prokaryotes to limit effects on\u00a0the host, and have robust assays to quantitate activity and identify inhibitors. Lipoprotein signal peptidase (Lsp) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease required for lipoprotein maturation and comprehensively fits these criteria. Here, we have developed the first in\u00a0vitro high-throughput assay to monitor proteolysis by Lsp. We employed our high-throughput screen assay against 646,275 compounds to discover inhibitors of Lsp and synthesized a range of analogs to generate molecules with nanomolar half maximal inhibitory concentration values. Importantly, our inhibitors are effective in preventing the growth of E.\u00a0coli cultures in the presence of outer-membrane permeabilizer PMBN and should facilitate development of antibacterial agents with a novel mechanism of action to treat antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",

The use of VHL-recruiting PROTACs against this protein family reveals several advantages of degradation over inhibition alone: direct comparisons of fully functional, target-degrading PROTACs with target-inhibiting variants that contain an inactivated E3 ligase-recruiting ligand show that degradation leads to more potent inhibition of cell proliferation and a more durable and sustained downstream signaling response, and thus addresses the kinome rewiring challenge seen with many receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Using promiscuous CRBN- and VHL-recruiting PROTACs that bind >50 kinases, we show that only a subset of bound targets is degraded. The basis of this selectivity relies on protein-protein interactions between the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein, as illustrated by engaged proteins that are not degraded as a result of unstable ternary complexes with PROTAC-recruited E3 ligases. In contrast, weak PROTAC:target protein affinity can be stabilized by high-affinity target:PROTAC:ligase trimer interactions, leading to efficient degradation. This study highlights design guidelines for generating potent PROTACs as well as possibilities for degrading undruggable proteins immune to traditional small-molecule inhibitors.",

We found this increase was caused by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation of HDAC3, was independent of HDAC3 complex composition or subcellular localization, and was associated with a 5-fold increase in HDAC3 enzymatic activity.

Here, to find upstream FeS biosynthesis/delivery protein(s) responsible for this, we compared copper sensitivity of yeast-overexpressing candidate targets. Overexpression of the mitochondrial ferredoxin Yah1 produced copper hyper-resistance. 55Fe turnover assays revealed that FeS integrity of Yah1 was particularly vulnerable to copper among the test proteins. Furthermore, destabilization of the FeS domain of Yah1 produced copper hypersensitivity, and YAH1 overexpression rescued Rli1 dysfunction. This copper-resistance function was conserved in the human ferredoxin, Fdx2. The data indicate that the essential mitochondrial ferredoxin is an important copper target, determining a tipping point where plentiful copper supply becomes excessive.

Barriers include a scarcity of tissue and experimental models to enable basic research and insufficient patient accrual for clinical studies. Consequently, an understanding of the genetic and cellular features of many rare cancer types and their associated vulnerabilities has been lacking. However, new opportunities are emerging to facilitate discovery of therapeutic targets in rare cancers. Online platforms are allowing patients with rare cancers to organize on an unprecedented scale, tumor genome sequencing is now routinely performed in research and clinical settings, and the efficiency of patient-derived model generation has improved. New CRISPR/Cas9 and small-molecule libraries permit cancer dependency discovery in a rapid and systematic fashion. In parallel, large-scale studies of common cancers now provide reference datasets to help interpret rare cancer profiling data. Together, these advances motivate consideration of new research frameworks to accelerate rare cancer target discovery.",

Covalent drugs have resurged in recent years and several reports have extolled the general virtues of developing irreversible inhibitors. Indeed, many modern pharmaceuticals contain electrophilic appendages. Several invoke a warhead that hijacks active-site nucleophiles whereas others take advantage of spectator nucleophilic side chains that do not participate in enzymatic chemistry, but are poised to bind/react with electrophiles. The latest data suggest that innate electrophile sensing\u2014which enables rapid reaction with an endogenous signaling electrophile\u2014is a quintessential resource for the development of covalent drugs. For instance, based on recent work documenting isoform-specific electrophile sensing, isozyme non-specific drugs may be converted to isozyme-specific analogs by hijacking privileged first-responder electrophile-sensing cysteines. Because this approach targets functionally relevant cysteines, we can simultaneously harness previously untapped moonlighting roles of enzymes linked to redox sensing.",

We identified several estrone-derived compounds, including 4-hydroxyestrone, a meta-cleavage product, and pyridinestrone acid. The yeast-based estrogen assay suggested that pyridinestrone acid exhibits negligible estrogenic activity. We characterized 17\u03b2-estradiol dehydrogenase and 4-hydroxyestrone 4,5-dioxygenase, responsible for the 17-dehydrogenation and meta-cleavage of the estrogen A ring, respectively. The characteristic pyridinestrone acid was detected in estrone-spiked samples collected from two wastewater treatment plants and two suburban rivers in Taiwan.

However, studies of molecular interactions involved in this process have been hampered by the transient and hydrophobic nature of these interactions and the lack of tools to study them. Here, we develop Ub-phototrap (UbPT), a synthetic Ub variant containing a photoactivatable crosslinking side chain. Enzymatic polymerization into chains of defined lengths and linkage types provided a set of reagents that led to identification of Rpn1 as a third proteasome ubiquitin-associating subunit that coordinates docking of substrate shuttles, unloading of substrates, and anchoring of polyUb conjugates. Our work demonstrates the value of UbPT, and we expect that its future uses will help define and investigate the ubiquitin interactome.",

We developed a multifactorial zebrafish drug-screening platform combining Pink1 deficiency with an environmental toxin to compromise mitochondrial function and trigger dopaminergic neuron loss. Using a phenotypic screening strategy, we identified a series of piperazine phenothiazines, including trifluoperazine, which rescued Pink1 deficiency by activating autophagy selectively in stressed zebrafish and human cells. We show that trifluoperazine acts downstream of, or parallel to, PINK1/PARKIN to stimulate transcription factor EB nuclear translocation and the expression of autophagy-lysosomal target genes.

Structural studies show that this nonapeptide forms a compact tertiary structure, and illustrate that a general inhibitory motif involving two phenolic groups is often accessed for tight binding of inhibitors to HPA. Furthermore, the work reported here demonstrates the potential of this methodology for the discovery of de novo peptide inhibitors against other glycosidases.",

We demonstrate that eukaryotic cells can, indeed, develop resistance to the model oncolytic peptide SVS-1, which preferentially disrupts the membranes of cancer cells. Utilizing fission yeast as a model organism, we show that ACP resistance is largely controlled through the loss of cell-surface anionic saccharides.

However, the high degree of structural conservation makes isoform-selective targeting a challenging task. Here, we present picomolar inhibitors with unprecedented kinome-wide selectivity for JAK3.

Detailed view of biological structures is created by overlaying conventional electron micrographs with pseudocolor lanthanide elemental maps derived from distinctive electron energy-loss spectra of each lanthanide deposit via energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy. This results in multicolor EM images analogous to multicolor fluorescence but with the benefit of the full spatial resolution of EM. We illustrate the power of this methodology by visualizing hippocampal astrocytes to show that processes from two astrocytes can share a single synapse.

Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using D1 and deep-sequencing revealed the consensus sequence for parallel G-quadruplex formation, which is characterized by G-rich sequence with a short loop size (<3 nt). By using D1, telomeric parallel G-quadruplex was identified and its formation was regulated by small molecular ligands targeting and telomere replication.

Here, we use high-throughput methods to measure and analyze the RNA association kinetics and equilibrium binding affinity for all possible sequence combinations in the precursor tRNA binding site of C5, the essential protein subunit of Escherichia coli RNase P. The results show that the RNA sequence specificity of C5 arises due to favorable RNA-protein interactions that stabilize the transition state for association and bound enzyme-substrate complex. Specificity is further impacted by unfavorable RNA structure involving the C5 binding site in the ground state. The results illustrate a comprehensive quantitative approach for analysis of RNA binding specificity, and show how both RNA structure and sequence preferences of an essential protein subunit direct the specificity of a ribonucleoprotein enzyme.",

In these disorders, TTR aggregates in extracellular environments through a mechanism involving rate-limiting dissociation of the tetramer to monomers, which then misfold and aggregate into soluble oligomers and amyloid fibrils that induce toxicity in distal tissues. Using an assay established herein, we show that highly destabilized, aggregation-prone TTR variants are secreted as both native tetramers and non-native conformations that accumulate as high-molecular-weight oligomers. Pharmacologic chaperones that promote endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis of destabilized TTR variants increase their fraction secreted as a tetramer and reduce extracellular aggregate populations. In contrast, disrupting ER proteostasis reduces the fraction of destabilized TTR secreted as a tetramer and increases extracellular aggregates. These results identify ER proteostasis as a factor that can affect conformational integrity and thus toxic aggregation of secreted amyloidogenic proteins associated with the pathology of protein aggregation diseases.",

Inability to validate reported PKMT substrates delayed progress in the field and cast unnecessary doubt about protein lysine methylation as a truly general PTM. Here, we aim to provide a concise guide to help avoid some of the most common pitfalls in studies searching for new PKMT substrates and propose a set of seven basic biochemical rules: (1) include positive controls; (2)\u00a0use target lysine mutations of substrate proteins as negative controls; (3) use inactive enzyme variants as negative controls; (4) report quantitative methylation data; (5) consider PKMT specificity; (6) validate methyl lysine antibodies; and (7) connect cellular and in\u00a0vitro results.

SimC7 shares little sequence similarity with characterized ketoreductases, suggesting it might have a distinct mechanism. To investigate this possibility, we determined the structures of SimC7 alone, with NADP+, and with NADP+ and the substrate 7-oxo-SD8. These structures show that SimC7 is distinct from previously characterized polyketide ketoreductases, lacking the conserved catalytic triad, including the active-site tyrosine that acts as central acid-base catalyst in canonical SDR proteins. Taken together with functional analyses of active-site mutants, our data suggest that SimC7 catalyzes a substrate-assisted, two-step reaction for reduction of the C-7 carbonyl group involving intramolecular transfer of a substrate-derived proton to generate a phenolate intermediate.",

Here, we reveal the structural basis for how these inhibitors retain activity against a disease-relevant, drug-resistant kinase mutant, while maintaining Src specificity. We find that these macrocycles display a degree of modularity: two of their three variable groups interact with sites on the kinase that confer selectivity, while the third group interacts with the universally conserved catalytic lysine and thereby retains the ability to inhibit the \u201cgatekeeper\u201d kinase mutant.

Remarkably, we verified that PolM, a previously annotated dehydrogenase, catalyzes an unprecedented tandem reduction of acyl-phosphate to aldehyde, and subsequently to alcohol. We also unveiled a distinctive acetylation cycle catalyzed by PolN to synthesize \u03b1-amino-\u03b4-hydroxyvaleric acid (6). Finally, we report that PolL is capable of converting a rare sequential hydroxylation of \u03b1-amino-\u03b4-carbamoylhydroxyvaleric acid (7) to CPOAA. PolL represents an intriguing family of Fe(II)-dependent \u03b1-ketoglutarate dioxygenase with a cupin fold. These data illustrate several novel\u00a0enzymatic reactions, and also set a foundation\u00a0for rational pathway engineering for polyoxin production.",

     "abstract": "Information transmission in biological signaling networks is commonly considered to be a unidirectional flow of information between protein partners. According to this view, many bacterial response regulator proteins utilize input receiver (REC) domains to \u201cswitch\u201d functional outputs, using REC phosphorylation to shift pre-existing equilibria between inactive and active conformations. However, recent data indicate that output domains themselves also shift such equilibria, implying a \u201cmutual inhibition\u201d model. Here we use solution nuclear magnetic resonance to provide a mechanistic basis for such control in a PhyR-type response regulator. Our structure of\u00a0the isolated, non-phosphorylated REC domain surprisingly reveals a fully active conformation, letting us identify structural and dynamic changes imparted by the output domain to inactivate the full-length protein. Additional data reveal transient structural changes within the full-length protein, facilitating activation.

Upon confirming that cysteine reactivity is a good predictor of functionality in C.\u00a0elegans, we profiled cysteine-reactivity changes between daf-2 and daf-16;daf-2 mutants, and identified 40 proteins that display a >2-fold change. Subsequent RNAi-mediated knockdown studies revealed that lbp-3 and K02D7.1 knockdown caused significant increases in lifespan and dauer formation. The proteins encoded by these two genes, LBP-3 and K02D7.1, are implicated in intracellular fatty acid transport and purine metabolism, respectively.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed the first suite of highly potent and specific SO3-amidine-based YwlE inhibitors. With these protein arginine phosphatase-specific probes, we demonstrated that YwlE activity is suppressed by oxidative stress, which consequently increases arginine phosphorylation, thereby inducing the expression of stress-response genes, which is critical for bacterial virulence. Overall, we predict that these novel chemical tools will be widely used to study the regulation of protein arginine phosphorylation in multiple organisms.",

It is not clear why Hsp70 promotes client degradation under some conditions, while sparing that protein under others. Here, we used a combination of chemical biology and genetic strategies to systematically perturb the affinity of Hsp70 for the model client, tau.

We deployed a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) approach to obtain P1-Asp fluorogenic substrates and biotin-labeled inhibitors that targeted legumain. Since this approach led to probes that were also recognized by caspases, we introduced a Counter Selection Substrate Library (CoSeSuL) approach that biases the peptidic scaffold against caspases, thus delivering highly selective legumain probes.

In this Perspective, we discuss the binding modes of various HDAC inhibitors and highlight topological differences between enzymes as well as key, functionally important, features. Based on this analysis, we suggest alternative strategies to achieve selective HDAC inhibition that does not rely on chelation of the zinc ion in the active site but rather on disruption of protein-protein interactions important for HDAC activity.

Although intriguing, the focus on biotechnology necessarily precluded the wider question of how the biopharmaceutical industry has been delivering on its goals to develop new drugs. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of all biopharmaceutical innovators and uncover unexpected findings. The present biopharmaceutical industry grew steadily from 1800 to 1950 and then stagnated for two decades, before a burst of growth attributable to the biotechnology revolution took place; but consolidation has reduced the number of active and independent innovators to a level not experienced since 1945. The trajectories and trends we observe raise fundamental questions about biopharmaceutical innovators and the sustainability of the drug-development enterprise.",

To address this challenge, we leveraged the potent immunostimulatory\u00a0activity of bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) to deliver designer glycan epitopes to the immune system. This approach involved heterologous expression of two clinically important glycans, namely polysialic acid (PSA) and Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (T antigen) in hypervesiculating strains of non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. The resulting glycOMVs displayed structural mimics of PSA or T antigen on their surfaces, and induced high titers of glycan-specific IgG antibodies following immunization in mice. In the case of PSA glycOMVs, serum antibodies potently killed Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MenB), whose outer capsule is PSA, in\u00a0a serum bactericidal assay.

Here, a competitive cysteine-reactivity profiling strategy was implemented to quantitatively measure the sensitivity of >600 cysteine residues to transnitrosation by GSNO. This platform identified a subset of cysteine residues with a high propensity for GSNO-mediated transnitrosation. Functional characterization of previously unannotated S-nitrosation sites revealed that S-nitrosation of a cysteine residue distal to the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type 2 (HADH2) active site impaired catalytic activity.

However, this mechanism of action has not been fully validated because THI does not inhibit S1PL in\u00a0vitro. To reconcile this situation, we examined molecular details of THI mechanism of action using \u201csmaller\u201d THI derivatives.

When exogenous palmitate is provided in the culture media at physiological concentrations, de novo synthesis accounts for only a minor fraction of intracellular palmitate in proliferating fibroblasts as well as proliferating HeLa and H460 cells. Blocking fatty acid uptake decreased the proliferation rate of fibroblasts, HeLa, and H460 cells, while supplementing media with exogenous palmitate resulted in decreased glucose uptake and rendered cells less sensitive to glycolytic inhibition.

High-resolution crystal structures of an ancestral arginine-binding protein in complex with l-arginine and l-glutamine show that the promiscuous binding of l-glutamine is enabled by multi-scale conformational plasticity, water-mediated interactions, and selection of an alternative conformational substate productive for l-glutamine binding. Evolution of specialized glutamine-binding proteins from this ancestral protein was achieved by displacement of water molecules from the protein-ligand interface, reducing the entropic penalty associated with the promiscuous interaction.

Further studies demonstrate that KA covalently binds to a previously uncharacterized cysteine 420 in the middle domain of HSP90 and dissociates HSP90 from its cochaperone CDC37, which leads to inhibition of RIP3-dependent necroptosis and promotion of apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines.

     "abstract": "The DNA double helix has captured the imagination of many, bringing it to the forefront of biological research. DNA has unique features that extend our interest into areas of chemistry, physics, material science, and engineering. Our laboratory has focused on studies of DNA charge transport (CT), wherein charges can efficiently travel long molecular distances through the DNA helix while maintaining an exquisite sensitivity to base pair \u03c0-stacking. Because DNA CT chemistry reports on the integrity of the DNA duplex, this property may be exploited to develop electrochemical devices to detect DNA lesions and DNA-binding proteins. Furthermore, studies now indicate that DNA CT may also be used in the cell by, for example, DNA repair proteins, as a cellular diagnostic, in order to scan the genome to localize efficiently to damage sites. In this review, we describe this evolution of DNA CT chemistry from the discovery of fundamental chemical principles to applications in diagnostic strategies and possible roles in biology.",
