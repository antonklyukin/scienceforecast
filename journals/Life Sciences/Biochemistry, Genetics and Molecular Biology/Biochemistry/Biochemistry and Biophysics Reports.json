While numerous studies point out the role of HSulf-2 in crucial physiological processes as well as in pathological conditions particularly in cancer, its structural organization in two chains and its functional properties remain poorly understood. In this study, we report the first characterization by mass spectrometry (MS) of HSulf-2. An average molecular weight of 133,115\u202fDa was determined for the whole enzyme by MALDI-TOF MS, i.e. higher than the naked amino acid backbone (98,170\u202fDa), highlighting a significant contribution of post-translational modifications. The HSulf-2 protein sequence was determined by Nano-LC-MS/MS, leading to 63% coverage and indicating at least four N-glycosylation sites at Asn 108, 147, 174 and 217. These results provide a platform for further structural investigations of the HSulf enzymes, aiming at deciphering the role of each chain in the substrate binding and specificities and in the catalytic activities.",

     "abstract": "Techniques for predicting interactions between a drug and a target (protein) are useful for strategic drug repositioning. Neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (NRLMF) is one of the state-of-the-art drug\u2013target interaction prediction methods; it is based on a statistical model using the Bernoulli distribution. However, the prediction is not accurate when drug\u2013target interaction pairs have less interaction information (e.g., the sum of the number of ligands for a target and the number of target proteins for a drug). This study aimed to address this issue by proposing NRLMF with beta distribution rescoring (NRLMF\u03b2), which is an algorithm to improve the score of NRLMF. The score of NRLMF\u03b2 is equivalent to the value of the original NRLMF score when the concentration of the beta distribution becomes infinity. The beta distribution is known as a conjugative prior distribution of the Bernoulli distribution and can reflect the amount of interaction information to its shape based on Bayesian inference. Therefore, in NRLMF\u03b2, the beta distribution was used for rescoring the NRLMF score. In the evaluation experiment, we measured the average values of area under the receiver operating characteristics and area under precision versus recall and the 95% confidence intervals. The performance of NRLMF\u03b2 was found to be better than that of NRLMF in the four types of benchmark datasets. Thus, we concluded that NRLMF\u03b2 improved the prediction accuracy of NRLMF.

Highly soluble and bioavailable quercetin glycosides (QGs) were used to examine the inhibition of dexamethasone (DEX)-induced muscle atrophy in vivo. Male BALB/cCrSlc mice were treated with or without QGs for 7 days ad libitum, followed by addition of DEX to their drinking water for a further 7 days. The weight of gastrocnemius (GM) adjusted by body weight was significantly decreased on day 7 after DEX treatment. DEX-induced decrease of GM weight was improved by QG co-administration on day 7. The mRNA levels of muscle atrophy-related genes in the gastrocnemius were significantly lowered by QGs on day 1. In particular, the expression of myostatin, a master regulator of muscle mass homeostasis, was suppressed to that of the control level. In murine C2C12 myotubes, quercetin elevated the phosphorylation of Akt, which are downstream of the myostatin pathway, as well as expression of atrogenes. We demonstrated the protective effect of QGs in DEX-induced muscle atrophy, which might depend on the suppression of myostatin signaling.",

     "abstract": "Mouse melanoma B16-BL6 cells are useful cells for cancer metastatic studies. To understand the metastatic principle at molecular levels, it is necessary to carry out experiments in which cancer cells and their normal counterparts are compared. However, unlike normal human melanocytes, preparation of normal mouse melanocytes is quite difficult due to the lack of marketing and insufficient information on an established protocol for primary culture of mouse melanocytes. In this study, we aimed to establish a convenient method for primary culture of mouse melanocytes on the basis of the protocol for human melanocytes. The main obstacles to preparing pure mouse melanocytes are how to digest mouse skin tissue and how to reduce the contamination of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. The obstacles were overcome by collagenase digestion for skin specimens, short time trypsinization for separating melanocytes and keratinocytes, and use of 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) and cholera toxin in the culture medium. These supplements act to prevent the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. The convenient procedure enabled us to prepare a pure culture of normal mouse melanocytes. Using enriched normal mouse melanocytes and cancerous B16-BL6 cells, we compared the expression levels of melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM), an important membrane protein for melanoma metastasis, in the cells. The results showed markedly higher expression of MCAM in B16-BL6 cells than in normal mouse melanocytes.",

Using CHOK1 derived cell lines, we have developed and used a cell-based high-throughput procedure to screen a 1280 compound, small molecule library for inhibitors of phospholipid biosynthesis. We identified tyrphostin AG 879 (AG879), which inhibited phospholipid biosynthesis by 85\u201390% at a concentration of 10\u202f\u03bcM, displaying an IC50 of 1\u20133\u202f\u03bcM. The synthesis of all phospholipid head group classes was heavily affected. Fatty acid biosynthesis was also dramatically inhibited (90%). AG879 inhibited phospholipid biosynthesis in all additional cell lines tested, including MDCK, HUH7, Vero, and HeLa cell lines. In CHO cells, AG879 was cytostatic; cells survived for at least four days during exposure and were able to divide following its removal. AG879 is an inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and inhibitors of signaling pathways known to be activated by RTK's also inhibited phospholipid biosynthesis. We speculate that inhibition of RTK by AG879 results in an inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis with a resulting decrease in phospholipid biosynthesis and that AG879's effect on fatty acid synthesis and/or phospholipid biosynthesis may contribute to its known capacity as an effective antiviral/anticancer agent.",

However, the direct functional contribution of NOS1 in this process remains to be elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we attempted to use silent RNA and adenovirus mediated silencing or overexpression to investigate the role of NOS1 and the associated molecular signaling mechanisms during OKphenylephrine (PE)-induced cardiac hypertrophy growth in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). We found that the expression of NOS1 was enhanced in PE-induced hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Moreover, LVNIO treatment, a selective NOS1 inhibitor, significantly decreased PE-induced NRVMs hypertrophy and [3H]-leucine incorporation. We demonstrated that NOS1 gene silencing attenuated both the increased size and the transcriptional activity of the hypertrophic marker atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) induced by PE stimulation. Further investigation suggested that deficiency of NOS1-induced diminished NRVMS hypertrophy resulted in decreased calcineurin protein expression and activity (assessed by measuring the transcriptional activity of NFAT) and, an increased activity of the anti-hypertrophic pathway, GSK-3\u03b2 (estimated by its augmented phosphorylated level). In contrast, exposing the NOS1 overexpressed NRVMs to PE-treatment further increased the hypertrophic growth, ANF transcriptional activity and calcineurin activity. Together, the results of the present study suggest that NOS1 is directly involved in controlling the development of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.",

     "abstract": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential dietary components. They are not only used for energy, but also act as signaling molecules. The delta-6 desaturase (D6D) enzyme, encoded by the FADS2 gene, is one of two rate limiting enzymes that convert the PUFA precursors \u2013 \u03b1-linolenic (n-3) and linoleic acid (n-6) to their respective metabolites. Alterations in the D6D enzyme activity alters fatty acid profiles and are associated with metabolic and inflammatory diseases including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Omega-3 PUFAs, specifically its constituent fatty acids DHA and EPA, are known for their anti-inflammatory ability and are also beneficial in the prevention of skeletal muscle wasting, however the mechanism for muscle preservation is not well understood. Moreover, little is known of the effects of altering the n-6/n-3 ratio in the context of a high-fat diet, which is known to downregulate protein synthesis. Twenty C57BL6 male mice were fed a high-fat lard (HFL, 45% fat (mostly lard), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 13:1) diet for 6 weeks. Mice were then divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a05 per group): HFL\u2013 , high-fat oil\u2013 (HFO, 45% fat (mostly Menhaden oil), 35% carbohydrate and 20% protein, n-6:n-3 PUFA, 1:3), HFL+ (HFL diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100\u00a0mg/kg/day), and HFO+ (HFO diet plus an orally administered FADS2 inhibitor, 100\u00a0mg/kg/day). After 2 weeks on their respective diets and treatments, animals were sacrificed and gastrocnemius muscle harvested. Protein turnover signaling were analyzed via Western Blot. 4-EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 expression were measured. A two-way ANOVA revealed no significant change in the phosphorylation of both 4EBP-1 and ribosomal protein S6 with diet or inhibitor. There was a significant reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation with the inhibition of FADS2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Additionally, we measured markers of protein degradation through levels of FOXO phosphorylation, ubiquitin, and LC3B expression; there was a trend towards increased phosphorylation of FOXO (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and ubiquitinated proteins (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05) with FADS2 inhibition. LC3B expression, a marker of autophagy, was significantly higher in the HFL plus FADS2 inhibition group from all other comparisons. Lastly, we analyzed activation of mitochondrial biogenesis which is closely linked with protein synthesis through PGC1-\u03b1 and Cytochrome-C expression, however no significant differences were associated with either marker across all groups. Collectively, these data suggest that the protective effects of muscle mass by omega-3 fatty acids are from inhibition of protein degradation. Our aim was to determine the role of PUFA metabolites, DHA and EPA, in skeletal muscle protein turnover and assess the effects of n-3s independently. We observed that by inhibiting the FADS2 enzyme, the protective effect of n-3s on protein synthesis and proliferation was lost; concomitantly, protein degradation was increased with FADS2 inhibition regardless of diet.",

The roles of the three well-structured RNA-binding domains have been extensively studied, while little is known about CTD. In this research, the impact of CTD on PARN stability and aggregatory potency was studied by comparing the thermal inactivation and denaturation behaviors of full-length PARN with two N-terminal fragments lacking CTD. Our results showed that K+ induced additional regular secondary structures and enhanced PARN stability against heat-induced inactivation, unfolding and aggregation. CTD prevented PARN from thermal inactivation but promoted thermal aggregation to initiate at a temperature much lower than that required for inactivation and unfolding. Blue-shift of Trp fluorescence during thermal transitions suggested that heat treatment induced rearrangements of domain organizations. CTD amplified the stabilizing effect of K+, implying the roles of CTD was mainly achieved by electrostatic interactions. These results suggested that CTD might dynamically interact with the main body of the molecule and release of CTD promoted self-association via electrostatic interactions.",

Here, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt) expression in tumor tissues of 99 NSCLC patients. We also analyzed the genotype of the patients for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the AKT1 gene, rs2498804 and rs2494732. We found that p-Akt expression differs between NSCLC patients and correlates with the risk of BM. Indeed, patients exhibiting medium to high p-Akt expression had a higher incidence of BM than those exhibiting low to no p-Akt expression (39% vs 16%). Our data also show that patients with the rs2498804\u202fGT/GG and rs2494732 CT/TT variant genotypes were more likely to exhibit higher levels of p-Akt expression than those with the rs2498804 TT and rs2494732 CC variant genotypes (35% vs. 24% and 37% vs. 25%, respectively).

Previously, we demonstrated that secreted hCLCA1 plays a role in regulating the innate immune response by activating airway macrophages. However, the mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. In this present study, recombinant proteins containing different hCLCA1 domains are expressed to determine the specific hCLCA1 domain(s) responsible for macrophage activation. Specifically, hCLCA1 constructs containing the hydrolase domain (HYD), the von Willebrand Factor Type A (VWA) domain, and the fibronectin type III (FN3) domain were heterologously expressed and affinity purified through fast protein liquid chromatography. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the purified hCLCA1 constructs exhibited secondary structure consistent with folded proteins. The VWA domain clearly demonstrated an ability to activate macrophages, inducing an increase in both IL-1\u03b2 mRNA and protein expression. This activation was associated with the activation of MAPKs and NF-\u03baB pathways, identifying potential mechanistic pathways by which hCLCA1's VWA domain exerts its signaling effect. Altogether, this work identifies a domain with signaling function within hCLCA1, providing a specific target to one of the most highly induced gene products of airway inflammatory disease.",

The dibenzodioxins had earlier proven their anti-proliferative nature against HeLa tumor cell lines. Since phenazines are structural analogues of the former, these molecules were evaluated in course of the current study for their cytotoxic action against HeLa cell lines and they exhibited strong anti-tumor activity. This behavior could be related to their good DNA binding property. The DNA binding modes of molecules 1\u20134 (Fig. 1) were evaluated using various experimental techniques and they interacted with DNA in a non-covalently by both intercalative as well as groove binding mechanisms. Molecule 1 follows predominantly intercalative binding mode whereas molecules 2 and 3 have nearly equal and opposite preferences for both groove binding and intercalative modes. For molecule 4, groove binding is preferred mode of binding to DNA. A rationale for such differential binding behaviour is provided based on the subtle structural differences in our synthesised dibenzodioxins and phenazines. Elucidation of the mode of a molecule-DNA-binding event is relevant for understanding the mechanism of action of these molecules and will help promote further research into designing better DNA targeting small molecules.",

     "abstract": "MUC5AC is a well-known gastric differentiation marker, which has been frequently used for the classification of stomach cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of regulation of MUC5AC expression remains to be elucidated. In previous studies, we have shown that Gli regulated MUC5AC transcription through the Gli-binding motif in the 5\u2032 region of MUC5AC. Gli played important roles, but independently was not sufficient for MUC5AC expression. In this study, we analyzed a 4010 bp fragment of the 5\u2032-flanking promoter region of the human MUC5AC gene by luciferase assay, and found a novel distal enhancer region located between \u22121434 bp to \u22123000 bp upstream from the first ATG initiation codon. This region is composed of repetitive DNA sequences 5\u2032-TCACTCAC-3\u2032. The strength of enhancer activities depended on the length of the repetitive region. The tandem repeats are conserved among primates, but not in other mammals. The tandem repeat regions enhanced promoter activities not only of MUC5AC but also of other genes. The enhancer effect of the tandem repeat regions was maintained even when inverted. ChIP analysis revealed that H3K9me3 binds to the tandem repeat regions. Together, our results suggest that the tandem repeat region in the MUC5AC promoter has the potential to act as a strong enhancer, and H3K9me3 may contribute to histone modifications of this region.",

However, the mechanism by which DNA methylation is deterred by the placeholder nucleosome is poorly understood. In the present study, we reconstituted the placeholder nucleosome containing histones H2A.Z and H3 with the Lys4 mono-methylation. The thermal stability assay revealed that the placeholder nucleosome is less stable than the canonical nucleosome. Nuclease susceptibility assays suggested that the nucleosomal DNA ends of the placeholder nucleosome are more accessible than those of the canonical nucleosome. These characteristics of the placeholder nucleosome are quite similar to those of the H2A.Z nucleosome without H3K4 methylation. Importantly, the linker histone H1, which is reportedly involved in the recruitment of DNA methyltransferases, efficiently binds to all of the placeholder, H2A.Z, and canonical nucleosomes. Therefore, the characteristics of the H2A.Z nucleosome are conserved in the placeholder nucleosome without synergistic effects on the H3K4 mono-methylation.",

Here we have examined the role of TRPC6 in progression of inflammation and fibrosis in the nephrotoxic serum (NTS) model of crescentic glomerulonephritis. This was assessed in rats with non-functional TRPC6 channels due to genomic disruption of an essential domain in TRPC6 channels (Trpc6del/del rats) and wild-type littermates (Trpc6wt/wt rats). Administration of NTS evoked albuminuria and proteinuria observed 4 and 28 days later that was equally severe in Trpc6wt/wt and Trpc6del/del rats. By 28 days, there were dense deposits of complement and IgG within glomeruli in both genotypes, accompanied by severe inflammation and fibrosis readily observed by standard histological methods, and also by increases in renal cortical expression of multiple markers (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, vimentin, NLRP3, and CD68). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis appeared equally severe in Trpc6wt/wt and Trpc6del/del rats. TRPC6 inactivation did not protect against the substantial declines in renal function (increases in blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and kidney:body weight ratio) in NTS-treated animals, and increases in a urine maker of proximal tubule pathology (\u03b22-macroglobulin) were actually more severe in Trpc6del/del animals. By contrast, glomerular pathology, blindly scored from histology, and from renal cortical expression of podocin suggested a partial but significant protective effect of TRPC6 inactivation within the glomerular compartment, at least during the autologous phase of the NTS model.",

     "abstract": "Growing evidence continues to point toward the critical role of beta tubulin isotypes in regulating some intracellular functions. Changes that were observed in the microtubules\u2019 intrinsic dynamics, the way they interact with some chemotherapeutic agents, or differences on translocation specifications of some molecular motors along microtubules, were associated to their structural uniqueness in terms of beta tubulin isotype distributions. These findings suggest that the effects of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) may also vary on structurally different microtubules. Among different microtubule associated proteins, Tau proteins, which are known as neuronal MAPs, bind to beta tubulin, stabilize microtubules, and consequently promote their polymerizations.In this study, in a set of well controlled experiments, the direct effect of Tau proteins on the polymerization of two structurally different microtubules, porcine brain and breast cancer (MCF7), were tested and compared. Remarkably, we found that in contrast with the promoted effect of Tau proteins on brain microtubules\u2019 polymerization, MCF7 expressed a demoted polymerization while interacting with Tau proteins. This finding can potentially be a novel insight into the mechanism of drug resistance in some breast cancer cells.It has been reported that microtubules show destabilizing behavior in some MCF7 cells with overexpression of Tau protein when treated with a microtubules\u2019 stabilizing agent, Taxol. This behavior has been classified by others as drug resistance, but it may instead be potentially caused by a competition between the destabilizing effect of the Tau protein and the stabilizing effect of the drug on MCF7 microtubules. Also, we quantified the polarization coefficient of MCF7 microtubules in the presence and absence of Tau proteins by the electro-orientation method and compared the values. The two significantly different values obtained can possibly be one factor considered to explain the effect of Tau proteins on the polymerization of MCF7 microtubules.",

This study was designed to investigate the cardiomyocyte protective potential of plant-produced asialo-rhuEPO (asialo-rhuEPOP) against staurosporine (STS)-induced injury in HL-1 murine cardiomyocytes and identify cellular pathway(s) responsible for its cardioprotection.HL-1 cardiomyocytes were simultaneously treated with STS and asialo-rhuEPOP. Cellular injury, apoptosis, and cell viabilities were measured by LDH assay, Hoechst staining and trypan blue exclusion method, respectively while western blotting was used to study its effects on apoptosis and autophagy hallmarks.Our results showed that 20 IU/ml asialo-rhuEPOP provided 39% protection to cardiomyocytes compared to STS-treated cells, which is 2-fold better than that of mammalian cell-produce rhuEPO (rhuEPOM). Asialo-rhuEPOP was found to suppress activation of proapoptotic kinase Mst1 (mammalian Sterile-20-like kinase 1) and FOXO3, leading to inhibition of apoptotic pathway and restoration of autophagy as indicated by the reduction of fragmented/condensed nuclei, altered ratios of Bax/Bcl2, p-Bad/Bad, cytosol/mitochondrial cyt c and caspase-3 activation, and the restored levels of autophagy markers Beclin1, p62 and LC3B-II. Additionally, Akt was found to be activated and FOXO3 was phosphorylated on Ser253, suggesting inhibition of FOXO3 transcriptional function.Asialo-rhuEPOP-mediated cardioprotection occurs through activation of PI3K/Akt pathway leading to suppression of Mst1 activation and promoting cardiomyocyte survival.Asialo-rhuEPOP could be used to modulate Mst1 activity elevated under numerous pathological states.",

S42 also increased muscle weight of the levator ani in orchiectomized Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. These findings prompted us to investigate whether S42 has a direct effect on cultured C2C12 myotubes. S42 significantly lowered expression levels of the skeletal muscle ubiquitin ligase (muscle atrophy-related gene), atrogin1 and Muscle RING-Finger Protein 1(MuRF1) in C2C12 myotubes, as determined by real time PCR. Phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K), an essential factor for promoting protein synthesis in skeletal muscle, was significantly increased by S42 to almost the same extent as by insulin, but this was significantly prevented by treatment with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). However, phosphorylation of Akt, upstream regulator of mTORC1, was not changed by S42. S42 did not increase insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) mRNA levels in C2C12 myotubes. These results suggest that S42 may have an anabolic effect through activation of mTORC1\u2013p70S6K signaling, independent of IGF-1-Akt signaling and may exert an anti-catabolic effect through inhibition of the degradation pathway in cultured C2C12 myotubes.",

Site-specific labelling of a protein is of particular interest for fluorescence-based single-molecule measurements including single-molecule FRET or super-resolution microscopy. The labelling procedure should be highly specific but minimally invasive to preserve sensitive biomolecules. The modern molecular engineering toolkit provides elegant solutions to achieve the site-specific modification of a protein of interest often necessitating the incorporation of an unnatural amino acid to introduce a unique reactive moiety. The Amber suppression strategy allows the site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into a protein of interest. Recently, this approach has been transferred to the mammalian expression system. Here, we demonstrate how the combination of unnatural amino acid incorporation paired with current bioorthogonal labelling strategies allow the site-specific engineering of fluorescent dyes into proteins produced in the cellular environment of a human cell. We describe in detail which parameters are important to ensure efficient incorporation of unnatural amino acids into a target protein in human expression systems. We furthermore outline purification and bioorthogonal labelling strategies that allow fast protein preparation and labelling of the modified protein. This way, the complete eukaryotic proteome becomes available for single-molecule fluorescence assays.",

     "abstract": "Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in the promoter region of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) gene have been linked to the activity of RAGE. However, contrary to our expectation, we previously detected no correlation between SNPs within the RAGE promoter and ulcerative colitis (UC) risk in a case-control study. Here, we investigated the methylation of the RAGE promoter and analyzed the collective contribution of methylation and SNPs to UC risk. We found that RAGE promoter hypomethylation was more common in UC patients compared to controls (70% vs. 30%, respectively), as determined via bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Furthermore, we investigated the cooperativity of promoter methylation and SNPs and found that either of two SNPs (rs1800624 or rs1800625) and promoter methylation jointly contributed to UC risk (30 UC patients vs. 30 controls, P\u202f<\u202f0.05). There was no correlation between UC risk and either methylation or SNPs when analyzed separately. This lack of correlation is likely due to promoter methylation repressing gene transcription, whereas SNPs in the RAGE promoter region activate RAGE transcription. We found that variant allele carriers with promoter hypomethylation were at an increased risk for UC (rs1800624, OR = 10, 95% CI: 1.641\u201360.21, P\u202f=\u202f0.009; rs1800625, OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.074\u201321.447, P\u202f=\u202f0.039). Furthermore, our data revealed that the RAGE mRNA levels in variant allele carriers with promoter hypomethylation were significantly higher compared to those with promoter hypermethylation (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) as well as to those in wild-type allele individuals exhibiting promoter hypomethylation (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). We therefore speculate that the methylation status and SNPs present in the RAGE promoter region alter RAGE transcription, thereby impacting UC risk. We also propose that the methylation status and RAGE promoter genotype could jointly serve as clinical biomarkers to assist in UC risk assessment.",

     "abstract": "Leigh syndrome is a highly heterogeneous condition caused by pathological mutations in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA regions encoding molecules involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, in which many organs including the brain can be affected. Among these organs, a high incidence of poor bone health has been recognized in primary mitochondrial diseases including Leigh syndrome. However, the direct association between mitochondrial dysfunction and poor bone health has not been fully elucidated. Mitochondrial biosynthesis is a potential therapeutic target for this syndrome, as it can ameliorate the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation without altering these gene mutations. A recent study has shown the impaired osteogenesis in the dental pulp stem cells derived from the deciduous teeth of a child with Leigh syndrome, harboring the heteroplasmic mutation G13513A in the mitochondrial DNA region encoding the ND5 subunit of the respiratory chain complex I. The present study aimed to investigate whether mitochondrial biogenesis could be a therapeutic target for improving osteogenesis, using the same stem cells in a patient-specific cellular model. For this purpose, bezafibrate was used because it has been reported to induce mitochondrial biogenesis as well as to improve bone metabolism and osteoporosis. Bezafibrate clearly improved the differentiation of patient-derived stem cells into osteoblasts and the mineralization of differentiated osteoblasts. The mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1\u03b1, ATP production, and mitochondrial Ca2+ levels were all significantly increased by bezafibrate in the patient-derived cells. In addition, the increased amount and morphological shift from the fragmentary to network shape associated with DRP1 downregulation were also observed in the bezafibrate-treated patient-derived cells. These results suggest that mitochondrial biogenesis may be a potential therapeutic target for improving osteogenesis in patients with Leigh syndrome, and bezafibrate may be one of the candidate treatment agents.",

The fates of female reproductive tract epithelia are determined by the mesenchyme. However, the mesenchymal fate determination system is still unclear. It is reported that presence or absence of retinoic acid (RA) signaling in MD mesenchyme induced uterine or vaginal mesenchyme, respectively. To analyze determination of the borderline, RA signal switching factors were found to play critical roles. Expression of a RA metabolizing enzyme, CYP26A1, was high in the epithelium of caudal MD and urogenital sinus, indicating that the enzyme causes the absence of RA signaling in the region. mRNA expression of some transcription factors regulating Aldh1a2, RA synthesis enzyme expressed in MDs, in other tissues was detected in MDs. When the transcription factor genes were overexpressed in a uterine mesenchymal cell line, C/ebp\u03b4 overexpression stimulated Aldh1a2 expression. Furthermore, C/EBP\u03b4 protein was strongly expressed in the proximal and middle regions of the MDs and bound to the Aldh1a2 promoter in vivo. Since C/ebp\u03b4 mRNA expression was maintained at the same level in proximal, middle and caudal MDs, we hypothesize that a high frequency of mitosis induces a low level protein expression in MD mesenchyme. In fact, the mitotic activity was significantly high in caudal mesenchyme, and a mathematical model showed that a gradient of protein was induced by cell proliferation. Therefore, morphogenesis of MDs controls the fate of mesenchyme via RA degradation in urogenital sinus and a gradient of proteins involved in RA synthesis.",

     "abstract": "The appropriate development and regulation of neuronal morphology are important to establish functional neuronal circuits and enable higher brain function of the central nervous system. R-Ras, a member of the Ras family of small GTPases, plays crucial roles in the regulation of axonal morphology, including outgrowth, branching, and guidance. GTP-bound activated R-Ras reorganizes actin filaments and microtubules through interactions with its downstream effectors, leading to the precise control of axonal morphology. However, little is known about the upstream regulatory mechanisms for R-Ras activation in neurons. In this study, we found that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a positive effect on endogenous R-Ras activation and promotes R-Ras-mediated axonal growth. RNA interference knockdown and overexpression experiments revealed that RasGRF1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for R-Ras, is involved in BDNF-induced R-Ras activation and the promotion of axonal growth. Phosphorylation of RasGRF1 by protein kinase A at Ser916/898 is needed for the full activation of its GEF activity and to facilitate Ras signaling. We observed that BDNF treatment markedly increased this phosphorylation. Our results suggest that BDNF is one of the critical extrinsic regulators for R-Ras activation, and that RasGRF1 is an intrinsic key mediator for BDNF-induced R-Ras activation and R-Ras-mediated axonal morphological regulation.",

Our previous reports have shown that ethanol reduced intracellular concentrations of antiretroviral drugs elvitegravir and darunavir in the HIV-1-infected U1 cell line. Ethanol also increased HIV-1 replication despite the presence of elvitegravir. Our previous finding has also shown that the levels of cytochrome P450 enzyme 2E1 (CYP2E1) and oxidative stress in blood monocytes were induced, while the concentration of alcohol in the plasma was reduced in HIV-1-infected alcohol users compared to uninfected alcohol users. However, the role of CYP2E1 in ethanol-enhanced oxidative stress and HIV-1 replication is still unclear.This study examined the chronic effects (14 days) of ethanol on HIV viral load, oxidative DNA damage, expression of CYP2E1, expression of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Further, to evaluate the role of CYP2E1 in mediating ethanol-induced viral replication, CYP2E1 siRNA and CYP2E1 selective inhibitor were used in the HIV-1-infected U1 cell line following ethanol treatment.Chronic ethanol exposure demonstrated an increase in oxidative DNA damage and CYP2E1 expression in both non-infected and HIV-1-infected MDM. Our results showed that ethanol chronic exposure increased HIV-1 replication by ~3-fold in HIV-1-infected MDM. This ethanol-enhanced HIV-1 replication was associated with an increased oxidative DNA damage, an increased expression of CYP2E1, and a decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme PRDX6. In HIV-1-infected U1 cell line, we observed a decreased viral replication (~30%) and a decreased DNA damage (~100%) after repression of CYP2E1 by siRNA, upon ethanol exposure. We also observed a decreased viral replication (~25%) after inhibition of CYP2E1 by using selective CYP2E1 inhibitor.The data suggest that chronic ethanol exposure increases HIV-1 replication in MDM, at least in part, through CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress. These results are clinically relevant to potentially find effective treatment strategies for HIV-1-infected alcohol users.",

The variant with 3-nitrotyrosine at position 205, near the substrate binding site, retained its catalytic activity at the neutral pH and showed a 60% activity reduction at pH 10.5. This reduction in the alkaline domain is desirable for enhancing the stability of the enzyme in the liquid laundary detergent, whereas the wild-type molecule showed a 20% increase in response to the same pH shift. The engineered pH dependency of the activity of the variant was ascribed partly to a lowered substrate affinity under the alkaline conditions, in which the incorporated 3-nitrotyrosine was probably charged negatively due to the phenolic pKa lower than that of tyrosine.",

At 11\u202fmM D-glucose, INS-1 832/13 cells expressing V91L GCK showed increased cell permeability without significant increases in Annexin V staining or caspase 3/7 activation, indicating that these cells are primarily undergoing cell death via necrosis. Over-expression of SV40 large T antigen, which inhibits the p53 pathway, did not affect the V91L GCK-induced cell death. We also found that non-phosphorylatable L-glucose did not induce rapid cell death. Of note, glucose phosphorylation coincided with a 90% loss of intracellular ATP content.

While significant advances have been made regarding how HC-modified HA (HC-HA) is an important regulator of inflammation, it remains unclear why HC-HA plays a critical role in promoting survival in intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia while exerting only a modest role in the outcomes following intratracheal exposure to LPS. To address this gap, the two models of intraperitoneal LPS-induced endotoxic shock and intratracheal LPS-induced acute lung injury were directly compared in TSG-6 knockout mice and littermate controls. HC-HA formation, endogenous TSG-6 activity, and inflammatory markers were assessed in plasma and lung tissue. TSG-6 knockout mice exhibited accelerated mortality during endotoxic shock. While both intraperitoneal and intratracheal LPS induced HC-HA formation in lung parenchyma, only systemically-induced endotoxemia increased plasma TSG-6 levels and intravascular HC-HA formation. Cultured human lung microvascular endothelial cells secreted TSG-6 in response to both TNF\u03b1 and IL1\u03b2 stimulation, indicating that, in addition to inflammatory cells, the endothelium may secrete TSG-6 into circulation during systemic inflammation. These data show for the first time that LPS-induced systemic inflammation is uniquely characterized by significant vascular induction of TSG-6 and HC-HA, which may contribute to improved outcomes of endotoxemia.",

     "abstract": "While the binding of biotin by streptavidin does not appear to be cooperative in the traditional sense of altered binding strength, it has been suggested that it may be cooperative in terms of differential structural changes in the protein. In this work we present intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence data as evidence of a cooperative structural change. The technique involves examination of the differences in fluorescence emission corresponding to distinct tryptophan populations accompanying protein-ligand binding. Specifically we note that the 335\u202fnm emission population (i.e. more hydrophobic) saturates prior to the saturation of the 350\u202fnm emission population commonly used in the standard binding activity assay. We also note that the wavelength of maximum emission, total integrated fluorescence emission and full width at half maximum during the titration of ligand into streptavidin also reach saturation before the expected 4:1 stoichiometric end point. This suggests that the binding of the first 3 biotins effect greater structural changes in the protein than the final ligand.",

     "abstract": "Previously, we proposed the following mechanism for konjac ceramide (kCer)-mediated neurite outgrowth inhibition: kCer binds to Nrp as a Sema3A agonist, resulting in Nrp1/PlexA complex formation and activation of the Sema3A signaling pathway to induce phosphorylation of CRMP2 and microtubule depolymerization. The Sema3A/Nrp1 signaling pathway is known to be also expressed in normal human keratinocytes. To determine whether kCer can function in human keratinocytes as it does in neurites, that is, if it can bind to Nrp1 in place of Sema3A, we studied the effect of kCer on HaCaT cell migration activity. Using a trans-well chamber assay, we compared the effects of Sema3A and kCer on serum-derived cell migration activity. kCer showed Sema3A-like suppression of cell migration activity and induction of cellular Cofilin phosphorylation. In addition, kCer and Sema3A inhibited histamine (His)-enhanced migration of immature HaCaT cells. We have demonstrated that kCer does not interact with histaime receptors H1R or H4R directly, but we speculate that kCer may transduce a signal downstream of the His signaling pathway.",

Our previous studies have suggested that alteration of oxygen homeostasis may be involved in the kidney injury caused by AQP11 deficiency, although the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we examined genes that are related to oxygen homeostasis in Aqp11-/- mice. Among 62 genes that are involved in oxygen homeostasis, 35 were upregulated by more than 2-fold in Aqp11-/- mice in comparison with wild-type mice. Pathway analysis using these genes extracted the pathway responsible for production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. As expression of the genes involved in the NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) complex was dramatically increased by more than 14-fold, we further analyzed NOX2 at the protein level. Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated a dramatic increase of NOX2 protein in the kidney of Aqp11-/- mice, and immunohistochemistry showed that NOX2 protein and a marker protein for macrophages were increased in the renal interstitium. These results indicate that NOX2-induced oxidative stress accompanied by macrophage infiltration plays an important role in alteration of oxygen homeostasis in Aqp11-/- mice.",

     "abstract": "Myostatin (MSTN) is a well-known negative growth factor of muscle mass, and studies have shown that MSTN-inhibition would be a potential strategy to treat muscle atrophy seen in various clinical conditions. Recent studies suggest that MSTN-inhibition induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy through up-regulation of the anabolic Akt/mTOR pathway. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the muscle hypertrophy induced by MSTN-inhibition would be suppressed by the administration of rapamycin (RAP), a mTOR suppressor. A MSTN transgenic mouse strain (MSTN-pro), which is characterized by a postnatal hyper-muscularity due to MSTN inhibition through transgenic overexpression of MSTN propeptide, was used in producing experimental animals. Five-week-old male heterozygous MSTN-pro mice and wild-type littermates were administered with 0 or 3\u202fmg/kg body weight of RAP intraperitoneally every other day for 4 weeks. The effects of RAP on muscle growth, mRNA abundance of signaling components of the Akt/mTOR pathway, and myogenic regulatory factors (MyoD, Myf5, MyoG, and Mrf4) were examined in comparison to wild-type mice. Body weight gain of MSTN-pro mice was significantly greater than that of wild-type mice. RAP suppressed body weight gain and muscle mass in both MSTN-pro and wild-type mice. The extent of both body weight and muscle mass suppression was significantly greater in MSTN-pro mice than in wild-type mice. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that mRNA abundance of the signaling molecules of the Akt/mTOR pathway, including Akt, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1, were significantly higher in MSTN-pro mice. RAP treatment decreased mRNA abundance of Akt, p70S6K and 4E-BP1 only in MSTN-pro mice. mRNA abundances of MyoD and MyoG were not affected by MSTN suppression or RAP treatment. mRNA abundance of Myf5 was decreased by RAP, but not affected by MSTN suppression. mRNA abundance of Mrf4 was decreased by MSTN suppression. RAP treatment decreased mRNA abundance of Mrf4 only in wild type mice. Results of this study indicate that transcriptional regulation of signaling components of the Akt/mTOR pathway and myogenic regulatory transcription factor Mrf4 is involved in the enhancement of skeletal muscle mass induced by MSTN suppression.",

     "abstract": "Fluid management using a body composition monitor (BCM) based on bioimpedance spectroscopy has been found to be beneficial for maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients. Our purpose was to provide a management procedure for the adjustment of post-dialysis overhydration (OHpost) and to evaluate whether this approach could improve blood pressure.Post-dialysis fluid status was assessed weekly using the BCM. The reference value of OHpost and the flow procedure for post-dialysis target weight (PDTW) adjustment were established via measurements of OHpost in 60 normotensive MHD patients. In the interventional study, we adjusted the PDTW of hypertensive patients to the optimal OHpost range, with a 0.2\u20130.5\u202fkg change in PDTW per week.This observational study included 130 anuric MHD patients, of whom 60 were in the pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure (sBPpre) <\u202f140\u202fmmHg group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that only OHpost was significantly associated with sBPpre \u2265\u202f140\u202fmmHg (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f2.293, p\u202f=\u202f0.000). Patients in the OHpost <\u202f\u22121.8\u202fL group were mainly male and younger, and had higher post-dialysis diastolic blood pressure, ultrafiltration volume, levels of nutrition markers (serum albumin and creatinine), body mass index, and lean tissue index (LTI). On multiple stepwise regression analysis, only the change in LTI was found to be an independent predictor of OHpost [R2 0.208, \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.196, 95% CI (\u22120.296, \u22120.095), p\u202f<\u202f0.001]. The reference value of OHpost was found to deviate by \u2212\u202f2.5\u20130.5\u202fL from that of normotensive patients. At the end of the study, the systolic blood pressure of 38 patients was less than 140\u202fmmHg after PDTW adjustment. The changes in OHpost from the initial to last adjustment were significant (t\u202f=\u202f5.431, p\u202f<\u202f 0.001), with a substantial decrease in the sBPpre (t\u202f=\u202f11.208, p\u202f<\u202f 0.001).Assessment of OHpost and LTI using a BCM with a patient-specific optimal PDTW adjustment flow can lead to significantly better control of hypertension in anuric MHD patients.",

In this study, we constructed Pluronic\u00ae -F127 polymer and tannic acid (TA) based nanoparticles (F127-TA core nanoparticles) with varying mannose densities. The particle size of the optimized mannose-decorated F127-TA hybrid nanoparticles (MDNPs) was found to be ~\u202f265\u202fnm with a negative zeta potential of ~ \u2212\u202f4.5\u202fmV. No significant changes in the size and zeta potentials of nanoparticles were observed, which demonstrated structural integrity and stability of the nanoformulation. Physicochemical characteristics of MDNPs were evaluated by FTIR and TGA and demonstrated the presence of mannose units on surface nanoparticles. A mannose-dependent cellular targeting and uptake of MDNPs was found in U937 macrophages. The uptake process was found to vary directly with time and volume of MDNPs nanoparticles. The uptake pattern is higher in M2 than M1. This behavior was also evident from the instantaneous and superior binding profile of M2 macrophage lysate protein with MDNPs over that of M1 macrophage lysate protein. These results demonstrated that an appropriate mannose ligand density was confirmed, suggesting efficient targeting of M2. Altogether, these data support that the MDNPs formulation could serve as a targeted therapeutic guide in the generation of nanomedicine to treat various conditions as an anti-inflammation therapy.",

Here, we have tested whether glucose and insulin regulate expression of SUR2A/KATP channel subunits and resistance to metabolic stress in heart H9c2 cells. Absence of glucose in culture media decreased SUR2A mRNA, while mRNAs of Kir6.2, Kir6.1, SUR1 and IES SUR2B were increased. 2-deoxyglucose (50\u202fmM) decreased mRNAs of SUR2A, SUR2B and SUR1, did not affect IES SUR2A and IES SUR2B mRNAs and increased Kir6.2 mRNA. No glucose and 2-deoxyglucose (50\u202fmM) decreased resistance to an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation, DNP (10\u202fmM). 50\u202fmM glucose did not alter KATP channel subunits nor cellular resistance to DNP (10\u202fmM). Insulin (20\u202fng/ml) in both physiological and high glucose (50\u202fmM) down-regulated SUR2A while upregulating Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 (in high glucose only). Insulin (20\u202fng/ml) in physiological and high glucose decreased cell survival in DNP (10\u202fmM). As opposed to Kir6.2, infection with SUR2A resulted in titre-dependent cytoprotection. We conclude that insulin decreases resistance to metabolic stress in H9c2 cells by decreasing SUR2A expression. Lower cardiac SUR2A levels underlie increased myocardial susceptibility to metabolic stress and shorter lifespan.",

We studied treadmill running as an intervention to improve musculoskeletal health in a translational rat model that has slowly progressive CKD. CKD rats were subjected to treadmill exercise or no treadmill exercise for 10 weeks (n\u202f=\u202f8 each group). Animals ran for 60\u202fmin, 5 times per week starting at a speed of 8\u202fm/min and ending at 18\u202fm/min (1\u202fm/min increase/week). Treadmill training had no effect on muscle strength (assessed as maximally stimulated torque), half-relaxation time (time from peak torque to 50%) or muscle cross-sectional area. Overall, there were no biochemical improvements related to CKD progression. Skeletal muscle catabolism was higher than non-exercised animals without a concomitant change in muscle synthesis markers or regeneration transcription factors. These results suggest that aerobic exercise, achieved via treadmill running was not protective in CKD animals and actually produced potentially harmful effects (increased catabolism). Given the high prevalence and dramatic musculoskeletal mobility impairment in patients with CKD, there is a clear need to understand how to effectively prescribe exercise in order to benefit the musculoskeletal system.",

     "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interactions, restrictive interests, and repetitive stereotypic behaviors. Among the various mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of ASD, dysfunctions of dopaminergic signaling and mitochondria have been hypothesized to explain the core symptoms of children with ASD. However, only a few studies focusing on the pathological association between dopaminergic neurons (DN) and mitochondria in ASD have been performed using patient-derived stem cells and in vitro differentiated neurons. Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cells present in the dental pulp of exfoliated deciduous teeth; these cells can differentiate into dopaminergic neurons (DN) in vitro. This study aimed to investigate the pathological association between development of DN and mitochondria in ASD by using SHED as a disease- or patient-specific cellular model. The SHED obtained from three children with ASD and three typically developing children were differentiated into DN, and the neurobiology of these cells was examined. The DN derived from children with ASD showed impaired neurite outgrowth and branching, associated with decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP production, number of mitochondria within the neurites, amount of mitochondria per cell area and intracellular calcium level. In addition, impaired neurite outgrowth and branching of ASD-derived DN were not improved by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), suggesting impairment of the BDNF signaling pathway in ASD. These results imply that intracerebral dopamine production may have decreased in these children. The earliest age at which deciduous teeth spontaneously exfoliate in humans, and SHED can be noninvasively collected, is approximately 6 years. Our results suggest that in vitro analysis of SHED-derived DN obtained from children with ASD provides neurobiological information that may be useful in determining treatment strategies in the early stages of ASD.",

Because ASM is an important therapeutic target in asthma, it is beneficial to develop bioengineered ASM models available for assessing physiological and biophysical properties of ASM cells.

We utilized a 3-D culture model of human ASM cells embedded in type-I collagen gel. We further examined the effects of cyclic mechanical stretch, which mimics tidal breathing, on cell orientation and expression of contractile proteins of ASM cells within the 3-D gel. ASM cells in type-I collagen exhibited a tissue-like structure with actin stress fiber formation and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in response to methacholine. Uniaxial cyclic stretching enhanced alignment of nuclei and actin stress fibers of ASM cells. Moreover, expression of mRNAs for contractile proteins such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, calponin, myosin heavy chain 11, and transgelin of stretched ASM cells was significantly higher than that under the static condition.

We detected an mSBC-specific response (including novel genes, e.g., Sertad4, Lifr, Pmepa1, Epcam, Tbxas1; and common genes, e.g., Usp2, Cst7, Grtp1, and Casp6), an hPBBC-specific response (e.g., CCL17, MTCL1, GCSAM, HOMER2, IL2RA), and a common mSBC/hPBBC response (e.g., CISH, NFIL3, SOCS1, VDR, CDH1). In contrast, the mSBC and mSTC responses were largely divergent. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied for the first time to identify the pathways affected. Both in mSBC and hPBBC, IL-4 activated Myc, the transcriptional machinery itself, cell cycle, mitochondria and respiratory chain, ribosome, proteasome and antigen presentation, and Wnt signaling, and inhibited GPCR signaling. However, significant differences were found in histone demethylation, Nod signaling, and Rho signaling, which were downregulated in mSBC, and in chromatin condensation, which was downregulated in hPBBC. These findings may have therapeutic implications for the treatment of allergic diseases and parasitic infections.",

     "abstract": "Herbal medicine is mainly prepared from boiling herbal water extracts. Many epoch-making immunosuppressant drugs, such as glycyrrhizic acid (old example) and FTY720 (current example), were developed from herbal secondary metabolites in the boiling water extract by partition with organic solvents. However, few immunostimulants have been discovered by this method. Instead of the usual method, we aimed to find a novel immunostimulant component by two unique methods in the research of herbal medicine: ultracentrifugation and electron microscopy. The immunostimulant was not a secondary metabolite, as expected, but the structure was a nanoparticle formed by a polysaccharide. In addition, we clarified the immune effect of the nanoparticle. Intake of the nanoparticle by phagocytosis resulted in immunostimulant effects by increasing the genes and proteins of inflammatory cytokines in macrophage cells. The immunostimulant effects were inhibited by a phagocytosis inhibitor, cytochalasin D. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to describe the discovery of a nanoparticle in boiling herbal water extracts and its immunostimulant properties. This study will provide additional understanding of the efficacy of herbal medicine, in that the immunostimulant nanoparticle universally exists in boiling herbal water extracts. Thus, traditional herbal medicine may be an oldest known nanomedicine. Furthermore, this study suggests that the immunostimulant nanoparticle simply can be obtained from herbal medicine only by ultracentrifugation. We hope that this simple strategy will substantially contribute to drug development, including vaccine adjuvant, in the future.",

It is well-known that ATP-binding cassette transporter sub-family G2 (ABCG2) is highly expressed in cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs possess the ability for differentiation, tumorigenesis, stem cell self-renewal, and the efflux of anti-cancer drug and these abilities affect malignancy of cancer cells. However, little is known about the relationship between the expression of ABCG2 and malignancy of cancer cells. The present study aimed at understanding the regulatory mechanism underlying 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-induced cell proliferation under the control of ABCG2. E2 increased cell viability with a peak at 1\u202f\u03bcM and facilitated ABCG2 mRNA expression followed by the increase of ABCG2 expression level at plasma membrane. E2-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by reserpine, an inhibitor of ABCG2, and the ABCG2 siRNA treatment. Thus, these results imply that ABCG2 plays an important role in the promotion of E2-induced cell proliferation in Ishikawa cells.",

After 2 days, we administered cultured MSCs from bone marrow of GFP-transgenic rats (0.8\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 cells, n\u202f=\u202f10) or vehicle (controls, n\u202f=\u202f10) to adventitial sites of the injured arteries.

Local vascular MSC administration significantly prevented neointimal hyperplasia (intima/media ratio) and reduced the percentage of Ki67\u202f+ proliferating cells in arterial walls by 14 days after treatment, despite little evidence of long-term MSC engraftment. Notably, systemic MSC infusion did not alter neointimal formation. By immunohistochemistry, compared with neointimal cells of controls, cells in MSC-treated arteries expressed reduced levels of embryonic myosin heavy chain and RM-4, an inflammatory cell marker. In the presence of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), conditioned medium from MSCs increased p27 protein levels and significantly attenuated VSMC proliferation in culture. Furthermore, MSC-conditioned medium suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and RM-4 in PDGF-BB-treated VSMCs. Thus, perivascular administration of MSCs may improve restenosis after vascular injury through paracrine effects that modulate VSMC inflammatory phenotype.",

Recent studies suggested that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) secrete many cytokines, which are important in wound healing. In this study, we investigated the effect of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells conditioned media (USC-CM) in cutaneous wound healing and collagen synthesis. We found that USC-CM has many useful growth factors associated with skin rejuvenation, such as Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF), basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Collagen type 1, and especially, one of the rejuvenation factors, the growth differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11). Our in vitro results showed that USC-CM stimulate growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production of Human Dermal Fibroblasts (HDFs) compared to those of other MSCs conditioned media (CM) from different origins. Moreover, we evaluated the roles of GDF-11. The results showed that GDF-11 accelerates growth, migration and ECM production of HDFs. Our In vivo results showed that topical treatment of USC-CM showed anti-wrinkle effect and significantly increased dermal density in women. In conclusion, USC-CM has various useful growth factors including GDF-11 that can stimulate skin rejuvenation by increasing growth and ECM production of HDFs.",

Control of the protein stability of the membrane, as well as nuclear receptors, has been known to be an important process affecting tumor cells; however, their relationships have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that estradiol promotes rapid degradation of HER3 via the proteasome pathway in ER-positive breast cancer, MCF-7. ER prevented HER3 degradation, and knockdown of ER expression by si-RNA promoted rapid degradation of HER3. Breakdown of HER3 and ER were regulated by a ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 in the presence of estradiol stimulation. We speculate that estradiol quickly degrades ER, making HER3 accessible by Nedd4-1, and leads to the rapid degradation of HER3. In addition, knockdown of ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-1 enhances estradiol induced cell proliferation. These results indicate that HER3 and Nedd4-1 in ER-positive breast cancers might be an important therapeutic target.",

The mechanism(s) of bone loss in SCD subjects has not been fully investigated, and there are no targeted therapies to prevent or treat compromised bone health in this population. Recent studies showed that depletion of gut microbiota with antibiotics significantly reduced the number of aged neutrophils, thereby dramatically improved the inflammation-related organ damages in SCD mice. Since neutrophils, abundantly present in bone marrow (BM), regulate bone cells, and BM neutrophils, induced by inflammatory cytokines, are associated with a low number of osteoblasts (OBs), we hypothesize that neutrophil aging in the BM of SCD mice impairs OB function. Flow cytometry analysis showed BM neutrophil aging was significantly increased in SCD mice that was reduced with antibiotic treatment. In vitro co-culture of calvarial OBs from control (Ctrl) mice with BM neutrophils from Ctrl or SCD mice showed that BM neutrophils from SCD mice inhibit OB function but was rescued when neutrophils were from antibiotic-treated SCD mice. In summary, there is an accumulation of aged neutrophils in BM from SCD mice that may contribute to impaired OB function, and antibiotic treatment is able to partially rescue impaired OB function by decreasing neutrophil aging in the BM of SCD mice.",

The deaminase APOBEC3B is expressed in these cancers and causes mutations under replication stress; however, the mechanisms by which APOBEC3B mediates deamination and its association with genomic disorders are still unclear. Here, we show that APOBEC3B is stabilized to induce deamination reaction in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), resulting in the formation of long-lasting DSBs. Uracil, the major deamination product, is subsequently targeted by base excision repair (BER) through uracil-DNA glycosylase 2 (UNG2); hence late-onset DSBs arise as by-products of BER. The frequency of these delayed DSBs was increased by treatment of cells with a PARP inhibitor, and was suppressed following knock-down of UNG2. The late-onset DSBs were induced in an ATR-dependent manner. Those secondary DSBs were persistent, unlike DSBs directly caused by \u03b3-ray irradiation. Overall, these results suggest that the deaminase APOBEC3B is induced in response to DSBs, leading to long-lasting DSB formation in addition to mutagenic 5me-C>T transition induction.",

     "abstract": "Many membrane proteins exist and function as oligomers or protein complexes. Routine analytical methods involve extraction and solubilization of the proteins with detergents, which could disturb their actual oligomeric state. AcrB is a trimeric inner membrane multidrug transporter in E. coli. In previous studies, we created a mutant AcrBP223G, which behaves like a monomer when extracted from the cell membrane. However, the actual oligomeric state of AcrBP223G in cell membranes remained unclear, which complicated the interpretation of the mechanism by which the mutation affects function. Here we used several complementary methods to determine the oligomeric state of AcrBP223G in E. coli cell membranes. Two sets of quantitative fluorescent techniques were exploited. For these, we created fluorescent tagged AcrB, AcrB-CFP and AcrB-YPet. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) were employed to characterize independently the efficiency of energy transfer between co-expressed AcrB-CFP and AcrB-YPet, and the diffusion coefficient of AcrB-YPet and AcrBP223G-YPet in live E. coli cells. Second, we introduced Cys pairs at the inter-subunit interface and used controlled oxidation to probe inter-subunit distances. The results from all studies converge on the conclusion that AcrBP223G exists as a trimer in cell membranes, which dissociates during the purification steps. The small change in trimer affinity and structure leads to a significant loss of AcrB activity. In addition, throughout this study we developed protocols and established benchmark values, useful for further studies on membrane protein associations in cell membranes.",

Accumulating clinical evidence supports that DCLK1 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and is an important prognostic marker in various human cancers. However, the mechanism, by which DCLK1 causes oncogenesis, is not yet elucidated. In this study, we showed that DCLK1 empowers human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells to form spheres under floating condition in serum-free medium, which are reminiscent of mammospheres formed by mammary epithelial stem cells. We demonstrated that DCLK1 causes chromatin instability in MCF10A cells. DCLK1 impairs DNA repairs in human colon cancer HCT116 and lung cancer H1299 cells. The kinase-negative DCLK1 mutant and the mutant that is not associated with microtubules compromise DNA repair.

Surprisingly, however, it binds only to the structural C-terminal domain of cTnC (cCTnC), and not to the regulatory N-terminal domain (cNTnC) that determines the calcium sensitivity of cardiac muscle.Physiologically, cTnC is always bound to cardiac troponin I (cTnI), so we examined its interaction with MCI-154 in the presence of two soluble constructs, cTnI1\u201377 and cTnI135\u2013209, which contain all of the segments of cTnI known to interact with cTnC. Neither the cTnC-cTnI1\u201377 complex nor the cTnC-cTnI135\u2013209 complex binds to MCI-154. Since residues 39\u201360 of cTnI are known to bind tightly to the cCTnC domain to form a structured core that is invariant throughout the cardiac cycle, we conclude that MCI-154 does not bind to cTnC when it is part of the intact cardiac troponin complex.

Previously, we have shown that not only wild-type LEF-1 but also LEF-1 lacking the amino-terminal \u03b2-catenin\u2013binding region can induce EMT, suggesting that LEF-1 acts independently of \u03b2-catenin. Because it has been reported that LEF-1 interacts with \u03b2-catenin outside the amino-terminal domain, namely, in the middle part of the molecule, the possible participation of \u03b2-catenin has not been formally ruled out. To determine the involvement of \u03b2-catenin in the LEF-1\u2013induced EMT, we produced MDCK cells with a deletion of the \u03b2-catenin gene and then expressed LEF-1 in the cells. We found that LEF-1 induced EMT in those cells. In the absence of \u03b2-catenin, \u03b3-catenin has been shown to take over the role of \u03b2-catenin. To examine this possibility, we first established MDCK cells with a double knockout of \u03b2-catenin and \u03b3-catenin genes and then expressed LEF-1 in these cells. We found that LEF-1 can induce EMT in these cells; therefore, we conclude that neither \u03b2-catenin nor \u03b3-catenin expression is necessary for the LEF-1\u2013mediated induction of EMT.",

However, little information is available about whether maternal exercises during pregnancy protect the offspring from infectious diseases, such as sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). This study aimed to investigate whether maternal exercise training protects the offspring from endotoxin-induced septic shock in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice performed voluntary wheel exercises during pregnancy. All dams and offspring were fed normal chow with sedentary activity during lactation and after weaning. At 10-week-old, mice were intraperitoneally injected a lethal (30\u202fmg/kg) or nonlethal (15\u202fmg/kg) dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), following which the survival of mice that were administered a lethal dose was monitored for 60\u202fh. Plasma, lung, and liver samples were collected 18\u202fh after the injection to evaluate the cytokine concentration or mRNA expression from those administered a nonlethal dose. Although maternal exercise training could not prevent lethality during an LPS-induced septic shock, it significantly inhibited the LPS-induced loss of body weight in female offspring. Regular maternal exercise significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of the LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), in the plasma and liver. Thus, maternal exercise inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response in female offspring, suggesting that regular exercise during pregnancy could be a potential candidate of the onset of sepsis and MODS in offspring.",

In this work, we describe production, purification and properties of anti-\u03b1- and anti-\u03b2-enolase polyclonal antibodies. To raise antibodies, rabbits were injected with enolase isoenzymes that were purified from human kidney (\u03b1-enolase) and skeletal muscle (\u03b2-enolase). Selective anti-\u03b1- and anti-\u03b2-enolase antibodies were obtained by affinity chromatography on either \u03b1- or \u03b2-enolase-Sepharose columns. On Western blots, antibodies directed against human \u03b2-enolase, did not react with human \u03b1-isoenzyme, but recognized pig and rat \u03b2-enolase. To determine what makes these antibodies selective bioinformatic tools were used to predict conformational epitopes for both enolase isoenzymes. Three predicted epitopes were mapped to the same regions in both \u03b1- and \u03b2-enolase. Peptides corresponding to predicted epitopes were synthesized and tested against purified antibodies. One of the pin-attached peptides representing \u03b1-enolase epitope (the C-terminal portion of the epitope 3 - S262PDDPSRYISPDQ273) reacted with anti-\u03b1-enolase, while the other also derived from the \u03b1-enolase sequence (epitope 2 - N193VIKEKYGKDATN205) was recognized by anti-\u03b2-enolase antibodies. Interestingly, neither anti-\u03b1- nor anti-\u03b2-antibody reacted with a peptide corresponding to the epitope 2 in \u03b2-enolase (G194VIKAKYGKDATN206). Further analysis showed that substitution of E197 with A in \u03b1-enolase epitope 2 peptide lead to 70% loss of immunological activity, while replacement of A198 with E in peptide representing \u03b2-enolase epitope 2, caused 67% increase in immunological activity. Our results suggest that E197 is essential for preserving immunologically active conformation in epitope 2 peptidic homolog, while it is not crucial for this epitope's antigenic activity in native \u03b2-enolase.",

     "abstract": "After a traumatic insult, macrophages can become activated leading to general inflammation at the site of injury. Activated macrophages are partially regulated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) which when activated suppresses inflammation by limiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting the over expression of immuno-modulatory mediators. This study aims to determine whether the low molecular weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF5A) and N-acetyl kynurenine (NAK), an N-acetyl tryptophan (NAT) breakdown product in LMWF5A, can regulate inflammation by inhibiting macrophage activation through the AhR since kynurenine is a known AhR agonist. Using LCMS, we demonstrate that NAT is non-enzymatically degraded during accelerated aging of LMWF5A with high heat accelerating degradation. More importantly, NAK is a major degradation product found in LMWF5A. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and pre-treated with 2-fold dilutions of LMWF5A or synthetic NAK with or without an AhR antagonist (CH223191) prior to overnight stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Treatment with LMWF5A caused a 50\u201370% decrease in IL-6 release throughout the dilution series. A dose-response inhibition of IL-6 release was observed for NAK with maximal inhibition (50%) seen at the highest NAK concentration. Finally, an AhR antagonist partially blocked the anti-inflammatory effect of LMWF5A while completely blocking the effect of NAK. A similar inhibitory effect was observed for CXCL-10, but the AhR antagonist was not effective suggesting additional mechanisms for CXCL-10 release. These preliminary findings suggest that LMWF5A and NAK partially promote the suppression of activated macrophages via the AhR receptor. Therefore, LMWF5A, which contains NAK, is potentially a useful therapeutic in medical conditions where inflammation is prevalent such as trauma, sepsis, and wound healing.",

We also examined other Ph+ ALL cells, MR87 and its IMT-resistant subline, MR87/STIR. IMT induced apoptosis of NphA2 and MR87 but had no effect on resistant sublines.

Moreover, NphA2 and MR87 and their IMT-resistant sublines were sensitive to ABT-199, a specific BCL2 inhibitor. The combination of SP600125 and ABT-199 synergistically suppressed both parental and IMT-resistant cells, including one with T315I mutation, suggesting that Ph+ ALL exhibits high sensitivity to ABT-199 and SP600125 regardless of TKI resistance.

In this study, we used kinetic and thermodynamic analyses of the antibody\u2013antigen interaction to investigate the molecular mechanism by which an antibody with introduced charged residues recognizes its antigen with higher affinity. The introduction of basic amino acid residues resulted in improvement of the affinity whereas the introduction of acidic residues weakened the interaction. For two mutant antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) with improved affinity (named K5- and R5-mutants), the balance between the association rate constant kon and the dissociation rate constant koff was distinct despite each mutant having the same number of charged residues. Moreover, thermodynamic analysis of the interactions in the transition state revealed a difference between the K5- and R5-mutants in terms of enthalpic energy change following formation of the encounter complex with the antigen. These results suggest that the affinity of the K5- and R5-mutants is improved by distinct mechanisms. Although the mutations destabilize the Fab and necessitate further studies, our strategy is expected to become a versatile and simple means to improve the affinity of antibodies to their antigens.",

Although diagnostic technologies and therapeutic techniques have progressed, the survival rate of patients with OSCC is still 60%, whereas the incidence rate has increased. Podocalyxin (PODXL) is a highly glycosylated type I transmembrane protein that is detected in normal tissues such as heart, breast, and pancreas as well as in many cancers, including lung, renal, breast, colorectal, and oral cancers. This glycoprotein is associated with the progression, metastasis, and poor outcomes of oral cancers. PODXL overexpression was strongly detected using our previously established anti-PODXL monoclonal antibody (mAb), PcMab-47, and its mouse IgG2a-type, 47-mG2a. In previous studies, we also generated PODXL-knock out (PODXL-KO) cell lines using SAS OSCC cell lines, in order to investigate the function of PODXL in the proliferation of oral cancer cells. The growth of SAS/PODXL-KO cell lines was observed to be lower than that of parental SAS cells. For this study, PODXL-KO OSCC cell lines were generated using HSC-2 cells, and the role of PODXL in the growth of OSCC cell lines in vitro was assessed. Decreased growth was observed for HSC-2/PODXL-KO cells compared with HSC-2 parental cells. The influence of PODXL on tumor growth of OSCC was also investigated in vivo, and both the tumor volume and the tumor weight were observed to be significantly lower for HSC-2/PODXL-KO than that for HSC-2 parental cells.

Antifertility activity 51% and 37.2% was exhibited by Alcoholic extracts of Piper betle (Petiole) APB and Aqueous extracts of Piper betle (Petiole) WPB respectively. After 21 days of the extracts free period, the antifertility effect of the extracts was reversed. The extract treatment with APB, an increase in the percentage of resorption index indicates the failure in development of embryo. The mean percentage of anti-implantation and abortifacient were found to be highest for APB-38.45%, WPB 13.62, and APB-28.96%, WPB-12.75% respectively. The decrement in implantation caused by the extracts may be due to estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity. However, along with standard APB exhibiting more potent estrogenic and less potent anti-estrogenic when compared with standard. Female antifertility agents should include acceptability, safety and efficacy during and after the treatment. The above results revealed the potential, reversible female antifertility effect of alcoholic extract Piper betle (Petiole).",

The major goal of our studies was to examine the impact of norepinephrine on metabolism related gene expression in obesity in vivo. Interestingly, we discovered that norepinephrine had a detrimental effect in our studies.C57BL6/J mice fed a high fat diet were intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 or 2\u202fmg/kg/day norepinephrine. These doses of norepinephrine have been used previously by other researchers. Survival of the mice was documented. Kidney and bladder tissues were excised and fixed for histological studies.A subset of norepinephrine treated mice experienced unexpected adverse events which included bladder distension and reduced kidney perfusion as suggested by kidney discolouration. This eventuated in the mice having to be sacrificed or the mice succumbed to the pathological condition. To our knowledge, such an effect of norepinephrine has not been previously reported in mice. Morphological examination of kidney and bladder indicated marked detrimental architectural changes, which we postulate is associated with norepinephrine induced vasoconstriction, urinary retention and renal impairment.Our studies highlight that administration of norepinephrine to mice may trigger adverse effects relating predominantly to the urogenital tract which can result in decline in a subpopulation of these mice. Researchers administering norepinephrine in mouse models should be aware and look out for these unexpected adverse events associated with the use of norepinephrine.",

Here, we explored the relation between cell death and autophagy by examining granulosa cell layers that control oocyte quality, which is important for the success of fertilization. Granulosa cell layers were collected from infertile women and morphologically divided into four types, viz., mature (MCCs), immature (ICCs), and dysmature cumulus cells (DCCs), and mural granulosa cells (MGCs). Microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), which is involved in autophagosome formation, was expressed excessively in DCCs and MGCs, and their chromosomal DNA was highly fragmented. However, autophagy initiation was limited to MGCs, as indicated by the expression of membrane-bound LC3-II and autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7), an enzyme that converts LC3-I to LC3-II. Although pro-LC3 was accumulated, autophagy was disabled in DCCs, resulting in cell death. Our results suggest the possibility that autophagy-independent accumulation of pro-LC3 proteins leads to the death of human granulosa cells surrounding the oocytes and presumably reduces oocyte quality and female fertility.",

Amygdalin, a cyanogenic diglycoside is commonly administered for cancer with other CAM therapies like vitamins and seeds of fruits like apricots and bitter almonds, due to its ability to hydrolyse to hydrogen cyanide (HCN), benzaldehyde and glucose. Over the years, several cases of cyanide toxicity on ingestion have been documented. In-vitro and in-vivo studies using various doses and modes of administration, like IV administration studies that showed no HCN formation, point to the role played by the gut microbiota for the commonly seen poisoning on consumption. The anaerobic Bacteriodetes phylum found in the gut has a high \u03b2-glucosidase activity needed for amygdalin hydrolysis to HCN. However, there are certain conditions under which these HCN levels rise to cause toxicity. Case studies have shown toxicity on ingestion of variable doses of amygdalin and no HCN side-effects on consumption of high doses. This review shows how factors like probiotic and prebiotic consumption, other CAM therapies, obesity, diet, age and the like, that alter gut consortium, are responsible for the varying conditions under which toxicity occurs and can be further studied to set-up conditions for safe oral doses. It also indicates ways to delay or quickly treat cyanide toxicity due to oral administration and, reviews conflicts on amygdalin's anti-cancer abilities, dose levels, mode of administration and pharmacokinetics that have hindered its official acceptance at a therapeutic level.",

UVB-induced ROS have been associated with inflammation, cytotoxicity, cell death, or DNA damage in human keratinocytes. However, the source and the role of UVB-induced ROS remain undefined.Here, we show that Nox1 is involved in UVB-induced p38/MAPK activation and cytotoxicity via ROS generation in keratinocytes. Nox1 knockdown or inhibitor decreased UVB-induced ROS production in human keratinocytes. Nox1 knockdown impaired UVB-induced p38 activation, accompanied by reduced IL-6 levels and attenuated cell toxicity. Treatment of cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a potent ROS scavenger, suppressed p38 activation as well as consequent IL-6 production and cytotoxicity in response to UVB exposure. p38 inhibitor also suppressed UVB-induced IL-6 production and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the blockade of IL-6 production by IL-6 neutralizing antibody reduced UVB-induced cell toxicity.In vivo assay using wild-type mice, the intradermal injection of lysates from UVB-irradiated control cells, but not from UVB-irradiated Nox1 knockdown cells, induced inflammatory swelling and IL-6 production in the skin of ears. Moreover, administration of Nox1 inhibitor suppressed UVB-induced increase in IL-6 mRNA expression in mice skin.Collectively, these data suggest that Nox1-mediated ROS production is required for UVB-induced cytotoxicity and inflammation through p38 activation and inflammatory cytokine production, such as IL-6. Thus, our findings suggest Nox1 as a therapeutic target for cytotoxicity and inflammation in response to UVB exposure.",

Because a previous study reported that silibinin hinders clathlin-mediated endocytosis (CME), we aimed to test whether silibinin inhibits the entry of HBV into hepatocytes. Using HepG2-NTCP-C4 cells, which overexpress sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), it was shown that silibinin inhibited HBV infection dose-dependently. Similar effects were observed using human primary hepatocytes (PXB-cells). Additionally, a combination of silibinin and entecavir reduced HBV DNA in the culture supernatant more than either mono-treatment alone in HepG2-NTCP-C4 cells that had already been infected with HBV. Silibinin decreased transferrin uptake but did not affect the interaction between the HBV envelope and NTCP, suggesting that silibinin might inhibit HBV infection by hindering CME. In conclusion, this study showed that silibinin inhibits HBV entry in vitro.",

Moreover, for the first time, the BPH model was a totally physiological using naturally aged rats with spontaneous, age-related BPH instead of the pharmacologically induced models usually used. Eighteen male Wistar rats were distributed according to their age: 6 weeks (young), 12 weeks (adult) and 12 months (old) old. Prostate gland was removed and analyzed by mini-arrays, Western blotting (WB) and SAW techniques. Mini-arrays indicated that there were significant differences in the expression of 29/34 inflammation-related cytokines. WB was carried out to confirm the results after selection of 4 cytokines from which one showed no changes, namely PDGF-AA, and the other three, which significantly increase in older animals, were CD86, \u03b2-NGF and VEGF. Notwithstanding, WB of old rats yielded confusing results due to an anomalous migration of proteins, dismissing this technique as an useful tool in these animals. Accurate results in old rats were uniquely obtained by using the SAW technique. Thus, SAW analysis showed that there were not differences among groups in the amount of PDGF-AA. On the contrary, SAW analysis showed that amounts of CD86, \u03b2-NGF and VEGF in old rats were 2.0, 1.9 and 5.7-fold higher than that from young ones, respectively. These results indicate that SAW is a highly accurate technique for determining changes in the cytokines expression in BPH.",

The gene had a partial nucleotide sequence of 968\u202fbp and encoded a protein of 222 aa residues with a molecular weight and isoelectric point of 25.13\u202fkDa and 4.17, respectively. Its catalytic site was located in the active site domain. BLASTp analysis showed that the protein primary sequence of the \u03b1-amylase gene had 98% and 99% homologies with the \u03b1-amylase of A. niger and A. oryzae RIB40, respectively. The gene is more closely related to \u03b1-amylase genes from fungi than to bacterial, plant, or animal \u03b1-amylase genes. Restriction mapping of the gene showed it can be digested with restriction enzymes like NcoI, PstI, SmaI, and BcLI among others but not with EcoRI and EcoRV. Its protein product had a hydrophobicity score of \u2212\u202f0.43 but no transmembrane helix. The CDF_Amyl protein was subcellularly localized in the secretory pathway, an indication of its release into extracellular space after secretion. Also, the 3D structure of the CDF-Amyl protein was barrel-shaped with domains characteristic of \u03b1-amylases. The encoded \u03b1-amylase Vmax is 6.90 U/mg protein and Km is 6.70\u202fmg/ml.

Various genetic and environmental factors can influence the level of PGE2 and increase the risk of developing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We have previously shown that in neuronal cell lines and mouse brain, PGE2 can interfere with the Wnt canonical pathway, which is essential during early brain development. Higher levels of PGE2 increased Wnt-dependent motility and proliferation of neuroectodermal stem cells, and modified the expression of Wnt genes previously linked to autism disorders. We also recently established a cross-talk between these two pathways in the prenatal mouse brain lacking PGE2 producing enzyme (COX-/-). The current study complements the published data and reveals that PGE2 signaling also converges with the Wnt canonical pathway in the developing mouse brain after maternal exposure to PGE2 at the onset of neurogenesis. We found significant changes in the expression level of Wnt-target genes, Mmp7, Wnt2, and Wnt3a, during prenatal and early postnatal stages. Interestingly, we observed variability in the expression level of these genes between genetically-identical pups within the same pregnancy. Furthermore, we found that all the affected genes have been previously associated with disorders of the central nervous system, including autism. We determined that prenatal exposure to PGE2 affects the Wnt pathway at the level of \u03b2-catenin, the major downstream regulator of Wnt-dependent gene transcription. We\u00a0discuss how these results add new knowledge into the molecular mechanisms by which PGE2 may interfere with neuronal development during critical periods.",

The binding of TDP-43 to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA is involved in transcriptional repression, regulation of RNA splicing, and RNA stabilization. Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of TDP-43 and ssDNA or RNA have been determined using various methods; however, methods that can measure Kd with high sensitivity in a short time using a small amount of TDP-43 in solution would be advantageous. Here, in order to determine the Kd of TDP-43 and fluorescence-labeled ssDNA as well as the binding stoichiometry, we use fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), which detects the slowed diffusion of molecular interactions in solution with single-molecule sensitivity, in addition to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Using tandem affinity chromatography of TDP-43 dually tagged with glutathione-S-transferase and poly-histidine tags, highly purified protein was obtained. FCS successfully detected specific interaction between purified TDP-43 and TG ssDNA repeats, with a Kd in the nanomolar range. The Kd of the TDP-43 mutant was not different from the wild type, although mutant oligomers, which did not bind ssDNA, were observed. Analysis of the fluorescence brightness per dimerized TDP-43/ssDNA complex was used to evaluate their binding stoichiometry. The results suggest that an assay combining FCS and EMSA can precisely analyze ssDNA recognition mechanisms, and that FCS may be applied for the rapid and quantitative determination of the interaction strength between TDP-43 and ssDNA or RNA. These methods will aid in the elucidation of the substrate recognition mechanism of ALS- and FTLD-associated variants of TDP-43.",

PODXL is expressed in some types of human cancer tissues including oral, breast, and lung cancer tissues and may promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. We previously produced PcMab-47, a novel anti-PODXL monoclonal antibody (mAb) which reacts with endogenous PODXL-expressing cancer cell lines and normal cells independently of glycosylation in Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis. In this study, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical analysis to determine the epitope of PcMab-47. The minimum epitope of PcMab-47 was found to be Asp207, His208, Leu209, and Met210. A blocking peptide containing this minimum epitope completely neutralized PcMab-47 reaction against oral cancer cells by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis. These findings could lead to the production of more functional anti-PODXL mAbs, which are advantageous for antitumor activities.",

Accordingly, creating healthy culture conditions to support 3D cardiac tissues requires an appropriate balance between the supplied nutrients and cell metabolism. The objective of this study was to develop a simple and efficient method for low-temperature cultivation (< 37\u202f\u00b0C) that decreases cell metabolism for facilitating the buildup of 3D cardiac tissues. We created 3D cardiac tissues using cell sheet technology and analyzed the viability of the cardiac cells in low-temperature environments. To determine a method that would allow thicker 3D tissues to survive, we investigated the cardiac tissue viability under low-temperature culture processes at 20\u201333.5\u202f\u00b0C and compared it with the viability under the standard culture process at 37\u202f\u00b0C. Our results indicated that the standard culture process at 37\u202f\u00b0C was unable to support higher-density myocardial tissue; however, low-temperature culture conditions maintained dense myocardial tissue and prevascularization. To investigate the efficiency of transplantation, layered cell sheets produced by the low-temperature culture process were also transplanted under the skin of nude rats. Cardiac tissue cultured at 30\u202f\u00b0C developed denser prevascular networks than the tissue cultured at the standard temperature. Our novel findings indicate that the low-temperature process is effective for fabricating 3D tissues from high-functioning cells such as heart cells.

We have shown that when cholesterol is present in lipid vesicles, kinetics of A\u03b2 nuclei formation is moderately hindered while that of fibril growth was considerably accelerated. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7keto slightly enhanced the formation of A\u03b2-42 nuclei and remarkably decreased fibril elongation, thus maintaining the peptide in protofibrillar aggregates, which are reportedly the most toxic species.

Our findings demonstrate that hypoxic exosomes induce differential gene expression in recipient glioma cells. Glioma cells stimulated with hypoxic exosomes showed a marked upregulation of small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 116\u201321 (SNORD116-21) transcript among others while significantly downregulated the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 3 (KCNJ3) message. This differential expression of certain genes is governed by the protein cargo being transferred via exosomes. Additionally, compared to normoxic exosomes, hypoxic exosomes increased various angiogenic related parameters vis-\u00e0-vis, overall tube length, branching intervals and length of isolated branches studied in tube formation assay with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). Thus, the intercellular communication facilitated via exosomes secreted from hypoxic GBM cells induce marked changes in the expression of genes in neighboring normoxic tumor cells and possibly in surrounding stromal cells, many of which are involved in cancer progression and treatment resistance mechanisms.",

The electrostatic force between the protein and nucleic acids dominates the binding interaction at neutral pH. In contrast, nucleic acid interaction with the incipient nonpolar groups exposed from the structured region of the prion protein dominates the reaction at pH 5. Prion protein of a particular species forms larger complexes with prion protein mRNA pseudoknots of the same species.

This paper describes a new and environmentally friendly process for developing biodiesel production technology from feather waste produced in poultry industry. Transesterification is one of the well-known processes by which fats and oils are converted into biodiesel. The reaction often makes use of acid/base catalyst. If the material possesses high free fatty acid then acid catalyst gives better results. The data resulted from gas chromatography (GC) revealed these percentages for fatty acid compositions: myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. The biodiesel function group was analyzed by using FTIR. This study concluded that the rooster feathers have superior potential to process them into biodiesel than broiler chicken feathers fat because of fatty acid composition values and it has important properties of biodiesel.",

It is widely known that a mutation in T3SS does not impair bacterial growth, thereby avoiding any subsequent development of resistance. Thus, T3SS is expected to be a candidate therapeutic target. While developing the T3SS screening method, we discovered that sanguinarine chloride, a natural compound, could decrease the production of the SPI-1 type III secretion system main virulence proteins SipA and SipB and prevent the invasion of HeLa cells by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium without affecting the growth of Salmonella. Furthermore, sanguinarine chloride downregulated the transcription of HilA and consequently regulated the expression of the SPI-1 apparatus and effector genes.

In a previous study, we reported that both pH- and long chain fatty acid-induced conformational changes can alter the interactive binding of ligands to the two principal binding sites of HSA, namely, site I and site II. In the present study, the effect of metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) caused by ascorbate/oxygen/trace metals on HSA structure and the interactive binding between dansyl-L-asparagine (DNSA; a site I ligand) and ibuprofen (a site II ligand) at pH 6.5 was investigated. MCO was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in carbonyl content in HSA, suggesting that the HSA was being oxidized. In addition, The MCO of HSA was accompanied by a change in net charge to a more negative charge and a decrease in thermal stability. SDS-PAGE patterns and \u03b1-helical contents of the oxidized HSAs were similar to those of native HSA, indicating that the HSA had not been extensively structurally modified by MCO. MCO also caused a selective decrease in ibuprofen binding. In spite of the changes in the HSA structure and ligand that bind to site II, no change in the interactive binding between DNSA and ibuprofen was observed. These data indicated that amino acid residues in site II are preferentially oxidized by MCO, whereas the spatial relationship between sites I and II (e.g. the distance between sites), the flexibility or space of each binding site are not altered. The present findings provide insights into the structural characteristics of oxidized HSA, and drug binding and drug-drug interactions on oxidized HSA.",

Of the several mechanisms, Guided Entry of Tail-anchored protein (GET) pathway plays a major role in TA protein targeting. Many in silico and in vivo analyses are geared to identify TA proteins and their targeting mechanisms in different systems including Arabidopsis thaliana. Yet, crop plants that grow in specific and/or different conditions are not investigated for the presence of TA proteins and GET pathway. This study majorly investigates GET pathway in two crop plants, Oryza sativa subsp.

Indica and Solanum tuberosum respectively and their localization with respect to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and chloroplast has been delineated. Similarly, the associated GET proteins are identified (Get1, Get3 and Get4) and their structural inferences are elucidated using homology modelling. Get3 models are based on yeast Get3. The cytoplasmic Get3 from O. sativa is identified to be very similar to yeast Get3 with conserved P-loop and TA binding groove. Three cytoplasmic Get3s are identified for S. tuberosum. Taken together, this is the first study to identify TA proteins and GET components in Oryza sativa subsp.

The composition of these Nf-containing hetero-aggregates (NCH) may change in systemic or organ-specific pathologies, providing the basis to develop novel disease biomarkers. We have tested ultracentrifugation (UC) and a commercially available protein aggregate binder, Seprion PAD-Beads (SEP), for the enrichment of NCH from plasma of healthy individuals, and then characterised the Nf content of the aggregate fractions using gel electrophoresis and their proteome by mass spectrometry (MS). Western blot analysis of fractions obtained by UC showed that among Nf isoforms, neurofilament heavy chain (NfH) was found within SDS-stable high molecular weight aggregates. Shotgun proteomics of aggregates obtained with both extraction techniques identified mostly cell structural and to a lesser extent extra-cellular matrix proteins, while functional analysis revealed pathways involved in inflammatory response, phagosome and prion-like protein behaviour.

Whereas contemporary molecular techniques are capable of identifying biomarkers associated with cancer, surgical interventions are required to biopsy tissue. The common imaging alternative, positron-emission tomography (PET), involves the use of nuclear material which poses some risks. Novel, non-invasive techniques to assess the degree to which tissues express malignant properties are now needed. Recent developments in biophoton research have made it possible to discriminate cancerous cells from normal cells both in vitro and in vivo. The current study expands upon a growing body of literature where we classified and characterized malignant and non-malignant cell types according to their biophotonic activity. Using wavelength-exclusion filters, we demonstrate that ratios between infrared and ultraviolet photon emissions differentiate cancer and non-cancer cell types. Further, we identified photon sources associated with three filters (420-nm, 620-nm., and 950-nm) which classified cancer and non-cancer cell types. The temporal increases in biophoton emission within these wavelength bandwidths is shown to be coupled with intrisitic biomolecular events using Cosic's resonant recognition model. Together, the findings suggest that the use of wavelength-exclusion filters in biophotonic measurement can be employed to detect cancer in vitro.",

Here, we analyzed AQP11-null kidneys at the beginning of cyst formation by quantitative proteomic analysis using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT). Among ~ 1200 identified proteins, 124 proteins were differently expressed by > 1.5 or < 0.8 fold change. A pancreatic stone inhibitor or a growth factor, lithostathine-1 (Reg1) was most enhanced by 5 folds which was confirmed by western blot, while mitochondria-related proteins were downregulated. The identified proteins will be new target molecules for the treatment of proximal tubular cysts and helpful to explore the functional roles of AQP11 in the kidney.",

The present investigation was undertaken with an aim to identify and characterize pigment from actinomycetes. Actinomycetes were isolated from rhizosphere soil samples collected from different regions of Madhya Pradesh state. Out of 85 actinomycetes, only 5 actinomycetes showed pigment production and based on diffusible pigment production ability one actinomycete ARITM02 was selected. The extraction of pigment was done by solvent extraction method using methanol and purified by TLC and column chromatography. The pigment was characterized by UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy which showed the lamda maximum of 277.44. FTIR spectroscopy suggested various functional groups like amino group, amide group, hydroxide, benzene and lactone group. The Mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy showed that the molecular mass of pigment is 621.7 and molecular formula is C34H43N3O8. The pigment was also tested for Antimicrobial activity against broad spectrum human pathogens, antioxidant test and toxicity test for safe use as a natural colorant in cosmetic, food, pharmaceutical and textile industries.

Neutralization of CCL17 by antibody treatment ameliorates the impact of disease by blocking influx of T cells. Monoclonal antibody M116 derived from a combinatorial library shows potency in neutralizing CCL17-induced signaling. To gain insight into the structural determinants of antigen recognition, the crystal structure of M116 Fab was determined in complex with CCL17 and in the unbound form. Comparison of the structures revealed an unusual induced-fit mechanism of antigen recognition that involves cis-trans isomerization in two CDRs. The structure of the CCL17-M116 complex revealed the antibody binding epitope, which does not overlap with the putative receptor epitope, suggesting that the current model of chemokine-receptor interactions, as observed in the CXCR4-vMIP-II system, may not be universal.",

In this context, Zo-peroxidase (ZoPrx) a member of the class III peroxidases and secreted by plants, differs from all previously described PRXs because of its remarkable catalytic stability in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In this work, we present the crystallographic structure of ZoPrx isolated from Japanese radish, at 2.05\u00a0\u00c5 resolution. The mature enzyme consists of a single monomer of 308 residues exhibiting the same fold as all previously described members of the plant PRXs superfamily. Furthermore, the enzyme contains a heme b group as the prosthetic group and two Ca2+ binding sites. Moreover, seven N-glycosylation sites were found in the structure, and 49 glycans bound to the two ZoPrx molecules found in the asymmetric unit are clearly visible in the electron density map. The comparison of ZoPrx coordinates with homologous enzymes revealed minor structural changes, in which the residue 177 appears to be responsible for enlarging the access to the heme cavity, the only structural finding which may be related to the H2O2 tolerance of ZoPrx and detected by X-ray crystallography. Because of its characteristics, ZoPrx has a broad range of potential applications from chemical synthesis to environmental biocatalysis, thus its aminoacidic sequence, partially completed using the electron density, and the three-dimensional structure itself, become a possible starting point to engineering heme-peroxidases to enhance oxidative stability.",

Moreover, muscle satellite cells may be a source of ectopic muscle adipocytes, explaining the lipid accumulation often observed in aged skeletal muscle (sarcopenia) and in muscles of patients` with diabetes. Quercetin, a polyphenol, is one of the most abundant flavonoids distributed in edible plants, such as onions and apples, and possesses antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we examined whether quercetin inhibited the adipogenesis of muscle satellite cells in vitro with primary cells from rat limbs by culture in the presence of quercetin under adipogenic conditions. Morphological observations, Oil Red-O staining results, triglyceride content analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that quercetin was capable of inhibiting the adipogenic induction of muscle satellite cells into adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner by suppressing the transcript levels of adipogenic markers, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 and fatty acid binding protein 4.

     "abstract": "Acidic human fibroblast growth factor (hFGF1) plays a key role in cell growth and proliferation. Activation of the cell surface FGF receptor is believed to involve the glycosaminoglycan, heparin. However, the exact role of heparin is a subject of considerable debate. In this context, in this study, the correlation between heparin binding affinity and cell proliferation activity of hFGF1 is examined by extending the heparin binding pocket through selective engineering via charge reversal mutations (D82R, D84R and D82R/D84R). Results of biophysical experiments such as intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy suggest that the gross native structure of hFGF1 is not significantly perturbed by the engineered mutations. However, results of limited trypsin digestion and ANS binding experiments show that the backbone structure of the D82R variant is more flexible than that of the wild type hFGF1. Results of the temperature and urea-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments suggest that the stability of the charge-reversal mutations increases in the presence of heparin. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data reveal that the heparin binding affinity is significantly increased when the charge on D82 is reversed but not when the negative charge is reversed at both positions D82 and D84 (D82R/D84R). However, despite the increased affinity of D82R for heparin, the cell proliferation activity of the D82R variant is observed to be reduced compared to the wild type hFGF1. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that heparin binding affinity of hFGF1 is not strongly correlated to its cell proliferation activity.",

     "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous senile degenerative diseases including retinal disorders. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a link between proteasome regulation and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-mediated expression of extracellular matrix genes. For this purpose, human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19) were treated with different concentrations of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and the irreversible proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin. First, cytotoxicity and proliferation assays were carried out. The expression of proteasome-related genes and proteins was assessed and proteasome activity was determined. Then, expression of fibrosis-associated factors fibronectin (FN), fibronectin EDA domain (FN EDA), metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) and peroxisome proliferator-associated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) was assessed. The proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin strongly arrested cell cycle progression and down-regulated TGF\u03b2 gene expression, which in turn was shown to induce expression of pro-fibrogenic genes in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, epoxomicin induced a directional shift in the balance between MMP-2 and TIMP-1 and was associated with down-regulation of transcription of extracellular matrix genes FN and FN-EDA and up-regulation of the anti-fibrogenic factor PPAR\u03b3. In addition, both CTGF and TGF\u03b2 were shown to affect expression of proteasome-associated mRNA and protein levels. Our results suggest a link between proteasome activity and pro-fibrogenic mechanisms in the RPE, which could imply a role for proteasome-modulating agents in the treatment of retinal disorders characterized by RPE-mediated fibrogenic responses.",

     "abstract": "Intestinal homeostasis and the coordinated actions of digestion, absorption and excretion are tightly regulated by a number of gastrointestinal hormones. Most of them exert their actions through G-protein-coupled receptors. Recently, we showed that the absence of G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 signaling impaired the maturation of Paneth cells, induced their differentiation toward goblet cells, and affected the regeneration of the colonic mucosa in an experimental model of colitis. Although an immunohistochemical study showed that G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 were highly expressed in enterocytes, it seemed that enterocytes were not affected in Int-Gq/G11 double knock-out intestine. Thus, we used an intestinal epithelial cell line to examine the role of signaling through G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 in enterocytes and manipulated the expression level of G\u03b1q and/or G\u03b111. The proliferation was inhibited in IEC-6 cells that overexpressed G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 and enhanced in IEC-6 cells in which G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 was downregulated. The expression of T-cell factor 1 was increased according to the overexpression of G\u03b1q/G\u03b111. The expression of Notch1 intracellular cytoplasmic domain was decreased by the overexpression of G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 and increased by the downregulation of G\u03b1q/G\u03b111. The relative mRNA expression of Muc2, a goblet cell marker, was elevated in a G\u03b1q/G\u03b111 knock-down experiment.

This result was validated by ShcD-RET co-localization, which was visualized using a fluorescence microscope. ShcD-RET coexpression promoted ShcD and RET endosomal localization, resulting in unexpected inhibition of the downstream ERK and AKT pathways. Interestingly, ShcD-RET association reduced the viability and migration of SK-N-AS cells. Although ShcD was previously shown to trigger melanoma cell migration and tumorigenesis, our data showed an opposite role for ShcD in neuroblastoma SK-N-AS cells via its association with RET in GDNF-treated cells.

The duPD-L2 cDNA encodes a 321 amino acid protein that has an amino acid identity of 76% and 35% with chicken and human PD-L2, respectively. Mapping of the duPD-L2 cDNA with duck genomic sequences revealed an exonic structure similar to that of the human Pdcd1lg2 gene. Homology modelling of the duPD-L2 protein was compatible with the murine PD-L2 ectodomain structure. Residues known to be important for PD-1 receptor binding of murine PD-L2 were mostly conserved in duPD-L2 within sheets A and G and partially conserved within sheets C and F. DuPD-L2 mRNA was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined with highest expression levels in lung, spleen, cloaca, bursa, cecal tonsil, duodenum and very low levels of expression in muscle, kidney and brain. Lipopolysaccharide treatment of adherent duck PBMC upregulated duPD-L2 mRNA expression. Our work shows evolutionary conservation of the PD-L2 ectodomain structure and residues important for PD-1 binding in vertebrates including fish. The information provided will be useful for further investigation of the role of duPD-L2 in the regulation of duck adaptive immunity and exploration of PD-1-targeted immunotherapies in the duck hepatitis B infection model.",

Arginine detection in fermented food products is necessary because, high level of arginine in foods forms ethyl carbamate (EC) during the fermentation process. Therefore, L-arginine detection in fermented food products is very important as a control measure for quality of fermented foods, food supplements and beverages including wine. In clinical analysis arginine detection is important due to their enormous inherent versatility in various metabolic pathways, topmost in the synthesis of Nitric oxide (NO) and tumor growth. A number of methods are being used for arginine detection, but biosensors technique holds prime position due to rapid response, high sensitivity and high specificity. However, there are many problems still to be addressed, including selectivity, real time analysis and interference of urea presence in the sample. In the present review we aim to emphasize the significant role of arginine in human physiology and foods. A small attempt has been made to discuss the various techniques used for development of arginine biosensor and how these techniques affect their performance. The choice of transducers for arginine biosensor ranges from optical, pH sensing, ammonia gas sensing, ammonium ion-selective, conductometric and amperometric electrodes because ammonia is formed as a final product.",

     "abstract": "A recently developed integrative approach combining varied types of experimental data has been successfully applied to three-dimensional modelling of larger biomacromolecular complexes. Deuteration-assisted small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) plays a unique role in this approach by making it possible to observe selected components in the complex. It enables integrative modelling of biomolecular complexes based on building-block structures typically provided by X-ray crystallography. In this integrative approach, it is important to be aware of the flexible properties of the individual building blocks. Here we examine the ability of SANS to detect a subtle conformational change of a multidomain protein using the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) interacting with a soluble form of the low-affinity Fc\u03b3 receptor IIIb (sFc\u03b3RIIIb) as a model system. The IgG-Fc glycoprotein was subjected to SANS in the absence and presence of 75%-deuterated sFc\u03b3RIIIb, which was matched out in D2O solution. This inverse contrast-matching technique enabled selective observation of SANS from IgG-Fc, thereby detecting its subtle structural deformation induced by the receptor binding. The SANS data were successfully interpreted by considering previously reported crystallographic data and an equilibrium between free and sFc\u03b3RIIIb-bound forms. Our SANS data thus demonstrate the applicability of SANS in the integrative approach dealing with biomacromolecular complexes composed of weakly associated building blocks with conformational plasticity.",

     "abstract": "This study explores the role of G-protein-coupled receptor-intracellular signaling in the development of P450-mediated insecticide resistance in mosquitoes, Culex quinquefasciatus, focusing on the essential function of the GPCRs and their downstream effectors of Gs alpha subunit protein (G\u03b1s) and adenylyl cyclase (ACs) in P450-mediated insecticide resistance of Culex mosquitoes. Our RNAi-mediated functional study showed that knockdown of G\u03b1s caused the decreased expression of the downstream effectors of ACs and PKAs in the GPCR signaling pathway and resistance P450 genes, whereas knockdown of ACs decreased the expression of PKAs and resistance P450 genes. Knockdown of either G\u03b1s or ACs resulted in an increased susceptibility of mosquitoes to permethrin. These results add significantly to our understanding of the molecular basis of resistance P450 gene regulation through GPCR/G\u03b1s/AC/cAMP-PKA signaling pathways in the insecticide resistance of mosquitoes. The temporal and spatial dynamic analyses of GPCRs, G\u03b1s, ACs, PKAs, and P450s in two insecticide resistant mosquito strains revealed that all the GPCR signaling pathway components tested, namely GPCRs, G\u03b1s, ACs and PKAs, were most highly expressed in the brain for both resistant strains, suggesting the role played by these genes in signaling transduction and regulation. The resistance P450 genes were mainly expressed in the brain, midgut and malpighian tubules (MTs), suggesting their critical function in the central nervous system and importance for detoxification. The temporal dynamics analysis for the gene expression showed a diverse expression profile during mosquito development, indicating their initially functional importance in response to exposure to insecticides during their life stages.",

The clinical features and histological data were collected. The mRNA expressions of colonic PRRs, T cell-associated components were measured. Finally, the colons were scored for Foxp3+ cells.

In contrast to acute colitis, the expression of all Toll-like receptors (Tlrs), except Tlr5 and Tlr9, was unaffected after repeated DSS treatments. The expression of Nod1 was decreased, while Nod2 increased. After third DSS treatment, only the expressions of Tlr3 and Tlr4 were significantly enhanced. Unlike other PRRs, decreased Tlr5 and increased Tlr9 mRNA expression persisted during the chronic colitis period. As the colitis progress, only the mRNA expression of Ifn\u03b3 and Il17 staid increased during chronic colitis, while the acute colitis-associated increase of Il23, and Il10 and Il12 was abolished.

Next, we knocked-in the HiBiT-epitope tag into the ATF4 gene using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and rapidly selected positive clones by measuring luciferase activity in an aliquot of each cell suspension. Using a selected clone, we observed that the expression of HiBiT-tagged ATF4 in the selected cells varied in response to treatment with protein synthesis inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors and tunicamycin.

Therefore, we investigated this using IL-1 receptor antagonist-deficient (IL-1Ra-/-) mice, which spontaneously develop IL-17-dependent arthritis. However, development of spontaneous arthritis (incidence rate, disease severity, proliferation of synovial cells, infiltration of PMNs, and bone erosion in joints) and differentiation of Th17 cells in draining lymph nodes in IL-25-/- IL-1Ra-/- mice were similar to in control IL-25+/+ IL-1Ra-/- mice.

This migration process is closely related to protein kinase C\u03b1 (PKC\u03b1), a Ca2+-dependent protein that translocates from the cytosol to the cell membrane. Because the cells adjacent to the wounded area are the first to migrate into the wound, we investigated whether a mechanical wound immediately induces PKC\u03b1 translocation in adjacent cells. We monitored Ca2+ dynamics and PKC\u03b1 translocation simultaneously using fluorescent microscopy. For this simultaneous observation, we used Fura-2\u2013acetoxymethyl ester to visualize Ca2+ and constructed a green fluorescent protein-tagged fusion protein to visualize PKC\u03b1. Mechanical wounding of the endothelial monolayer induced an immediate Ca2+ wave in cells adjacent to the wounded cells before their migration. Almost concurrently, PKC\u03b1 in the neighboring cells translocated to the cell membrane, then accumulated at the periphery near the wounded cell. This report is the first description of this biphasic and directed translocation of PKC\u03b1 in cells before cell migration.

The present study was undertaken to characterize melanin extracted from an environmental Aspergillus fumigatus AFGRD105 by studying its genes, chemical properties and spectral data. A gene based approach to confirm the type of melanin carried out indicated the extracted melanin to be of the dihydroxynaphthalene type. On comparison with synthetic melanin, UV\u2013Vis and IR spectra of the extracted melanin revealed characteristic peaks that can be further used for confirmation of DHN-melanin extracted from any source. Solid state 13C NMR spectroscopy established the presence of the hydroxyl-naphthalene moiety and validated the results obtained by genetic analysis. The correct assignment of the observed spectral frequency characteristic of functional groups can be further adapted in future works that deal with binding capacities and biomolecule systems involving melanin.",

This study was undertaken to look for an appropriate loading control for western blot analysis of ischemic myocardium. Myocardial ischemic infarction was induced by left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation in Rhesus monkeys and C57BL/6 mice. The heart tissue samples from different areas and time points after surgery were subjected to western blot or gel staining. The level of \u03b2-actin, GAPDH, \u03b2-tubulin, and total protein were tested. The total protein level was consistent in all groups, whereas the protein level of \u03b2-tubulin and \u03b2-actin were different in all groups.

     "abstract": "The use of liposomes to affect targeted delivery of pharmaceutical agents to specific sites may result in the reduction of side effects and an increase in drug efficacy. Since liposomes are delivered intravascularly, erythrocytes, which constitute almost half of the volume of blood, are ideal targets for liposomal drug delivery.In vivo, erythrocytes serve not only in the role of oxygen transport but also as participants in the regulation of vascular diameter through the regulated release of the potent vasodilator, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Unfortunately, erythrocytes of humans with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) do not release ATP in response to the physiological stimulus of exposure to increases in mechanical deformation as would occur when these cells traverse the pulmonary circulation. This defect in erythrocyte physiology has been suggested to contribute to pulmonary hypertension in these individuals.In contrast to deformation, both healthy human and PAH erythrocytes do release ATP in response to incubation with prostacyclin analogs via a well-characterized signaling pathway. Importantly, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) have been shown to significantly increase prostacyclin analog-induced ATP release from human erythrocytes.Here we investigate the hypothesis that targeted delivery of PDE5 inhibitors to human erythrocytes, using a liposomal delivery system, potentiates prostacyclin analog- induced ATP release. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that directed delivery of this class of drugs to erythrocytes could be a new and important method to augment prostacyclin analog-induced ATP release from these cells. Such an approach could significantly limit side effects of both classes of drugs without compromising their therapeutic effectiveness in diseases such as PAH.",

However molecular pathways through which hormones and ECM exert their effect on wallaby mammary gland function remain unclear. This study undertakes transcriptome analysis of wallaby mammary epithelial cells (WallMEC) following treatment with mammary ECM from two distinct stages of lactation.WallMEC from MID lactation mammary glands were cultured on ECM from MID or LATE lactation and treated for 5 days with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml cortisol, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml insulin, 0.2\u00a0\u00b5g/ml prolactin, 650\u00a0pg/ml triodothyronine and 1\u00a0pg/ml estradiol to induce lactation. WallMEC RNA from triplicate ECM treatments was used to perform RNAseq.ECM from MID and LATE lactation differentially regulated key genes in sugar and lipid metabolism. Seven pathways including galactose metabolism, lysosome, cell adhesion molecules (CAM), p53 signaling, the complement and coagulation and Nod-like receptor signaling pathways were only significantly responsive to ECM in the presence of hormones. The raw RNA-seq data for this project are available on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) browser (accession number GSE81210).A potential role of ECM in regulation of the caloric content of milk, among other functions including apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation has been identified.This study has used a non-eutherian lactation model to demonstrate the synergy between ECM and hormones in the local regulation of mammary function.",

     "abstract": "The influenza A virus, which has an RNA genome, requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for transcription and replication. The polymerase is comprised of the subunits PA, PB1, and PB2. The C-terminal RNA-binding domain in PB2 contains lysine 627 (PB2 627), which is associated with pathogenicity and host range. However, the structure and molecular mechanism of PB2 627 in solution remain obscure. Here, we investigated PB2 627 in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and detected inhomogeneity in the intensities of backbone amide proton signals due to local fluctuations in structure. To characterize the effects of chemical chaperones on spectral data and improve the data quality, we tested 20 different additives, including L-arginine L-glutamate salt, (L-arginine)2SO4, glycerol, \u03b2-octylglucoside, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, Na2SO4, 1,5-diaminopentane, 1,4-diaminobutane, trehalose, sucrose, glycine, trimethylamine N-oxide, \u03b2-alanine, L-\u03b1-alanine, hydroxyectoine, betaine, L-proline, and non-detergent sulfobetaine 195, 201, and 256. We evaluated the quality of the resulting spectra by calculating the standard deviation and average of the ratio of signal intensities to noise level of amide peaks, as well as the ratio of the standard deviation to the average. NMR-profile analysis revealed diverse effects of additives on the dynamic properties of PB2 627. Based on such criteria, we found that small osmolytes such as glycine and L-\u03b1-alanine reduced structural fluctuations and improved the quality of spectral data, which is likely to facilitate a detailed NMR-based structural analysis. The methodology developed here may also be more generally useful for evaluating the effects of chemical chaperones on the structural integrity of proteins.",

     "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to drug delivery into the central nervous system (CNS), in particular for macromolecules such as peptides and proteins. However, certain macromolecules can reach the CNS via a receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) pathway, and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is one of the promising receptors for RMT. An LRP1 ligand peptide, Angiopep-2, was reported to pass through the BBB and deliver covalently conjugated drugs into the CNS. While conjugation of LRP1 ligands with drugs would be an effective approach for drug delivery to the CNS, no other reliable LRP1 ligands have been reported to date. In this study, we aimed to identify novel LRP1 ligands to further investigate LRP1-mediated RMT. Using phage display technology, we obtained a novel peptide, L57 (TWPKHFDKHTFYSILKLGKH-OH), with an EC50 value of 45\u00a0nM for binding to cluster 4 (Ser3332\u2013Asp3779) of LRP1. L57 was stable in mouse plasma for up to 20\u00a0min. In situ brain perfusion assay in mice revealed the significantly high BBB permeability of L57. In conclusion, we discovered L57, the first artificial LRP1-binding peptide with BBB permeability. Our findings will contribute to the development of RMT-based drugs for the treatment of CNS diseases.",

     "abstract": "Regulatory elements present in the promoter of a gene drive the expression of the gene in response to various stimuli. Lemur Tyrosine Kinase 2 (LMTK2) is a membrane-anchored Serine/Threonine kinase involved in endosomal protein trafficking and androgen signaling amongst other processes. Previous studies have shown this protein to be of therapeutic importance in cystic fibrosis and prostate cancer. However, nothing is known about the endogenous expression of this protein and its regulation. In this study, we analyzed the gene encoding human LMTK2, to look for possible regulatory elements that could affect its expression. Interestingly, the human lmtk2 gene contains a consensus TPA (12- O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-responsive element (TRE) in the region preceding its start codon. The element with the sequence TGAGTCA modulates LMTK2 expression in response to treatment with TPA, a synthetic Protein Kinase C (PKC) activator. It serves as the binding site for c-Fos, a member of the Activator Protein \u22121 (AP-1) transcription factor complex, which is transactivated by PKC. We observed that TPA, at low concentrations, increases the promoter activity of LMTK2, which leads to a subsequent increase in the mRNA transcript and protein levels. This modulation occurs through binding of the AP-1 transcription factor complex to the lmtk2 promoter. Thus, our current study has established LMTK2 as a TPA-responsive element-containing gene, which is upregulated downstream of PKC activation. Considering the involvement of LMTK2 in intracellular processes as well as pathological conditions, our findings demonstrate a way to modulate intracellular LMTK2 levels pharmacologically for potentially therapeutic purposes.",

Only two micro-organisms have previously been shown to express an enzyme that uses polyphosphate exclusively.A variety of experimental approaches, including NMR and NAD-linked assay systems were used to conduct a biochemical investigation of polyphosphate dependent glucokinase activity in mammalian tissues.A novel mammalian glucokinase, highly responsive to hexametaphosphate (HMP) but not ATP or ADP as a phosphoryl donor is present in the nuclei of mammalian hepatocytes. The liver enzyme exhibited sigmoidal kinetics with respect to glucose with a S0.5 of 12\u00a0mM, similar to the known kinetics of mammalian ATP-glucokinase. The Km for HMP (0.5\u00a0mM) was also similar to that of phosphoryl donors for mammalian ATP-glucokinases. The new enzyme was inhibited by several nucleotide phosphates.We report the discovery of a polyphosphate-dependent enzyme system in mammalian cells with kinetics similar to established ATP-dependent glucokinase, also known to have a nuclear location. The kinetics suggest possible regulatory or redox protective roles.The role of polyphosphate in mammalian systems has remained an enigma for decades, and the present report describes progress on the significance of this compound in intracellular metabolism in mammals.",

Heat capacity changes, \u0394Cp, for these same H10 binding interactions were estimated from the temperature dependence of the enthalpy changes. The enthalpy changes for binding H10, H10-C, or H10-G to CT-DNA are all endothermic at 298\u00a0K, becoming more exothermic as the temperature is increased. The \u0394H for binding H10-G to CT-DNA is exothermic at temperatures above approximately 300\u00a0K. Osmotic stress experiments indicate that the binding of H10 is accompanied by the release of approximately 35 water molecules.We estimate from our naked DNA titration results that the binding of the H10 to the nucleosome places the H10 protein in close contact with approximately 41 DNA bp. The breakdown is that the H10 carboxyl terminus interacts with 28\u00a0bp of linker DNA on one side of the nucleosome, the H10 globular domain binds directly to 7\u00a0bp of core DNA, and shields another 6 linker DNA bases, 3\u00a0bp on either side of the nucleosome where the linker DNA exits the nucleosome core.",

However, expression of all REG family genes in IBD is still unclear. Here, we analyzed expression of all REG family genes (REG I\u03b1, REG I\u03b2, REG III, HIP/PAP, and REG IV) in biopsy specimens of UC and CD by real-time RT-PCR.

We further analyzed the expression mechanisms of REG I\u03b1, REG I\u03b2, and REG IV genes in human colon cells. The expression of REG I\u03b1 was significantly induced by IL-6 or IL-22, and REG I\u03b2 was induced by IL-22.

Therefore, an effective viral suppression in monocytes is critical for effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). This study focuses on a new strategy using nanoformulation to optimize the efficacy of ART drugs in HIV-infected monocytes.Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based elvitegravir nanoparticles (PLGA-EVG) were prepared by nano-precipitation technique. The physicochemical properties of PLGA-EVG were characterized using transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Cellular uptake study was performed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. All in vitro experiments were performed by using HIV-infected monocytic cell lines U1 and HIV-infected primary macrophages. Elvitegravir quantification was performed using LC-MS/MS. HIV viral replication was assessed by using p24 ELISA.We developed a PLGA-EVG nanoparticle formulation with particle size of ~ 47\u00a0nm from transmission electron microscopy and zeta potential of ~ 6.74\u00a0mV from dynamic light scattering. These nanoparticles demonstrated a time- and concentration-dependent uptakes in monocytes. PLGA-EVG formulation showed a ~ 2 times higher intracellular internalization of EVG than control group (EVG alone). PLGA-EVG nanoparticles also demonstrated superior viral suppression over control for a prolonged period of time.PLGA-based EVG nanoformulation increased the intracellular uptake of EVG, as well as enhanced viral suppression in HIV-infected macrophages, suggesting its potential for improved HIV treatment in monocytic cells.",

Activity of Na+/K+-pump and Na+,K+,2Cl-cotransport was measured in cultured endothelial and smooth muscle cells from the rat aorta as ouabain-sensitive and ouabain-resistant, bumetanide-sensitive components of the 86Rb influx, respectively.NaHS exhibited the bimodal action on contractions triggered by modest depolarization ([K+]o=30\u00a0mM). At 10\u22124 M, NaHS augmented contractions of intact and endothelium-denuded strips by ~ 15% and 25%, respectively, whereas at concentration of 10\u22123\u00a0M it decreased contractile responses by more than two-fold. Contractions evoked by 10\u22124\u00a0M NaHS were completely abolished by bumetanide, a potent inhibitor of Na+,K+,2Cl-cotransport, whereas the inhibition seen at 10\u22123\u00a0M NaHS was suppressed in the presence of K+ channel blocker TEA. In cultured SMC, 5\u00d710\u22125\u00a0M NaHS increased Na+,K+,2Cl- - cotransport without any effect on the activity of this carrier in endothelial cells. In depolarized SMC, 45Ca influx was enhanced in the presence of 10\u22124\u00a0M NaHS and suppressed under elevation of [NaHS] up to 10\u22123\u00a0M. 45Ca influx triggered by 10\u22124\u00a0M NaHS was abolished by bumetanide and L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nicardipine.Our results strongly suggest that contractions of rat aortic rings triggered by low doses of NaHS are mediated by activation of Na+,K+,2Cl-cotransport and Ca2+ influx via L-type channels.",

The preliminary network-based mutational analysis suggested that the two residues, Arg-21 and Asn-121, have an apparent mutational potential for fine-tuning of AzoA, based on their beneficial pleiotropic feedbacks. However, epistasis between the two promising mutational spots in AzoA has not been obtained in terms of substrate binding and azoreductase activity. In this study, we further quantified, visualized, and described the pleiotropic and/or epistatic behavior of six single or double mutations at the positions, Arg-21 and Asn-121, as a further research endeavor for beneficial fine-tuning of AzoA. Based on this network-based mutational analysis, we showed that pleiotropy and epistasis are common, sensitive, and complex mutational behaviors, depending mainly on the structural and functional responsibility and the physicochemical properties of the residue(s) in AzoA.",

Here, we examined the direct effects of crocin on key functions and pro-inflammatory gene expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated BV-2 microglia. We found that crocin stimulation strongly promoted filopodia formation and markedly increased microglial phagocytosis, two important parameters relevant for physiological microglia functions. Moreover, crocin significantly reduced gene expression of the pro-inflammatory markers IL6, CCL2, and iNOS in LPS-challenged BV-2 cells and potently blocked NO production in these microglia. The observed immunomodulatory effects of crocin were not mediated by general inhibition of NFkB nuclear translocation. Our findings indicate that many of the anti-inflammatory effects of crocin demonstrated in animal models of neuronal degeneration could be mediated by its direct effects on microglia homeostasis.",

We identified several lysine modifications in H3 variants, including testis-specific histone H3 (H3t), through their successful separation with MS-based strategy, based on differences in masses, retention times, and presence of immonium ions. Besides methylation and acetylation, we detected formylation as a novel PTM on H3 variants in mouse testes. These patterns were also observed in H3t.

To understand the accurate molecular mechanism of the delayed effect of SM, the identification of the gene expression pattern in these patients is essential. Hence, we have evaluated mRNA expression of four common housekeeping genes (ACTIN, PGK1, \u03b22m, GAPDH) in SM-exposed and non-exposed (control) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human lung tissues.Paraffin block of lung biopsy of SM-exposed people (11 cases) and people without exposure to SM as control group (9 cases) have been selected. The mRNA expression of four endogenous control genes has been evaluated by qRT-PCR. The stability value of each gene was calculated by different methods.It was found that ACTIN mRNA has the highest expression (30.26\u00b12.87) and PGK1 has the lowest standard deviation (SD) (30.885\u00b12.215) between pooled groups. The best correlation was between ACTIN and PGK1 expressions. The M value has shown that ACTIN and then PGK1 are the most stable housekeeping genes among. The results obtained from the GeNorm and NormFinder have indicated that the pair ACTIN- PGK1 is the most suitable choice for endogenous control genes.ACTIN and PGK1 genes are stable in studied lung tissues and are the better than two other housekeeping genes.

In this study, we employed an electrostatic interaction between vesicles and supported bilayer lipid membranes (s-BLMs) to control the fusion process. We combined large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) containing anionic lipids, which we used instead of proteoliposomes, and s-BLMs containing cationic lipids to control electrostatic interaction. Anionic LUVs were never adsorbed or ruptured on the SiO2 substrate with a slight negative charge, and selectively fused with cationic s-BLMs. The LUVs can be fused effectively to the target position. Furthermore, as the vesicle fusion proceeds and some of the positive charges are neutralized, the attractive interaction weakens and finally the vesicle fusion saturates. In other words, we can control the number of LUVs fused with s-BLMs by controlling the concentration of the cationic lipids in the s-BLMs. The fluidity of the s-BLMs after vesicle fusion was confirmed to be sufficiently high. This indicates that the LUVs attached to the s-BLMs were almost completely fused, and there were few intermediate state vesicles in the fusion process.

     "abstract": "Addicsin (Arl6ip5) is a multifunctional physiological and pathophysiological regulator that exerts its effects by readily forming homo- and hetero-complexes with various functional factors. In particular, addicsin acts as a negative modulator of neural glutamate transporter excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) and participates in the regulation of intracellular glutathione (GSH) content by negatively modulating EAAC1-mediated cysteine and glutamate uptake. Addicsin is considered to play a crucial role in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases including epilepsy. However, the molecular dynamics of addicsin remains largely unknown. Here, we report the dynamics of addicsin in NG108-15 cells upon exposure to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a representative epileptogenic agent acting on the gamma-Aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptor. Fluorescent immunostaining analysis demonstrated that addicsin drastically changed its localization from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the plasma membrane within 1\u00a0h of PTZ exposure in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, addicsin was co-localized with the plasma membrane markers EAAC1 and Na+/K+ ATPase alpha-3 upon PTZ stimulation. This translocation was significantly inhibited by a non-competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, but not by a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging assay showed that PTZ-induced addicsin translocation was accompanied by a decrease of radical-scavenging activity and an increase of cytotoxicity in a PTZ dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that PTZ induces the translocation of addicsin from the ER to the plasma membrane and modulates the redox system by regulating EAAC1-mediated GSH synthesis, which leads to the activation of cell death signaling.",

Sulfadiazine and/or pyrimethamine served as positive controls.We found that interplay among multiple host cellular processes, including HIF-1\u03b1 activity, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity, and to a larger extent the tryptophan pathway, contribute to the anti-parasitic action of NPs.To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate an effect of NPs on the tryptophan and/or kynurenine pathway.Our findings deepen our understanding of the mechanism of action of NPs and suggest that modulation of the host nutrient pool may represent a viable approach to the development of new and effective anti-parasitic agents.",

Exhaustive mutagenesis of Tyr93 in ttCK revealed that the uridine phosphorylation activity was restored only by replacement of Tyr93 with His or Gln. Replacement of His117 in human UCK2, corresponding to residue Tyr93 in ttCK, by Tyr resulted in a loss of uridine phosphorylation activity. These findings indicated that uridine phosphorylation activity commonly depends on a single residue in the UCK family.",

They currently represent valuable targets for the development of inhibitors of aberrant transcriptional processes in a variety of human diseases. Here we report urea-induced equilibrium unfolding experiments monitored by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence on two structurally similar BRDs: BRD2(2) and BRD4(1), showing that BRD4(1) is more stable than BRD2(2). Moreover, we report a description of their kinetic folding mechanism, as obtained by careful analysis of stopped-flow and temperature-jump data. The presence of a high energy intermediate for both proteins, suggested by the non-linear dependence of the folding rate on denaturant concentration in the millisec time regime, has been experimentally observed by temperature-jump experiments. Quantitative global analysis of all the rate constants obtained over a wide range of urea concentrations, allowed us to propose a common, three-state, folding mechanism for these two BRDs. Interestingly, the intermediate of BRD4(1) appears to be more stable and structurally native-like than that populated by BRD2(2). Our results underscore the role played by structural topology and sequence in determining and tuning the folding mechanism.",

Both ALA and the combination of ALA and SFC promoted the synthesis of heme, without affecting the expression of genes involved in intestinal iron transport, such as DMT1 and FPN. The enhanced heme synthesis in Caco-2 cells was more pronounced under the effect of the combination of ALA and SFC than under the effect of ALA alone, as reflected by the induced expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), as well as a reduced protein level of the transcriptional corepressor Bach1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed Bach1 chromatin occupancy at the enhancer regions of HO-1, which were significantly decreased by the addition of ALA and SFC. Finally, Transwell culture of Caco-2 cells suggested that the administered ALA to the intestinal lumen was partially transported into vasolateral space.

     "abstract": "It is well established that NADH/NAD+ redox balance is heavily perturbed in diabetes, and the NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance is a major source of oxidative stress in diabetic tissues. In mitochondria, complex I is the only site for NADH oxidation and NAD+ regeneration and is also a major site for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Yet how complex I responds to the NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance and any potential consequences of such response in diabetic pancreas have not been investigated. We report here that pancreatic mitochondrial complex I showed aberrant hyperactivity in either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Further studies focusing on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes indicate that complex I hyperactivity could be attenuated by metformin. Moreover, complex I hyperactivity was accompanied by increased activities of complexes II to IV, but not complex V, suggesting that overflow of NADH via complex I in diabetes could be diverted to ROS production. Indeed in diabetic pancreas, ROS production and oxidative stress increased and mitochondrial ATP production decreased, which can be attributed to impaired pancreatic mitochondrial membrane potential that is responsible for increased cell death. Additionally, cellular defense systems such as glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, sirtuin 3, and NQO1 were found to be compromised in diabetic pancreas. Our findings point to the direction that complex I aberrant hyperactivity in pancreas could be a major source of oxidative stress and \u03b2 cell failure in diabetes. Therefore, inhibiting pancreatic complex I hyperactivity and attenuating its ROS production by various means in diabetes might serve as a promising approach for anti-diabetic therapies.",

We exposed human hepatocytes (JHH5, JHH7, and HepG2) to experimental IH or normoxia for 24\u00a0h, measured mRNA levels by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and found that IH significantly increased the mRNA levels of selenoprotein P (SELENOP) \u2014 a hepatokine \u2014 and hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/pancreatitis-associated protein (HIP/PAP) \u2014 one of REG (Regenerating gene) family.

On the other hand, a target mRNA search of micro RNA (miRNA) revealed that both mRNAs have a potential target sequence for miR-203. The miR-203 level of IH-treated cells was significantly lower than that of normoxia-treated cells. Thus, we introduced miR-203 inhibitor and a non-specific control RNA (miR-203 inhibitor NC) into HepG2 cells and measured the mRNA levels of SELENOP and HIP/PAP. The IH-induced expression of SELENOP and HIP/PAP was abolished by the introduction of miR-203 inhibitor but not by miR-203 inhibitor NC. These results demonstrate that IH stress up-regulates the levels of SELENOP in human hepatocytes to accelerate insulin resistance and up-regulates the levels of HIP/PAP mRNAs to proliferate such hepatocytes, via the miR-203 mediated mechanism.",

Dysfunctional autophagy is attributed to disease progression in several pathological conditions and therefore, autophagy has appeared as a potential pharmacological target for such conditions.In search of potential drugs that modulate autophagy, identifying small molecule effectors of autophagy is the primary step. The conventional autophagy assays have a limitation that they cannot be scaled down to a high throughput format, therefore, novel sensitive assays are needed to discover new candidate molecules. Keeping this rationale in mind, a dual luciferase based assay was developed in the yeast S. cerevisiae that could measure both selective and general autophagy in real time.Firefly and Renilla luciferase reporter genes were cloned under POT-1 promoter. Using fatty acid medium the promoter was induced and the luciferase cargo was allowed to build up. The cells were then transferred to starvation conditions to stimulate autophagy and the degradation of luciferase markers was followed with time.The assay was more sensitive than conventional assays and could be scaled down to a 384 well format using an automated system. A good Z-factor score indicated that the assay is highly suitable for High Throughput Screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries. Screening of a small molecule library with our assay identified several known and novel modulators of autophagy.",

For this study, we examined hemin (Fe3+ -protoporphyrin IX)-induced NET formation quantitatively in vitro as well as the effects of oxidative stress.NETs formed in vitro from cultured neutrophils were quantitatively detected by using nuclease treatment and Sytox Green, a nucleic acid stain. Hemin-induced NET production was found to be in a dose-dependent manner, NADPH oxidase-dependent and toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 independent.

While mechanical stress can be disastrous for the metabolism of chondrocytes, mechanical stimulation at the physiological level is known to improve cell function. The disease modifying OA drug (DMOAD) diacerein functions as a slowly-acting drug in OA by exhibiting anti-inflammatory, anti-catabolic, and pro-anabolic properties on cartilage. Combining these two treatment options revealed positive effects on OA-chondrocytes.Cells were grown on flexible silicone membranes and mechanically stimulated by cyclic tensile loading. After seven days in the presence or absence of diacerein, inflammation markers and growth factors were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme linked immune assays. The influence of conditioned medium was tested on cell proliferation and cell migration.Tensile strain and diacerein treatment reduced interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression, whereas cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) expression was increased only by mechanical stimulation. The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was down regulated by the combined treatment modalities, whereas prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis was reduced only under OA conditions. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) was down-regulated by both.From our study we conclude that moderate mechanical stimulation appears beneficial for the fate of the cell and improves the pharmacological effect of diacerein based on cross-talks between different initiated pathways.Combining two different treatment options broadens the perspective to treat OA and improves chondrocytes metabolism.",

MANF can be secreted but is generally resident within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, where it is involved in the ER stress response with pro-survival effects. Here we report the discovery of the MANF homolog SDMANF in the sponge Suberites domuncula. The basal positioning of sponges (phylum Porifera) in the animal tree of life offers a unique vantage point on the early evolution of the metazoan-specific genetic toolkit and molecular pathways. Since sponges lack a conventional nervous system, SDMANF presents an enticing opportunity to investigate the evolutionary ancient role of these neurotrophic factors. SDMANF shares considerable sequence similarity with its metazoan homologs. It also comprises a putative protein binding domain with sequence similarities to the Bcl-2 family of apoptotic regulators. In Suberites, SDMANF is expressed in the vicinity of bacteriocytes, where it co-localizes with the toll-like receptor SDTLR. In transfected human cells, SDMANF was detected in both the organelle protein fraction and the cell culture medium. The intracellular SDMANF protein level was up-regulated in response to both a Golgi/ER transport inhibitor and bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Upon LPS challenge, transfected cells revealed a decreased caspase-3 activity and increased cell viability with no inducible Bax expression compared to the wild type. These results suggest a deep evolutionary original cytoprotective role of MANF, at the crossroads of innate immune and apoptotic pathways, of which a neurotrophic function might have arisen later in metazoan evolution.",

While many experimental studies have been performed towards this end, they have limited scope to examine all aspects of the effect of a mutation. Computational studies can help to overcome these limitations, however, relatively few studies that focus on insulin analogues have been performed to date. Here, we present a comprehensive computational study of insulin analogues\u2014three mutant insulins that have been identified with hyperinsulinemia and three mutations on the critical B26 residue that exhibit similar binding affinity to the insulin receptor\u2014using molecular dynamics simulations with the aim of predicting how mutations of insulin affect its activity, dynamics, energetics and conformations. The time evolution of the conformers is studied in long simulations. The probability density function and potential of mean force calculations are performed on each insulin analogue to unravel the effect of mutations on the dynamics and energetics of insulin activation. Our conformational study can decrypt the key features and molecular mechanisms that are responsible for an enhanced or reduced activity of an insulin analogue. We find two key results: 1) hyperinsulinemia may be due to the drastically reduced activity (and binding affinity) of the mutant insulins. 2) Y26BS and Y26BE are promising therapeutic candidates for insulin as they are more active than WT-insulin. The analysis in this work can be readily applied to any set of mutations on insulin to guide development of more effective therapeutic analogues.",

However, the relationship between osteocytes and mechanical stress remains unclear due to the difficulty of three-dimensional (3D) culture of osteocytes in vitro. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of cyclic mechanical stretch on 3D-cultured osteocyte-like cells. Osteocyte-like cells were established using rat calvarial osteoblasts cultured in a 3D culture system. Cyclic mechanical stretch (8% amplitude at a rate of 2 cycles min\u22121) was applied for 24, 48 and 96 consecutive hours. Morphology, cell number and preferential cell alignment were evaluated. Apoptosis- and autophagy-related gene expression levels were measured using quantitative PCR. 3D-cultured osteoblasts became osteocyte-like cells that expressed osteocyte-specific genes such as Dmp1, Cx43, Sost, Fgf23 and RANKL, with morphological changes similar to osteocytes. Cell number was significantly decreased in a time-dependent manner under non-loaded conditions, whereas cyclic mechanical stretch significantly prevented decreased cell numbers with increased expression of anti-apoptosis-related genes. Moreover, cyclic mechanical stretch significantly decreased cell size and ellipticity with increased expression of autophagy-related genes, LC3b and atg7. Interestingly, preferential cell alignment did not occur, irrespective of mechanical stretch. These findings suggest that an anti-apoptotic effect contributes to network development of osteocyte-like cells under loaded condition. Spherical change of osteocyte-like cells induced by mechanical stretch may be associated with autophagy upregulation. Preferential alignment of osteocytes induced by mechanical load in vivo may be partially predetermined before osteoblasts differentiate into osteocytes and embed into bone matrix.",

Soluble starch synthases (SSs) are a group of key players in starch biosynthesis which have proven their impact on different aspects of the starch biosynthesis and functionalities. These enzymes have been studied in different plant species and organs in detail, however, there seem to be key differences among species regarding their contributions to the starch synthesis. In this review, we consider an update on various SSs with an emphasis on potato SSs as a model for storage organs. The genetics and regulatory mechanisms of potato starch synthases will be highlighted. Different aspects of various isoforms of SSs are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Bioethanol has been identified as the mostly used biofuel worldwide since it significantly contributes to the reduction of crude oil consumption and environmental pollution. It can be produced from various types of feedstocks such as sucrose, starch, lignocellulosic and algal biomass through fermentation process by microorganisms. Compared to other types of microoganisms, yeasts especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the common microbes employed in ethanol production due to its high ethanol productivity, high ethanol tolerance and ability of fermenting wide range of sugars. However, there are some challenges in yeast fermentation which inhibit ethanol production such as high temperature, high ethanol concentration and the ability to ferment pentose sugars. Various types of yeast strains have been used in fermentation for ethanol production including hybrid, recombinant and wild-type yeasts. Yeasts can directly ferment simple sugars into ethanol while other type of feedstocks must be converted to fermentable sugars before it can be fermented to ethanol. The common processes involves in ethanol production are pretreatment, hydrolysis and fermentation. Production of bioethanol during fermentation depends on several factors such as temperature, sugar concentration, pH, fermentation time, agitation rate, and inoculum size. The efficiency and productivity of ethanol can be enhanced by immobilizing the yeast cells. This review highlights the different types of yeast strains, fermentation process, factors affecting bioethanol production and immobilization of yeasts for better bioethanol production.",

     "abstract": "The C. elegans NB327 mutant strain is characterized for the knockdown of the dic-1 gene. The dic-1 gene is homologous to the dice-1 gene in humans, encoding the protein DICE-1 as a tumor suppressor. Absence or under-regulation of the dice-1 gene can be reflected in lung and prostate cancer [17], [18]. This study evaluated the effect of EEAML on the C. elegans NB327 mutant strain. Phenotypic aspects such as morphology, body length, locomotion, and reproductive behaviour were analyzed. It is important to emphasize that the strain presents a phenotype characteristic with respect to egg laying and hatching. Reported studies showed that Annona muricata extract and its active components evidence anti-cancer and anti-tumor effects, through experimentation in vivo and in vitro models. However, neurotoxicity has been reported as a side effect. The results showed that the mutant strain NB327 was exposed to EEAML (5\u00a0mg/ml) concentration, it showed a significant decrease in average locomotion, resulting in 13 undulations in 30\u00a0s. This contrasts with the control strain's 17.5 undulations in 30\u00a0s. Similarly, the number of progenies was reduced from 188 progenies (control strain) to 114 and 92 progenies at the dose of (1\u00a0mg/ml and 5\u00a0mg/m) EEAML. The results of this study suggest that EEAML has a possible neurotoxic effect in concentrations equal to or greater than 5\u00a0mg/ml. Also, it does not have positive effects on the mutant strain of Caenorhabditis elegans NB327 phenotype.",

Cells of the osteoblast-like cell line MC3T3-E1 were initially cultured for six days in HEPES-buffered media with pH ranging from 7.2 to 9.0. Cell count, cellular WST-1 metabolism, and ATP content were analyzed. The three parameters showed a pH optimum around pH 8.4, exceeding the recommended buffer range of HEPES at the alkaline flank. Therefore, only pH 7.2, 7.4, 7.8, and 8.4 media were used in more elaborate, daily investigations to reduce the effects of pH change within the pH control intervals of 24\u00a0h. All parameters exhibited similar pH behaviors, roughly showing increases to 130% and 230% at pH 7.8 and 8.4, as well as decreases to 70% at pH 7.2 when using the pH 7.4 data for reference. To characterize cell differentiation and osteoblastic cell function, cells were cultured at pH 7.4 and under alkaline conditions at pH 7.8 and 8.4 for 14 days. Gene expression and mineralization were evaluated using microarray technology and Alizarin staining. Under alkaline conditions, ATF4, a regulator for terminal differentiation and function as well as DMP1, a potential marker for the transition of osteoblasts into osteocytes, were significantly upregulated, hinting at an accelerated differentiation process. After 21 days, significant mineralization was only detected at alkaline pH. We conclude that elevated pH is beneficial for the cultivation of bone cells and may also provide therapeutic value in bone regeneration therapies.",

The effects of exogenous PP IX on iron metabolism remain to be elucidated. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is implicated in the transport of coproporphyrinogen into the mitochondria for conversion to PP IX. We have demonstrated that PBR-Associated Protein 7 (PAP7) bound to the Iron Responsive Element (IRE) isoform of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). PP IX and PAP7 are ligands for PBR, thus, we hypothesized that PAP7 interact with PP IX via PBR.We have examined in K562 cells, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by PP IX and hemin, the effects of PP IX on the expression of PAP7 and other proteins involved in cellular iron metabolism, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), DMT1, ferritin heavy chain (FTH), c-Myc and C/EBP\u03b1 by western blot and quantitative real time PCR analyses.PP IX significantly decreased mRNA levels of DMT1 (IRE) and (non-IRE) from 4\u00a0h. PP IX markedly decreased protein levels of C/EBP\u03b1, PAP7 and DMT1. In contrast, hemin, which like PP IX also induces K562 cell differentiation, had no effect on PAP7 or DMT1 expression.We hypothesize that PP IX binds to PBR displacing PAP7 protein, which is then degraded, decreasing the interaction of PAP7 with DMT1 (IRE) and resulting in increased turnover of DMT1.These results suggest that exogenous PP IX disrupts iron metabolism by decreasing the protein expression levels of PAP7, DMT1 and C/EBP\u03b1.",

     "abstract": "Since brown adipose tissue (BAT) is involved in thermogenesis using fatty acids as a fuel, BAT activation is a potential strategy for treating obesity and diabetes. However, whether BAT fatty acid combusting capacity is preserved in these conditions has remained unclear. We therefore evaluated expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-associated enzymes and uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) in BAT by western blot using a diet-induced obesity C57BL/6J mouse model. In C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) over 2\u20134 weeks, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2), acyl-CoA thioesterase (Acot) 2, Acot11 and Ucp1 levels were significantly increased compared with baseline and control low-fat diet (LFD)-fed mice. Similar results were obtained in other mouse strains, including ddY, ICR and KK-Ay, but the magnitudes of the increase in Ucp1 level were much smaller than in C57BL/6J mice, with decreased Acot11 levels after HFD-feeding. In C57BL/6J mice, increased levels of these mitochondrial proteins declined to near baseline levels after a longer-term HFD-feeding (20 weeks), concurrent with the accumulation of unilocular, large lipid droplets in brown adipocytes. Extramitochondrial Acot11 and acyl-CoA oxidase remained elevated. Treatment of mice with Wy-14,643 also increased these proteins, but was less effective than 4 week-HFD, suggesting that mechanisms other than peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 were also involved in the upregulation. These results suggest that BAT enhances its fatty acid combusting capacity in response to fat overload, however profound obesity deprives BAT of the responsiveness to fat, possibly via mitochondrial alteration.",

     "abstract": "Many areas of the cerebral cortex process sensory information or coordinate motor output necessary for control of movement. Disturbances in cortical cholinergic system can affect locomotor coordination. Spinal cord injury causes severe motor impairment and disturbances in cholinergic signalling can aggravate the situation. Considering the impact of cortical cholinergic firing in locomotion, we focussed the study in understanding the cholinergic alterations in cerebral cortex during spinal cord injury. The gene expression of key enzymes in cholinergic pathway - acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyl transferase showed significant upregulation in the cerebral cortex of spinal cord injured group compared to control with the fold increase in expression of acetylcholine esterase prominently higher than cholineacetyl transferase. The decreased muscarinic receptor density and reduced immunostaining of muscarinic receptor subtypes along with down regulated gene expression of muscarinic M1 and M3 receptor subtypes accounts for dysfunction of metabotropic acetylcholine receptors in spinal cord injury group. Ionotropic acetylcholine receptor alterations were evident from the decreased gene expression of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors and reduced immunostaining of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors in confocal imaging. Our data pin points the disturbances in cortical cholinergic function due to spinal cord injury; which can augment the locomotor deficits. This can be taken into account while devising a proper therapeutic approach to manage spinal cord injury.",

Identifying the gene performing 6\u03b2-hydroxylation would be useful for \u2018humanizing\u2019 the bile acid profile in mice for studies of the interaction between bile acids, gut microbiota, and host metabolism. We investigated the formation of MCAs in primary murine hepatocytes and found that \u03b1MCA is synthesized from CDCA and \u03b2MCA from UDCA. It is commonly assumed that the P450-enzyme CYP3A11 catalyzes 6\u03b2-hydroxylation of bile acids, thus we hypothesized that mice without the Cyp3a11 gene would lack MCAs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed bile acid profiles in Cyp3a deficient mice, which lack 7 genes in the Cyp3a gene cluster including Cyp3a11, and compared them with wild-type littermate controls. Bile acid composition in liver, gallbladder, caecum and serum from Cyp3a knock out mice and wild-type littermate controls was analyzed with UPLC-MS/MS and revealed no major differences in bile acid composition.

While recent studies have revealed non-redundant roles for basophils in various immune responses, basophil-derived effector molecules, including lipid mediators, remain poorly characterized, compared to mast cell-derived ones. Here we analyzed and compared eicosanoids produced by mouse basophils and mast cells when stimulated with IgE plus allergens. The production of 5-LOX metabolites such as LTB4 and 5-HETE was detected as early as 0.5\u00a0h post-stimulation in both cell types, even though their amounts were much smaller in basophils than in mast cells. In contrast, basophils and mast cells showed distinct time course in the production of COX metabolites, including PGD2, PGE2 and 11-HETE. Their production by mast cells was detected at both 0.5 and 6\u00a0h post-stimulation while that by basophils was detectable only at 6\u00a0h. Of note, mast cells showed 8\u20139 times higher levels of COX-1 than did basophils at the resting status. In contrast to unaltered COX-1 expression with or without stimulation, COX-2 expression was up-regulated in both cell types upon activation. Importantly, when activated, basophils expressed 4\u20135 times higher levels of COX-2 than did mast cells. In accordance with these findings, the late-phase production of the COX metabolites by basophils was completely ablated by COX-2 inhibitor whereas the early-phase production by mast cells was blocked by COX-1 but not COX-2 inhibitor.

One strategy for the study of the physicochemical properties of lipid rafts in model membrane systems has been the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), but until now this spectroscopic method has not been considered a clinically relevant tool. We performed a proof-of-concept study to test the feasibility of using NMR to study lipid rafts in human tissues. Platelets were selected as a cost-effective and minimally invasive model system in which lipid rafts have previously been studied using other approaches. Platelets were isolated from plasma of medication-free adult research participants (n=13) and lysed with homogenization and sonication. Lipid-enriched fractions were obtained using a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Association of lipid fractions with GM1 ganglioside was tested using HRP-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit dot blot assays. 1H high resolution magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (HRMAS NMR) spectra obtained with single-pulse Bloch decay experiments yielded spectral linewidths and intensities as a function of temperature. Rates of lipid lateral diffusion that reported on raft size were measured with a two-dimensional stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode NMR experiment. We found that lipid fractions at 10\u201335% sucrose density associated with GM1 ganglioside, a marker for lipid rafts. NMR spectra of the membrane phospholipids featured a prominent \u2018centerband\u2019 peak associated with the hydrocarbon chain methylene resonance at 1.3\u00a0ppm; the linewidth (full width at half-maximum intensity) of this \u2018centerband\u2019 peak, together with the ratio of intensities between the centerband and \u2018spinning sideband\u2019 peaks, agreed well with values reported previously for lipid rafts in model membranes. Decreasing temperature produced decreases in the 1.3\u00a0ppm peak intensity and a discontinuity at ~18\u00a0\u00b0C, for which the simplest explanation is a phase transition from Ld to Lo phases indicative of raft formation. Rates of lateral diffusion of the acyl chain lipid signal at 1.3\u00a0ppm, a quantitative measure of microdomain size, were consistent with lipid molecules organized in rafts. These results show that HRMAS NMR can characterize lipid microdomains in human platelets, a methodological advance that could be extended to other tissues in which membrane biochemistry may have physiological and pathophysiological relevance.",

Using crude enzyme preparations, competitive inhibition by 1\u20135\u00a0mM imidazole was observed under both kinetic conditions tested. However, when imidazole was added to reaction mixtures at 0.125\u20130.250\u00a0mM, we detected a significant enzyme activation. To further inspect this effect exerted by imidazole, \u03b2-glucosidase was purified to homogeneity. Two enzyme isoforms were isolated, i.e. a full-length monomer, and a dimer containing a full-length and a truncated subunit. Dimeric \u03b2-glucosidase was found to perform much better than the monomeric enzyme, independently of the kinetic conditions used to assay enzyme activity. In addition, the sensitivity towards imidazole was found to differ between the two isoforms. While monomeric enzyme was indeed found to be relatively insensitive to imidazole, dimeric \u03b2-glucosidase was observed to be significantly activated by 0.125\u20130.250\u00a0mM imidazole under pre-steady-state conditions. Further, steady-state assays revealed that the addition of 0.125\u00a0mM imidazole to reaction mixtures increases the Km of dimeric enzyme from 2.3 to 6.7\u00a0mM. The activation of \u03b2-glucosidase dimer by imidazole is proposed to be exerted via a conformational transition poising the enzyme towards proficient catalysis.",

Therefore, in the present study, we examined the effect of BPA on compound action potentials (CAPs) recorded from the frog sciatic nerve using the air-gap method. Treatment of the sciatic nerve with BPA (0.5\u00a0mM) for 20\u00a0min reduced the peak amplitude of the CAP by approximately 60% in a partially reversible manner. The reduction in the CAP peak amplitude was concentration-dependent, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.31\u00a0mM. This effect of BPA was unaffected by an estrogen-receptor antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which by itself reduced CAP peak amplitude, with an IC50 value of 0.26\u00a0mM (comparable to that of BPA). The natural estrogen 17\u03b2-estradiol, at the highest dissolvable concentration (0.05\u00a0mM), had an effect similar to that of BPA. The IC50 value of BPA was comparable to those of some local anesthetics in inhibiting frog CAPs. Our findings suggest that BPA inhibits nerve conduction in a manner independent of estrogen receptors. This action of BPA may underlie, at least in part, the neurotoxicity of the compound.",

The identified prime candidate PAR-1 agonist was subsequently analysed for PAR-1-dependent induction of fibrosis in vitro.Of the 553 proteases expressed in the human genome, 247 qualified as potential PAR-1 agonists of which 71 were significantly expressed above background in diabetic glomeruli. The recently identified PAR-1 agonist plasmin(ogen), together with its physiological activator tissue plasminogen activator, were among the highest expressed proteases. Plasmin did however not induce mesangial proliferation and/or fibronectin deposition in vitro. In a PAR-1 independent manner, plasmin even reduced fibronectin deposition.Expression profiling identified plasmin as potential endogenous PAR-1 agonist driving DN. Instead of inducing fibronectin expression, plasmin however reduced mesangial fibronectin deposition in vitro.

     "publication date": "07-2017",
     "abstract": "The cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway is implicated in the development of alcohol use disorder. Previous studies have demonstrated that ethanol enhances the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) in an isoform specific manner; AC7 is most enhanced by ethanol, and regions responsible for enhancement by ethanol are located in the cytoplasmic domains of the AC7 protein. We hypothesize that ethanol modulates AC activity by directly interacting with the protein and that ethanol effects on AC can be studied using recombinant AC in vitro. AC recombinant proteins containing only the C1a or C2 domains of AC7 and AC9 individually were expressed in bacteria, and purified. The purified recombinant AC proteins retained enzymatic activity and isoform specific alcohol responsiveness. The combination of the C1a or C2 domains of AC7 maintained the same alcohol cutoff point as full-length AC7. We also find that the recombinant AC7 responds to alcohol differently in the presence of different combinations of activators including MnCl2, forskolin, and Gs\u03b1. Through a series of concentration-response experiments and curve fitting, the values for maximum activities, Hill coefficients, and EC50 were determined in the absence and presence of butanol as a surrogate of ethanol. The results suggest that alcohol modulates AC activity by directly interacting with the AC protein and that the alcohol interaction with the AC protein occurs at multiple sites with positive cooperativity. This study indicates that the recombinant AC proteins expressed in bacteria can provide a useful model system to investigate the mechanism of alcohol action on their activity.",

LR8 mRNA levels were higher in fibrotic lungs. In this study we assessed LR8 production in human tissues and determined if the distribution of fibroblasts producing LR8 is affected in fibrosis. Normal and fibrotic tissue sections from human liver, lung and kidneys were immunostained with antibodies to LR8 and examined for the presence of fibroblasts staining positively and negatively. The cells were also examined for co-expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA), a marker for myofibroblasts. The results showed that LR8 was expressed by fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, bile duct cells, pulmonary alveolar cells and distal and proximal kidney tubule cells. Connective tissues of normal and fibrotic tissues contained fibroblasts staining positively and negatively with anti- LR8 antibody. The number of LR8-positive cells was higher in fibrotic tissues, but differences were not statistically significant. Fibroblasts producing both LR8 and SMA were present in higher numbers in fibrotic tissues as compared to normal tissues and the differences were statistically significant (p<0.05). Our results show that fibroblast subtypes differing in LR8 expression are present in human tissues, and that in fibrotic tissues cells co-expressing LR8 and SMA are present. Our results indicate that LR8 expressing cells may participate in the early stages of fibrotic diseases and that fibroblasts expressing LR8, not LR8 negative cells, have potential to become myofibroblasts in fibrotic tissues.",

TEM images reveal distinct cracks in elastic fibers as a result of UV-A irradiation and histological measurements show a disruption in the regular array of elastic fibers present in unirradiated samples; elastic fibers appear shorter, highly fragmented, and thinner after UV-A treatment. Magic angle spinning 13C NMR was applied to investigate possible secondary structural changes or dynamics in the irradiated samples; our spectra reveal no differences between UV-A irradiated and non-irradiated samples. Lastly, MALDI mass spectrometry indicates that the concentration of desmosine, which forms cross-links in elastin, is observed to decrease by 11 % following 9 days of continuous UV-A irradiation, in comparison to unirradiated samples. These alterations presumably play a significant role in the loss of elasticity observed in UV exposed skin.",

The aim of this study was to provide enriched conditions for RPE cell culture through the production of a BrM-like matrix. Our hypothesis was that a human RPE cell line would deposit an extracellular matrix (ECM) resembling BrM. The composition and structure of ECM deposited by ARPE19 cells (ARPE19-ECM) was characterized. To produce ARPE19-ECM, ARPE19 cells were cultured in the presence dextran sulphate. ARPE19-ECM was decellularized using deoxycholate and characterized by immunostaining and western blot analysis. Primary human RPE and induced pluripotent stem cells were seeded onto ARPE19-ECM or geltrex coated surfaces and examined by microscopy or RT-PCR. Culture of ARPE19 cells with dextran sulphate promoted nuclear localization of SOX2, formation of tight junctions and deposition of ECM. ARPE19 cells deposited ECM proteins found in the inner layers of BrM, including fibronectin, vitronectin, collagens IV and V as well as laminin-alpha-5, but not those found in the middle elastic layer (elastin) or the outer layers (collagen VI). ARPE19-ECM promoted pigmentation in human RPE and pluripotent stem cell cultures. Expression of RPE65 was significantly increased on ARPE19-ECM compared with geltrex in differentiating pluripotent stem cell cultures. ARPE19 cells deposit ECM with a composition and structure similar to BrM in the retina. Molecular cues present in ARPE19-ECM promote the acquisition and maintenance of the RPE phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate a simple method for generating a BrM-like surface for enriched RPE cell cultures.",

Although many studies have described in vitro liver models for drug discovery, to date, no model has been described that can stably maintain liver function. Here, we used a unique, scaffold-free 3D bio-printing technology to construct a small portion of liver tissue that could stably maintain drug, glucose, and lipid metabolism, in addition to bile acid secretion. This bio-printed normal human liver tissue maintained expression of several kinds of hepatic drug transporters and metabolic enzymes that functioned for several weeks. The bio-printed liver tissue displayed glucose production via cAMP/protein kinase A signaling, which could be suppressed with insulin. Bile acid secretion was also observed from the printed liver tissue, and it accumulated in the culture medium over time. We observed both bile duct and sinusoid-like structures in the bio-printed liver tissue, which suggested that bile acid secretion occurred via a sinusoid-hepatocyte-bile duct route. These results demonstrated that our bio-printed liver tissue was unique, because it exerted diverse liver metabolic functions for several weeks. In future, we expect our bio-printed liver tissue to be applied to developing new models that can be used to improve preclinical predictions of long-term toxicity in humans, generate novel targets for metabolic liver disease, and evaluate biliary excretion in drug development.",

The genetic background that predisposes Japanese individuals to type 2 diabetes mellitus is under study. Recent genetic studies demonstrated that the locus mapped in macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA) increases the susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus in East Asians, including Japanese individuals. MAEA encodes a protein that plays a role in erythroblast enucleation and in the normal differentiation of erythroid cells and macrophages. However, the contribution of MAEA to type 2 diabetes mellitus remains unknown. In this study, to overexpress MAEA in the mouse liver and primary mouse hepatocytes, we generated a MAEA-expressing adenovirus (Ad) vector using a novel Ad vector exhibiting significantly lower hepatotoxicity (Ad-MAEA). Blood glucose and insulin levels in Ad-MAEA-treated mice were comparable to those in control Ad-treated mice. Primary mouse hepatocytes transduced with Ad-MAEA showed lower levels of expression of gluconeogenesis genes than those transduced with the control Ad vector. Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4\u03b1 (HNF-4\u03b1) mRNA expression in primary mouse hepatocytes was also suppressed by MAEA overexpression. These results suggest that MAEA overexpression attenuates hepatic gluconeogenesis, which could potentially lead to improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus.",

In mice, the renal Slc13a1 sulfate transporter maintains high maternal circulating levels of sulfate in pregnancy, and the placental Slc13a4 sulfate transporter mediates sulfate supply to the fetus. Both of these genes have been linked to severe embryonal defects and fetal loss in mice. However, the clinical significance of SLC13A1 and SLC13A4 in human gestation is unknown. One approach towards understanding the potential involvement of these genes in human fetal pathologies is to use an animal model, such as the pig, which mimics the developmental trajectory of the human fetus more closely than the previously studied mouse models. In this study, we determined the tissue distribution of pig SLC13A1 and SLC13A4 mRNA, and compared the gene, cDNA and protein sequences of the pig, human and mouse homologues. Pig SLC13A1 mRNA was expressed in the ileum and kidney, whereas pig SLC13A4 mRNA was expressed in the placenta, choroid plexus and eye, which is similar to the tissue distribution in human and mouse. The pig SLC13A1 gene contains 15 exons spread over 76\u00a0kb on chromosome 8, and encodes a protein of 594 amino acids that shares 90% and 85% identity with the human and mouse homologues, respectively.

In this study, seven different combinations of 3 dimensional (3D) novel nanocomposite porous structured scaffolds were fabricated to rebuild SBDs using an extraordinary blend of cockle shells (CaCo3) nanoparticles (CCN), gelatin, dextran and dextrin to structure an ideal bone scaffold with adequate degradation rate using the Freeze Drying Method (FDM) and labeled as 5211, 5400, 6211, 6300, 7101, 7200 and 8100. The micron sized cockle shells powder obtained (75\u00a0\u00b5m) was made into nanoparticles using mechano-chemical, top-down method of nanoparticles synthesis with the presence of the surfactant BS-12 (dodecyl dimethyl bataine). The phase purity and crystallographic structures, the chemical functionality and the thermal characterization of the scaffolds\u2019 powder were recognized using X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) respectively. Characterizations of the scaffolds were assessed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Degradation Manner, Water Absorption Test, Swelling Test, Mechanical Test and Porosity Test. Top-down method produced cockle shell nanoparticles having averagely range 37.8\u00b13\u201355.2\u00b19\u00a0nm in size, which were determined using Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). A mainly aragonite form of calcium carbonate was identified in both XRD and FTIR for all scaffolds, while the melting (Tm) and transition (Tg) temperatures were identified using DSC with the range of Tm 62.4\u201375.5\u00a0\u00b0C and of Tg 230.6\u2013232.5\u00a0\u00b0C. The newly prepared scaffolds were with the following characteristics: (i) good biocompatibility and biodegradability, (ii) appropriate surface chemistry and (iii) highly porous, with interconnected pore network. Engineering analyses showed that scaffold 5211 possessed 3D interconnected homogenous porous structure with a porosity of about 49%, pore sizes ranging from 8.97 to 337\u00a0\u00b5m, mechanical strength 20.3\u00a0MPa, Young's Modulus 271\u00b163\u00a0MPa and enzymatic degradation rate 22.7 within 14 days.",

     "abstract": "Topoisomerase poisons are important drugs for the management of human malignancies. Nitric oxide (\u2022NO), a physiological signaling molecule, induces nitrosylation (or nitrosation) of many cellular proteins containing cysteine thiol groups, altering their cellular functions. Topoisomerases contain several thiol groups which are important for their activity and are also targets for nitrosation by nitric oxide.Here, we have evaluated the roles of \u2022NO/\u2022NO-derived species in the stability and activity of topo II (\u03b1 and \u03b2) both in vitro and in human MCF-7 breast tumor cells. Furthermore, we have examined the effects of \u2022NO on the ATPase activity of topo II.Treatment of purified topo II\u03b1 and \u03b2 with propylamine propylamine nonoate (PPNO), an NO donor, resulted in inhibition of the catalytic activity of topo II. Furthermore, PPNO significantly inhibited topo II-dependent ATP hydrolysis. \u2022NO-induced inhibition of these topo II (\u03b1 and \u03b2) functions resulted in a decrease in cleavable complex formation in MCF-7 cells in the presence of m-AMSA and XK469 and induced significant resistance to both drugs in MCF-7 cells.PPNO treatment resulted in the nitrosation of the topo II protein in MCF-7 cancer cells and inhibited both catalytic-, and ATPase activities of topo II. Furthermore, PPNO significantly affected the DNA damage and cytotoxicity of m-AMSA and XK469 in MCF-7 tumor cells.As tumors express nitric oxide synthase and generate \u2022NO, inhibition of topo II functions by \u2022NO/\u2022NO-derived species could render tumors resistant to certain topo II-poisons in the clinic.",

     "abstract": "The AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1) kinase is a member of most frequently activated proliferation and survival signaling pathway in cancer. Recently, hyperactivation of AKT1, due to functional point mutation in the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT1 gene, has been found to be associated with human colorectal, breast and ovarian cancer. Thus, considering its crucial role in cellular signaling pathway, a functional analysis of missense mutations of AKT1 gene was undertaken in this study. Twenty nine nsSNPs (non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism) within coding region of AKT1 gene were selected for our investigation and six SNPs were found to be deleterious by combinatorial predictions of various computational tools. RMSD values were calculated for the mutant models which predicted four substitutions (E17K, E319G, D32E and A255T) to be highly deleterious. The insight of the structural attribute was gained through analysis of, secondary structures, solvent accessibility and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis which confirmed one missense mutation (E17K) to be highly deleterious nsSNPs. In conclusion, the investigated gene AKT1 has twenty nine SNPs in the coding region and through progressive analysis using different bioinformatics tools one highly deleterious SNP with rs121434592 was profiled. Thus, results of this study can pave a new platform to sort nsSNPs for several important regulatory genes that can be undertaken for the confirmation of their phenotype and their correlation with diseased status in case control studies.",

Although MAGE-A10 has been characterized for some time and is generally associated to metastasis its function remains unknown. Here we describe experiments using as models oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines displaying increasing metastatic potential (LN1 and LN2). These cell lines were transduced with lentivirus particles coding for short hairpin against MAGE-A10 mRNA. Repression of MAGE-A10 expression in LN2 cells altered their morphology and impaired growth of LN1 and LN2 cell lines. Furthermore, repression of MAGE-A10 expression increased cell-cell and cell matrix adhesion. Furthermore shMAGEA10 cells were shown to assemble aberrantly on a 3D culture system (microspheroids) when compared to cells transduced with the control scrambled construct. Cell migration was inhibited in knocked down cells as revealed by two different migration assays, wound healing and a phagokinetic track motility assay. In vitro invasion assay using a leiomyoma tissue derived matrix (myogel) showed that shMAGEA10 LN1 and shMAGEA10 LN2 cells displayed a significantly diminished ability to penetrate the matrices. Concomitantly, the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin and vimentin genes was analyzed. shMAGEA10 activated the expression of E-cadherin and repression N-cadherin and vimentin transcription.Taken together the results indicate that MAGE-A10 exerts its effects at the level of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) presumably by regulating the expression of adhesion molecules.",

     "abstract": "The uncoupling proteins (UCPs) leak protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus uncoupling the proton gradient from ATP synthesis. The main known physiological role for this is heat generation by UCP1 in brown adipose tissue. However, UCPs are also believed to be important for protection against reactive oxygen species, fine-tuning of metabolism and have been suggested to be involved in disease states such as obesity, diabetes and cancer.Structural studies of UCPs have long been hampered by difficulties in sample preparation with neither expression in yeast nor refolding from inclusion bodies in E. coli yielding sufficient amounts of pure and stable protein. In this study, we have developed a protocol for cell-free expression of human UCP1, 2 and 3, resulting in 1\u00a0mg pure protein per 20\u00a0mL of expression media. Lauric acid, a natural UCP ligand, significantly improved protein thermal stability and was therefore added during purification. Secondary structure characterisation using circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed the proteins to consist of mostly \u03b1-helices, as expected. All three UCPs were able to bind GDP, a well-known physiological inhibitor, as shown by the Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) technique, suggesting that the proteins are in a natively folded state.",

     "abstract": "An aqueous electrohydrodynamic (EHD) floating liquid bridge is a unique environment for studying the influence of protonic currents (mA\u00a0cm\u22122) in strong DC electric fields (kV\u00a0cm\u22121) on the behavior of microorganisms. It forms in between two beakers filled with water when high-voltage is applied to these beakers. We recently discovered that exposure to this bridge has a stimulating effect on Escherichia coli.. In this work we show that the survival is due to a natural Faraday cage effect of the cell wall of these microorganisms using a simple 2D model. We further confirm this hypothesis by measuring and simulating the behavior of Bacillus subtilis subtilis, Neochloris oleoabundans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and THP-1 monocytes. Their behavior matches the predictions of the model: cells without a natural Faraday cage like algae and monocytes are mostly killed and weakened, whereas yeast and Bacillus subtilis subtilis survive. The effect of the natural Faraday cage is twofold: First, it diverts the current from passing through the cell (and thereby killing it); secondly, because it is protonic it maintains the osmotic pressure in the cell wall, thereby mitigating cytolysis which would normally occur due to the low osmotic pressure of the surrounding medium. The method presented provides the basis for selective disinfection of solutions containing different microorganisms.",

This study evaluated the effect of sub-chronic exposure of rats to p-DNB on cellular redox balance, hepatic and renal integrity.Forty eight male Wistar rats weighing 160\u2013180\u00a0g were administered 50, 75, 1000 and 2000\u00a0mg/kg b.wt (body weight) of p-DNB or an equivalent volume of vehicle (control) orally and topically for 14 days. After the period of treatment, the activities of kidney and liver catalase (CAT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) as well as extent of renal and hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) were determined. Serum ALP activity and plasma urea concentration were also evaluated.Compared with control animals, p-DNB -administered rats showed decrease in the body and relative kidney and liver weights as well as increased renal and hepatic hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation levels accompanied by decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities. However, p-DNB caused a significant increase in plasma urea concentration and serum, liver and kidney ALP activities relative to control. In addition, p-DNB caused periportal infiltration, severe macro vesicular steatosis and hepatic necrosis in the liver.Our findings show that sub-chronic oral and sub-dermal administration of p-DNB may produce hepato-nephrotoxicity through oxidative stress.",

The antioxidant effect of highly diluted fullerenol solutions on bacterial cells was attributed to hormesis phenomenon; the detoxification was concerned with stimulation of adaptive cellular response under low-dose exposures. Sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA was carried out; it did not reveal mutations in bacterial DNA.

     "abstract": "Cancer cell migration and invasion involves temporal and spatial regulation of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which is regulated by the WASP family of proteins such as N-WASP (Neural- Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome Protein). We have previously shown that expression of N-WASP was increased under hypoxic conditions. In order to characterize the regulation of N-WASP expression, we constructed an N-WASP promoter driven GFP reporter construct, N-WASPpro-GFP. Transfection of N-WASPpro-GFP construct and plasmid expressing HiF1\u03b1 (Hypoxia Inducible factor 1\u03b1) enhanced the expression of GFP suggesting that increased expression of N-WASP under hypoxic conditions is mediated by HiF1\u03b1. Sequence analysis of the N-WASP promoter revealed the presence of two hypoxia response elements (HREs) characterized by the consensus sequence 5\u2032-GCGTG-3\u2032 at -132\u00a0bp(HRE1) and at -662\u00a0bp(HRE2) relative to transcription start site (TSS). Site-directed mutagenesis of HRE1(-132) but not HRE2(-662) abolished the HiF1\u03b1 induced activation of N-WASP promoter. Similarly ChIP assay demonstrated that HiF1\u03b1 bound to HRE1(-132) but not HRE2(-662) under hypoxic condition. MDA-MB-231 cells but not MDA-MB-231KD cells treated with hypoxia mimicking agent, DMOG showed enhanced gelatin degradation. Similarly MDA-MB-231KD(N-WASPpro-N-WASPR) cells expressing N-WASPR under the transcriptional regulation of WT N-WASPpro but not MDA-MB-231KD(N-WASPproHRE1-N-WASPR) cells expressing N-WASPR under the transcriptional regulation of N-WASPproHRE1 showed enhanced gelatin degradation when treated with DMOG. Thus indicating the importance of N-WASP in hypoxia induced invadopodia formation. Thus, our data demonstrates that hypoxia-induced activation of N-WASP expression is mediated by interaction of HiF1\u03b1 with the HRE1(-132) and explains the role of N-WASP in hypoxia induced invadopodia formation.",

     "abstract": "It has been known that some Streptomyces species, including the model strain Streptomyces coelicolor, are vulnerable to visible light. Much evidence demonstrated that the phototoxicity induced by visible light is a consequence of the formation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are potentially harmful to cells. In this study, we found that \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG) has a protective role against the phototoxicity in S. coelicolor. It could be because that \u03b1-KG can detoxify the ROS with the concomitant formation of succinate, which mediates the cells getting into anaerobiosis to produce more NADH and maintain intracellular redox homeostasis, a situation that was demonstrated by overexpressing gdhA in S. coelicolor. This finding, therefore, connects the central metabolites with the bacterial resistance against phototoxicity effect induced by visible light.",

     "abstract": "Basophils, which are the rarest granulocytes, play crucial roles in protective immunity against parasites and development of allergic disorders. Although immunoglobulin (Ig)E-dependent responses via receptor for IgE (Fc\u03b5RI) in basophils have been extensively studied, little is known about cell surface molecules that are selectively expressed on this cell subset to utilize the elimination in vivo through treatment with monoclonal antibody (mAb). Since CD200 receptor 3 (CD200R3) was exclusively expressed on basophils and mast cells (MCs) using a microarray screening, we have generated anti-CD200R3 mAb recognizing CD200R3A. In this study we examined the expression pattern of CD200R3A on leukocytes, and the influence of the elimination of basophils by anti-CD200R3A mAb on allergic responses. Flow cytometric analysis showed that CD200R3A was primarily expressed on basophils and MCs, but not on other leukocytes. Administration with anti-CD200R3A mAb led to the prominent specific depletion of tissue-resident and circulating basophils, but not MCs. Furthermore, in vivo depletion of basophils ameliorated IgE-mediated systemic and local anaphylaxis. Taken together, these findings suggest that CD200R3A is reliable cell surface marker for basophils in vivo, and targeting this unique molecule with mAb for the elimination of basophils may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in ameliorating the allergic diseases.",

The hypothesized origin of these effects is nanoporation of the plasma membrane (PM) followed by transmembrane diffusion of extracellular fluid and disassembly of cortical actin structures. This investigation will provide evidence that shows passive movement of fluid into the cell through nanopores and increase of intracellular osmotic pressure are not solely responsible for this observed phenomena. We demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) depletion and hydrolysis are critical steps in the chain reaction leading to cellular blebbing and swelling. PIP2 is heavily involved in osmoregulation by modulation of ion channels and also serves as an intracellular membrane anchor to cortical actin and phospholipase C (PLC). Given the rather critical role that PIP2 depletion appears to play in the response of cells to nsPEF exposure, it remains unclear how its downstream effects and, specifically, ion channel regulation may contribute to cellular swelling, blebbing, and unknown mechanisms of the lasting \u201cpermeabilization\u201d of the PM.",

However, differences in the acylcarnitine profile and/or changes in gene expression and protein abundance of CRAT in myotubes obtained from obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and glucose-tolerant obese and lean controls remain unclear. The objective of the study was to examine whether myotubes from obese patients with T2DM express differences in gene expression and protein abundance of CRAT and in acylcarnitine species pre-cultured under glucose and insulin concentrations similar to those observed in healthy individuals in the over-night fasted, resting state. Primary myotubes obtained from obese persons with or without T2DM and lean controls (n=9 in each group) were cultivated and harvested for LC-MS-based profiling of acylcarnitines. The mRNA expression and protein abundance of CRAT were determined by qPCR and Western Blotting, respectively. Our results suggest that the mRNA levels and protein abundance of CRAT were similar between groups. Of the 14 different acylcarnitine species measured by LC-MS, the levels of palmitoylcarnitine (C16) and octadecanoylcarnitine (C18) were slightly reduced in myotubes derived from T2DM patients (p<0.05) compared to glucose-tolerant obese and lean controls.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) is a nuclear receptor for 15d-PGJ2, and mediates the cytotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2 in many cancerous cells. However, 15d-PGJ2 induces apoptosis independently of PPAR\u03b3 in human RCC cell line such as Caki-2. In the present study, we found that 15d-PGJ2 ameliorated the chemoresistance to one of anthracycline antibiotics, doxorubicin, in Caki-2 cells. Doxorubicin alone exhibited weak cytotoxicity at the concentrations effective for other cancer cells such as Hela cells. In addition, it did not activate caspase 3. However, the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was increased remarkably and accompanied with the caspase- 3 activation in the presence of 15d-PGJ2. Doxorubicin alone damaged plasma membrane, and the combined application of 15d-PGJ2 with doxorubicin increased the membrane permeability slightly. PPAR\u03b3 was involved in neither the anti-tumor activity nor the synergistic effect of 15d-PGJ2. 15d-PGJ2 induces apoptosis in Caki-2 cells via suppressing the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. The effect of PI3K inhibitor on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was additive, but not synergistic. Although the PI3K inhibitor mimicked the cytotoxicity of 15d-PGJ2, it might not be involved in the synergism between 15d-PGJ2 and doxorubicin. In conclusion, 15d-PGJ2 enhanced the chemosensitivity of doxorubicin via the pathway independent of PPAR\u03b3 and PI3K.",

To clarify the function of CSPG in blood vessel formation, we tested salmon nasal cartilage proteoglycan (PG), a member of the aggrecan family of CSPG, for endothelial capillary-like tube formation. Treatment with salmon PG inhibited endothelial cell adhesion and in vitro tube formation. The anti-angiogenic activity was derived from CS in the salmon PG but not the core protein. Salmon PG also reduced matrix metalloproteinase expression and inhibited angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane. All of these data support an anti-angiogenic role for CSPG in cartilage.",

Achievements in targeted therapeutics have not been observed for over 30 years. Therefore, the underlying disease biology and novel targets urgently require a better understanding. Epigenetic regulation is deeply involved in the cellular plasticity that could shift tumor cells to the malignant phenotype. We have focused on a histone modifier, LSD1, that is overexpressed in SCLC and is a potent therapeutic target. Interestingly, the LSD1 splice variant LSD1+8a, the expression of which has been reported to be restricted to neural tissue, was detected and was involved in the expression of neuroendocrine marker genes in SCLC cell lines. Cells with high expression of LSD1+8a were resistant to CDDP and LSD1 inhibitor.

This study was performed to test the ability of Hsp60 from H. pylori to function as a molecular chaperone under mildly acidic conditions.

Hsp60 was found to undergo a conformational change within this pH range. It was also found that exposure of hydrophobic surfaces of Hsp60 is significant and that their exposure is increased under acidic conditions.

The double reciprocal plot of the varying NADPH concentrations displays a downward concave shape, while the NADPH binding curves gave Hill coefficients of less than 1. These data suggest that negative cooperativity occurs between the two identical monomers. The pre steady-state Abs420 versus time trace revealed biphasic kinetics, with a fast phase (hydride transfer) and a slow phase. The fast phase displayed an increased rate constant as side chain length decreased. The rate constant for the second phase, remained ~2\u00a0s\u22121 for each variant. Our data suggest that I135 plays a key role in sustaining the donor-acceptor distance between the two cofactors, thereby regulating the rate at which the hydride is transferred from FOH2 to NADP+. Therefore, Fno is a dynamic enzyme that regulates NADPH production.",

This underlines the role of these enzymes in plant responses to environmental stresses. However, information concerning the PLD involvement in the widely cultivated and economically important cotton plant responses is very limited. The aim of this report was to study the activity of conventional cotton PLD and its participation in plant responses to mechanical wounding, which resembles both biotic and abiotic stresses. PLD\u03b1 activity was identified and further characterized by transphosphatidylation reaction. Upon wounding, cotton leaf responses consist of an acute in vitro increase of PLD\u03b1 activity in both wounded and systemic tissue. However, determination of the in vivo PtdOH levels under the same wounding conditions revealed a rapid PtdOH formation only in wounded leaves and a late response of a PtdOH increase in both tissues. \u0395xpression analysis of PLD\u03b1 and PLD\u03b4 isoforms showed mRNA accumulation of both isoforms in the wounded tissue, but only PLD\u03b4 exerts a high and sustainable expression in systemic leaves, indicating that this isoform is mainly responsible for the systemic wound-induced PtdOH production. Therefore, our data suggest that PLD\u03b1 and PLD\u03b4 isoforms are involved in different steps in cotton wound signalling.",

However, it is known that there are variable patient responses to glucocorticoid treatment; there are responders and non-responders, or those that need higher dosages. Polymorphisms in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) have been implicated in this variability. In this study, ninety-seven volunteers were surveyed for polymorphisms in the human GR-alpha (hGR\u03b1), the accepted biologically active reference isoform. One isoform identified in our survey, named hGR DL-2, had four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one synonymous and three non-synonymous, and a four base pair deletion resulting in a frame shift and early termination to produce a 743 amino acid putative protein. hGR DL-2 had a decrease in transactivation potential of more than 90%. Upon further analysis of the individual SNPs and deletion, one SNP, A829G, which results in a lysine to glutamic acid amino acid change at position 277, was found to increase the transactivation potential of hGR more than eight times the full-length reference. Furthermore, the hGR\u03b1-A829G isoform had a differential hyperactive response to various exogenous steroids. Increasing our knowledge as to how various SNPs affect hGR activity may help in understanding the unpredictable patient response to steroid treatment, and is a step towards personalizing patient care.",

     "abstract": "Autoinflammatory diseases occupy one of a group of primary immunodeficiency diseases that are generally thought to be caused by mutation of genes responsible for innate immunity, rather than by acquired immunity. Mutations related to\u00a0autoinflammatory diseases occur in 12 genes. For example, low-level somatic mosaic NLRP3 mutations underlie chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular syndrome (CINCA), also known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID). In current clinical practice, clinical genetic testing plays an important role in providing patients with quick, definite diagnoses. To increase the availability of such testing, low-cost high-throughput gene-analysis systems are required, ones that not only have the sensitivity to detect even low-level somatic mosaic mutations, but also can operate simply in a clinical setting. To this end, we developed a simple method that employs two-step tailed PCR and an NGS system, MiSeq platform, to detect mutations in all coding exons of the 12 genes responsible for autoinflammatory diseases. Using this amplicon sequencing system, we amplified a total of 234 amplicons derived from the 12 genes with multiplex PCR. This was done simultaneously and in one test tube. Each sample was distinguished by an index sequence of second PCR primers following PCR amplification. With our procedure and tips for reducing PCR amplification bias, we were able to analyze 12 genes from 25 clinical samples in one MiSeq run. Moreover, with the certified primers designed by our short program\u2014which detects and avoids common SNPs in gene-specific PCR primers\u2014we used this system for routine genetic testing. Our optimized procedure uses a simple protocol, which can easily be followed by virtually any office medical staff. Because of the small PCR amplification bias, we can analyze simultaneously several clinical DNA samples with low cost and can obtain sufficient read numbers to detect a low level of somatic mosaic mutations.",

However, it is unclear whether circadian regulation also extends to intracellular signaling pathways in the cardiac and skeletal muscles. Here, we examined circadian variation in the intracellular mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways, which regulate protein synthesis in rat cardiac and skeletal muscles. Seven-week-old male Wistar rats were assigned to six groups: Zeitgeber time (ZT) 2, ZT6, ZT10, ZT14, ZT18, and ZT22 (ZT0, lights on; ZT12, lights off). The cardiac, plantaris, and soleus muscles were removed after a 12-h fasting period, and signal transducers involved in protein synthesis (mTOR, p70S6K, and ERK) were analyzed by western blotting. Circadian rhythms of signal transducers were observed in both cardiac (mTOR, p70S6K, and ERK) and plantaris (p70S6K and ERK) muscles (p<0.05), but not in the soleus muscle. In the cardiac muscle, the phosphorylation rate of mTOR was significantly higher at ZT6 (peak) than at ZT18 (bottom), and the phosphorylation rate of p70S6K was significantly higher at ZT2 (peak) than at ZT18 (bottom). In contrast, in the plantaris muscle, the phosphorylation rate of ERK was significantly lower at ZT2 (bottom) than at ZT18 (peak). Our data suggested that protein synthesis via mTOR/p70S6K and ERK signaling molecules exhibits circadian variation in rat cardiac and fast-type plantaris muscles.",

To facilitate sample preparation and perform detailed structural characterization of the complex between HBx and Bcl-xL, we designed and purified a recombinant HBx BH3-like motif-linker-Bcl-xL fusion protein produced in E. coli. The fusion protein was characterized by size exclusion chromatography, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Our results show that the fusion protein is a monomer in aqueous solution, forms a stable intramolecular complex, and likely retains the native conformation of the complex between Bcl-xL and the HBx BH3-like motif. Furthermore, the HBx BH3-like motif of the intramolecular complex forms an \u03b1-helix.

We conducted studies utilizing RNA-sequencing in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and OPCs so as to understand the role of transcriptional regulators during transition from both ESCs to NSCs and NSCs to OPCs.

We also demonstrated that long term in vitro culture of hESC-derived OPC with different isoforms of RA led to the significant up-regulation of two known transcriptional inhibitors of oligodendrocyte differentiation: Hes5 following prolonged treatment with all-trans-RA, 9-cis RA and 13-cis RA; and Id4 following treatment with 13cisRA.

     "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,5,4-trihydroxystilbene) is a natural polyphenolic compound found in grapes and red wine and has been shown to exert protective effects on the liver preventing lipid accumulation induced by a high-fat diet. However, no studies have shown that the nutritional resveratrol intake by the parental generation has modified lipogenesis in an adult offspring. The aim of this study was to investigate whether maternal resveratrol intake during lactation affects lipogenesis in adult male rat offspring, and if it does, what is the molecular mechanistic basis. Six male pups born from mothers given a control diets during lactation (CC group) and six male pups born from mothers given a control diet as well as resveratrol during lactation (CR group) were fed a standard diet until sacrifice at 36 weeks. Adult male offspring from mothers given resveratrol during lactation (CR group) had lower body weight from the fourth week of lactation until adulthood, but no significant change was observed in the relative food intake. Low levels of plasma triacylglycerol were found in the CR group compared to the CC group. Histopathological analysis of the livers of adult male rat offspring revealed lipid accumulation in hepatocytes in the CC group, whereas lipid droplets were rare in the CR group. Hepatic protein levels of AMPK-phosphorylated at ser403, Sirt1, and Nampt in the CR group were upregulated significantly compared to the CC group. These results indicated the maternal resveratrol intake during lactation-induced activation of AMPK through Sirt1 upregulation. In this study, significant upregulation of the levels of precursor of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) and downregulation of the ratio of active-SREBP-1c/precusor-SREBP-1c were observed in the CR group compared to the CC group. These results suggested that proteolytic processing of SREBP-1c was suppressed by AMPK in the livers of the CR group. It is well known that SREBP-1c regulates the lipogenic pathway by activating genes involved in triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis. The present study showed significant downregulation of hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) levels in the CR group. These results indicated that maternal resveratrol intake during lactation suppressed SREBP-1c cleavage and nuclear translocation and repressed SREBP-1c target gene expression such as FAS and ACC in the livers of adult male offspring. These changes attenuate hepatic triacylglycerol and fatty acid synthesis in adult male offspring.",

     "abstract": "The consumption of green tea catechins (GTCs) suppresses age-related cognitive dysfunction in mice. GTCs are composed of several catechins, of which epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant, followed by epigallocatechin (EGC). Orally ingested EGCG is hydrolyzed by intestinal biota to EGC and gallic acid (GA). To understand the mechanism of action of GTCs on the brain, their permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) as well as their effects on cognitive function in mice and on nerve cell proliferation in vitro were examined.The BBB permeability of EGCG, EGC and GA was examined using a BBB model kit. SAMP10, a mouse model of brain senescence, was used to test cognitive function in vivo. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were used to test nerve cell proliferation and differentiation.The in vitro BBB permeability (%, in 30\u00a0min) of EGCG, EGC and GA was 2.8\u00b10.1, 3.4\u00b10.3 and 6.5\u00b10.6, respectively. The permeability of EGCG into the BBB indicates that EGCG reached the brain parenchyma even at a very low concentration. The learning ability of SAMP10 mice that ingested EGCG (20\u00a0mg/kg) was significantly higher than of mice that ingested EGC or GA. However, combined ingestion of EGC and GA showed a significant improvement comparable to EGCG. SH-SY5Y cell growth was significantly enhanced by 0.05\u00a0\u00b5M EGCG, but this effect was reduced at higher concentrations. The effect of EGC and GA was lower than that of EGCG at 0.05\u00a0\u00b5M. Co-administration of EGC and GA increased neurite length more than EGC or GA alone.Cognitive dysfunction in mice is suppressed after ingesting GTCs when a low concentration of EGCG is incorporated into the brain parenchyma via the BBB. Nerve cell proliferation/differentiation was enhanced by a low concentration of EGCG. Furthermore, the additive effect of EGC and GA suggests that EGCG sustains a preventive effect after the hydrolysis to EGC and GA.",

The legumain activity is also increased under acid conditions in Alzheimer's disease brains. DJ-1/PARK7, a cancer- and Parkinson's disease-associated protein, works as a coactivator to various transcription factors, including the androgen receptor, p53, PSF, Nrf2, SREBP and RREB1. Recently, we found that legumain expression, activation and cleavage of annexin A2 are regulated by DJ-1 through p53. In this study, we found that the expression levels of legumain mRNA were increased in the cerebrum, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, epididymis, stomach, small intestine and pancreas from DJ-1-knockout mice, although legumain activity levels were decreased in the cerebrum, spleen and heart from DJ-1-knockout mice. Furthermore, we found that cystatin E/M expression was increased in the spleen, cerebrum and heart from DJ-1-knockout mice.

     "abstract": "Inactivation of bacterial toxins for use in human vaccines traditionally is achieved by treatment with formaldehyde. In contrast, the bivalent experimental vaccine for the prevention of C. difficile infections (CDI) that is currently being evaluated in clinical trials was produced using a different strategy. C. difficile toxins A and B were inactivated using site-directed mutagenesis and treatment with 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC/NHS). In the present work we investigate the effect of genetic and chemical modifications on the structure of inactivated toxins (toxoids) A and B. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of wild type toxins, mutated toxins, and EDC/NHS-inactivated toxoids reveal that the secondary structure of all proteins is very similar. The near-UV CD spectra show that aromatic residues of all proteins are in a unique asymmetric environment, indicative of well-defined tertiary structure. These results along with the fluorescence emission maxima of 335\u00a0nm observed for all proteins suggest that the tertiary structure of toxoids A and B is preserved as well. Analytical ultracentrifugation data demonstrate that all proteins are predominantly monomeric with small fractions of higher molecular weight oligomeric species present in toxoids A and B. Differential scanning calorimetry data reveal that genetic mutations induce thermal destabilization of protein structures. Subsequent treatment with EDC/NHS results either in a minimal (1\u00a0\u00b0C) increase of apparent thermostability (toxoid B) or no change at all (toxoid A). Therefore, our two-step inactivation strategy is an effective approach for the preparation of non-toxic proteins maintaining native-like structure and conformation.",

TF-1 (\u223c2\u00a0\u00b5m in length) was amorphous with an acidic surface, while TF-2 (\u223c7\u00a0\u00b5m in length) was brookite with a basic surface. The results demonstrated that none of these titanate nanomaterials resulted in significant cytotoxicity, even at the highest doses tested (50\u00a0\u00b5g/ml), consistent with an absence of ROS generation and lack of change of mitochondrial membrane potential. While no cytotoxic effect was found in the titanate nanomaterials, TF-2 tended to decrease the proliferation of THP-1 cells. Furthermore, TF-2 resulted in an inflammatory cytokine response, as evidenced by dramatic induction of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 release in TF2 but not TF-1 nor TNPs. These results suggest that shape of titanate nanomaterials plays an important role in cellular internalization, while surface pH may play a prominent role in inflammatory response in THP-1 cells.",

Hemopexin is a Class 2 acute phase reactant and control of its transcription is predominantly regulated by IL-6, with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 also inducing hemopexin gene expression. Thus, we asked whether insulin could inhibit the ability of TNF-\u03b1 to stimulate hemopexin mRNA expression. In cultured rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cells, TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased hemopexin mRNA accumulation. The TNF-\u03b1-induced increase of hemopexin mRNA was dramatically attenuated by insulin, even though TNF-\u03b1 reduced peak insulin activation of ERK. Thus, even though TNF-\u03b1 can contribute to insulin resistance, the residual insulin response was still able to counteract TNF-\u03b1 actions.",

The present study aimed to determine the effects of cinnamic acid on the circadian clock, which is a cell-autonomous endogenous system that generates circadian rhythms that govern the behavior and physiology of most organisms. Cinnamic acid significantly shortened the circadian period of PER2::LUC expression in neuronal cells that differentiated from neuronal progenitor cells derived from PER2::LUC mouse embryos. Cinnamic acid did not induce the transient mRNA expression of clock genes such as Per1 and Per2 in neuronal cells, but significantly shortened the half-life of PER2::LUC protein in neuronal cells incubated with actinomycin D, suggested that CA post-transcriptionally affects the molecular clock by decreasing Per2 mRNA stability. A continuous infusion of CA into mice via an Alzet osmotic pump under constant darkness significantly shortened the free-running period of wheel-running rhythms.

     "abstract": "DM domain transcription factors play important roles in sexual development in a wide variety of species from invertebrate to humans. Among seven mammalian family members of DM domain transcription factors, DMRT1 has been studied in mouse and human for its conserved role in male gonadal identity. Chromosomal deletion of 9p24.3, the region in which DMRT1 is located, is associated with 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. Dmrt1 knockout (KO) mice also showed male-to-female gonadal reprogramming. However, the phenotype of Dmrt1 KO mouse appears only after birth while 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis occurs during the developmental phase, and the cause behind this difference remained unknown. We hypothesized that in human the function of other DMRT genes clustered with DMRT1, namely DMRT3, might also be impaired by the chromosomal deletion, which leads to the gonadal dysgenesis phenotype. Thus, simultaneous loss of multiple DM domain genes in mice could have a more severe impact on gonadal development. To address this issue, we generated double KO mice for Dmrt1 and Dmrt3 via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Comparing adult and neonatal testes of single and double KO mice, we found that loss of Dmrt1 or Dmrt3, or both, does not have apparent effect on male gonadal formation during embryonic development. Our study demonstrated that the discrepancy between human with 9p24.3 deletion and Dmrt1 KO mouse could not be explained by the simultaneous loss of Dmrt3 gene. CRISPR/Cas9 is a versatile and straightforward approach to elucidate the questions that were otherwise difficult to address with conventional methods.",

An effective treatment for this disease remains to be established. We reprogrammed somatic cells from three ATS patients to generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) were used to record extracellular electrograms of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, revealing strong arrhythmic events in the ATS-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Ca2+ imaging of cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 enabled us to examine intracellular Ca2+ handling properties, and we found a significantly higher incidence of irregular Ca2+ release in the ATS-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes than in control-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Drug testing using ATS-iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes further revealed that antiarrhythmic agent, flecainide, but not the sodium channel blocker, pilsicainide, significantly suppressed these irregular Ca2+ release and arrhythmic events, suggesting that flecainide's effect in these cardiac cells was not via sodium channels blocking. A reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+exchanger (NCX) inhibitor, KB-R7943, was also found to suppress the irregular Ca2+ release, and whole-cell voltage clamping of isolated guinea-pig cardiac ventricular myocytes confirmed that flecainide could directly affect the NCX current (INCX).

We used the orbital shaking method, instead of the frequently used parallel plate method, to examine activation of ERK and AKT by FSS for detailed tracking of its temporal transition. We found that ERK activation by orbital shaking was biphasic. The early phase was independent of Ca2+, PI3-kinase, and Rho kinase but required RAF activity. The late phase was dependent on Ca2+ but not RAF. These results suggest that the superior time-resolving capability of the orbital shaking method to separate the previously unrecognized Ca2+-independent early phase of ERK activation from the late phase. We also found that a certain combination of serum starvation and medium renewal affected ERK activation by FSS, suggesting that a soluble factor(s) may be secreted during serum starvation, which modified the phosphorylation level of ERK. These findings revealed novel aspects of the osteoblastic mechanoresponses and indicated that the orbital shaking method would be a useful, complementary alternative to the parallel plate method for certain types of study on cellular mechanoresponses.",

On the other hand, neurodegenerative diseases are thought to involve chronic microglia activation resulting in release of excess glutamate, proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, leading to neuronal death. System xC- cystine/glutamate antiporter (SXC), a sodium independent heterodimeric transporter found in microglia and astrocytes in the CNS, imports cystine into the cell and exports glutamate. SXC has been shown to be upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, ALS, neuroAIDS Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, SXC inhibitors could be of use in the treatment of diseases characterized by neuroinflammation and glutamate excitotoxicity. We report on the optimization of a primary microglia-based assay to screen for SXC inhibitors. Rat primary microglia were activated using lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and glutamate release and cystine uptake were monitored by fluorescence and radioactivity respectively. LPS-induced glutamate release increased with increasing cell density, time of incubation and LPS concentration. Conditions to screen for SXC inhibitors were optimized in 96-well format and subsequently used to evaluate SXC inhibitors. Known SXC inhibitors sulfasalazine, S-4CPG and erastin blocked glutamate release and cystine uptake while R-4CPG, the inactive enantiomer of S-4CPG, failed to inhibit glutamate release or cystine transport. In addition, several erastin analogs were evaluated using primary microglia and found to have EC50 values in agreement with previous studies using established cell lines.",

In the present study, expression in differentiating C2C12 cells of the myomiRs miR-1 and 133a were down-regulated following treatment with 1\u00a0\u00b5g of recombinant myostatin at 1 d post-induction of differentiation while all myomiRs (miR-1, 133a/b and 206) were upregulated by SB431542, a potent ALK4/5/7 inhibitor which reduces Smad2 signaling, at 1 d and all, with the exception of miR-206, were upregulated by SB431542 at 3 d. The expression of the muscle-enriched miR-486 was greater following treatment with SB431542 but not altered by myostatin. Other highly expressed miRNAs in skeletal muscle, miR-23a/b and 145, were altered only at 1 d post-induction of differentiation. miR-27b responded differently to treatments at 1 d, where it was upregulated, as compared to 3 d, where it was downregulated. Neither myostatin nor SB431542 altered cell size or cell morphology.

Molecularly, nsEP have been shown to activate signaling pathways, produce oxidative stress, stimulate hormone secretion and induce both apoptotic and necrotic death. We hypothesize that studying the genetic response of primary human dermal fibroblasts exposed to nsEP, will gain insight into the molecular mechanism(s) either activated directly by nsEP, or indirectly through electrophysiology interactions.Microarray analysis in conjunction with quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to screen and validate genes selectively upregulated in response to nsEP exposure.Expression profiles of 486 genes were found to be significantly changed by nsEP exposure. 50% of the top 20 responding genes coded for proteins located in two distinct cellular locations, the plasma membrane and the nucleus. Further analysis of five of the top 20 upregulated genes indicated that the HDFa cells\u2019 response to nsEP exposure included many elements of a mechanical stress response.We found that several genes, some of which are mechanosensitive, were selectively upregulated due to nsEP exposure. This genetic response appears to be a primary response to the stimuli and not a secondary response to cellular swelling.This work provides strong evidence that cells exposed to nsEP interpret the insult as a mechanical stress.",

In vivo Escherichia coli cloning (iVEC) can directly transform a mixture of insert and vector DNA fragments into E. coli, which are ligated by endogenous homologous recombination activity in the cells. Seamless ligation cloning extract (SLiCE) cloning uses the endogenous recombination activity of E. coli cellular extracts in vitro to ligate insert and vector DNA fragments. An evaluation of the efficiency and utility of these methods is important in deciding the adoption of a seamless cloning method as a useful tool. In this study, both seamless cloning methods incorporated inserting DNA fragments into linearized DNA vectors through short (15\u201339\u00a0bp) end homology regions. However, colony formation was 30\u201360-fold higher with SLiCE cloning in end homology regions between 15 and 29\u00a0bp than with the iVEC method using DH5\u03b1 competent cells. E. coli AQ3625 strains, which harbor a sbcA gene mutation that activates the RecE homologous recombination pathway, can be used to efficiently ligate insert and vector DNA fragments with short-end homology regions in vivo. Using AQ3625 competent cells in the iVEC method improved the rate of colony formation, but the efficiency and accuracy of SLiCE cloning were still higher. In addition, the efficiency of seamless cloning methods depends on the intrinsic competency of E. coli cells. The competency of chemically competent AQ3625 cells was lower than that of competent DH5\u03b1 cells, in all cases of chemically competent cell preparations using the three different methods. Moreover, SLiCE cloning permits the use of both homemade and commercially available competent cells because it can use general E. coli recA\u2212 strains such as DH5\u03b1 as host cells for transformation.

Isolated macrophages forcibly expressing Usp2a, a longer splicing variant of USP2, failed to modulate the insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Similarly, macrophage-selective overexpression of Usp2a in mice (Usp2a transgenic mice) had a negligible effect on insulin sensitivity relative to wild type littermates following a three-month high-fat diet. However, Usp2a transgenic mice exhibited fewer M1 macrophages in their mesenteric adipose tissue. Following a six-month high-fat diet, Usp2a transgenic mice exhibited a retarded progression of insulin resistance in their skeletal muscle and liver, and an improvement in insulin sensitivity at an individual level. Although conditioned media from Usp2a-overexpressing macrophages did not directly affect the insulin sensitivity of C2C12 myotubes compared to media from control macrophages, they did increase the insulin sensitivity of C2C12 cells after subsequent conditioning with 3T3-L1 cells. These results indicate that macrophage USP2A hampers obesity-elicited insulin resistance via an adipocyte-dependent mechanism.",

We thus analyzed the relationship between calcium flux and particle surface properties and determined the calcium flux route. Treatment of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts with nano-SPs with a diameter of 70\u00a0nm (nSP70) increased cytosolic calcium concentration, but that with SPs with a diameter of 300 or 1000\u00a0nm did not. Surface modification of nSP70 with a carboxy group also did not modulate calcium flux. Pretreatment with a general calcium entry blocker almost completely suppressed calcium flux by nSP70. Preconditioning by emptying the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores slightly suppressed calcium flux by nSP70. These results indicate that nSP70 mainly modulates calcium flux across plasma membrane calcium channels, with subsequent activation of the ER calcium pump, and that the potential of calcium flux by nano-SPs is determined by the particle surface charge.",

The pre-incubation of acetaldehyde inhibited the above synergistic reduction of TB in intact and permeabilized yeast cell suspension. The pre-incubation of acetaldehyde might promote NADH oxidation by alcohol dehydrogenase, because acetaldehyde decreased the intracellular NAD(P)H concentration. The above facts indicate that the synergistic reduction of TB is controlled by the order of addition of menadione and acetaldehyde. The synergistic reduction of TB by menadione and acetaldehyde was proportional to viable yeast cell number from 104 to 2\u00d7106 cells/ml, and this assay was applicable to cytotoxicity test.

This phenomenon is supposedly achieved by bridging a receptor protein CD47 to vimentin, an intermediate filament, which in turn regulates integrin dependent cell spreading. Since the discovery of these proteins, the molecular details of the above-mentioned interactions and the underlying complexes are yet to be characterized. Several independent studies have together emphasized PLIC/Ubiquilin\u2019s role in the proteasomal degradation pathway. This seems to be in contrast to the purported initial discovery of PLIC as a cytoskeletal adaptor protein. In an effort to reconcile the different roles associated with the ubiquitous PLIC proteins, we tested the involvement of PLIC-2 both in the proteasomal degradation pathway and as a protein linking the cell cytoskeleton to the cytoplasmic tail of CD47. This was achieved thorough an in vitro investigation of their binding interface using a combination of biophysical techniques. Our results show that the two terminal domains of PLIC-2 interact weakly with each other, while the C-terminal UBA domain interacts strongly with ubiquitin. Interestingly, no perceptible interaction was observed for PLIC-2 with the cytoplasmic tail of CD47 questioning its role as a \u201cPLIC\u201d protein linking the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton.",

Here, we investigated the effects of chronic running exercise on satellite cell activation in diabetic mice focused on the molecular mechanism including Notch and Wnt signaling, which are contribute to the fate determination of satellite cells. Male C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks of age were injected with streptozotocin and were randomly divided into runner group and control group. Runner group mice were performed treadmill running for 4 weeks. DM attenuated satellite cell activation and the expressions of the components of Notch and Wnt signaling. However, chronic running resulted in activation of satellite cells in diabetic mice and salvaged the inactivity of Wnt signaling but not Notch signaling.

Therefore, it plays a crucial role in the disease development by the virus. In spite of its importance, the 3d-structurephosphorylated and unphosphorylated of this protein has not been determined. In this study, first we predicted whether Rex protein is an ordered or disordered protein. In second step protein 3Dstructure of Rex was obtained. The content of disorder-promoting amino acids, flexibility, hydrophobicity, short linear motifs (SLiMs) and protein binding regions and probability of Rex crystallization were calculated by various In Silico methods. The3D models of Rex protein were obtained by various In Silico methods, such as homology modeling, threading and ab initio, including; I-TASSER, LOMETS, SPARSKS, ROBBETA and QUARK servers. By comparing and analyzing Qmean, z-scores and energy levels of selected models, the best structures with highest favored region in Ramachandran plot (higher than 90%) was refined with MODREFINER software. In silico analysis of Rex physicochemical properties and also predicted SLiMs and binding regions sites confirms that unphosphorylated Rex protein in HTLV-1 as Rev protin in HIV is wholly disordered protein belongs to the class of intrinsically disordered proteins with extended disorder (native coils, native pre-molten globules).",

The fluorescent proteins in the Rev fusion protein were separated by a cleavage site specific for the VP24 protease. When co-expressed in COS-7 cells proteolysis was observed by fluorescence microscopy as a shift from a predominantly cytoplasmic localization of the fusion protein RevEGFP to a nuclear localization while the RFP part of the fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm. The cleavage of the fusion protein by VP24 was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The activity of VP24, when tagged N-terminally by the Myc-epitope, was found to be comparable to VP24. These results demonstrates that the activity and localization of a recombinantly expressed protease can be assessed by protease-mediated cleavage of fusion proteins containing a specific protease cleavage site.",

However, the biological and immunosuppressive properties of AM-MSCs are still poorly characterized. Previous studies demonstrated that BM-MSCs expressed indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to suppress T-cell responses. This study was designed to address whether IDO contributes to the immunosuppressive function of AM-MSCs. MSCs isolated from amnion were cultured in complete medium similar to BM-MSCs. After culture, AM-MSCs exhibited spindle shape morphology and expressed MSC markers similar to that of BM-MSCs. In addition, AM-MSCs were able to differentiate into adipocytes and osteoblasts. Fascinatingly, AM-MSCs and BM-MSCs exhibited comparable degree of immunosuppressive effect when they were co-cultured with activated T-cells. In addition, IDO secreted by AM-MSCs was responsible for induction of immunosuppressive activities in the same manner as BM-MSCs. Taken together; the results of the present study demonstrate that while AM-MSCs and BM-MSCs show similar immunosuppressive effect, AM-MSCs may have additional advantage over the BM-MSCs in terms of availability. Therefore, AM-MSCs might be considered a potential source for therapeutic applications especially for treatment of immune related diseases.",

In wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans, gustatory plasticity results in reduced chemotaxis toward NaCl of otherwise attractive concentrations after pre-exposure to 100\u00a0mM NaCl in the absence of food. However, acute nicotine administration during a 15\u00a0min pre-exposure period inhibits gustatory plasticity, whereas chronic nicotine administration during worm development facilitates the plasticity. To investigate the relationship between the duration of nicotine administration and its effects, we exposed worms to nicotine for various periods during development. The modulatory effect of nicotine on gustatory plasticity was gradually switched from inhibition to facilitation with increased duration of nicotine administration. Moreover, inhibition of plasticity was sustained after relatively short-term chronic administration, with effects lasting for 45\u00a0h after the removal of nicotine. Similar to the acute inhibitory effect after 15\u00a0min nicotine pre-exposure, the inhibitory effect after short-term chronic administration was dependent on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes lev-1 and unc-29, and genes involved in serotonin biosynthesis bas-1 and tph-1. The impaired inhibition in bas-1 and tph-1mutants was recovered by exogenous serotonin, demonstrating that serotonin plays an important role in the long-lasting inhibitory effects of short-term chronic nicotine exposure.",

Identifying amino acids that are essential to CDTa function may aid drug inhibitor design to control the severity of C. difficile infections.

Rather than an all-or-nothing response, activity of CDTa mutants vary with the type of amino acid substitution; S345A retains cytotoxicity whereas S345Y was sufficient to render CDT non-cytotoxic.

Additionally, analysis of the mechanisms through which atRA upregulated StAR and Cyp11a1 mRNAs revealed that atRA enhanced intracellular cAMP accumulation and phosphorylation of cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB). In addition, H-89, an inhibitor of protein kinase A (PKA), abolished the stimulatory effects of atRA, indicating that atRA enhanced progesterone synthesis through cAMP/PKA signaling.

In this study, we investigated the effects of the low molecular weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF-5A), an agent that has proven to decrease pain and improve function in OAK patients after intra-articular injection, on the expression of COX2 and its downstream products, prostaglandins (PGs).Fibroblast-like synoviocytes from the synovial membrane of OAK patients were treated with LMWF-5A or saline as a control with or without the addition of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) to elicit an inflammatory response. Cells were harvested for RNA and protein at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24\u00a0h, and media was collected at 24\u00a0h for analysis of secreted products. COX2 mRNA expression was determined by qPCR, and COX2 protein expression was determined by western blot analysis.

In the present work the 13C, 15N-enriched GB1 model protein was used to demonstrate applicability of high-resolution magic-angle-spinning (HR-MAS) NMR spectroscopy to investigate ionic liquid\u2013protein interactions. Effect of an ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide, [C4-mim]Br) on GB1was studied over a wide range of the ionic liquid concentrations (0.6\u20133.5\u00a0M, which corresponds to 10\u201360% v/v). Interactions between GB1 and [C4-mim]Br were observed from changes in the chemical shifts of the protein backbone as well as the changes in 15N ps-ns dynamics and rotational correlation times. Site-specific interactions between the protein and [C4-mim]Br were assigned using 3D methods under HR-MAS conditions. Thus, HR-MAS NMR is a viable tool that could aid in elucidation of molecular mechanisms of ionic liquid\u2013protein interactions.",

When radiolabeled, peptide p5 has been shown to specifically bind amyloid in vivo thereby allowing imaging of the disease. Structural requirements for heparin and amyloid binding have been studied using analogues of p5 that modify helicity and chirality.Peptide-ligand interactions were studied using CD spectroscopy and solution-phase binding assays with radiolabeled p5 analogues. The interaction of a subset of peptides was further studied by using molecular dynamics simulations.Disruption of the peptide helical structure reduced peptide binding to heparin and human amyloid extracts. The all-D enantiomer and the \u03b2-sheet-structured peptide bound all substrates as well as, or better than, p5. The interaction of helical and \u03b2-sheet structured peptides with A\u03b2 fibrils was modeled and shown to involve both ionic and non-ionic interactions.The \u03b1-helical secondary structure of peptide p5 is important for heparin and amyloid binding; however, helicity is not an absolute requirement as evidenced by the superior reactivity of a \u03b2-sheet peptide. The differential binding of the peptides with heparin and amyloid fibrils suggests that these molecular interactions are different. The all-D enantiomer of p5 and the \u03b2-sheet peptide are candidates for amyloid targeting reagents in vivo.General SignificanceEfficient binding of polybasic peptides with amyloid is dependent on the linearity of charge spacing in the context of an \u03b1-helical secondary structure.

We conducted high-throughput flow cytometry (HT-FC) profiling to characterize the expression of 375 CD antigens on tumor cells from 10 different human HCC samples. We selected 91 of these for further analysis based on HT-FC data that showed consistent expression in discrete, rare, sortable populations of HCC cells. Nine of these CD antigens demonstrated significantly increased expression in the EpCAM+ stem/progenitor fraction of a human HCC cell line and were further evaluated in primary human HCC tissues from 30 different patients. Of the nine tested, only CD146 demonstrated significantly increased expression in HCC tumor tissue as compared with matched adjacent non-tumor liver tissue.

CsA treatment markedly decreased the EAE disease score during the first episode, but augmented disease severity after CsA withdrawal, compared to untreated mice. After discontinuation of CsA the production of IL-17A was increased and the severity of relapse in EAE was reduced by treatment with anti-IL-17A antibody.

     "abstract": "Previous research has indicated that the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signal transduction system plays an important role in the predisposition to and development of ethanol abuse in humans. Our laboratory has demonstrated that ethanol is capable of enhancing adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity. This effect is AC isoform-specific; type 7 AC (AC7) is most enhanced by ethanol. Therefore, we hypothesized that the expression of a specific AC isoform will play a role on the effect of ethanol on cAMP regulated gene expression. We employed NIH 3T3 cells transfected with AC7 or AC3 as a model system. To evaluate ethanol's effects on cAMP regulated gene expression, a luciferase reporter gene driven by a cAMP inducing artificial promoter was utilized. Stimulation of AC activity leads to an increase in the reporter gene activity. This increase was enhanced in the presence of ethanol in cells expressing AC7, while cells expressing AC3 did not respond to ethanol. cAMP reporter gene expression was increased in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP; this expression was not enhanced by ethanol. These observations are consistent with our hypothesis. The basal level of CREB phosphorylation was high and did not change by cAMP stimulation or in the presence of ethanol. However, there were significant changes in the TORC3 amount in nuclei depending on stimulation conditions. The results suggest that nuclear translocation of TORC3 plays a more important role than CREB phosphorylation in the observed changes in the cAMP driven reporter gene activity.",

In the present study, we have constructed a 3-D structure of MSG of Brucella melitensis 16M in MODELLER with the help of crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis malate synthase (PDB ID: 2GQ3) as template. The stereo chemical quality of the restrained model was evaluated by SAVES server; remarkably we identified the catalytic functional core domain located at 4th cleft with conserved catalytic amino acids, start at ILE 59 to VAL 586 manifest the function of the protein. Furthermore, virtual screening and docking results reveals that best leadmolecules binds at the core domain pocket of MSG catalytic residues and these ligand leads could be the best prospective inhibitors to treat brucellosis.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of extravasation injury induced by thiopental and propofol, and the effects of cooling or warming of local tissue on extravasation injury at macroscopic and histopathologic levels. Rats were administered intradermally thiopental (2.5\u00a0mg/100\u00a0\u00b5L) or propofol (1.0\u00a0mg/100\u00a0\u00b5L). Rats were assigned randomly to three groups: control (no treatment), cooling and warming. Local cooling (18\u201320\u00a0\u00b0C) or warming (40\u201342\u00a0\u00b0C) was applied for 3\u00a0h immediately after agent injection. Lesion sizes (erythema, induration, ulceration, necrosis) were monitored after agent injection. Histopathology was evaluated in skin biopsies taken 24\u00a0h after agent injection. Thiopental injection induced severe skin injury with necrosis. Peak lesions developed within 24\u00a0h and healed gradually 18\u201327 days after extravasation. Propofol induced inflammation but no ulceration, and lesions healed within 1\u20132 days. Local cooling reduced thiopental- and propofol-induced extravasation injuries but warming strongly exacerbated the skin lesions (e.g., degeneration, necrosis) induced by extravasation of thiopental and propofol. Thiopental can be classified as a \u201cvesicant\u201d that causes tissue necrosis and propofol can be classified as an \u201cirritant\u201d. Local cooling protects (at least in part) against skin disorders induced by thiopental and propofol, whereas warming is harmful.",

As a multivalent DNA scaffold, Mcm10 coordinates the action of proteins that are indispensable for lagging strand synthesis, such as the replication clamp, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The binding between Mcm10 and PCNA serves an essential function during DNA elongation and is mediated by the ubiquitination of Mcm10. Here we map lysine 372 as the primary attachment site for ubiquitin on S. cerevisiae Mcm10. Moreover, we identify five additional lysines that can be ubiquitinated. Mutation of lysine 372 to arginine ablates ubiquitination of overexpressed protein and causes sensitivity to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea in cells that are S-phase checkpoint compromised. Together, these findings reveal the high selectivity of the ubiquitination machinery that targets Mcm10 and that ubiquitination has a role in suppressing replication stress.",

It has been identified that although as a tumor suppressor, P27Kip1 is expressed in different cancer cell types, which shows the therapeutic potential in tumor genesis. In this study, we examined the upstream regulatory mechanism of P27Kip1 at the microRNA (miRNA) level in gastric carcinogenesis. We used bioinformatics to predict that microRNA-200c (miR-200c) might be a direct upstream regulator of P27Kip1. It was also verified in gastric epithelial-derived cell lines that overexpression of miR-200c significantly inhibited the expression levels of P27Kip1, whereas knockdown of miR-200c promoted P27Kip1 expression in AGS and BGC-823 cells. Furthermore, we identified the direct binding of miR-200c on the P27Kip1 3\u2032 -UTR sequence by luciferase assay. MiR-200c could enhance the colony formation of cells by repressing P27Kip1 expression. In addition, the negative correlation between P27Kip1 and miR-200c in human gastric cancer tissues and matched normal tissues further supported the tumor-promoting action of miR-200c in vivo. Our finding suggested that miR-200c directly regulates the expression of P27Kip1 and promotes cell growth in gastric cancer as an oncogene, which may provide new clues to treatment.",

GTL was previously purified from the rat liver and considered as a liver type glutamine transaminase. However, because of the substrate overlap and high sequence similarity of KAT3 and KAT1, it was difficult to assay the specific activity of each KAT and to study the enzyme localization in animals.KAT3 transcript and protein levels as well as enzyme activity in the liver and kidney were analyzed by regular reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real time RT-PCR, biochemical activity assays combined with a specific inhibition assay, and western blotting using a purified and a highly specific antibody, respectively.This study concerns the comparative biochemical characterization and localization of KAT 3 in the mouse. The results showed that KAT3 was present in both liver and kidney of the mouse, but was much more abundant in the kidney than in the liver. The mouse KAT3 is more efficient in transamination of glutamine with indo-3-pyruvate or oxaloacetate as amino group acceptor than the mouse KAT1.Mouse KAT3 is a major glutamine transaminase in the kidney although it was named a liver type transaminase.Our data highlights KAT3 as a key enzyme for studying the nephrotoxic mechanism of some xenobiotics and the formation of chemopreventive compounds in the mouse kidney.

Apart from the core cytolysin domain, VCC has two lectin domains with \u03b2-trefoil and \u03b2-prism folds. The \u03b2-prism domain binds to cell surface carbohydrate receptors; the role of the \u03b2-trefoil domain is unknown. Here, we show that the pro-VCC mutant without the \u03b2-trefoil domain formed aggregates highly susceptible to proteolysis, suggesting lack of a properly folded compact structure. The VCC variants with Trp532Ala or Trp534Ala mutation in the \u03b2-trefoil domain formed hemolytically inactive, protease-resistant, ring-shaped SDS-labile oligomers with diameters of ~19\u00a0nm. The Trp mutation induced a dramatic change in the global conformation of VCC, as indicated by: (a) the change in surface polarity from hydrophobic to hydrophilic; (b) movement of core Trp residues to the protein-water interface; and (c) decrease in reactivity to the anti-VCC antibody by >100-fold. In fact, the mutant VCC had little similarity to the wild toxin. However, the association constant for the carbohydrate-dependent interaction mediated by the \u03b2-prism domain decreased marginally from ~3\u00d7108 to ~5\u00d7107\u00a0M\u22121.

     "abstract": "Resting transmembrane potential (TMP) of primary human fibroblast cells was altered in predictable directions by subjecting cell cultures to specific monophasic and biphasic waveforms. Cells electrically stimulated with an anodal pulse resulted in hyperpolarization while a cathodal waveform depolarized the TMP to below that of non-paced control cells. The biphasic waveform, consisting of an anodal pulse followed immediately by an inverse symmetric cathodal pulse, also lessened the TMP similar to that of the cathodal pulse. The effect of short-term pacing on the TMP can last up to 4\u00a0h before the potentials equilibrate back to baseline. While subjecting the cells to this electrical field stimulation did not appear to damage the integrity of the cells, the three paced electrical stimulation waves inhibited expansion of the cultures when compared to non-paced control cells. With longer pacing treatments, elongation of the cells and electrotaxis towards the anodal polarity were observed. Pacing the fibroblasts also resulted in modest, yet very statistically significant (and likely underestimated) changes to cellular adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) levels, and cells undergoing anodal and biphasic (anodal/cathodal) stimulation also exhibited altered mitochondrial morphology. These observations indicate an active role of electrical currents, especially with anodal content, in affecting cellular metabolism and function, and help explain accumulating evidence of cellular alterations and clinical outcomes in pacing of the heart and other tissues in general.",

     "abstract": "N-arachidonoyl-l-serine (ARA-S) is an endogenous lipid, chemically related to the endocannabinoid, N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine (i.e., anandamide) and with similar physiologic and pathophysiologic functions. Reports indicate that ARA-S possesses vasoactive and neuroprotective properties resembling those of cannabinoids. However, in contrast to cannabinoids, ARA-S binds weakly to its known classical receptors, CB1 and CB2, and is therefore considered to be a \u2018cannabinoid-like\u2019 substance. The originally described ARA-S induced-endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation was not abrogated by CB1, CB2 receptor antagonists or TRPV1 competitive inhibitor. The present report demonstrates that ARA-S enhances the fluorescence staining of both cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2) in human brain endothelial cells (HBEC). This reaction is specific since it was reduced by respective selective receptor antagonist (SR141716A and SR141728A). ARA-S alone or in the presence of ET-1 was shown to alter the cytoskeleton (actin). Both ARA-S stimulated phosphorylation of various kinases (MAPK, Akt, JNK and c-JUN) and alteration of cytoskeleton are mediated via CB1, CB2 and TRPV1 receptors. The findings also showed the involvement of Rho/Rock and PI3/Akt/NO pathways in the ARA-S-induced phosphorylation of kinases and actin reorganization in HBEC. All of the above mentioned ARA-S-induced effects were reduced by the treatment with LY294002 (inhibitor of PI3/Akt kinase), except MAPK kinase. In addition, MAPK, JNK, c-JUN phosphorylation were inhibited by H1152 (inhibitor of Rho/ROCK kinase), except Akt kinase. Furthermore, PI3/Akt pathway was inhibited by pretreatment with l-NAME (inhibitor of NOS). The findings suggest that ARA-S is a modulator of Rho kinase and may play a critical role in the regulation of its activity and subsequent effects on the cytoskeleton and its role in supporting essential cell functions like vasodilation, proliferation and movement.",

We hypothesised that these two RNases are present in a range of tissues and secretions where they could contribute to host defence. We therefore, determined the relative abundance of RNase4 and RNase5 mRNA as well as protein levels in a range of host defence related and other tissues as well as a range of secretions in cattle, using real time PCR and western blotting. The two RNases were found to be expressed in liver, lung, pancreas, mammary gland, placenta, endometrium, small intestine, seminal vesicle, salivary gland, kidney, spleen, lymph node, skin as well as testes. Corresponding proteins were also detected in many of the above tissues, as well as in seminal fluid, mammary secretions and saliva. This study provides evidence for the presence of RNase4 and RNase5 in a range of tissues and secretions, as well as some major organs in cattle.

Skin substitutes were produced according to the self-assembly approach.Serum-free conditions have no negative impact on the reconstruction of healthy or psoriatic skin substitutes presented in this study regarding their macroscopic or histological appearances. ATR-FTIR results showed no significant differences in the CH2 bands between psoriatic substitutes cultured with or without serum, thus suggesting that serum deprivation did not have a negative impact on the lipid organization of their stratum corneum. Serum deprivation could even lead to a better organization of healthy skin substitute lipids. Percutaneous analyses demonstrated that psoriatic substitutes cultured in serum-free conditions showed a higher permeability to hydrocortisone compared to controls, while no significant differences in benzoic acid and caffeine penetration profiles were observed.Results obtained with this 3D-psoriatic skin substitute demonstrate the potential and versatility of the model.

Though it is known that nutrient consumption reduces REDD1 expression, it is largely unknown how nutrients and hormones individually contribute to the reduction in REDD1 expression. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine how nutrients and hormones individually regulate REDD1 expression. HeLa cells were deprived of leucine or serum for 10\u00a0h, after which either leucine or serum was reintroduced to cell culture medium for 60\u00a0min.

Re-supplementation of leucine or serum to deprived cells also led to a reduction in REDD1 mRNA content by 49.1\u00b12.7% and 65.0\u00b11.4%, respectively, compared to the deprived conditions. Interestingly, rates of REDD1 protein degradation were unaffected by either leucine or serum re-supplementation, as assessed in cells treated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Likewise, addition of leucine- or serum to cells treated with Actinomycin D to inhibit gene transcription failed to alter the rate of REDD1 mRNA degradation. The data indicate that the leucine or serum-induced suppression of REDD1 expression occurs independent of changes in the rate of degradation of either the REDD1 protein or mRNA. Thus, the leucine- or serum-induced suppression likely occurs through alternative mechanism(s) such as reduced REDD1 gene transcription and/or mRNA translation.",

Feeding bioassays of lab reared C. partellus with CanPI-7 and -22 were performed. C. partellus proteinase gene expression was done by RT-PCR. In-silico structure prediction of proteinases and CanPI IRDs was carried out, their validation and molecular docking was done for estimating the interaction strength.Larval proteinases of C. partellus showed higher activity at alkaline pH and expressed few proteinase isoforms. Both CanPIs showed strong inhibition of C. partellus larval proteinases. Feeding bioassays of C. partellus with CanPIs revealed a dose dependent retardation of larval growth, reduction of pupal mass and fecundity, while larval and pupal periods increased significantly. Ingestion of CanPIs resulted in differential up-regulation of C. partellus proteinase isoforms, which were sensitive to CanPI-7 but were insensitive to CanPI-22. In-silico interaction studies indicated the strong interaction of IRD-9 (of CanPI-22) with Chilo proteinases tested.Of the two PIs tested, CanPI-7 prevents induction of inhibitor insensitive proteinases in C. partellus so it can be explored for developing C. partellus tolerance in sorghum.Ingestion of CanPIs, effectively retards C. partellus growth; while differentially regulating the proteinases.",

The state of the art method to produce acyl-ACPs involves the transfer of a phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to apo-ACP by E. coli holo-ACP synthase (EcACPS), yielding holo-ACP which subsequently becomes thioesterified with free fatty acids by the E. coli acyl-ACP synthase (EcAAS). Alternatively, acyl-ACPs can be synthesized by direct transfer of acylated phosphopantetheine moieties from acyl-CoA to apo-ACP by means of EcACPS. The need for native substrates to characterize the FAS-II enzymes of P. falciparum prompted us to investigate the potential and limit of the two methods to efficiently acylate P. falciparum ACP (PfACP) with respect to chain length and \u03b2-modification and in preparative amounts. The EcAAS activity is found to be independent from the oxidation state at the \u03b2-position and accepts fatty acids as substrates with chain lengths starting from C8 to C20, whereas EcACPS accepts very efficiently acyl-CoAs with chain lengths up to C16, and with decreasing activity also longer chains (C18 to C20). Methods were developed to synthesize and purify preparative amounts of high quality natural substrates that are fully functional for the enzymes of the P. falciparum FAS-II system.",

It plays important roles in diverse DNA functions, including replication, segregation, transcription and repair. Interestingly, it has been reported that HU also binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regardless of sequence. However, structural analysis of HU with ssDNA has been lacking, and the functional relevance of this binding remains elusive.In this study, we found that ssDNA induced a significant change in the secondary structure of Thermus thermophilus HU (TtHU), as observed by analysis of circular dichroism spectra. Notably, this change in secondary structure was sequence specific, because the complementary ssDNA or dsDNA did not induce the change. Structural analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed that TtHU and this ssDNA formed a unique structure, which was different from the previously reported structure of HU in complex with dsDNA.

     "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) requires the packaging of human tRNALys3 as a primer for effective viral reverse transcription. Previously, we reported that glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) suppresses the packaging efficiency of tRNALys3. Although the binding of GAPDH to Pr55gag is important for the suppression mechanism, it remains unclear which domain of GAPDH is responsible for the interaction with Pr55gag. In this study, we show that Asp256, Lys260, Lys263 and Glu267 of GAPDH are important for the suppression of tRNALys3 packaging. Yeast two-hybrid analysis demonstrated that the C-terminal domain of GAPDH (151\u2013335) interacts with both the matrix region (MA; 1\u2013132) and capsid N-terminal domain (CA-NTD; 133\u2013282). The D256R, K263E or E267R mutation of GAPDH led to the loss of the ability to bind to wild-type (WT) MA, and the D256R/K260E double mutation of GAPDH resulted in the loss of detectable binding activity to WT CA-NTD. In contrast, R58E, Q59A or Q63A of MA, and E76R or R82E of CA-NTD abrogated the interaction with the C-terminal domain of GAPDH. Multiple-substituted GAPDH mutant (D256R/K260E/K263E/E267R) retained the oligomeric formation with WT GAPDH in HIV-1 producing cells, but the incorporation level of the hetero-oligomer was decreased in viral particles. Furthermore, the viruses produced from cells expressing the D256R/K260E/K263E/E267R mutant restored tRNALys3 packaging efficiency because the mutant exerted a dominant negative effect by preventing WT GAPDH from binding to MA and CA-NTD and improved the reverse transcription. These findings indicate that the amino acids Asp256, Lys260, Lys263 and Glu267 of GAPDH is essential for the mechanism of tRNALys3-packaging suppression and the D256R/K260E/K263E/E267R mutant of GAPDH acts in a dominant negative manner to suppress tRNALys3 packaging.",

Genotype-phenotype correlations have been defined, but considerable clinical heterogeneity still exists. Symptoms are often induced by physiological stress such as fasting or intercurrent illness, setting it as an important example of environmental effects altering clinical course in an individual with a genetic disease. However, neither the cellular changes that predispose to this phenomenon nor the alterations it induces are well characterized. We examined the effects of fasting in a knockout mouse model to explore changes in global mitochondria protein profiles in liver and to investigate the physiologically relevant changes that lead to the clinical presentations. An isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) labeling approach was employed to examine mitochondrial proteome changes in VLCAD deficient compared to wild type mice in the fed and fasted states. We identified numerous proteomic changes associated with the gene defect and fasting within relevant metabolic pathways. Few changes induced by fasting were shared between the VLCAD deficient and wild type mice, with more alterations found in the deficient mice on fasting. Particularly, fasting in the deficient mice could reverse the protective response in oxidative phosphorylation pathway seen in wild type animals. In addition, we found that changes in chaperone proteins including heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and 10 (HSP10) during fasting differed between the two genotypes, highlighting the importance of these proteins in VLCAD deficiency. Finally, the effects on the liver proteome imposed by changes in fasted VLCAD deficient mice indicates that this environmental factor may be an inducer of both cellular and physiological changes.",

We also investigated how MIZ-1 regulates gene expression of AMELX. Oligonucleotide-pull down assays showed that MIZ-1 binds to an MRE (MIZ-1 binding element) of the AMELX proximal promoter region (bp, \u2212170 to \u221225). Combined, our ChIP, transient transcription assays, and promoter mutagenesis revealed that MIZ-1 directly binds to the MRE of the Amelx promoter recruits p300 and induces Amelx gene transcription.

Lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), a kind of lysophospholipid, potentiates the histamine release from MCs triggered by antigen stimulation. We previously showed through structure-activity studies of LysoPS analogs that LysoPS with a methyl group at the carbon of the serine residue, i.e., lysophosphatidylthreonine (LysoPT), is extremely potent in stimulating the MC degranulation. In this study, as our continuing study to identify more potent LysoPS analogs, we developed LysoPS analogs with fatty acid surrogates. We found that the substitution of oleic acid to an aromatic fatty acid surrogate (C3-pH-p-O-C11) in 2-deoxy-1-LysoPS resulted in significant increase in the ability to induce MCs degranulation compared with 2-deoxy-1-LysoPS with oleic acid. Conversion of the serine residue into the threonine residue further increased the activity of MC degranulation both in vitro and in vivo. The resulting super agonist, 2-deoxy-LysoPT with C3-pH-p-O-C11, will be a useful tool to elucidate the mechanisms of stimulatory effect of LysoPS on MC degranulation.",

PA consists of various molecular species with different acyl chains at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions. However, it has been poorly understood what PA molecular species are produced during such cellular events. Here we identified the PA molecular species generated during retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuroblastoma cell differentiation using a newly established liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) method. Intriguingly, the amount of 32:0-PA species was dramatically and transiently increased in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells 24\u201348\u00a0h after RA-treatment. In addition, 30:0- and 34:0-PA species were also moderately increased. Moreover, similar results were obtained when Neuro-2a cells were differentiated for 24\u00a0h by serum starvation. MS/MS analysis revealed that 32:0-PA species contains two palmitic acids (16:0\u00a0s). RT-PCR analysis showed that diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) \u03b4 and DGK\u03b6 were highly expressed in Neuro-2a cells. The silencing of DGK\u03b6 expression significantly decreased the production of 32:0-PA species, whereas DGK\u03b4-siRNA did not. Moreover, neurite outgrowth was also markedly attenuated by the deficiency of DGK\u03b6. Taken together, these results indicate that DGK\u03b6 exclusively generates very restricted PA species, 16:0/16:0-PA, and up-regulates neurite outgrowth during the initial/early stage of neuroblastoma cell differentiation.",

In order to explore the possibility that vibrational stimulation from vocalization can enhance thyroid epithelial cell function, FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells were subjected to either chemical stimulation with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), mechanical stimulation with physiological vibrations, or a combination of the two, all in a well-characterized, torsional rheometer-bioreactor.

In this study, we investigated the molecular function of Crk II in prostate cancer (PCa) cells (CWR-22rv1) in vitro and using a mouse tumor model. Results showed that Crk II knockdown by shRNA-mediated silencing (Crk II-shRNA) in the PCa cells significantly inhibited both cancer cell migration and invasion in cell culture study. Crk II-shRNA cancer cells also significantly decreased colony formation in vitro, but had no significant reduction of tumor volume after 4 weeks of cancer cell xenografting in vivo when compared to the scramble control. Interestingly, Crk II-shRNA cancer cells showed a greatly reduced level of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and decreased signaling of the IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt axis upon IGF-1 ligand stimulation. A close interaction between Crk II and IGF-1R was demonstrated upon co-immunoprecipitation of IGF-1R with Crk II protein. Further, treatment of cells with either proteosomal degradation or protein synthesis inhibitor showed higher proportion of ubiquitin-associated IGF-1R and faster degradation of IGF-1R in Crk II-shRNA cells in comparison with that in the control cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Crk II plays an important role in the regulation of IGF-1R protein stability and affects downstream of IGF-1R signaling pathways.

Osteoporosis, one of the bone disorders, is not effectively treated by currently available medicines. In addition to the development of novel drugs for palliative treatment, the exploitation of novel compounds for preventive treatment is important in an aging society. Quercetin, a major flavonoid found in many fruits and vegetables, has been expected to inhibit cancer and prevent several diseases because of its anti-inflammatory and estrogenic functions. It has been reported that quercetin has the potential to reduce bone resorption, but the mechanism by which this compound affects the differentiation of osteoclasts remains unknown. Here, using a bone marrow cell-based in vitro osteoclast differentiation system from bone marrow cells, we found that the ability of quercetin to inhibit osteoclastogenesis was related to its estrogenic activity. The inhibition was partially blocked by a specific antagonist for the nuclear receptor estrogen receptor \u03b1, but a specific antagonist of the membrane-type receptor GPR30 completely ablated this inhibition. Furthermore, quercetin suppressed the transient increase of Akt phosphorylation induced by the stimulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand with no effect on MAPK phosphorylation, suggesting exquisite crosstalk between cytokine receptor and G-protein coupled receptor signaling.

Chronic pancreatitis is considered to be a significant etiological factor for pancreatic cancer development, and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the transition between inflammation and carcinogenesis would help further elucidate chemopreventative options. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 and BCL6 in human pancreatic cancer of ductal origin, as well as the therapeutic potential of PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist, GW501516.

RNAi knockdown of Pparb attenuated the GW501516 effect on Nfkb luciferase, while knockdown of Bcl6 enhanced TNF\u03b1-induced Nfkb activity. PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 activation induced expression of several anti-inflammatory genes in a dose-dependent manner, and GW501516 inhibited Mcp1 promoter-driven luciferase in a BCL6-dependent manner. Several pro-inflammatory genes were suppressed in a BCL6-dependent manner.

High salt (0.2\u00a0M NaCl vs basal 0.1\u00a0M NaCl) treatment resulted in a decrease in M\u03a61 macrophage phenotype (CD11b+CD14highCD16low) from 77.4\u00b16.2% (0.1\u00a0M) to 29.3\u00b15.7% (0.2\u00a0M, p<0.05), while there was an increase in M\u03a62 macrophage phenotype (CD11b+ CD14lowCD16high) from 17.2\u00b15.9% (0.1\u00a0M) to 67.4\u00b19.4% (0.2\u00a0M, p<0.05). ELISA-based cytokine analysis demonstrated that high salt treatment induced decreased expression of in the M\u03a61 phenotype specific pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF\u03b1 (3.3 fold), IL-12 (2.3 fold), CCL-10 (2 fold) and CCL-5 (3.8 fold), but conversely induced an enhanced expression M\u03a62-like phenotype specific anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, TGF\u03b2, CCL-17 (3.7 fold) and CCR-2 (4.3 fold). Further high salt treatment significantly decreased phagocytic efficiency of macrophages and inducible nitric oxide synthetase expression. Taken together, these data suggest that high salt extracellular environment induces an anti-inflammatory M\u03a62-like macrophage phenotype with poor phagocytic and potentially reduced antigen presentation capacity commonly found in tumor microenvironment.",

In this study, the mechanism of Gln-mediated ERK-dependency in MKP-1 induction was investigated. Gln increased ERK phosphorylation and activity, and phosphorylations of Ras, c-Raf, and MEK, located in the upstream pathway of ERK, in response to lipopolysaccharidein vitro and in vivo. Gln-induced dose-dependent transient increases in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in MHS macrophage cells. Ionomycin increased [Ca2+]i and activation of Ras \u2192 ERK pathway, and MKP-1 induction, in the presence, but not in the absence, of LPS. The Gln-induced pathways involving Ca2+\u2192 MKP-1 induction were abrogated by a calcium blocker. Besides Gln, other amino acids including L-phenylalanine and l-cysteine (Cys) also induced Ca2+ response, activation of Ras \u2192 ERK, and MKP-1 induction, albeit to a lesser degree. Gln and Cys were comparable in suppression against 2, 4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact dermatitis. Gln-mediated, but not Cys-mediated, suppression was abolished by MKP-1 small interfering RNA. These data indicate that Gln induces MKP-1 by activating Ca2+\u2192 ERK pathway, which plays a key role in suppression of inflammatory reactions.",

In recent in situ studies, we showed that the N-terminal proteolytic product of ameloblastin co-localized with amelogenin around the prism boundaries. However, the molecular mechanisms of such interactions are still unclear. Here, in order to determine the interacting domains between amelogenin and ameloblastin, we designed four ameloblastin peptides derived from different regions of the full-length protein (AB1, AB2 and AB3 at N-terminus, and AB6 at C-terminus) and studied their interactions with recombinant amelogenin (rP172), and the tyrosine-rich amelogenin polypeptide (TRAP). A series of amelogenin Trp variants (rP172(W25), rP172(W45) and rP172(W161)) were also used for intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectra of rP172 titrated with AB3, a peptide encoded by exon 5 of ameloblastin, showed a shift in \u03bbmax in a dose-dependent manner, indicating molecular interactions in the region encoded by exon 5 of ameloblastin. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of amelogenin titrated with AB3 showed that amelogenin was responsible for forming \u03b1-helix in the presence of ameloblastin. Fluorescence spectra of amelogenin Trp variants as well as the spectra of TRAP titrated with AB3 showed that the N-terminus of amelogenin is involved in the interaction between ameloblastin and amelogenin. We suggest that macromolecular co-assembly between amelogenin and ameloblastin may play important roles in enamel biomineralization.",

When C6 cells were exposed to 250\u00a0\u03bcM t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), the loss of a membrane potential-sensitive dye (tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester, TMRE) from mitochondria was observed, indicating mitochondrial depolarization leading to cell death. The fluorescence of calcein entrapped in mitochondria prior to addition of t-BuOOH was significantly decreased to 70% after mitochondrial depolarization. Cyclosporin A suppressed the decrease in mitochondrial calcein fluorescence, but not mitochondrial depolarization. These results show that t-BuOOH induced cell death even when it did not induce MPT.

MamA is one of the most abundant magnetosome-associated proteins and is anchored to the magnetosome vesicles through protein-protein interactions, but the identity of the protein that interacts with MamA is undetermined. In this study, we found that MamA binds to a magnetosome membrane protein Mms6. Two different molecular masses of Mms6, 14.5-kDa and 6.0-kDa, were associated with the magnetosomes. Using affinity chromatography, we identified that the 14.5-kDa Mms6 interacts with MamA, and the interaction was further confirmed by pull-down, immunoprecipitation and size-exclusion chromatography assays.

     "publication date": "09-2016",
     "abstract": "Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory disease caused by the aquaporin (AQP)-4-antibody. Pathological studies on NMO have revealed extensive astrocytic damage, as evidenced by the loss of AQP4 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), specifically in perivascular regions with immunoglobulin and complement depositions, although other pathological patterns, such as a loss of AQP4 without astrocyte destruction and clasmatodendrosis, have also been observed. Previous studies have shown that complement-dependent antibody-mediated astrocyte lysis is likely a major pathomechanism in NMO. However, there are also data to suggest antibody-mediated astrocyte dysfunction in the absence of complement. Thus, the importance of complement inhibitory proteins in complement-dependent AQP4-antibody-mediated astrocyte lysis in NMO is unclear. In most of the previous studies, the complement and target cells (astrocytes or AQP4-transfected cells) were derived from different species; however, the complement inhibitory proteins that are expressed on the cell surface cannot protect themselves against complement-dependent cytolysis unless the complements and complement inhibitory proteins are from the same species. To resolve these issues, we studied human astrocytes in primary culture treated with AQP4-antibody in the presence or absence of human complement and examined the effect of complement inhibitory proteins using small interfering RNA (siRNA).Purified IgG (10\u00a0mg/mL) was obtained from 5 patients with AQP4-antibody-positive NMO, 3 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and 3 healthy controls. Confluent human astrocytes transfected with Venus-M1-AQP4-cDNA were incubated with IgG (5% volume). After washing, we cultured the cells with human complements with or without heat inactivation. We observed time-lapse morphological and immunohistochemical changes using a fluorescence microscope. We also evaluated cytotoxicity using a propidium iodide (PI) kit and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay.AQP4-antibody alone caused clustering and degradation followed by endocytosis of membraneous AQP4, thereby resulting in decreased cellular adherence and the shrinkage of astrocytic processes. However, these changes were partially reversed by the removal of IgG in culture. In contrast, following the application of AQP4-antibody and non-heated human complements, the cell bodies and nuclei started to swell. At 3\u00a0h, most of the astrocytes had lost mobility and adherence and were eventually destroyed or had swollen and were then destroyed. In addition, the remaining adherent cells were mostly PI-positive, indicating necrosis. Astrocyte lysis caused by rabbit complement occurred much faster than did cell lysis with human complement. However, the cell lysis was significantly enhanced by the transfection of astrocytes with siRNA against human CD55 and CD59, which are major complement inhibitory proteins on the astrocyte membrane. AQP4-antibody-negative IgG in MS or control did not induce such changes.Taken together, these findings suggest that both complement-dependent and complement-independent AQP4-antibody-mediated astrocytopathies may operate in NMO, potentially contributing to diverse pathological patterns. Our results also suggest that the effect of complement inhibitory proteins should be considered when evaluating AQP4-antibody-mediated cytotoxicity in AQP4-expressing cells.",

The targetability of actin in injured sites has been demonstrated in vivo through the specific delivery of anti-actin conjugated particles to the wounded tissue in a lethal rat model of grade IV liver injury.These results illustrate that identification of injury-specific protein markers and their targetability for specific delivery is feasible.Identification of wound-specific targets has important medical applications as it could enable specific delivery of various products, such as expression vectors, therapeutic drugs, hemostatic materials, tissue healing, or scar prevention agents, to internal sites of penetrating or surgical wounds regardless of origin, geometry or location.",

Based on experimental data obtained using RP S19 analog peptide and recombinant protein monomer, we suggested that L131DR, I134AGQVAAAN and K143KH moieties in the RP S19 C\u2010terminus act in, respectively, C5aR binding, penetration of the plasma membrane, and interaction with either an apoptosis-inducing molecule in neutrophils (delta lactoferrin) or a calcium channel-activating molecule (annexin A3) to induce the p38 MAPK pathway in macrophages. Recently, we observed RP S19 trimer in serum. To study the effects of this RP S19 trimer on C5aR, we prepared mutant RP S19 C\u2010terminal peptide (RP S19122-145) dimer and trimer, and examined their chemotactic activities and signal transduction pathways in human C5aR-overexpressing squamous cell carcinoma HSC-1 (HSC-1C5aR) cells using 24 trans-well chamber and western blotting assays, respectively. HSC-1C5aR cells were attracted by RP S19122-145 dimer and vice versa by RP S19122-145 trimer. The RP S19122-145 dimer-induced attraction was competitively blocked by pre-treatment with RP S19122-145 trimer. Moreover, RP S19122-145 trimer-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was stronger than RP S19122-145 dimer-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation. RP S19122-145 trimer appeared to act as a C5aR antagonist. The agonistic and antagonistic effects of RP S19122-145 dimers and trimers were reflected by monocytic, THP-1-derived macrophage-like cells.

To better understand the mechanism underlying the accumulation of IL-10-producing B cells upon T. gondii infection, we determined the effect of products released by T. gondii on the induction and differentiation of IL-10-producing B cells during the acute stage of infection using transgenic green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing T. gondii strain. We demonstrated that products secreted at the stage of cell lysis by fully replicated tachyzoites induced the differentiation of naive B cells to IL-10-producing Bregs. Our results indicated that the downregulation of the immune response via Bregs during T. gondii infection is related to cyst formation in the host brain and to the establishment of chronic infection.",

HCV envelope glycoproteins are involved in the virion formation; the correct folding of these proteins plays the key role in virus infectivity. Glycosylation at certain sites of different genotypes HCV glycoproteins shows substantial differences in functions of the individual glycans (Goffard et al., 2005; Helle et al., 2010) [1], [2]. In this study, differential glycosylation sites of HCV genotype 1b envelope proteins in insect and mammalian cells was demonstrated. We showed that part of glycosylation sites was important for folding of the proteins involved in the formation of viral particles. Point mutations were introduced in the protein N-glycosylation sites of HCV (genotype 1b) and the mutant proteins were analyzed using baculovirus expression system in mammalian and insect cells. Our data showed that, in contrast to HCV 1a and 2a, the folding of HCV 1b envelope proteins E2 (sites N1, N2, N10) and E1 (sites N1, N5) was disrupted, however that did not prevent the formation of virus-like particles (VLP) with misfolded glycoproteins having densities typical for HCV particles containing RNA fragments. Experimental data are supported by mathematical modeling of the structure of E1 mutant variants.",

Dramatic differences in the (7-aza)Trp-Baa and (2,7-aza)Trp-Baa fluorescence properties between free peptide in water and calmodulin-bound peptide were observed, showing a less polar and water scant environment at the binding interface of the peptide upon calmodulin binding.

Kinetic properties of the enzyme are very similar to those of the cytosolic enzyme. PCK2 has an absolute requirement for Mn2+ ions for activity; Mg2+ ions reduce the Km for Mn2+ by about 60 fold. Its specificity constant is 100 fold larger for oxaloacetate than for phosphoenolpyruvate suggesting that oxaloacetate phosphorylation is the favored reaction in vivo. The enzyme possesses weak pyruvate kinase-like activity (kcat=2.7\u00a0s\u22121).

This fluorescence emission quenching may be due to the loss of the intermolecular bonds and, consequently, to the destructuration of the mKO chromophore structure.

We report that the total number of peripheral na\u00efve and memory CD4+ and CD8+T cells notably declined after one week of malnourishment, a time period too short to be entirely due to malnutrition-induced thymic involution. Peripheral malnourished T cells expressed higher levels of the IL-7 receptor component, CD127, and were less sensitive to death-by-neglect as compared to control T cells. Overall levels of IL-7 were similar in malnourished and control mice. Adoptive transfer studies revealed that CD127 expression did not correlate with increased survival in vivo and that all na\u00efve CD8+T cells upregulated CD127, regardless of initial expression levels. Corticosterone levels were elevated in malnourished mice and this correlated in time with peripheral T cell up-regulation of CD127 and the diminishment of the peripheral T cell pool. Overall, these data suggest a model in which CD127 levels are up-regulated quickly during malnourishment, thereby increasing the scavenge rate of IL-7, and providing a mechanism to quickly adjust the total number of T cells during malnutrition.",

There is growing evidence for the important role of the PGE2/EP4 signaling in the nervous system. Previous studies in our lab show that the expression of the EP4 receptor is significantly higher during the neurogenesis period in the mouse. We also showed that in mouse neuroblastoma cells, the PGE2/EP4 receptor signaling pathway plays a role in regulation of intracellular calcium via a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent mechanism. Recent research indicates that the functional importance of the EP4 receptor depends on its subcellular localization. PGE2-induced EP4 externalization to the plasma membrane of primary sensory neurons has been shown to play a role in the pain pathway. In the present study, we detected a novel PGE2\u2013dependent subcellular trafficking of the EP4 receptor in neuroectodermal (NE-4C) stem cells and differentiated NE-4C neuronal cells. We show that PGE2 induces EP4 externalization from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane in NE-4C stem cells. We also show that the EP4 receptors translocate to growth cones of differentiating NE-4C neuronal cells and that a higher level of PGE2 enhances its growth cone localization. These results demonstrate that the EP4 receptor relocation to the plasma membrane and growth cones in NE-4C cells is PGE2 dependent. Thus, the functional role of the PGE2/EP4 pathway in the developing nervous system may depend on the subcellular localization of the EP4 receptor.",

Recent studies showed that supra-physiological levels of cholesterol in surfactant contribute to impaired function. Since cholesterol is incorporated into surfactant within the alveolar type II cells which derives its cholesterol from serum, it was hypothesized that serum hypercholesterolemia would predispose the host to the development of lung injury due to alterations of cholesterol content in the surfactant system.Wistar rats were randomized to a standard lab diet or a high cholesterol diet for 17\u201320 days. Animals were then exposed to one of three models of lung injury: i) acid aspiration ii) ventilation induced lung injury, and iii) surfactant depletion. Following physiological monitoring, lungs were lavaged to obtain and analyze the surfactant system.The physiological results showed there was no effect of the high cholesterol diet on the severity of lung injury in any of the three models of injury. There was also no effect of the diet on surfactant cholesterol composition. Rats fed a high cholesterol diet had a significant impairment in surface tension reducing capabilities of isolated surfactant compared to those fed a standard diet exposed to the surfactant depletion injury. In addition, only rats that were exposed to ventilation induced lung injury had elevated levels of surfactant associated cholesterol compared to non-injured rats.It is concluded that serum hypercholesterolemia does not predispose rats to altered surfactant cholesterol composition or to lung injury. Elevated cholesterol within surfactant may be a marker for ventilation induced lung damage.",

When collecting fresh plasma samples, it is possible to produce cell-free/platelet-poor plasma by centrifugation. In this study, we systematically investigated whether biobanked EDTA plasma samples could be processed to be suitable for miRNA analysis.Blood samples were collected from ten healthy volunteers and centrifuged to produce platelet-poor-plasma (PPP) and standard biobank plasma. After one week at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C the biobanked EDTA plasma was re-centrifuged by different steps to remove residual platelets. Using RT-qPCR the levels of 14 miRNAs in the different plasma preparations were compared to that of PPP.We were able to remove residual platelets from biobanked EDTA plasma by re-centrifugation of the thawed samples. Nevertheless, for most of the investigated miRNAs, the miRNA level was significantly higher in the re-centrifuged biobanked plasma compared to PPP, even when the platelet count was reduced to 0\u20131\u00d7109/L.We found, that pre-storage centrifugation conditions have a significant impact on the measured EDTA plasma level of miRNAs known to be present in platelets.

Oxytocin also enhanced GABAergic and glycinergic spontaneous inhibitory transmissions in a manner sensitive to a voltage-gated Na+-channel blocker tetrodotoxin. These actions were mediated by oxytocin-receptor activation. Such a result was different from that obtained by other investigators in young male rat superficial dorsal horn neurons in which an oxytocin-receptor agonist enhanced glutamatergic and GABAergic but not glycinergic spontaneous transmissions. In order to know a developmental change and also sexual difference in the actions of oxytocin, we examined its effect on spontaneous synaptic transmission in adult female and young male rat SG neurons by using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in spinal cord slices. In adult female rats, oxytocin produced an inward current at \u221270\u00a0mV without a change in excitatory transmission. GABAergic and glycinergic transmissions were enhanced by oxytocin, the duration of which enhancement was much shorter than in adult male rats. In young (11\u201321 postnatal days) male rats, oxytocin produced not only an inward but also outward current at \u221270\u00a0mV, and presynaptically inhibited or facilitated excitatory transmission, depending on the neurons tested; both GABAergic and glycinergic transmissions were enhanced by oxytocin. The inhibitory transmission enhancements in adult female and young male rats were sensitive to tetrodotoxin. Although the data may not be enough to be estimated, it is suggested that synaptic modulation by oxytocin in SG neurons, i.e., cellular mechanism for its antinociceptive action, exhibits a developmental change and sexual difference.",

Activated eEF2K phosphorylates its specific substrate, eEF2, which results in inhibition of protein translation. We have recently shown that protein expression of eEF2K was specifically increased in hypertrophied left ventricles (LV) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). However, phosphorylation state of eEF2K and eEF2 in hypertrophied LV is not determined. In the present study, we examined expression and phosphorylation of eEF2K and eEF2 in LV from SHR as well as the pressure overload (transverse aortic constriction: TAC)- and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy model. In LV from TAC mice, eEF2K expression was increased as determined by Western blotting. In LV from TAC mice and SHR, eEF2K phosphorylation at Ser366 (inactive site) was decreased. Consistently, eEF2 phosphorylation at Thr56 was increased. In LV from ISO rats, while eEF2K phosphorylation was decreased, eEF2K expression and eEF2 phosphorylation were not different as determined by Western blotting. In the results obtained from immunohistochemistry, however, total eEF2K and phosphorylated eEF2 (at Thr56) localized to cardiomyocytes were increased in LV cardiomyocytes from ISO rats. Accordingly, the increased expression and the decreased phosphorylation of eEF2K and the increased phosphorylation of eEF2 in hypertrophied LV were common to all models in this study. The present results thus suggest that cardiac hypertrophy may be regulated at least partly via eEF2K-eEF2 signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione disulfide (GSSG) is the oxidized form of glutathione (GSH). GSH is a tripeptide present in the biological system in mM concentration and is the major antioxidant in the body. An increase in GSSG reflects an increase in intracellular oxidative stress and is associated with disease sates. The increase has also been demonstrated to lead to an increase in protein S-glutathionylation that can affect the structure and function of proteins. Protein S-glutathionylation serves as a regulatory mechanism during cellular oxidative stress. Though GSSG is commercially available, its roles in various GSSG-associated normal/abnormal physiological functions have not been fully delineated due to the reason that GSSG is not cell membrane permeable and a lack of method to specifically increase GSSG in cells. We have developed cationic liposomes that can effectively deliver GSSG into cells. Various concentrations of GSSG liposomes can be conveniently prepared. At 1\u00a0mg/mL, the GSSG liposomes effectively increased intracellular GSSG by 27.1\u00b16.9 folds (n=3) in 4\u00a0h and led to a significant increase in protein S-glutathionylation confirming that the increased GSSG is functionally effective. The Trypan blue assay demonstrated that GSSG liposomes were not cytotoxic; the cell viability was greater than 95% after cells were treated with the GSSG liposomes for 4\u00a0h. A stability study showed that the dry form of the GSSG liposomes were stable for at least 70 days when stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C.

In current study, we first showed that SOX2 displayed high affinity toward the mRNA encoding S100A14 in BFTC905 and that depletion of SOX2 resulted in a decrease of S100A14 mRNA and protein level. To characterize the RNA binding sequence recognized by SOX2, oligomer-directed RNase H digestion was coupled to the cross-linking before immunoprecipitation assay to demonstrate that SOX2 preferentially binds to the 3\u2032-UTR of the S100A14 mRNA. Using EGFP-S100A14 3\u2032-UTR reporters and mobility shift assay, we identified that the binding sequence on the 3\u2032-UTR of the S100A14 mRNA exhibits a stem-loop structure. Together, our data indicates that SOX2 enhances S100A14 expression by binding to the 3\u2032-UTR of the S100A14 mRNA. Functionally, depletion of SOX2 increases growth and mobility of BFTC905. Knock-down of S100A14 in BFTC905 also leads to an increase in the number of the cells in the S phase and higher mobility, suggesting that SOX2 suppresses cell growth and mobility through promoting the expression of S100A14. Together, our experimental evidence indicates that SOX2 is capable of exerting its cellular functions by functioning as an RNA binding protein in post-transcriptional regulation.",

Finally, the expression levels of COL1 and fibrosis-related cytokines, including CTGF, ET-1, Wnt1 and \u03b2-catenin were determined. The binding of CUX1 isoforms to the COL1A2 enhancer region increased after TGF-\u03b2 treatment. TGF-\u03b2 also increased the protein levels of the CUX1 isoforms p200, p150, p110, p75, p30 and p28. Moreover, SSc lung fibroblasts showed higher levels of CUX1 isoforms than normal lung fibroblasts, and treatment of SSc lung fibroblasts with a cathepsin L inhibitor (IW-CHO) decreased COL1 protein expression and reduced cell size, as measured using immunocytochemistry.

Herein, we report that conditioned media (CM) from rat adipose tissue-derived MSCs (ASCs) protected adult cardiomyocytes from oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death. We focused on furin/PCSK protease activity in ASC-CM because many therapeutic factors of MSCs and soluble cardioprotective factors include the PCSK cleavage site. We found that recombinant furin protected cardiomyocytes from OGD-induced cell death. The ASC-CM had potent furin/PCSK protease activity and the cardioprotective effect of the CM from ASCs in the OGD-assay was abolished by an inhibitor of the furin/PCSK-like enzyme. Microarray analysis and Western blot analysis showed PCSK5A, the secreted type of PCSK5, is the most abundantly secreted PCSK among 7 PCSK family members in ASC. Finally, knockdown of PCSK5A in ASCs decreased both the furin/PCSK protease activity and cardioprotective activity in the CM. These findings indicate an involvement of furin/PCSK-type protease(s) in the anti-ischemic activity of ASCs, and suggest a new mechanism of the therapeutic effect of MSCs.",

     "abstract": "The HER4 receptor tyrosine kinase and STAT5A cooperate to promote mammary luminal progenitor cell maturation and mammary epithelial cell differentiation. Coupled HER4 and STAT5A signaling is mediated, in part, through association of the HER4 intracellular domain (4ICD) with STAT5A at STAT5A target gene promoters where 4ICD functions as a STAT5A transcriptional coactivator. Despite an essential role for coupled 4ICD and STAT5A signaling in mammary gland development, the mechanistic basis of 4ICD and STAT5A cooperative signaling remains unexplored. Here we show for the first time that 4ICD and STAT5A directly interact through STAT5A recruitment and binding to HER4/4ICD residue Y984. Accordingly, altering the 4ICD Y984 to phenylalanine results in a dramatic reduction of STAT5A and 4ICD-Y984F interacting complexes coimmunoprecipitated with HER4 or STAT5A specific antibodies. We further show that disrupting the 4ICD and STAT5A interaction has an important physiological impact on mammary epithelial cell differentiation. HC11 mammary epithelial cells with stable expression of 4ICD undergo differentiation with significantly increased expression of the STAT5A target genes and differentiation markers \u03b2-casein and WAP. In contrast, HC11 cells stably expressing 4ICD-Y984F failed to undergo differentiation with basal expression levels of \u03b2-casein and WAP. Differentiation in this cell system was induced in the absence of exogenous prolactin indicating that 4ICD activity is sufficient to induce mammary epithelial cell differentiation. Finally, we show that suppression of STAT5A expression abolishes the ability of 4ICD to induce HC11 differentiation and activate \u03b2-casein or WAP expression. Taken together our results demonstrate for the first time that direct coupling of 4ICD and STAT5A is both necessary and sufficient to drive mammary epithelial differentiation. In conclusion, our findings that 4ICD and STAT5A directly interact to form a physiologically important transcriptional activation complex, provide a mechanistic basis for the in vivo observations that HER4/4ICD and STAT5A cooperate to promote mammary gland progenitor cell maturation and initiate lactation at parturition.",

     "abstract": "Whey-acidic-protein (WAP) four-disulphide core (WFDC) proteins have important roles in the regulation of innate immunity, anti-microbial function, and the inhibition of inflammatory proteases at mucosal surfaces. It was recently demonstrated that the WFDC protein, prostate stromal 20 (ps20), encoded by the WFDC1 gene, is a potent growth inhibitory factor, and shares with other WFDC proteins the ability to modulate wound healing processes and immune responses to viral infections. However, ps20 remains relatively uncharacterised at the protein level.Using a panel of ps20 antibodies for western-blotting (WB), ELISA and immunoaffinity purification, we isolated, biochemically characterised and tested ps20 preparations for three biological properties: (i) interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAG) (ii) inhibition of cell proliferation, and (iii) transglutaminase2 (TG2) mediated crosslinking of ps20 to fibronectin, a process implicated in wound healing. We show herein that ps20 preparations contain multiple molecular forms including full-length ps20 (resolving at \u224827\u00a0kDa), an exon 3 truncated form (\u224822\u00a0kDa) that lacks aa113\u2013140, and variable amounts of a putatively cleaved lower MW (\u224815\u201317\u00a0kDa) species. Untagged purified ps20 preparations containing a mixture of these forms are biologically active in significantly suppressing prostate cell proliferation. We show that one mechanism by which lower LMW forms of ps20 arise is through cathepsin L (CL) cleavage, and confirm that CL cleaves ps20 at the C-terminus, but this does not inhibit its growth inhibitory function. However, CL cleavage abrogated the interaction between ps20 and solid-phase fibronectin.Therefore, we demonstrate for the first time that LMW forms of ps20 that lack a C-terminal immunogenic epitope can arise through CL cleavage and this cleavage impairs multimerisation and potential capacity to cross-link to ECM, but not the capacity of ps20 to inhibit cell proliferation. We propose that ps20 like other WFDC proteins can become associated with GAGs and the ECM. Furthermore, we suggest post-translational processing and cleavage of ps20 is required to generate functional protein species, and TG2 mediated crosslinking and CL cleavage form components of a ps20 regulatory apparatus.",

Almost all of SH groups in PLCys were in free forms. Such a multi-thiol peptide may cross-link proteins through thiol/disulfide (SH/SS) exchange reactions, considering the knowledge that other synthetic multi-thiol additives changes properties of protein materials.This study explored the capability of PLCys to cross-link proteins using lysozyme as a model protein which has four disulfide bonds but no free SH group. The protein was incubated with PLCys at neutral pH and at below 70\u00a0\u00b0C to avoid PLCys-independent, \u03b2-elimination-mediated cross-linkings. Protein polymerization was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SEC. PLCys peptides involved in the protein polymer, which were released by reduction with dithiothreitol, were analyzed by RP-HPLC.Addition of urea and thermal treatment at 60\u00a0\u00b0C caused PLCys-induced lysozyme polymerization. Compared with free cysteine, a higher level of PLCys was required for the polymerization probably due to its low water solubility. RP-HPLC analyses suggested that PLCys played a role in the protein polymerization as a cross-linker.Enzymatically synthesized PLCys shows promise as a peptidic cross-linker for the production of protein polymers with novel physiochemical properties and functionalities.",

Though widely studied as mediators of tissue development, recent work has uncovered a role for this TF family in modulating the vertebrate hematopoietic compartment. Pertinent to our study, murine Dlx1-3 are expressed in an innate lymphocyte population known as natural killer (NK) cells, and they are implicated to assume a functional role in the NK cell maturation pathway. However, Dlx target genes are poorly understood. In Drosophila, the invertebrate Dlx ortholog Distal-less (Dll) regulates another transcription factor called Spineless (ss), which is critical for specifying distal antennal segments. Importantly, the vertebrate ortholog of ss is the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor recently shown to be important in the regulation of a number of immune cell subsets, including NK cells. Given these findings, we investigated whether Dlx TF family members might analogously regulate AhR in an NK cell context. Our results demonstrate that Dlx3 is constitutively co-expressed with AhR in murine and human CD127+ NK cells. Critically, we show that Dlx3 induces AhR promoter activity by binding to a regulatory region that resides ~5.5\u00a0kb upstream of the transcriptional start site. This mechanism is functionally relevant, as Dlx3 expression in human NK cells significantly enhances TF activity at AhR DNA-binding elements (Xenobiotic Responsive Elements, XREs). Thus, our study defines Dlx3 as a positive regulator of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.",

These patients often experience exacerbations with viral and/or bacterial infection, which may cause continuous corticosteroid insensitive inflammation. In this study, we observed that repeated exposure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intranasally attenuated the anti-inflammatory effects of the corticosteroid fluticasone propionate (FP) on neutrophils and CXCL1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in an in vivo murine model. Histone deacetylase-2 (HDAC2) and NF-E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) levels in lungs after LPS administration for 3 consecutive days were significantly decreased to 38.9\u00b16.3% (mean\u00b1SEM) and 77.5\u00b12.7% of the levels seen after only one day of LPS exposure, respectively. In addition, 3 days LPS exposure resulted in an increase of Akt phosphorylation, indicating activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway by 4-fold in lungs compared with 1 day of exposure. Furthermore, combination treatment with theophylline and FP significantly decreased the neutrophil accumulation and CXCL1 concentrations in BAL fluid from 22.5\u00b11.8\u00d7104 cells/mL and 214.6\u00b120.6\u00a0pg/mL to 7.9\u00b10.5\u00d7104 cells/mL and 61.9\u00b113.3\u00a0pg/mL, respectively.

Histopathological analysis of MoM peri-implant tissues reveals an inflammatory cell infiltrate that includes macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils.Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is an innate immune receptor activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Recent studies have demonstrated that cobalt ions from metal-on-metal joints also activate human TLR4, increasing cellular secretion of inflammatory chemokines including interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL8) and CCL2. Chemokines recruit immune cells to the site of inflammation, and their overall effect depends on the chemokine profile produced.This study investigated the effect of cobalt on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines CCL20 and IL-6. The chemotactic potential of conditioned media from a cobalt-stimulated human monocyte cell line on primary monocytes and neutrophils was investigated using an in vitro transwell migration assay. The role of TLR4 in observed effects was studied using a small molecule TLR4-specific antagonist.Cobalt ions significantly increased release of CCL2 and IL-6 by MonoMac 6 cells (P<0.001). Conditioned media from cobalt-stimulated cells significantly increased monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro (P<0.001). These effects were abrogated by the TLR4 antagonist (P<0.001) suggesting that they occur through cobalt activation of TLR4.This study demonstrates the role of TLR4 in cobalt-mediated immune cell chemotaxis and provides a potential mechanism by which cobalt ions may contribute to the immune cell infiltrate surrounding failed metal hip replacements. It also highlights the TLR4 signalling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in preventing cobalt-mediated inflammation.",

To address to this question, CD69-deficient (CD69KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to a mouse model of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced pulmonary inflammation and emphysema. In the two genotypes, PPE increased counts of macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and induced emphysematous changes in the lung, whereas those two pathological signs were significantly enhanced in CD69KO mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, the PPE-induced levels of IL-17 and IL-6 in BALF were significantly higher in CD69KO mice than in WT mice at the acute inflammatory phase. Immunofluorescent studies showed that IL-17 and IL-6 were predominantly expressed in CD4+ and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and macrophages, respectively. Concomitant administration of IL-17- and IL-6-neutralizing antibodies significantly attenuated the PPE-induced emphysematous changes in the two genotypes.

One isolate that showed reduced susceptibility (<50\u00a0nM) to UCLA1 contained mutations in the \u03b15 helix next to the CD4 and co-receptor (CoR) binding complex.

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle formation in vertebrates is derived from the paraxial mesoderm, which develops into myogenic precursor cells and finally differentiates into mature myofibers. This myogenic program involves temporal-spatial molecular events performed by transcription regulators (such as members of the Pax, MRFs and Six families) and signaling pathways (such as Wnts, BMP and Shh signaling). Epigenetic regulation, including histone post-translational modifications is crucial for controlling gene expression through recruitment of various chromatin-modifying enzymes that alter chromatin dynamics during myogenesis. The chromatin modifying enzymes are also recruited at regions of muscle gene regulation, coordinating transcription regulators to influence gene expression. In particular, the reversible methylation status of histone N-terminal tails provides the important regulatory mechanisms in either activation or repression of muscle genes. In this report, we review the recent literatures to deduce mechanisms underlying the epigenetic regulation of gene expression with a focus on histone methylation modification during embryo myogenesis and adult muscle regeneration. Recent results from different histone methylation/demethylation modifications have increased our understanding about the highly intricate layers of epigenetic regulations involved in myogenesis and cross-talk of histone enzymes with the muscle-specific transcriptional machinery.",

Here we show that the BCL6 protein significantly represses RUVBL1 transcription (6.8-fold). Knockdown of endogenous BCL6 in a human B cell lymphoma line leads to significant upregulation of RUVBL1, and there is an inverse expression pattern between the BCL6 and RUVBL1 proteins in certain human lymphomas. RUVBL1 is part of the AAA+ superfamily and participates in multiple processes, including gene transcription regulation, chromatin remodeling, and DNA repair, which, if dysregulated, may promote lymphoma development.

YAP has eight known alternately spliced isoforms and these are widely expressed across multiple tissues. Variable effects have been ascribed to different YAP isoforms by inducing their expression in cells, but whether these differences are due to variability in the transcriptional potency of individual YAP isoforms has not been addressed. Indeed a systematic comparison of the transcriptional potencies of YAP isoforms has not been done. To address this, using overexpression and transcriptional reporter analyses we investigated the transcriptional activities of several human YAP isoforms and determined the effects of the splice variant insertions within the transactivation domain on its transcriptional potency. Utilising full-length coding sequence constructs we determined that the number of WW domains and disruption of the leucine zipper motif within YAP\u2019s transactivation domain both contribute to transcriptional activity. Notably, disruption of YAP\u2019s leucine zipper had a greater effect on transcriptional activity than the absence of the second WW domain. Using GAL4-YAP transcriptional activation domain fusion proteins we found that disruption of the leucine zipper significantly decreased YAP\u2019s transcriptional activity in several cell lines. Our data indicates that expression of different YAP isoforms with varying transcriptional potencies may enable fine control of Hippo pathway signaling. Furthermore the specific isoform being utilised should be taken into consideration when interpreting published data or when designing experiments to ascribe YAP\u2019s function.",

Male Swiss albino mice were injected with different doses of Hcy (100 and 250\u00a0mg/kg; intraperitoneal) for 60 days. Animals subjected to higher doses of Hcy, but not the lower dose, produces motor behavioral abnormalities with significant dopamine depletion in the striatum. Significant inhibition of mitochondrial complex-I activity in nigra with enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes in the nigrostriatum have highlighted the involvement of Hcy-induced oxidative stress. While, chronic exposure to Hcy neither significantly alters the nigrostriatal glutathione level nor it causes any visible change in tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactivity of dopaminergic neurons.

The purpose of the present work is to assess whether desmin is a circulating or only a tissue biomarker of HF. We used several antibodies in order to detect desmin, its proteolytic fragments and its phosphorylated form in LV and plasma by western blot, phosphate affinity electrophoresis, mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence. Plasma was treated with combinatorial peptide ligand library or depleted for albumin and immunoglobulins to increase the sensitivity of detection. We found a 2-fold increased serine-desmin phosphorylation in the LV of HF-rats, mainly in the insoluble fraction, suggesting the formation of desmin aggregates. Desmin cleavage products were also detected in the LV of HF rats, indicating that the increased phosphorylation of desmin results in more susceptibility to proteolytic activity, likely mediated by calpain activity. The native desmin and its degradation products were undetectable in the plasma of rat, mouse or human. These data suggest the potential of serine-phosphorylated form of desmin and its degradation products, but not of desmin itself, as tissue but not circulating biomarkers of HF.",

J774 macrophages in culture were loaded with either H2DCFDA for monitoring ROS or with DAFFM-DA for NO detection. Free radical production was measured on a fluorescence microplate reader and changes were analysed by Cumulative sum (CuSum) calculations. Low concentration of LGG-CM (10% LGG-CM) or LPS did not cause any significant change in basal levels of ROS or NO production. In contrast, high concentration of LGG-CM (75% and 100%) significantly enhanced ROS generation but also significantly reduced NO level. These findings are novel and suggest for the first time that probiotics may release factors in culture which enhance ROS production and may additionally reduce deleterious effects associated with excessive nitrogen species by suppressing NO level.

The bypass grafts harvested from patients with DM tend to go into spasm after their implantation into the coronary circulation. To clarify the contribution of 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT) and angiotensin II (AngII) in the bypass graft spasm, we examined the contractile reactivity to 5-HT or AngII of isolated human endothelium-denuded saphenous vein (SV) harvested from DM and non-DM patients. The 5-HT-induced constriction of the SV was significantly augmented in the DM group than in the non-DM group, which is similar to our previous report. AngII-induced constriction of the SV was also significantly augmented in the DM group than the non-DM group. Especially in the non-DM group, the AngII-induced maximal vasoconstriction was markedly lower than the 5-HT-induced one. Meanwhile, the increasing rates of AngII-induced vasoconstriction in the DM group to the non-DM group were significantly greater than those of 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction. These results indicate that 5-HT is a potent inducer of SV graft spasm in both DM and non-DM patients, while AngII is a potent inducer of SV graft spasm only in patients with DM. Furthermore, the protein level of AngII AT1 receptor (AT1R), but not the protein level of 5-HT2A receptor, in the membrane fraction of the SV smooth muscle cells of DM patients was significantly increased as compared with that of the non-DM patients. These results suggest that the mechanism for hyperreactivity to AngII in the SV from DM patients is due to, at least in part, the increase in the amount of AT1R on membrane of the SV smooth muscle cells.",

Menadione promoted oxidation of NAD(P)H much faster than MSB in permeabilized yeast cell suspension, suggesting the oxidative stress due to consumption of NAD(P)H. The proliferation of yeast cells was inhibited by menadione under aerobic conditions rather than anaerobic conditions, and the inhibitory effect was reduced by superoxide dismutase and catalase. The effect of MSB on the proliferation was much smaller than that of menadione. The above facts suggest that harmless MSB promotes the electron transfer from plasma membrane of yeast cells to anode.

The complex formation between S100A8 and S100A9 appears to be dependent on the thermodynamic stability of the protein during expression.

Insight into the functional characteristics of such structure is achieved by viewing the network as consisting of \u201csubsarcolemmal\u201d (SS) and \u201cintermyofibrillar\u201d (IMF) regions. During the decades, most, but not all, published studies have reported higher (sometimes over 2-fold) enzyme and enzyme-pathway protein-specific activities in IMF compared to SS mitochondria. We tested the hypothesis that non-mitochondrial protein contamination might account for much of the apparently lower specific activities of isolated SS mitochondria. Mouse gastrocnemii (n=6) were suspended in isolation medium, minced, and homogenized according to procedures typically used to isolate SS mitochondria. However, the supernatant fraction, collected after the first slow-speed (800g) centrifugation, was divided equally: one sample was exposed to nagarse (MITO+), while the other was not (MITO\u2212). Nagarse treatment reduced total protein yield by 25%, while it increased protein-specific respiration rates (nmol O2 min\u22121\u00a0mg\u22121), by 38% under \u201cresting\u201d (state 4) and by 84% under maximal (state 3) conditions. Nagarse therefore increased the respiratory control ratio (state 3/state 4) by 30%. In addition, the ADP/O ratio was increased by 9% and the activity of citrate synthase (U/mg) was 49% higher. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the MITO+ preparation contained less contamination from non-mitochondrial proteins. We conclude that nagarse treatment of SS mitochondria removes not only non-mitochondrial proteins but also the protein of damaged mitochondria, improves indices of functional integrity, and the resulting protein-specific activities.",

While the intercellular signals controlling Schwann cell precursor migration are well studied, the intracellular signals controlling Schwann cell precursor migration remain elusive. Here, using a rat primary cell culture system, we show that Dock8, an atypical Dock180-related guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for small GTPases of the Rho family, specifically interacts with Nck1, an adaptor protein composed only of Src homology (SH) domains, to promote Schwann cell precursor migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Knockdown of Dock8 or Nck1 with its respective siRNA markedly decreases PDGF-induced cell migration, as well as Rho GTPase activation, in precursors. Dock8, through its unique N-terminal proline-rich motif, interacts with the SH3 domain of Nck1, but not with other adaptor proteins composed only of SH domains, e.g. Grb2 and CrkII, and not with the adaptor protein Elmo1. Reintroduction of the proline-rich motif mutant of Dock8 in Dock8 siRNA-transfected Schwann cell precursors fails to restore their migratory abilities, whereas that of wild-type Dock8 does restore these abilities. These results suggest that Nck1 interaction with Dock8 mediates PDGF-induced Schwann cell precursor migration, demonstrating not only that Nck1 and Dock8 are previously unanticipated intracellular signaling molecules involved in the regulation of Schwann cell precursor migration but also that Dock8 is among the genetically-conservative common interaction subset of Dock family proteins consisting only of SH domain adaptor proteins.",

     "abstract": "The intracellular trigger for the quorum sensing response mechanism in Staphylococcus aureus involves the phosphorylation of the response regulator AgrA by the membrane anchored histidine kinase AgrC. AgrA activates transcription from three promoter sequences (P1\u2013P3). The promoter strength, conditional association of AgrA with these promoter elements and temporal delay in AgrA-mediated changes in gene expression contribute to the diversity of the quorum sensing response in different S. aureus strains. AgrA promoters comprise of imperfect direct repeats of DNA with a consensus sequence- [TA][AC][CA]GTTN[AG][TG]. Here we describe crystal structures of the DNA-binding (LytTR) domain of AgrA with different cognate DNA sequences that reveal a hitherto unanticipated feature of AgrA-DNA interactions. AgrA promoter interactions are asymmetric with fewer interactions at the binding site proximal to the \u221235 promoter element. Biochemical assays to evaluate AgrA-promoter interactions suggests that phosphorylation induced dimerization of AgrA can compensate for the asymmetry in AgrA-DNA interactions. The structures also provide a basis to rationalize mutations that were noted to alter AgrA activity without affecting protein-DNA interactions. Put together, the structural data, gene expression and mutational analysis reveal that promoter strength and AgrA phosphorylation enable quorum-sensing triggered transcriptional changes leading to a transition from the persistent to virulent phenotype.",

In recent years, drug repositioning has gained considerable attention in drug discovery and development. Herein, 8HQ (1) and its derivatives (2\u20139) bearing various substituents (amino, nitro, cyano and halogen) were investigated for their antimicrobial against 27 microorganisms (agar dilution method) and antioxidant (DPPH method) activities. The parent 8HQ (1) exerted a highly potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including diploid fungi and yeast with MIC values in the range of 3.44\u201313.78\u00a0\u03bcM. Moreover, the halogenated 8HQ, especially 7-bromo-8HQ (4) and clioquinol (6), displayed a high antigrowth activity against Gram-negative bacteria compared with the parent compound (1). Apparently, the derivatives with a relatively high safely index, e.g., nitroxoline (2), exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila (MIC=5.26\u00a0\u03bcM) and selectively inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa with the MIC value of 84.14\u00a0\u03bcM; cloxyquin (3) showed a strong activity against Listseria monocytogenes and Plesiomonas shigelloides with MIC values of 5.57 and 11.14\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. Most compounds displayed an antioxidant activity. Specifically, 5-amino-8HQ (8) was shown to be the most potent antioxidant (IC50=8.70\u00a0\u03bcM) compared with the positive control (\u03b1-tocopherol) with IC50 of 13.47\u00a0\u03bcM.

The anticancer effects of the drugs were checked by observing their inhibitory effects on proliferation of rat liver cancer cells using MTT assay. Inhibition of Na+,K+-pump was determined by measuring pump-mediated current of rat \u03b11/\u03b21 and \u03b12/\u03b21 Na+,K+pumps expressed in Xenopus oocytes.All tested bufadienolides inhibited cell proliferation and Na+,K+pump activity. An activity coefficient A=100xIC50Na,K pump/IC50proliferation was used to describe drug effectivity as anticancer drug. Natural bufalin exhibited lowest effectivity on cell proliferation, and also the A value for rat \u03b11 isoform was the lowest (0.08), the \u03b12 isoform was much less sensitive (A=1.00). The highest A values were obtained for the BF238 derivative with A=0.88 and 2.64 for the \u03b11 and \u03b12 isoforms, respectively.

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how CD44 impaired Akt phosphorylation, EGR-1 expression and cell proliferation. E6.1 Jurkat cells, which lack endogenous CD44 expression, were engineered to express CD44. Previously we showed that Akt is hypophosphorylated, EGR-1 expression is reduced and proliferation is impaired in CD44 expressing E6.1 Jurkat cells. The cell cycle was studied using flow cytometry and the role of calcium (Ca2+) in Akt phosphorylation and EGR-1 expression was investigated using Western blotting. Phosphatase activity was assessed using a commercially available kit. CD44 expressing cells showed disruption at the G1 to S transition. Chelation of Ca2+ from the culture media impaired Akt phosphorylation and EGR-1 expression in both CD44 expressing cells and the open vector control. Moreover, Ni2+ disrupted cell proliferation in both cell types suggesting Ca2+ import through calcium release activated calcium channels (CRAC). Staining of cells with fura-2 AM showed significantly higher Ca2+ in CD44 expressing cells as compared with the vehicle control. Finally, non-calcium mediated phosphatase activity was significantly greater in CD44 expressing cells. We propose that the enhanced phosphatase activity in the CD44 cells increased the dephosphorylation rate of Akt; at the same time, the increased intracellular concentration of Ca2+ in the CD44 cells ensured that the phosphorylation of Akt remains intact albeit at lower concentrations as compared with the vector control. Reduced Akt phosphorylation resulted in lowered expression of EGR-1 and hence, reduced the cell proliferation rate.",

Interleukin (IL)-7 and CXC chemokine ligand (CXCL) 12 are known to be express in stromal cells, and both molecules are essential for B-lymphogenesis. In the present study, we examined the role of Wnt signaling in regulating IL-7 and CXCL12 expression and in affecting B-lymphogenesis. In mouse stromal ST2 cells, expression of IL-7 and CXCL12 mRNA was augmented by noncanonical Wnt5a. When mouse BM-derived cells were cultured on Wnt5a-overexpressing ST2 cells, an increased number of B220+/IgM- B-lymphoid precursor cells was observed. These results show that Wnt5a regulates IL-7 gene expression in stromal cells and suggest the possibility that noncanonical Wnt regulates B-lymphogenesis via IL-7 expression in stromal cells.",

Two glycyl-radical enzymes (GREs), pyruvate formate-lyase (PflB) and 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase (TdcE), generate formate as a product of catalysis during anaerobic growth of Escherichia coli. We demonstrate in this study that TdcE, like PflB, interacts specifically with FocA.

     "abstract": "Bone and dentin are mineralized extracellular matrices produced by osteoblasts and odontoblasts, respectively, and their major organic portion is type I collagen. Dentinogenesis Imperfecta (DGI) is one of the most common clinically- and genetically-based disturbances of dentin formation, causing irreversible dentin defects. Among several types of DGI, patients with DGI type II exhibit opalescent dentin with partial or complete pulp obliteration. It has been previously reported that the non-sense mutation (c.133C>T) in Dentin Sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) was identified in DGI type II patients at glutamine residue 45, resulting in the premature stop codon (p.Q45X). DSPP is known to be synthesized as a single gene product and further processed at Gly462-Asp463, resulting in the production of Dentin Sialoprotein (DSP) and Dentin Phosphoprotein (DPP). We hypothesized that the shorter form (Q45X) of N-terminal Dentin Sialoprotein (N-DSP) may cause over-production of type I collagen protein as obliterated pulp is occupied by dentin. To test this hypothesis, we generated mouse recombinant Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST)-N-DSP fusion protein, and the effect of GST-N-DSP was investigated in calvarial bone explant culture and MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic culture systems. Here we show that a significant increase in calvarial bone formation is observed by GST-N-DSP. GST-N-DSP accelerates MC3T3-E1 osteoblast cell growth and proliferation and subsequent osteoblast differentiation by inducing the expression of certain osteogenic markers such as type I collagen, Runx2, Osterix and ATF4. Interestingly, GST-N-DSP significantly enhances dentinogenesis marker gene expression including Dspp and Dmp1 gene expression in non-odontogenic MC3T3-E1 cells. To rule out any artificial effect of GST-tag, we also used the synthetic peptide of N-DSP and confirmed the results of N-DSP peptide were essentially similar to those of GST-N-DSP. Taken together, our data suggest that N-DSP promotes bone formation by accelerating osteoblast cell proliferation and subsequent osteoblast differentiation accompanied by marked up-regulation of the dentin matrix markers, such as Dspp and Dmp1 genes.",

Glabridin is one of the main flavonoid compounds from Glycyrrhiza glabra and displays a broad range of biological properties. In the present work, we investigated the effect of glabridin on GABAA receptors. For this purpose, we employed the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique on Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant GABAA receptors. Through this approach, we observed that glabridin presents a strong potentiating effect on GABAA \u03b11\u03b2(1\u22123)\u03b32 receptors. The potentiation was slightly dependent on the \u03b2 subunit and was most pronounced at the \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32 subunit combination, which forms the most abundant GABAA receptor in the CNS. Glabridin potentiated with an EC50 of 6.3\u00b11.7\u00a0\u00b5M and decreased the EC50 of the receptor for GABA by approximately 12-fold. The potentiating effect of glabridin is flumazenil-insensitive and does not require the benzodiazepine binding site. Glabridin acts on the \u03b2 subunit of GABAA receptors by a mechanism involving the M286 residue, which is a key amino acid at the binding site for general anesthetics, such as propofol and etomidate. Our results demonstrate that GABAA receptors are strongly potentiated by one of the main flavonoid compounds from Glycyrrhiza glabra and suggest that glabridin could contribute to the reported hypnotic effect of Glycyrrhiza extracts.",

The QENS measurements on the D2O- and H2O-solution samples of F-actin and S1 provided the spectra of hydration water, from which the translational diffusion coefficient (DT), the residence time (\u03c4T), and the rotational correlation time (\u03c4R) were evaluated.

The amount of lectin required for hemagglutination of normal human O erythrocytes was 6.72\u00a0\u00b5g/ml. Among the saccharides tested, Man-\u03b1-(1,6)-Man was found to be the most potent inhibitor (0.01\u00a0mM) determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Steady state and time resolved fluorescence measurements revealed that litchi lectin formed ground state complex with maltose (Ka=4.9 (\u00b10.2)\u00d7104\u00a0M\u22121), which indicated static quenching (Stern-Volmer (SV) constant Ksv=4.6 (\u00b10.2)\u00d7104\u00a0M\u22121). CD measurements demonstrated that litchi lectin showed no overall conformational change during the binding process with maltose. The lectin showed antibiofilm activity against Pseudomonus aeruginosa.A novel homodimeric lectin has been purified from the seeds of litchi fruits (Litchi chinensis) having specificity for \u03b1-d-glucose/mannose. The thermodynamics and conformational aspects of its interaction with maltose have been studied in detail. The antibiofilm activity of this lectin towards Pseudomonus aeruginosa has been explored.The newly identified litchi lectin is highly specific for \u03b1-d-glucose/mannose with an important antibiofilm activity towards Pseudomonus aeruginosa.",

We utilized whole-cell patch clamp and Di-8-ANEPPS voltage-sensitive dye measurements to characterize plasma membrane effects of 500\u00a0ps stimuli in rat hippocampal neurons (RHN), NG108, and CHO cells. Even a single 500-ps pulse at 190\u00a0kV/cm increased membrane conductance and depolarized cells. These effects were augmented by applying brief psEP bursts (5\u2013125 pulses), whereas the rate of pulse delivery (8\u00a0Hz\u20131\u00a0kHz) played little role. psEP-treated cells displayed large inward current at negative membrane potentials but modest or no conductance changes at positive potentials. A 1-kHz burst of 25 pulses increased the whole-cell conductance in the range (\u2212100)\u2013(\u221260)\u00a0mV to 22\u201326\u00a0nS in RHN and NG108 cells (from 3 and 0.7 nS, respectively), but only to 5\u00a0nS in CHO (from 0.3\u00a0nS). The conductance increase was reversible within about 2\u00a0min. Such pattern of cell permeabilization, with characteristic inward rectification and slow recovery, was similar to earlier reported effects of 60- and 600-ns pulses, pointing to the similarity of structural membrane rearrangements in spite of a different membrane charging mechanism.",

In glycosome biogenesis, Pex5p recognizes newly synthesized glycosomal matrix proteins via peroxisome-targeting signal type-1 (PTS-1) and transports them into glycosomes through an interaction with Pex14p, a component of the matrix protein import machinery on the glycosomal membrane. Knockdown of the PEX5 or PEX14 with RNAi has been shown to inhibit the growth of Trypanosoma brucei. Thus, compounds that inhibit the interaction of TbPex5p\u2013TbPex14p are expected to become lead compounds in the development of anti-trypanosomal drugs. Here, we report a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay for the screening of compounds that inhibit the TbPex5p\u2013TbPex14p interaction. The binding of GST-TbPex14p and TbPex5p-His with or without additional compounds was evaluated by measuring the energy transfer of the HTRF pair, using a terbium-labeled anti GST antibody as the donor and an FITC-labeled anti His antibody as the acceptor. The assay was performed in a 384-well plate platform and exhibits a Z\u2019-factor of 0.85\u20130.91, while the coefficiency of variation is 1.1\u20137.7%, suggesting it can be readily adapted to a high-throughput format for the automated screening of chemical libraries. We screened 20,800 compounds and found 11 compounds that inhibited energy transfer.

Here, we examine, whether N-AcMet also is better than N-AcTrp to protect albumin against oxidation. Recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) without and with N-AcMet or N-AcTrp was oxidized by using chloramine-T (CT) as a model compound for mimicking oxidative stress. Oxidation of rHSA was examined by determining carbonyl groups and advanced oxidation protein products. Structural changes were studied by native-PAGE, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence and differential scanning calorimetry. The anti-oxidant capacity of CT-treated rHSA was quantified by its ability to scavenge peroxynitrite and the hydroxyl radical. The pharmacokinetics of indocyanine green-labeled albumin preparations was studied in male mice. We found that the number of chemical modifications and the structural changes of rHSA were significantly smaller in the presence of N-AcMet than in the presence of N-AcTrp. The anti-oxidant properties of CT-exposed rHSA were best protected by adding N-AcMet. Finally, N-AcMet is superior in preserving the normal pharmacokinetics of rHSA. Thus, N-AcMet is superior to N-AcTrp in protecting albumin preparations against oxidation. In addition, N-AcMet is probable also useful for protecting other proteins. Therefore, N-AcMet should be useful as a new and effective stabilizer and antioxidant for albumin isolated from blood, rHSA, albumin-fusion proteins and for preparations of rHSA-therapeutic complexes.",

This review focuses on applications and developments of various electrochemical biosensors based on lactate detection as lactate being essential metabolite in anaerobic metabolic pathway. A comparative study to summarize the L-lactate biosensors on the basis of different analytical properties in terms of fabrication, sensitivity, detection limit, linearity, response time and storage stability has been done. It also addresses the merits and demerits of current enzyme based lactate biosensors. Lactate biosensors are of two main types \u2013 lactate oxidase (LOD) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) based. Different supports tried for manufacturing lactate biosensors include membranes, polymeric matrices-conducting or non-conducting, transparent gel matrix, hydrogel supports, screen printed electrodes and nanoparticles. All the examples in these support categories have been aptly discussed. Finally this review encompasses the conclusion and future emerging prospects of lactate sensors.",

Structures like hairpin, cruciform, triplex, G-triplex, quadruplex, i-motif and other alternative non-canonical DNA structures have been studied at length and have also shown their in vivo occurrence. This review mainly focuses on non-canonical structures adopted by DNA oligonucleotides which have certain prerequisites for their formation in terms of sequence, its length, number and orientation of strands along with varied solution conditions. This conformational polymorphism of DNA might be the basis of different functional properties of a specific set of DNA sequences, further giving some insights for various extremely complicated biological phenomena.

TGF-\u03b21 up-regulated the expression of SDC4, accompanied by the induction of EMT. Wound-healing and transwell chemotaxis assay revealed that SDC4 promoted cell migration and invasion. SDC4 knockdown recovered the E-cadherin and decreased vimentin and Snail expression in EMT-induced A549 cells. However, depletion of SDC4 resulted in little change of the Slug protein expression and mesenchymal cell morphology induced by TGF-\u03b21. The double knockdown of SDC-4 and Slug was required for reversal of epithelial morphology; it did not occur from the SDC4 single knockdown. These findings suggest that Snail is a transcriptional factor downstream of SDC4, and SDC4 regulates TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT by cooperating with Slug.

This effect was effectively canceled by the expression of shRNA-resistant ST2, but not shRNA-resistant ST2L.The novel enhancement of cell proliferation by ST2 appears to involve positive feedback.

Data presented here demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity phytochemical curcumin blocked Skp2 protein accumulation during early adipocyte hyperplasia. In addition, curcumin dose-dependently induced p27 protein accumulation and G1 arrest of synchronously replicating 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Of note, p27 protein accumulation occurred in the presence of decreased p27 mRNA suggesting a role for post-transcriptional regulation. In support of this hypothesis, curcumin markedly increased p27 protein half-life as well as attenuated ubiquitin proteasome activity suggesting that inhibition of targeted p27 proteolysis occurred through curcumin-mediated attenuation of Skp2 and 26S proteasome activity. While we observed no cytotoxic effects for curcumin at doses less than 20\u00a0\u00b5M, it is important to note an increase in apoptotic signaling at concentrations greater than 30\u00a0\u00b5M. Finally, data presented here demonstrate that the anti-proliferative effect of curcumin was critical for the suppression of adipocyte differentiation and the development of the mature adipocyte. Collectively, our data demonstrate that curcumin-mediated post-transcriptional accumulation of p27 accounts in part for the anti-proliferative effect observed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.",

While a knock down of RelA does not alter the effects of TNF on Cirbp, a knock down of RelB represses this effect.

In contrast, knockdown of Trx1 mRNA expression by short interfering RNA or blockage of Trx1 redox activity with PX12 or 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene enhanced protein S-sulfhydration.

In this study, we evaluated the activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase pathway, which participates in protein translation, cell growth and autophagy in a manner relevant to intracellular glutamine levels, in murine neural progenitor cells exposed to theanine. Exposure to theanine promoted the phosphorylation of mTOR and downstream proteins in neurospheres from embryonic mouse neocortex. Although stable overexpression of SLC38A1 similarly facilitated phosphorylation of mTOR-relevant proteins in undifferentiated P19 cells, theanine failed to additionally accelerate the increased phosphorylation in these stable transfectants. Theanine accelerated the formation of neurospheres from murine embryonic neocortex and adult hippocampus, along with facilitation of both 5-bromo-2\u2019-deoxyuridine incorporation and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide reduction in embryonic neurospheres.

These results suggest that theanine activates the mTOR signaling pathway for proliferation together with accelerated neurogenesis in murine undifferentiated neural progenitor cells.",

     "abstract": "In humans, sulfite is generated endogenously by the metabolism of sulfur containing amino acids such as methionine and cysteine. Sulfite is also formed from exposure to sulfur dioxide, one of the major environmental pollutants. Sulfite is used as an antioxidant and preservative in dried fruits, vegetables, and beverages such as wine. Sulfite is also used as a stabilizer in many drugs. Sulfite toxicity has been associated with allergic reactions characterized by sulfite sensitivity, asthma, and anaphylactic shock. Sulfite is also toxic to neurons and cardiovascular cells. Recent studies suggest that the cytotoxicity of sulfite is mediated by free radicals; however, molecular mechanisms involved in sulfite toxicity are not fully understood. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is known to participate in mitochondrial respiration and has antioxidant and peroxidase activities. Studies were performed to understand the related mechanism of oxidation of sulfite and radical generation by ferric cytochrome c (Fe3+cyt c) in the absence and presence of H2O2. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin trapping studies using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) were performed with sulfite, Fe3+cyt c, and H2O2. An EPR spectrum corresponding to the sulfite radical adducts of DMPO (DMPO-SO3-) was obtained. The amount of DMPO- SO 3 - formed from the oxidation of sulfite by the Fe3+cyt c increased with sulfite concentration. In addition, the amount of DMPO- SO 3 - formed by the peroxidase activity of Fe3+cyt c also increased with sulfite and H2O2 concentration. From these results, we propose a mechanism in which the Fe3+cyt c and its peroxidase activity oxidizes sulfite to sulfite radical. Our results suggest that Fe3+cyt c could have a novel role in the deleterious effects of sulfite in biological systems due to increased production of sulfite radical. It also shows that the increased production of sulfite radical may be responsible for neurotoxicity and some of the injuries which occur to humans born with molybdenum cofactor and sulfite oxidase deficiencies.",

This limitation could partly be due to glycosylation heterogeneity and has delayed the disclosure of the 3D structure of hCES2 which would be of upmost relevance for the development of new substrates and inhibitors. The present work evaluated the involvement of glycans in hCES2 activity and thermo stability in an attempt to find alternative active forms of the enzyme that might be adequate for structure elucidation.Partial or non-glycosylated forms of a secreted form of hCES2 have been obtained by three approaches: (i) enzymatic deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase F; (ii) incubation with the inhibitor tunicamycin; ii) site directed mutagenesis of each or both N-glycosylation sites.Deglycosylated protein did not show a detectable decrease in enzyme activity. On the other hand, tunicamycin led to decreased levels of secreted hCES2 but the enzyme was still active. In agreement, mutation of each and both N-glycosylation sites led to decreased levels of secreted active hCES2. However, the thermostability of the glycosylation mutants was decreased.The results indicated that glycans are involved, to some extent in protein folding in vivo, however, removal of glycans does not abrogate the activity of secreted hCES2.",

Thrombin and factor Xa have been revealed as the most promising targets, which fully agrees with the current drug development strategy. Inhibitors of factors Va and VIIa are expected to have narrow therapeutic windows. Inhibitors of factors VIIIa and IXa are expected to have a moderate anticoagulant effect. Factors XI and XII are poor targets for anticoagulant drugs. Compared with plasma that is deficient in factor II, the thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin and aptamer HD1 had increased activity. Both inhibitors were tested in deficient plasma providing a model of potential drug combination.

At 20-26 weeks of age, approximately 20% of Dgcr2-KO mice showed gait abnormalities with trembling and difficulty in balancing. Footprint test revealed awkward movements in Dgcr2-KO mice soon after they were placed on the floor. Once they started walking, their stride lengths were not different from wild-type mice. In short-term open field test, Dgcr2-KO mice travelled a significantly shorter distance and walked more slowly than wild-type mice during the initial 5\u00a0min after being placed in a new environment. In long-term open field test, Dgcr2-KO mice exhibited reduced cage activity compared to wild-type mice on the first day, but not on later days. Dgcr2-KO mice showed reduced latency to fall in the rotarod test, and the latency was not improved in the 3-day test. Histology revealed sparseness of cerebellar Purkinje cells in Dgcr2-KO mice.

In this study, the effects of lovastatin on two phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, were studied in cultured endothelial cells in the presence of an oxysterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol. After the cells were cultured with 50\u00a0nM of lovastatin for 60\u00a0h, lovastatin was found to decrease the incorporation of [3H]choline into phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, inhibited CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) activity without altering the activity of sphingomyelin synthase and neutral sphingomyelinase. And lovastatin was not found to have a direct inhibitive effect on activity of CT. Exogenous mevalonic acid or cholesterol reversed the reduction of cholesterol concentration that was caused by lovastatin, but had no significant effect on the diminished [3H]sphingomyelin by lovastatin. The increase of [3H]sphingomyelin by 27-hydroxycholesterol was not detected in the presence of lovastatin. These findings suggest that (1) lovastatin can reduce sphingomyelin content by means of inhibiting phosphatidylcholine synthesis; and (2) The decrease in sphingomyelin is not related to the diminished cholesterol concentration or mevalonate-derived intermediates. This inhibitive effect of lovastatin on sphingomyelin may benefit cellular calcification caused by sphingomyelin.",

These reactions constitute potential mechanisms for active demethylation of methylated DNA. However, the relationship between the DNA methylation patterns and the effects of TET family proteins in chondrocyte differentiation is still unclear. In this study, we showed that DNA hydroxylation of 5mC was increased during chondrocytic differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells and that the expression of Tet1 was particularly enhanced. Moreover, knockdown experiments revealed that the downregulation of Tet1 expression caused decreases in chondrogenesis markers such as type 2 and type 10 collagens. Furthermore, we found that TET proteins had a site preference for hydroxylation of 5mC on the Insulin-like growth factor 1 (Igf1) promoter in chondrocytes.

Mice were treated with clodronate liposome or control liposome for 48\u00a0h before undergoing exhaustive exercise on a treadmill. Twenty-four hours after exhaustive exercise, the gastrocnemius muscles were removed for histological and PCR analyses. Exhaustive exercise increased the number of macrophages in the muscle; however, clodronate liposome treatment reduced this infiltration. Although exhaustive exercise resulted in an increase in injured myofibers, clodronate liposome treatment following exhaustive exercise reduced the injured myofibers. Clodronate liposome treatment also decreased the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6) in the skeletal muscle after exhaustive exercise.

Our current understanding is that dietary GlcCer is degraded to ceramide and further metabolized to sphingoid bases in the intestine. However, ceramide is only found in trace amounts in food plants and thus is frequently taken as GlcCer in a health supplement. In the present study, we successfully prepared konjac ceramide (kCer) using endoglycoceramidase I (EGCase I). Konjac, a plant tuber, is an enriched source of GlcCer (kGlcCer), and has been commercialized as a dietary supplement to improve dry skin and itching that are caused by a deficiency of epidermal ceramide. Nerve growth factor (NGF) produced by skin cells is one of the itch factors in the stratum corneum of the skin. Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) has been known to inhibit NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of epidermal nerve fibers. It is well known that the itch sensation is regulated by the balance between NGF and Sema 3A. In the present study, while kGlcCer did not show an in vitro inhibitory effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, kCer was demonstrated to inhibit a remarkable neurite outgrowth. In addition, the effect of kCer was similar to that of Sema 3A in cell morphological changes and neurite retractions, but different from C2-Ceramide. kCer showed a Sema 3A-like action, causing CRMP2 phosphorylation, which results in a collapse of neurite growth cones. Thus, it is expected that kCer is an advanced konjac ceramide material that may have neurite outgrowth-specific action to relieve uncontrolled and serious itching, in particular, from atopic eczema.",

The significant increase of amylase and lipase levels in sera of the transgenic lines approximately peaked at 8 weeks old and thereafter, plateaued or gradually decreased. The histopathology in transgenic acinar cells was characterized by intracytoplasmic accumulation of abnormal proteins with decrease of normal zymogen granules. The hNectin-2Ig expression was observed in the cytoplasm of pancreatic acinar cells, which was consistent with zymogen granules. However, signals of hNectin-2Ig were very weak in the transgenic acinar cells with the abnormal cytoplasmic accumulaion.

     "abstract": "The CD98 heavy chain (CD98hc) regulates virus-induced cell fusion and monocyte fusion, and is involved in amino acid transportation. Here, we examined the role that CD98hc plays in the formation of osteoclasts using CD98hcflox/floxLysM-cre peritoneal macrophages (CD98hc-defect macrophages). Peritoneal macrophages were stimulated with co-cultured with osteoblasts in the presence of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3, and thereafter stained with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining solution. The multinucleated osteoclast formation was severely impaired in the peritoneal macrophages isolated from the CD98hc-defect mice compared with those from wild-type mice. CD98hc mediates integrin signaling and amino acid transport through the CD98 light chain (CD98lc). In integrin signaling, suppression of the M-CSF-RANKL-induced phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, JNK and p130Cas were observed at the triggering phase in the CD98h-defect peritoneal macrophages. Moreover, we showed that the general control non-derepressible (GCN) pathway, which was activated by amino acid starvation, was induced by the CD98hc-defect peritoneal macrophages stimulated with RANKL. These results indicate that CD98 plays two important roles in osteoclast formation through integrin signaling and amino acid transport.",

     "abstract": "Various types of zinc (Zn) complexes have been developed as promising antidiabetic agents in recent years. However, the pharmacological action of Zn complex is not elucidated because the biodistribution of the complex in a living organism has not been studied. Nuclear medicine imaging is superior technology for the noninvasive analysis of the temporal distribution of drug candidates in living organisms. Gamma-ray emission imaging (GREI), which was developed by our laboratory as a novel molecular imaging modality, was adopted to visualize various \u03b3-ray\u2013emitting radionuclides that are not detected by conventional imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. Therefore, we applied GREI to a biodistribution assay of Zn complexes. In the present study, 65Zn was produced in the natCu(p,n) reaction in an azimuthal varying field cyclotron for the GREI experiment. The distribution was then noninvasively visualized using GREI after the intravenous administration of a 65Zn-labeled di(1-oxy-2-pyridinethiolato)zinc [Zn(opt)2], ZnCl2, and di(l-histidinato)zinc. The GREI images were validated using conventional invasive assays. This novel study showed that GREI is a powerful tool for the biodistribution analysis of antidiabetic Zn complexes in a living organism. In addition, accumulation of 65Zn in the cardiac blood pool was observed for [Zn(opt)2], which exhibits potent antidiabetic activity. These results suggest that the slow elimination of Zn from the blood is correlated to the antidiabetic activity of [Zn(opt)2].",

     "abstract": "We previously demonstrated a marked upregulation in the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/growth differentiation factor (GDF) family member, GDF5, which is capable of promoting brown adipogenesis, in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of obese mice. In this study, we identified other GDF family members, besides GDF5 that are responsive to different obesogenic signals in BAT using inborn and acquired obesity animal models. In BAT from leptin-deficient ob/ob mice, GDF1 expression was preferentially downregulated, whereas the expression of several other genes in the BMP/GDF family, including GDF5, was upregulated. Moreover, in cultured brown adipocytes exposed to tunicamycin and hydrogen peroxide, at concentrations not affecting cellular viability, GDF1 expression was significantly downregulated. Recombinant GDF1 failed to significantly alter brown adipogenesis, despite the promoted phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in cultured brown adipocytes, but accelerated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation with a concomitant increase in the number of migrating cells during exposure in a manner sensitive to activin-like kinase inhibitors in macrophagic RAW264.7 cells. Similarly, accelerated migration was observed in murine peritoneal macrophages exposed to GDF1. These results indicate that obesity could lead to predominant downregulation of GDF1 expression in BAT, which can modulate cellular migration through a mechanism relevant to activation of the downstream Smad signaling pathway in adjacent macrophages.",

Our aim was to identify the lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) in trophozoites and investigate its cellular fate during endocytosis. LBPA was detected by TLC in a 0.5 Rf spot of total lipids, which co-migrated with the LBPA standard. The 6C4 antibody, against LBPA recognized phospholipids extracted from this spot. Reverse phase LC-ESI-MS and MS/MS mass spectrometry revealed six LBPA species of m/z 772.58\u2013802.68. LBPA was associated to pinosomes and phagosomes. Intriguingly, during pinocytosis, whole cell fluorescence quantification showed that LBPA dropped 84% after 15\u00a0min incubation with FITC-Dextran, and after 60\u00a0min, it increased at levels close to steady state conditions. Similarly, during erythrophagocytosis, after 15\u00a0min, LBPA also dropped in 36% and increased after 60 and 90\u00a0min. EhRab7A protein appeared in some vesicles with LBPA in steady state conditions, but after phagocytosis co-localization of both molecules increased and in late phases of erythrophagocytosis they were found in huge phagosomes or multivesicular bodies with many intraluminal vacuoles, and surrounding ingested erythrocytes and phagosomes. The 6C4 and anti-EhADH (EhADH is an ALIX family protein) antibodies and Lysotracker merged in about 50% of the vesicles in steady state conditions and throughout phagocytosis. LBPA and EhADH were also inside huge phagosomes. These results demonstrated that E. histolytica LBPA is associated to pinosomes and phagosomes during endocytosis and suggested differences of LBPA requirements during pinocytosis and phagocytosis.",

Most notably in a complex with chromatin-remodelling ATPase ATRX, Daxx serves as a histone H3.3 chaperone at telomeric regions and certain genes. In this report we document that Daxx interacts with another chromatin-remodelling, ATPase Brg1. We confirm the Daxx-Brg1 association both in vitro and in cells and show that Daxx interacts with Brg1 in high-molecular-weight complexes. Ectopic co-expression of Daxx with Brg1 and PML could shift disperse nuclear localisation of Brg1 into PML bodies. Mapping the Daxx-Brg1 interaction revealed that Daxx preferentially binds the region between Brg1 N-terminal QLQ and HSA domains, but also weakly interacts with its C-terminal part. Brg1 interacted with both the central and N-terminal parts of Daxx. SiRNA-mediated down-regulation of Daxx in SW13 adrenal carcinoma cells markedly enhanced expression of Brg1-activated genes CD44 or SCEL, suggesting that Daxx either directly through Brg1 and/or indirectly via other factors is a negative regulator of their transcription. Our findings point to Brg1 as another chromatin-remodelling protein that might similarly, as ATRX, target Daxx to specific chromatin regions where it can carry out its chromatin- and transcription-regulating functions.",

We also determined that the all three compounds increase the number of osteoclast differentiated from murine bone marrow cells. Furthermore, the three inhibitors, especially kenpaullone, promoted maturation of cathepsin K, suggesting that the resorption activity of the resultant osteoclasts is also activated.

We herein investigated the effects of water-soluble fullerene derivatives: a bis-malonic acid derivative and three types of proline-type fullerene derivatives, on adipogenesis using NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing PPAR\u03b3. One of the proline-type fullerene derivatives (P3) harboring three carboxy groups significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and the expression of adipocyte-specific genes, such as aP2, induced by the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone. On the other hand, the bis-malonic acid derivative (M) and the 2 other proline-type fullerene derivatives (P1, P2), which have two carboxy groups, had no effect on PPAR\u03b3-mediated lipid accumulation or the expression of aP2. P3 fullerene also inhibited lipid accumulation induced by the combined stimulation with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), dexamethasone, and insulin in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. During the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, P3 fullerene did not affect the expression of C/EBP\u03b4, C/EBP\u03b2, or PPAR\u03b3, but markedly inhibited that of aP2 mRNA.

Since the plant-derived LAB strain produces an extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), in this study, we analyzed the chemical structure and the biosynthesizing genes for the EPS.The EPS, which was purified from the LP28 culture broth, was classified into acidic and neutral EPSs with a molecular mass of about 50\u00a0kDa and 40\u00a0kDa, respectively. The acidic EPS consisted of glucose, galactose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine moieties. Interestingly, since pyruvate residue was detected in the hydrolyzed acidic EPS, one of the four sugars may be modified with pyruvate. On the other hand, the neutral EPS consisted of glucose, mannose, and N-acetylglucosamine; pyruvate was scarcely detected in the polysaccharide molecule.As a first step to deduce the probiotic function of the EPS together with the biosynthesis, we determined the whole genome sequence of the LP28 strain, demonstrating that the genome is a circular DNA, which is composed of 1,774,865\u00a0bp (1683 ORFs) with a GC content of 37.1%. We also found that the LP28 strain harbors a plasmid carrying 6 ORFs composed of 5366\u00a0bp with a GC content of 36.5%. By comparing all of the genome sequences among the LP28 strain and four strains of P. pentosaceus reported previously, we found that 53 proteins in the LP28 strain display a similarity of less than 50% with those in the four P. pentosaceus strains. Significantly, 4 of the 53 proteins, which may be enzymes necessary for the EPS production on the LP28 strain, were absent in the other four P. pentosaceus strains and displayed less than 50% similarity with other LAB species. The EPS-biosynthetic gene cluster detected only in the LP28 genome consisted of 12 ORFs containing a priming enzyme, five glycosyltransferases, and a putative polysaccharide pyruvyltransferase.",

The glyoxal group (\u2013COCHO) of Z-Lys-COCHO increases binding ~300 fold compared to Z-Lys-H. The \u03b1-carboxylate of Z-Lys-COOH has no significant effect on inhibitor binding. Z-Arg-COOH is shown to bind ~2 times more tightly than Z-Lys-COOH. Both Z-Lys-13COCHO and Z-Lys-CO13CHO have been synthesized. Using Z-Lys-13COCHO we have observed a signal at 107.4\u00a0ppm by 13C NMR which is assigned to a terahedral adduct formed between the hydroxyl group of the catalytic serine residue and the 13C-enriched keto-carbon of the inhibitor glyoxal group. Z-Lys-CO13CHO has been used to show that in this tetrahedral adduct the glyoxal aldehyde carbon is not hydrated and has a chemical shift of 205.3\u00a0ppm. Hemiketal stabilization is similar for trypsin, chymotrypsin and subtilisin Carlsberg. For trypsin hemiketal formation is optimal at pH 7.2 but decreases at pHs 5.0 and 10.3. The effective molarity of the active site serine hydroxyl group of trypsin is shown to be 25300\u00a0M. At pH 10.3 the free glyoxal inhibitor rapidly (t1/2=0.15\u00a0h) forms a Schiff base while at pH 7 Schiff base formation is much slower (t1/2=23\u00a0h). Subsequently a free enol species is formed which breaks down to form an alcohol product. These reactions are prevented in the presence of trypsin and when the inhibitor is bound to trypsin it undergoes an internal Cannizzaro reaction via a C2 to C1 alkyl shift producing an \u03b1-hydroxycarboxylic acid.",

Cytokine and chemokine levels in the THP-1 culture medium were measured as well as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) concentrations in the Raw 264.7 cell culture medium. PTX3-silenced apoptotic macrophages (THP-1 cell line) were generated to investigate the roles of PTX3 in phagocytosis.In the presence of PTX3, macrophage interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and MCP-1 levels were reduced significantly (\u221239%, P=0.007; \u221221%, P=0.008; and \u221267%, P=0.0003, respectively), whilst activated transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u2212\u03b2) was detected in the THP-1 macrophages (P=0.0004). Additionally, PTX3 induced Akt phosphorylation and reduced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation by 35% (P=0.002), which was induced by TNF-\u03b1 in THP-1 macrophages. Furthermore, silencing of PTX3 in apoptotic cells resulted in increased macrophage binding, elevated expression rate of HLA-DR (+30%, P=0.015) and CD86 (+204%, P=0.004) positive cells, and induction of IL-1\u03b2 (+36%, P=0.024) production. Conversely, adding recombinant PTX3 to macrophages reduced CD86 and HLA-DR expression in a dose-dependent manner.We identified PTX3 as a novel regulator of macrophage activity, and this function suggests that PTX3 acts to resolve inflammation.",

Our group has recently synthesized low molecular weight SOD mimics, demonstrating superior protection against oxidative damages to kidney cells. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the protective effect of the SOD mimic ML1 against high glucose induced cardiomyopathy in diabetes. Mechanistic studies using rat cardiac myoblast H9c2 showed that ML1 markedly inhibited High Glucose (HG) induced cytotoxicity. This was associated with increased Mn-SOD expression along with decreased mitochondrial O 2 \u00b7 - , ONOO- and Ca2+ accumulation, unveiling its anti-oxidant potentials. ML1 also attenuated HG-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and release of cytochrome c, suggesting that ML1 effectuates its cytoprotective action via the preservation of mitochondrial function. In an ex-vivo model normal adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) were isolated and cultured in either normal glucose (5.5\u00a0mmol/l glucose) or HG (25.5\u00a0mmol/l glucose) conditions and the efficiency of ML-1 was analyzed by studying contractile function and calcium indices. Mechanical properties were assessed using a high-speed video-edge detection system, and intracellular Ca2+ transients were recorded in fura-2\u2013loaded myocytes. Pretreatment of myocytes with ML1 (10\u00a0nM) ameliorated HG induced abnormalities in relaxation including depressed peak shortening, prolonged time to 90% relenghthening, and slower Ca2+ transient decay. Thus, ML1 exhibits significant cardio protection against oxidative damage, perhaps through its potent antioxidant action via activation of Mn-SOD.",

These cells also respond to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and phorbol esters with increased steroid biosynthesis. In order to probe the intracellular pathways along with heterologous receptor down-regulation and cellular desensitization, cells were preincubated with EGF or phorbol esters and then challenged with CG, EGF, dibutryl-cyclic AMP, and a phorbol ester. Relative receptor numbers, steroid biosynthesis, and expression of the early response genes, JUNB and c-FOS, were measured. It was found that in all cases but one receptor down-regulation and decreased progesterone production were closely coupled under the conditions used; the exception involved preincubation of the cells with EGF followed by addition of CG where the CG-mediated stimulation of steroidogenesis was considerably lower than the level of receptor down-regulation. In a number of instances JUNB and c-FOS expression paralleled the decreases in receptor number and progesterone production, while in some cases these early response genes were affected little if at all by the changes in receptor number. This finding may indicate that even low levels of activated signaling kinases, e.g. protein kinase A, protein kinase C, or receptor tyrosine kinase, may suffice to yield good expression of JUNB and c-FOS, or it may suggest alternative pathways for regulating expression of these two early response genes.",

In this scenario, we consider mangiferin, as a safe agent in tBHP induced renal cell death and rationalize its action systematically, in normal human kidney epithelial cells (NKE).NKE cells were exposed to 20\u00a0\u00b5M mangiferin for 2\u00a0h followed by 50\u00a0\u00b5M tBHP for 18\u00a0h. The effect on endogenous ROS production, antioxidant status (antioxidant enzymes and thiols), mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptotic signaling molecules, PI3K mediated signaling cascades and cell cycle progression were examined using various biochemical assays, FACS and immunoblot analyses.tBHP exposure damaged the NKE cells and decreased its viability. It also elevated the intracellular ROS and other oxidative stress-related biomarkers within the cells. However, mangiferin dose dependently, exhibited significant protection against this oxidative cellular damage. Mangiferin inhibited tBHP induced activation of different pro-apoptotic signals and thus protected the renal cells against mitochondrial permeabilization. Further, mangiferin enhanced the expression of cell proliferative signaling cascade molecules, Cyclin d1, NF\u03baB and antioxidant molecules HO-1, SOD2, by PI3K/Akt dependent pathway. However, the inhibitor of PI3K abolished mangiferin's protective activity.Results show Mangiferin maintains the intracellular anti-oxidant status, induces the expression of PI3K and its downstream molecules and shields NKE cells against the tBHP induced cytotoxicity.Mangiferin can be indicated as a therapeutic agent in oxidative stress-mediated renal toxicity. This protective action of mangiferin primarily attributes to its potent antioxidant and antiapoptotic nature.",

Among these phenotypes, nitric oxide (NO) production as well as inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), were remarkably different. iNOS expression was higher in the macrophages cultured in DMEM than in F-12 for 20\u00a0h, while no significant differences were shown in NO production between in F-12 and DMEM.

Owing to the scarcity of human neurons, the pathological role of LAMP2 deficiency in neural injury of humans remains largely elusive. However, the application of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may shed light on overcoming such scarcity.In this study, we obtained iPSCs derived from a patient carrying a mutated LAMP2 gene that is associated with Danon disease. By differentiating such LAMP2-deficient iPSCs into cerebral cortical neurons and with the aid of various biochemical assays, we demonstrated that the LAMP2-deficient neurons are more susceptible to mild oxidative stress-induced injury.The data from MTT assay and apoptotic analysis demonstrated that there was no notable difference in cellular viability between the normal and LAMP2-deficient neurons under non-stressed condition. When exposed to mild oxidative stress (10\u00a0\u03bcM H2O2), the LAMP2-deficient neurons exhibited a significant increase in apoptosis. Surprisingly, we did not observe any aberrant accumulation of autophagic materials in the LAMP2-deficient neurons under such stress condition.Our results from cellular fractionation and inhibitor blockade experiments further revealed that oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in the LAMP2-deficient cortical neurons was caused by increased abundance of cytosolic cathepsin L. These results suggest the involvement of lysosomal membrane permeabilization in the LAMP2 deficiency associated neural injury.",

In the present study, WT1 was found to bind to the double strand containing the G-quadruplex-forming sequence of the bcl-2 promoter.

We also found that this change in water permeability by treatment with ceramics occurred in distilled water. The distilled water was determined to exhibit the same aquaporin permeability as the original tap water. Our data indicate that the aquaporin permeability of water can be changed by severe physical shocks, such as slapping and sonication, which is consistent with the implication that the aquaporin permeability is closely related to the structure of the water.

     "abstract": "We examined the effect of Ca2+ on skeletal muscle glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation using L6 cell cultures. Ca2+ stimulation of glucose transport is controversial. We found that caffeine (a Ca2+ secretagogue) stimulation of glucose transport was only evident in a two-part incubation protocol (\u201cpost-incubation\u201d). Caffeine was present in the first incubation, the media removed, and labeled glucose added for the second. Caffeine elicited a rise in Ca2+ in the first incubation that was dissipated by the second. This post-incubation procedure was insensitive to glucose concentrations in the first incubation. With a single, direct incubation system (all components present together) caffeine caused a slight inhibition of glucose transport. This was likely due to caffeine induced inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), since nanomolar concentrations of wortmannin, a selective PI3K inhibitor, also inhibited glucose transport, and previous investigators have also found this action.We did find a Ca2+ stimulation (using either caffeine or ionomycin) of fatty acid oxidation. This was observed in the absence (but not the presence) of added glucose. We conclude that Ca2+ stimulates fatty acid oxidation at a mitochondrial site, secondary to malonyl CoA inhibition (represented by the presence of glucose in our experiments). In summary, the experiments resolve a controversy on Ca2+ stimulation of glucose transport by skeletal muscle, introduce an important experimental consideration for the measurement of glucose transport, and uncover a new site of action for Ca2+ stimulation of fatty acid oxidation.",

Hyperglycemia is a typical response of many aquatic animals to harmful physical and chemical environmental changes. In crustaceans increased circulating crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) and hyperglycemia are reported to occur following exposure to several environmental stress. The biogenic amine, serotonin has been found to modulate the CHH levels and oxidation of serotonin into its metabolites is catalysed by monoamine oxidase. The blue swimmer crab, Portunus pelagicus is a dominant intertidal species utilized throughout the indo-pacific region and is a particularly important species of Palk bay. It has high nutritional value and delicious taste and hence their requirements of capture and cultivation of this species are constantly increasing. This species experiences varying and increasing temperature levels as it resides in an higher intertidal zone of Thondi coast. The present study examines the effect of thermal stress on the levels of serotonin and crustacean hyperglycemic hormone in the hemolymph of P. pelagicus and analyzes the effect of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline on serotonin and CHH level after thermal stress. The results showed increased levels of glucose, CHH and serotonin on exposure to 26\u00a0\u00b0C in control animals. Pargyline injected crabs showed highly significant increase in the levels of CHH and serotonin on every 2\u00a0\u00b0C increase or decrease in temperature.

This could be due to the effect of in maintaining the level of serotonin in the hemolymph and preventing its oxidation, which in turn induces hyperglycemia by releasing CHH into hemolymph.

     "abstract": "Programmed \u20131 translational frameshifting is a process where the translating ribosome shifts the reading frame, which is directed by at least two stimulatory elements in the mRNA\u2014a slippery sequence and a downstream secondary structure. Despite a lot of theoretical and experimental studies, the detailed pathway and mechanism of the \u20131 frameshifting remain unclear. Here, in order to understand the pathway and mechanism we consider two models to study the kinetics of the \u20131 frameshifting, providing quantitative explanations of the recent biochemical data of Caliskan et al. (Cell 2014, 157, 1619\u20131631). One model is modified from that proposed by Caliskan et al. and the other is modified from that proposed in the previous work to explain the single-molecule experimental data. It is shown that by adjusting values of some fundamental parameters both models can give quantitative explanations of the biochemical data of Caliskan et al. on the kinetics of EF-G binding and dissociation and on the kinetics of movement of tRNAs inside the ribosome. However, for the former model some adjusted parameter values deviate significantly from those determined from the available single-molecule experiments, while for the latter model all parameter values are consistent with the available biochemical and single-molecule experimental data. Thus, the latter model most likely reflects the pathway and mechanism of the \u20131 frameshifting.",

Therapeutic efficacy of undifferentiated versus differentiated MSCs was evaluated via assessment of quantitative gene expressions of insulin1, insulin 2, Smad-2, Smad-3, PDX-1, PAX-4, neuroD. Blood glucose and insulin hormone levels were also assessed. Results showed that quantitative gene expressions of all studied genes showed significant decrease in diabetic rat groups. Use of undifferentiated and differentiated MSCs led to a significant elevation of expression levels of all genes with more superior effect with differentiated MSCs except smad-2 gene. As regards insulin hormone levels, use of either undifferentiated or differentiated MSCs led to a significant elevation of its levels with more therapeutic effect with differentiated MSCs. Blood glucose levels were significantly decreased with both undifferentiated and differentiated MSCs in comparison to diabetic groups but its levels were normalized 2 months after injection of differentiated MSCs. In conclusion, use of undifferentiated or differentiated MSCs exhibited significant therapeutic potentials in experimental type I diabetes in rats with more significant therapeutic effect with the use of differentiated MSCs.",

In the present paper we show that two out of three extremophyte plant Eutrema salsugineum proteins EsCSDP1-3, namely EsCSDP1 and EsCSDP3, possess high DNA-melting activity. DNA-melting activity of proteins was evaluated using molecular beacon assay in two ways: by measuring Tm parameter (the temperature at which half of the DNA beacon molecules is fully melted) and the beacon fluorescence at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. As the ratio protein/beacon was increased, a decrease in Tm was observed. Besides DNA-melting activity of full proteins, activity was measured for three isolated cold shock domains EsCSD1-3, C-terminal domain of EsCSDP1 (EsZnF1), as well as a mixture of EsCSD1 and EsZnF1. The Tm reduction efficiency of proteins formed the following sequence: EsCSDP3\u2248EsCSDP1>(EsCSD1+EsZnF1)>EsZnF1>EsCSDP2. Only full proteins EsCSDP3 and EsCSDP1 demonstrated DNA-melting activity at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The presented experimental data indicate that i: interaction of EsCSDP1-3 with beacon single-stranded region is obligatory for efficient melting; ii: cold shock domain and C-terminal domain with zinc finger motifs should be present in one protein molecule to have high melting activity.",

CNCs have a needle-like structure with sizes in the range of 100\u2013200\u00a0nm long and 5\u201320\u00a0nm wide and a mean aspect ratio 10\u2013100. Despite the great potential applicability of CNCs, very little is known about their potential immunogenicity. Needle-like materials have been known to evoke an immune response in particular to activate the (NOD- l ike r eceptor, p yrin domain-containing 3)-inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 (Interleukin 1\u03b2) pathway. In this study we evaluated the capacity of unmodified CNC and its cationic derivatives CNC-AEM (aminoethylmethacrylate)1, CNC-AEM2, CNC-AEMA(aminoethylmethacrylamide)1 and CNC-AEMA2 to stimulate NLRP3-inflammasome/IL-1\u03b2 pathway and enhance the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mouse macrophage cell line (J774A.1) was stimulated for 24\u00a0h with 50\u00a0\u00b5g/mL with unmodified CNC and its cationic derivatives. Alternatively, J774A1 or PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were stimulated with CNC-AEMA2 in presence or absence of LPS (lipopolysaccharide). IL-1\u03b2 secretion was analyzed by ELISA, mitochondrial function by JC-1 staining and ATP content. Intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by DCF-DA (2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) and MitoSOX, respectively. Mitochondrial ROS and extracellular ATP were significantly increased in cells treated with CNC-AEMA2, which correlates with the strongest effects on IL-1\u03b2 secretion in non-primed cells. CNC-AEMA2 also induced IL-1\u03b2secretion in LPS-primed and non-primed PBMCs. Our data suggest that the increases in mitochondrial ROS and ATP release induced by CNC-AEMA2 may be associated with its capability to evoke immune response. We demonstrate the first evidence that newly synthesized cationic cellulose nanocrystal derivative, CNC-AEMA2, has immunogenic properties, which may lead to the development of a potential non-toxic and safe nanomaterial to be used as a novel adjuvant for vaccines.",

This differential affinity has been proposed to reflect the different physiological environments in which these two members of the SCO protein family reside. In this study the affinity of mitochondrial SCO1 from yeast is compared directly to that of BsSCO in vitro. We find that the yeast SCO1 protein has similar preference for Cu(II) over Cu(I), as does BsSCO.

In the holoenzyme, CK2\u03b2 is a substrate-dependent modulator of kinase activity. Therefore, a comprehensive characterization of CK2 cellular function should firstly address which substrates are phosphorylated exclusively when CK2\u03b2 is present (class-III or beta-dependent substrates). However, current experimental constrains limit this classification to a few substrates. Here, we took advantage of motif-based prediction and designed four linear patterns for predicting class-III behavior in sets of experimentally determined CK2 substrates. Integrating high-throughput substrate prediction, functional classification and network analysis, our results suggest that beta-dependent phosphorylation might exert particular regulatory roles in viral infection and biological processes/pathways like apoptosis, DNA repair and RNA metabolism. It also pointed, that human beta-dependent substrates are mainly nuclear, a few of them shuttling between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.",

These insect stage parasites were resistant to conA killing, with a median lethal dose at least 50-fold greater than the parental line. Fluorescence-based experiments revealed that the resistant cells bound less lectin when compared to the parental line. Western blotting and mass spectrometry confirmed that the resistant line lacked an N-glycan required for conA binding on the cellular receptors, EP procyclin proteins. The failure to N-glycosylate the EP procyclins was not the consequence of altered N-glycan precursor biosynthesis, as another glycosylated protein (Fla1p) was normally modified.

Here we investigated the incorporation of selenium into GPXH and its causal relationship with the upregulation of the enzymatic activity. GPXH was purified from algal cells grown with selenium and proteolytically digested into four fragments. Selenium content analysis for these proteolytic fragments confirmed that GPXH-incorporated selenium is predominantly enriched in a fragment that carries the putative catalytic residue Cys-38. We next constructed three kinds of engineered GPXH proteins by substituting Ser for one of three Cys residues in native GPXH, Cys-38, -66, and -84, using a bacterial overexpression system, resulting in Cys38Ser, Cys66Ser, and Cys84Ser derivatives, respectively. Of these, the Cys66Ser and Cys84Ser derivatives exhibited the same level of selenium-dependent GPX activity as the normal recombinant GPXH, whereas the Cys38Ser mutant GPXH not only lost its activity completely but also demonstrated severely impaired incorporation of selenium. These findings strongly suggest that selenium is post-translationally assimilated into the Cys-38 of the GPXH protein, thereby enhancing its enzymatic activity.",

The role of the native PCMT in cell survival and protein repair was investigated by manipulating intracellular PCMT levels with Oxidized Adenosine (AdOx) and Lithium Chloride (LiCl). Proteomic Identification of possible cellular targets was carried out using 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by on-Blot methylation and mass spectrometric analysis.The 25.4\u00a0kDa native PCMT from C. utilis was found to have a Km of 3.5\u00a0\u00b5M for AdoMet and 33.36\u00a0\u00b5M for IsoAsp containing Delta Sleep Inducing Peptide (DSIP) at pH 7.0. Native PCMT comprises of 232 amino acids which is coded by a 698\u00a0bp long nucleotide sequence. Phylogenetic comparison revealed the PCMT to be related more closely with the prokaryotic homologs. Increase in PCMT levels in vivo correlated with increased cell survival under physiological stresses. PCMT expression was seen to be linked with increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration. Proteomic identification of possible cellular substrates revealed that PCMT interacts with proteins mainly involved with cellular housekeeping.

     "abstract": "The A-type and B-type lamins form a filamentous meshwork underneath the inner nuclear membrane called the nuclear lamina, which is an important component of nuclear architecture in metazoan cells. The lamina interacts with large, mostly repressive chromatin domains at the nuclear periphery. In addition, genome\u2013lamina interactions also involve dynamic association of lamin A/C with gene promoters in adipocytes. Mutations in the human lamin A gene cause a spectrum of hereditary diseases called the laminopathies which affect muscle, cardiac and adipose tissues. Since most mutations in lamin A/C affect skeletal muscle, we investigated lamin\u2013chromatin interactions at promoters of muscle specific genes in both muscle and non-muscle cell lines by ChIP-qPCR. We observed that lamin A/C was specifically associated with promoter regions of muscle genes in myoblasts but not in fibroblasts. Lamin A/C dissociated from the promoter regions of the differentiation specific MyoD, myogenin and muscle creatine kinase genes when myoblasts were induced to differentiate. In the promoter regions of the myogenin and MyoD genes, the binding of lamin A/C in myoblasts inversely correlated with the active histone mark, H3K4me3. Lamin A/C binding on muscle genes was reduced and differentiation potential was enhanced on treatment of myoblasts with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These findings suggest a role for lamina\u2013chromatin interactions in muscle differentiation and have important implications for the pathological mechanisms of striated muscle associated laminopathies.",

     "abstract": "Growing axons are directed by an extracellular electric field in a process known as galvanotropism. The electric field is a predominant guidance cue directing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to the future optic disc during embryonic development. Specifically, the axons of newborn RGCs grow along the extracellular voltage gradient that exists endogenously in the embryonic retina (Yamashita, 2013 [8]). To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying galvanotropic behaviour, the quantification of the electric effect on axon orientation must be examined. In the present study, a culture system was built to apply a constant, uniform direct current (DC) electric field by supplying an electrical current to the culture medium, and this system also continuously recorded the voltage difference between the two points in the medium. A negative feedback circuit was designed to regulate the supplied current to maintain the voltage difference at the desired value. A chick embryo retinal strip was placed between the two points and cultured for 24\u00a0h in an electric field in the opposite direction to the endogenous field, and growing axons were fluorescently labelled for live cell imaging (calcein-AM). The strength of the exogenous field varied from 0.0005\u00a0mV/mm to 10.0\u00a0mV/mm. The results showed that RGC axons grew in the reverse direction towards the cathode at voltage gradients of \u22650.0005\u00a0mV/mm, and straightforward extensions were found in fields of \u22650.2\u20130.5\u00a0mV/mm, which were far weaker than the endogenous voltage gradient (15\u00a0mV/mm). These findings suggest that the endogenous electric field is sufficient to guide RGC axons in vivo.",

The enzyme activity and properties of a highly thermostable AHAS from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima is being reported. The catalytic and regulatory subunits of AHAS from T. maritima were over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant subunits were purified using a simplified procedure including a heat-treatment step followed by chromatography. A discontinuous colorimetric assay method was optimized and used to determine the kinetic parameters. AHAS activity was determined to be present in several Thermotogales including T. maritima. The catalytic subunit of T. maritima AHAS was purified approximately 30-fold, with an AHAS activity of approximately 160\u00b127\u00a0U/mg and native molecular mass of 156\u00b16\u00a0kDa. The regulatory subunit was purified to homogeneity and showed no catalytic activity as expected. The optimum pH and temperature for AHAS activity were 7.0 and 85\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. The apparent Km and Vmax for pyruvate were 16.4\u00b12\u00a0mM and 246\u00b17\u00a0U/mg, respectively. Reconstitution of the catalytic and regulatory subunits led to increased AHAS activity. This is the first report on characterization of an isoleucine, leucine, and valine operon (ilv operon) enzyme from a hyperthermophilic microorganism and may contribute to our understanding of the physiological pathways in Thermotogales.

Elevated glucose leads to extracellular matrix collagen glycation, which delays endothelial capillary-like tube formation in vitro. Glucose also increases endothelial cell fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) release and extracellular matrix storage, which should increase tube formation. In this study, we determined if FGF-2 could restore plasminogen system activity and angiogenic function in endothelial cells on glycated collagen. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on native or glycated collagen substrates were stimulated with FGF-2. Plasminogen system activity, cell migration, and capillary-like tube formation were measured, along with plasminogen system protein and mRNA levels. Glycated collagen decreased endothelial cell plasminogen system activity, cell migration, and tube length. FGF-2 did not restore plasminogen system activity or tube formation in cells on glycated collagen, despite decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) protein level. We now show that PAI-1 binds to glycated collagen, which may localize PAI-1 to the extracellular matrix.

     "abstract": "The aim of the work was to evaluate whether or not there is glycolytic reprogramming in the neighboring cells of colorectal cancer (CRC). Using postoperative material we have compared the functional capacity of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in CRC cells, their glycolytic activity and their inclination to aerobic glycolysis, with those of the surrounding and healthy colon tissue cells. Experiments showed that human CRC cannot be considered a hypoxic tumor, since the malignancy itself and cells surrounding it exhibited even higher rates of OXPHOS than healthy large intestine. The absence of acute hypoxia in colorectal carcinomas was also confirmed by their practically equal glucose-phosphorylating capacity as compared with surrounding non-tumorous tissue and by upregulation of VEGF family and their ligands. Studies indicated that human CRC cells in vivo exert a strong distant effect on the energy metabolism of neighboring cells, so that they acquire the bioenergetic parameters specific to the tumor itself. The growth of colorectal carcinomas was associated with potent downregulation of the creatine kinase system. As compared with healthy colon tissue, the tumor surrounding cells display upregulation of OXPHOS and have high values of basal and ADP activated respiration rates. Strong differences between the normal and CRC cells in the affinity of their mitochondria for ADP were revealed; the corresponding Km values were measured as 93.6\u00b17.7\u00a0\u00b5M for CRC cells and 84.9\u00b19.9\u00a0\u00b5M for nearby tissue; both these apparent Km (ADP) values were considerably (by almost 3 times) lower in comparison with healthy colon tissue cells (256\u00b134\u00a0\u00b5M).",

However, it has long been reported that atomic masses can also be increased to improve configurational sampling because higher atomic masses permit the use of a longer time step. It is worth investigating whether standard-mass NTP MD simulations at \u0394t=2.00 or 3.16\u00a0fssmt can offer better or comparable configurational sampling than low-mass NTP MD simulations at \u0394t=1.00\u00a0fssmt. This article reports folding simulations of two \u03b2-hairpins showing that the configurational sampling efficiency of NTP MD simulations using atomic masses uniformly reduced by tenfold at \u0394t=1.00\u00a0fssmt is statistically equivalent to and better than those using standard masses at \u0394t=3.16 and 2.00\u00a0fssmt, respectively.

We report here the binding and structural studies of MbRIP1 with a pyrimidine base, cytosine; cytosine containing nucleoside, cytidine; and cytosine containing nucleotide, cytidine diphosphate. All three compounds bound to MbRIP1 at the active site with dissociation constants of 10\u22124\u00a0M\u201310\u22127\u00a0M. As reported earlier, in the structure of native MbRIP1, there are 10 water molecules in the substrate binding site. Upon binding of cytosine to MbRIP1, four water molecules were dislodged from the substrate binding site while five water molecules were dislodged when cytidine bound to MbRIP1. Seven water molecules were dislocated when cytidine diphosphate bound to MbRIP1. This showed that cytidine diphosphate occupied a larger space in the substrate binding site enhancing the buried surface area thus making it a relatively better inhibitor of MbRIP1 as compared to cytosine and cytidine. The key residues involved in the recognition of cytosine, cytidine and cytidine diphosphate were Ile71, Glu85, Tyr111 and Arg163. The orientation of cytosine in the cleft is different from that of adenine or guanine indicating a notable difference in the modes of binding of purine and pyrimidine bases. Since adenine containing nucleosides/nucleotides are suitable substrates, the cytosine containing nucleosides/nucleotides may act as inhibitors.",

We previously demonstrated that deletion of Bax or caspase 3 from these cells reduces ROS/RS production to near baseline levels indicating a central role for both Bax and caspase 3 in generating the ROS/RS. Here we depleted cytochrome c to a similar level in neurons from wild type and bax hemizygous or knockout mice by NGF withdrawal or treatment with H2O2.

Here, we demonstrate the prominent expression of the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channel, a Ca2+-permeable channel that is known to act as a sensor for hypo-osmotic and mechanical stresses, in the basal cells of the mouse nasal epithelium. TRPV4 mRNA was expressed in the basal portions of the prenatal mouse nasal epithelium, and this expression continued into adult mice. The TRPV4 protein was also detected in the basal layers of the nasal epithelium in wild-type but not in TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4-KO) mice. The TRPV4-positive immunoreactions largely overlapped with those of keratin 14 (K14), a marker of basal cells, in the airway epithelium, and they partially overlapped with those of K14 in the olfactory epithelium. Ca2+ imaging analysis revealed that hypo-osmotic stimulation and 4\u03b1-phorbol 12,13 didecanoate (4\u03b1-PDD), both of which are TRPV4 agonists, caused an increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in a subset of primary epithelial cells cultured from the upper parts of the nasal epithelium of the wild-type mice. This response was barely noticeable in cells from similar parts of the epithelium in TRPV4-KO mice. Finally, there was no significant difference in BrdU-labeled proliferation between the olfactory epithelia of wild-type and TRPV4-KO mice under normal conditions. Thus, TRPV4 channels are functionally expressed in basal cells throughout the nasal epithelium and may act as sensors for the development and injury-induced regeneration of basal stem cells.",

In this study, we analyzed gene expression profiles by DNA microarray and protein distribution patterns using an immunofluorescence method to clarify the process of EM-accelerated wrinkle repair in UVB-irradiated hairless mouse skin. In the microarray analysis, we detected EM-induced up-regulation of various extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes in the UVB-irradiated skin. In the immunofluorescence, we confirmed that type I collagen \u03b11 chain, fibrillin 1, elastin and dystroglycan 1 in the skin decreased after repeated UVB irradiation but staining for these proteins was improved by EM treatment. In addition, ADAMTS2 and MMP-14 also increased in the EM-treated skin. Although the relationship between these molecules and wrinkle formation is not clear yet, our present data suggest that the molecules are involved in the repair of UVB-induced wrinkles.",

     "abstract": "Aquaporin-8 (AQP8), a member of the aquaporin water channel family, is expressed in various tissue and cells, including liver, testis, and pancreas. AQP8 appears to have functions on the plasma membrane and/or on the mitochondrial inner membrane. Mitochondrial AQP8 with permeability for water, H2O2 and NH3 has been expected to have important role in various cells, but its information is limited to a few tissues and cells including liver and kidney. In the present study, we found that AQP8 was expressed in the mitochondria in mouse adipose tissues and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, and investigated its role by suppressing its gene expression.AQP8-knocked down (shAQP8) cells were established using a vector expressing short hairpin RNA. Cellular localization of AQP8 was examined by western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption and ATP level measurements.In 3T3-L1 cells, AQP8 was expressed in the mitochondria. In shAQP8 cells, mRNA and protein levels of AQP8 were decreased by about 75%. The shAQP8 showed reduced activities of complex IV and ATP synthase; it is probable that the impaired mitochondrial water handling in shAQP8 caused suppression of the electron transport and ADP phosphorylation through inhibition of the two steps which yield water. The reduced activities of the last two steps of oxidative phosphorylation in shAQP8 cause low routine and maximum capacity of respiration and mitochondrial hyperpolarization.Mitochondrial AQP8 contributes to mitochondrial respiratory function probably through maintenance of water homeostasis.The AQP8-knocked down cells we established provides a model system for the studies on the relationships between water homeostasis and mitochondrial function.",

Tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and PHOSPHO1 are indispensable for bone and cartilage mineralization but their functional relationship in the mineralization process remains unclear. In this study, we have used osteoblast and ex-vivo metatarsal cultures to obtain biochemical evidence for co-operativity and cross-talk between PHOSPHO1 and TNAP in the initiation of mineralization. Clones 14 and 24 of the MC3T3-E1 cell line were used in the initial studies. Clone 14 cells expressed high levels of PHOSPHO1 and low levels of TNAP and in the presence of \u03b2-glycerol phosphate (\u03b2GP) or phosphocholine (P-Cho) as substrates and they mineralized their matrix strongly. In contrast clone 24 cells expressed high levels of TNAP and low levels of PHOSPHO1 and mineralized their matrix poorly. Lentiviral Phospho1 overexpression in clone 24 cells resulted in higher PHOSPHO1 and TNAP protein expression and increased levels of matrix mineralization. To uncouple the roles of PHOSPHO1 and TNAP in promoting matrix mineralization we used PHOSPHO1 (MLS-0263839) and TNAP (MLS-0038949) specific inhibitors, which individually reduced mineralization levels of Phospho1 overexpressing C24 cells, whereas the simultaneous addition of both inhibitors essentially abolished matrix mineralization (85%; P<0.001). Using metatarsals from E15 mice as a physiological ex vivo model of mineralization, the response to both TNAP and PHOSPHO1 inhibitors appeared to be substrate dependent. Nevertheless, in the presence of \u03b2GP, mineralization was reduced by the TNAP inhibitor alone and almost completely eliminated by the co-incubation of both inhibitors. These data suggest critical non-redundant roles for PHOSPHO1 and TNAP during the initiation of osteoblast and chondrocyte mineralization.",

However, it is often associated with neurological side effects, including chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment (CACI), such as \u201cchemobrain\u201d. Previously, we reported that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is involved in Px-induced neurotoxicity, and immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP) inducer X (BIX) alleviates Px-induced neurotoxicity. However, BIX has not been used in clinical practice yet. We recently reported that fluvoxamine (Flv) alleviates ER stress via induction of sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Flv could alleviate Px-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. SK-N-SH cells were pre-treated for 12\u00a0h with or without 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Flv followed by treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcM Px with or without co-existence of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Flv for 24\u00a0h. To investigate the involvement of Sig-1R in alleviation effect on Px-induced neurotoxicity,1\u00a0\u03bcM NE100, an antagonist of Sig-1R, was added for 24\u00a0h. Neurotoxicity was assessed using the MTS viability assay and ER stress-mediated neurotoxicity was assessed by evaluating the expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), cleaved caspase 4, and cleaved caspase 3.Pre-treatment with Flv significantly alleviated the induction of CHOP, cleaved caspase 4, and cleaved caspase 3 in SK-N-SH cells. At the same time, pre-treatment with Flv significantly induced Sig-1R in SK-N-SH cells. In addition, viability was significantly higher in Flv-treated cells than in untreated cells, which was reversed by treatment with NE100.Our results suggest that Flv alleviates Px-induced neurotoxicity in part through the induction of Sig-1R. Our findings should contribute to one of the novel approaches for the alleviation of Px-induced neurotoxicity, including chemobrain.",

     "abstract": "Trehalase specifically hydrolyses trehalose into two glucose units and is most important in insects and fungi. Previous evidence suggested that Spodoptera frugiperda midgut trehalase (wild type, WT) has substantial conformational changes on binding different substances. Our goal is to understand this mobility. For this, two deletion mutants were produced, lacking regions supposed to be the cause of mobility [(102 residues from the N-terminus (NT) and this portion plus 31 residues from the C-terminus (NCT)]. Circular dichroism spectra before and after denaturation of the enzymes support the assertion that they are appropriately folded. The overall results show that the removal of 102 or 133 amino acids does not greatly change the interaction with the substrate and competitive inhibitors, but leads to a considerable decrease in kcat/Km values from WT 74,500\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 to NT 647\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 and NCT 1,044\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121. Diethyl pyrocarbonate His modification only occurs in wild and truncated trehalases in the presence of some ligands. Looking for changes in folding WT, NT, and NCT were incubated with different compounds in the presence of Sypro Orange, that binds to hydrophobic regions increasing its fluorescence. The dye fluorescence is affected by 2 compounds when WT is present, and at least by 5 compounds when NT or NCT are present, suggesting that conformational changes caused by ligand binding occur only in the vicinity of the active site. These data provide physical evidence in favor of a change in folding around the active site caused by ligand binding, in agreement to prior chemical modification and other kinetic data and challenging the hypothesis that N- and C-terminal are the mobile regions.",

Recent studies have found lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (l-PGDS) to be an emerging target involved in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes. This study focused on the effect of l-PGDS on glucagon secretion from cultured pancreatic Alpha TC-1 Clone 6 cells. When cells were treated with various concentrations of l-PGDS (0, 10, 50, and 100\u00a0ug/ml) for 2\u00a0h in 1\u00a0mM glucose; glucagon secretion decreased to 670\u00b145, 838\u00b138, 479\u00b111, and 437\u00b145\u00a0pg/ml, respectively. In addition, pancreatic islets were isolated from C57BL/6 mice and stained for prostaglandin D2 receptors, DP1 and DP2, using immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that these islets express only the DP1 receptor. Pancreatic islets were then stained for alpha and beta cells, as well as DP1, to find the primary location of the receptor within the islets using immunofluorescence. Interestingly, DP1 receptor density was found primarily in alpha cells rather than in beta cells. Our study is the first to report a correlation between l-PGDS and glucagon secretion in alpha cells. Based on our obtained results, it can be concluded that higher concentrations of l-PGDS significantly reduced the secretion of glucagon in alpha cells, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes as well as offer a novel therapeutic site for the treatment of diabetes.",

     "abstract": "The Gompertz law of mortality quantitatively describes the mortality rate of humans and almost all multicellular animals. However, its underlying kinetic mechanism is unclear. The Gompertz law cannot explain the mortality plateau at advanced ages and cannot give an explicit relationship between temperature and mortality. In this study a reaction kinetics model with a time dependent rate coefficient is proposed to describe the survival and senescence processes. A temperature-dependent mortality function was derived. The new mortality function becomes the Gompertz mortality function with the same relationship of parameters prescribed by the Strehler\u2013Mildvan correlation when age is smaller than a characteristic value \u03b4, and reaches the mortality plateau when age is greater than \u03b4. A closed-form analytical expression for describing the relationship of average lifespan with temperature and other equations are derived from the new mortality function. The derived equations can be used to estimate the limit of average lifespan, predict the maximal longevity, calculate the temperature coefficient of lifespan, and explain the tendency of the survival curve. This prediction is consistent with the most recently reported mortality trajectories for single-year birth cohorts. This study suggests that the senescence process results from the imbalance between damaging energy and protecting energy for the critical chemical substance in the body. The rate of senescence of the organism increases while the protecting energy decreases. The mortality plateau is reached when the protecting energy decreases to its minimal levels. The decreasing rate of the protecting energy is temperature-dependent. This study is exploring the connection between the biochemical mechanism and demography.",

We studied the regulation of NEU2 activity by siastatin B in vitro and predicted the interaction in silico. Inhibitory and stabilizing effects of siastatin B were analyzed in comparison with DANA (2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid) toward 4-umbelliferyl N-acetylneuraminic acid (4-MU-NANA)- and \u03b12,3-sialyllactose-degrading activities of recombinant NEU2 produced by E. coli GST-fusion gene expression. Siastatin B exhibited to have higher competitive inhibitory activity toward NEU2 than DANA at pH 4.0. We also revealed the stabilizing effect of siastatin B toward NEU2 activity at acidic pH. Docking model was constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of NEU2/DANA complex (PDB code: 1VCU). Molecular docking predicted that electrostatic neutralization of E111 and E218 residues of the active pocket should not prevent siastatin B from binding at pH 4.0. The imino group (1NH) of siastatin B can also interact with D46, neutralized at pH 4.0. Siastatin B was suggested to have higher affinity to the active pocket of NEU2 than DANA, although it has no C7\u20139 fragment corresponding to that of DANA. We demonstrated here the pH-dependent affinity of siastatin B toward NEU2 to exhibit potent inhibitory and stabilizing activities. Molecular interaction between siastatin B and NEU2 will be utilized to develop specific inhibitors and stabilizers (chemical chaperones) not only for NEU2 but also the other human sialidases, including NEU1, NEU3 and NEU4, based on homology modeling.",

The flagellum is important for the viability of trypanosomes like Leishmania. However, very little is known about dynein and its role in flagellar motility in such trypanosomatid species. Here, we have identified genes in five species of Leishmania that code for outer-arm dynein (OAD) heavy chains \u03b1 and \u03b2, and inner-arm dynein (IAD) heavy chains 1\u03b1 and 1\u03b2 using BLAST and MSA. Our sequence analysis indicates that unlike the three-headed outer-arm dyneins of Chlamydomonas and Tetrahymena, the outer-arm dyneins of the genus Leishmania are two-headed, lacking the \u03b3 chain like that of metazoans. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed a conserved IQ-like calmodulin binding motif in the outer-arm \u03b1 and inner-arm 1\u03b1 dynein heavy chain in the five species of Leishmania similar to Chlamydomonas reinhardtii outer-arm \u03b3. It was predicted that both motifs were incapable of binding calmodulin. Phosphorylation site prediction revealed conserved serine and threonine residues in outer-arm dynein \u03b1 and inner-arm 1\u03b1 as putative phosphorylation sites exclusive to Leishmania but not in Trypanosoma brucei suggesting that regulation of dynein activity might be via phosphorylation of these IQ-like motifs in Leishmania sp.",

Slick and Slack channels are widely distributed in the mammalian CNS and they play a role in slow afterhyperpolarization, generation of depolarizing afterpotentials and in setting and stabilizing the resting potential. In the present study we used a combined approach of (co)-immunoprecipitation studies, Western blot analysis, double immunofluorescence and mass spectrometric sequencing in order to investigate protein\u2013protein interactions of the Slick and Slack channels. The data strongly suggest that Slick and Slack channels co-assemble into identical cellular complexes. Double immunofluorescence experiments revealed that Slick and Slack channels co-localize in distinct mouse brain regions. Moreover, we identified the small cytoplasmic protein beta-synuclein and the transmembrane protein 263 (TMEM 263) as novel interaction partners of both, native Slick and Slack channels. In addition, the inactive dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP 10) and the synapse associated protein 102 (SAP 102) were identified as constituents of the native Slick and Slack channel complexes in the mouse brain.

In this study, the FAD binding region in Myxococcus xanthus PPOX was analysed by engineering and characterising a selection of mutant proteins. Amino acid residues which interact with FAD via their side chains were selected for study. Mutants were characterised and compared with wild type protein. Characterisation included FAD quantitation, analysis of FAD spectra and kinetic assay. Results revealed that Serine 20 mutants could still bind FAD, but polarity in this position is favourable, yet not essential for the integrity of FAD binding. Study of Glutamate 39 mutants suggest that a negative charge at position 39 is clearly favoured for interaction with the ribose ring of FAD, as all non-conservative replacements could not bind sufficient FAD. Asparagine 441 appears not to be directly involved in FAD binding but rather in stabilizing the FAD, and polarity in this position appears important. Tryptophan 408 may play a role in orientating or stabilizing the bound substrate during catalysis, and a non-polar (or slightly polar) residue is favoured at this position; however, aromaticity in this position appears not to be critical.

The main objective of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial activity found in the venom of the spider, with emphasis on the toxin VdTX-I.Antimicrobial assays were performed in 96 well plates culture against 14 micro-organisms (fungi, yeasts and bacteria), which were tested concentrations from 0.19 to 100\u00a0\u03bcM of VdTX-I. After qualitative analysis, dose-response curve assays were performed in bacterial kill curve using MTT reagent and hemolytic assay.The antimicrobial activity of the VdTX-I toxin was observed in 12 tested species of Candida, Trichosporiun, Staphylococcus and Micrococcus. The toxicity had a dose-response at 3.12\u00a0\u00b5M \u2013 100\u00a0\u03bcM in Candida albicans, Candida guillermondii, Micrococcus luteus and Escherichia coli.

We show that non-inactivated, purified rabies virus unfolds cooperatively in two events centered at approximately 62 and 73\u00a0\u00b0C. Beta-propiolactone (BPL) treatment does not alter significantly viral unfolding behavior, indicating that viral inactivation does not alter protein structure significantly. The first unfolding event was absent in bromelain treated samples, causing an elimination of the G-protein ectodomain, suggesting that this event corresponds to G-protein unfolding. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that this first event was shifted to higher temperatures in the presence of three monoclonal, G-protein specific antibodies. We show that dithiothreitol treatment of the virus abolishes the first unfolding event, indicating that the reduction of G-protein disulfide bonds causes dramatic alterations to protein structure. Inactivated virus samples heated up to 70\u00a0\u00b0C also showed abolished recognition of conformational G-protein specific antibodies by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis. The sharpness of unfolding transitions and the low standard deviations of the Tm values as derived from multiple analysis offers the possibility of using this analytical tool for efficient monitoring of the vaccine production process and lot to lot consistency.",

     "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder that is currently incurable. SMA is caused by decreased levels of the survival motor neuron protein (SMN), as a result of loss or mutation of SMN1. Although the SMN1 homolog SMN2 also produces some SMN protein, it does not fully compensate for the loss or dysfunction of SMN1. Salbutamol, a \u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonist and well-known bronchodilator used in asthma patients, has recently been shown to ameliorate symptoms in SMA patients. However, the precise mechanism of salbutamol action is unclear. We treated SMA fibroblast cells lacking SMN1 and HeLa cells with salbutamol and analyzed SMN2 mRNA and SMN protein levels in SMA fibroblasts, and changes in SMN protein ubiquitination in HeLa cells. Salbutamol increased SMN protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in SMA fibroblast cells lacking SMN1, though no significant changes in SMN2 mRNA levels were observed. Notably, the salbutamol-induced increase in SMN was blocked by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor and deubiquitinase inhibitor, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation assay using HeLa cells showed that ubiquitinated SMN levels decreased in the presence of salbutamol, suggesting that salbutamol inhibited ubiquitination. The results of this study suggest that salbutamol may increase SMN protein levels in SMA by inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated SMN degradation via activating \u03b22-adrenergic receptor-PKA pathways.",

We have previously synthesized a series of novel curcumin derivatives. In this study, we investigated the effects of our curcumin derivatives on A\u03b2 aggregation and the cell toxicities of A\u03b2 aggregates. According to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) profiles, 14 of 41 compounds showed a significant increase in the densities of the bands of A\u03b2 (1\u201342) by incubation during the aggregation process relative to those of A\u03b2 (1\u201342) prepared in the presence of the vehicle control.

This time, we used Multi Plex to measure the production of cytokines and chemokines following tetracycline treatment of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced THP-1 cells. The signaling pathways were investigated with Western blotting analysis. Three tetracyclines significantly suppressed the expression of cytokines and chemokines induced by LPS. Minocycline (50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), tigecycline (50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), or doxycycline (50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) were added after treatment with LPS (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was downregulated to 16%, 14%, and 8%, respectively, after 60\u00a0min compared to treatment with LPS without agents. Interleukin-8 was downregulated to 43%, 32%, and 26% at 60\u00a0min. Macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 was downregulated to 23%, 33%, and 16% at 120\u00a0min. MIP-1\u03b2 was downregulated to 21%, 11%, and 2% at 120\u00a0min. Concerning about signaling pathways, the mechanisms of the three tetracyclines might not be the same. Although the three tetracyclines showed some differences in the time course, tetracyclines modulated phosphorylation of the NF-\u03baB pathway, p38 and ERK1/2/MAPK pathways, resulting in inhibition of cytokine and chemokine production. In addition, SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) and U0126 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) significantly suppressed the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells. And further, the NF-\u03baB inhibitor, BAY11-7082, almost completely suppressed LPS-induced these two cytokines production. Thus, more than one signaling pathway may be involved in tetracyclines downregulation of the expression of LPS-induced cytokines and chemokines in THP-1 cells. And among the three signaling pathways, NF-\u03baB pathway might be the dominant pathway on tetracyclines modification the LPS-induced cytokines production in THP-1 cells. In general, minocycline and doxycycline suppressed the production of cytokines and chemokines in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell lines via mainly the inhibition of phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB pathways.

It was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, Sephacryl S-300 and CM-cellulose columns. Gel filtration and SDS-PAGE of the purified TLCAT indicated that the protein has a native molecular weight of 120\u00a0kDa and is most likely a homodimer with a subunit of approximately 60\u00a0kDa. The Km value of TLCAT is 12\u00a0mM H2O2 and displayed its optimum activity at pH 7.2. CaCl2, MgCl2, MnCl2 and NiCl2 increased the activity of TLCAT, while FeCl2, CoCl2, CuCl2 and ZnCl2 inhibited the activity of TLCAT. Sodium azide inhibited TLCAT competitively with a Ki value of 0.28\u00a0mM. The presence of TLCAT in cells may play a role in protecting H. dromedarii ticks against oxidative damage. This finding will contribute to our understanding of the physiology of these ectoparasites and the development of untraditional methods to control them.",

     "abstract": "Polyphenols in tea are considered beneficial to human health. However, many such claims of their bioactivity still require in vitro and in vivo evidence.Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model multicellular organism, we assess the fat accumulation-suppressing effects of theaflavin (TF), a tea polyphenol; epitheaflagallin (ETG), which has an unknown function; and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), a prominent component of green tea. Dietary TF reduced the malondialdehyde accumulation related to a high-fat diet in adult flies. Other physiological and genetic responses induced by the high-fat diet, such as lipid accumulation in the fat body and expression of lipid metabolism-related genes, were ameliorated by the addition of TF, ETG, and EGCg, in some cases approaching respective levels without high-fat diet exposure. Continuous ingestion of the three polyphenols resulted in a shortened lifespan.We provide evidence in Drosophila that tea polyphenols have a fat accumulation-suppressing effect that has received recent attention. We also suggest that tea polyphenols can provide different desirable biological activities depending on their composition and the presence or absence of other chemical components.",

     "abstract": "Scaling protein production seems like a simple perturbation of transcriptional control. However, when embryonic tendon fibroblasts have to produce >50% procollagen and secrete it from the cell 4 times faster than the average protein, this taxes the cellular machinery and requires a fresh look at how the pathway is controlled. Ascorbate, a reducing agent, can stimulate procollagen production 6-fold. Procollagen mRNA levels goes up 6-fold but requires 3 days for the cell to accomplish this task. Secretion rates, the last cellular step in the process, also goes up 6-fold but this occurs in <1\u00a0h. What regulatory scheme is consistent with these properties?This review focuses on fibroblasts that make high levels of procollagen (type I) and how they regulate the collagen pathway. Data from many different labs are relevant to this problem but it is hard to see the bigger picture from a large number of small studies. This review aims to consolidate this data into a coherent model and this requires solutions to some controversies and postulating potential mechanisms where the details are still missing.In high collagen producing cells, the pathway is controlled by post-transcriptional regulation. This requires feedback control between secretion and translation rates that is based on the helical structure of the procollagen molecule and additional tissue-specific modifications.Transcriptional control does not scale well to high protein production with rapid regulation. New paradigms lead to better understanding of collagen diseases and tendon morphogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Efforts in experimental therapeutics of atherosclerosis are mostly focused on identifying candidate targets that can be exploited in developing new strategies to reduce plaque progression, induce its regression and/or improve stability of advanced lesions. Plaque macrophages are central players in all these processes, and consequently a significant amount of research is devoted to understanding mechanisms that regulate, for instance, macrophage apoptosis, necrosis or migration. Macrophage diversity is a key feature of the macrophage population in the plaque and can impact many aspects of lesion development. Thus, searching for molecular entities that contribute to atherorelevant functions of a specific macrophage type but not others may lead to identification of targets that can be exploited in phenotype selective modulation of the lesional macrophage. This however, remains an unmet goal. In recent years several studies have revealed critical functions of micro-RNAs (miRs) in mechanisms of macrophage polarization, and a number of miRs have emerged as being specific of distinctive macrophage subsets. Not only can these miRs represent the first step towards recognition of phenotype specific targets, but they may also pave the way to reveal novel atherorelevant pathways within macrophage subsets. This article discusses some of these recent findings, speculates on their potential relevance to atherosclerosis and elaborates on the prospective use of miRs to affect the function of plaque macrophages in a phenotype selective manner.",

To examine the effects of the cytoplasmic tail of CM2 on its biochemical properties, deletion and substitution mutations were introduced into CM2 cytoplasmic tail at residues 47\u2013115, and the expressed CM2 mutants were investigated. Although the cytoplasmic tail is not essential for the oligomerization of CM2, it may affect the degree of oligomerization. The residues 47\u201348, 67\u201369, 73\u201390 and 113\u2013115 were all required for the proper expression of CM2.

The C-terminal region at residues 61\u2013115 is not essential for CM2 transport to the cell surface, and a 14-amino-acid, but not an 11-amino-acid, cytoplasmic tail is sufficient for the cell surface expression of CM2.

In the current study, we functionally and clinically investigated KIF14 expression in patients with OSCC. Quantitative reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses were used to assess the KIF14 regulatory mechanism in OSCC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to analyze the correlation between KIF14 expression and clinical behavior in 104 patients with OSCC. A KIF14 knockdown model of OSCC cells (shKIF14 cells) was used for functional experiments. KIF14 expression was up-regulated significantly (P<0.05) in OSCCs compared with normal counterparts in vitro and in vivo. In addition, shKIF14 cells inhibited cellular proliferation compared with control cells by cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase through up-regulation of G2 arrest-related proteins (p-Cdc2 and cyclin B1). As expected, IHC data from primary OSCCs showed that KIF14-positive patients exhibited significantly (P<0.05) more larger tumors compared with KIF14-negative patients. The current results suggest for the first time that KIF14 is an indicator of tumoral size in OSCCs and that KIF14 might be a potential therapeutic target for development of new treatments for OSCCs.",

Here we found that substances in beetle grub hemolymph, after they were browned by aging for a month or heating for hours, reduced abnormal prion protein (PrP) levels in RML prion-infected cells. Active anti-prion components in the hemolymph were resistant to protease treatment and had molecular weights larger than 100\u00a0kDa. Aminoguanidine treatment of the hemolymph abolished its anti-prion activity, suggesting that Maillard reaction products are enrolled in the activity against the RML prion. However, levels of abnormal PrP in RML prion-infected cells were not decreased by incubation with the Maillard reaction products formed by amino acids or bovine serum albumin. The anti-prion components in the hemolymph modified neither cellular or cell-surface PrP levels nor lipid raft or autophagosome levels. The anti-prion activity was not observed in cells infected with 22\u00a0L prion or Fukuoka-1 prion, suggesting the anti-prion action is prion strain-dependent. Although the active components of the hemolymph need to be further evaluated, the present findings imply that certain specific chemical structures in the hemolymph, but not chemical structures common to all Maillard reaction products, are involved in RML prion formation or turnover, without modifying normal PrP expression.

We also compared apparent Vmax values for AcCoA hydrolysis and N-acetylation of the substrate para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Human NAT1 and its rodent analogs rat Nat2, mouse Nat2 and hamster Nat2 catalyzed AcCoA hydrolysis in a folate-dependent manner. Rates of AcCoA hydrolysis were between 0.25\u20131% of the rates for N-acetylation of PABA catalyzed by human NAT1 and its rodent orthologs. In contrast to human NAT1, human NAT2 and its rodent analogs rat Nat1, mouse Nat1, and hamster Nat1 did not hydrolyze AcCoA in a folate-dependent manner.

However, subsequent studies have indicated that other transporters make contributions to this process, and that URAT1 transports other organic anions besides urate (including several in common with the closely related multi-specific renal organic anion transporters, OAT1 (slc22a6) and OAT3 (slc22a8)). These findings raise the possibility that urate transport is not the sole physiological function of URAT1. We previously characterized mice null for the murine ortholog of URAT1 (mURAT1; previously cloned as RST), finding a relatively modest decrement in urate reabsorptive capacity. Nevertheless, there were shifts in the plasma and urinary concentrations of multiple small molecules, suggesting significant metabolic changes in the knockouts. Although these molecules remain unidentified, here we have computationally delineated the biochemical networks consistent with transcriptomic data from the null mice. These analyses suggest alterations in the handling of not only urate but also other putative URAT1 substrates comprising intermediates in nucleotide, carbohydrate, and steroid metabolism. Moreover, the analyses indicate changes in multiple other pathways, including those relating to the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans, methionine, and coenzyme A, possibly reflecting downstream effects of URAT1 loss. Taken together with the available substrate and metabolomic data for the other OATs, our findings suggest that the transport and biochemical functions of URAT1 overlap those of OAT1 and OAT3, and could contribute to our understanding of the relationship between uric acid and the various metabolic disorders to which it has been linked.",

Based on this observation, a series of KCNQ1 mutants were constructed to study molecular mechanisms of the KCNQ1 channel insensitivity toward natural scorpion toxins. Electrophysiological studies of chimera channels showed that the channel filter region controls KCNQ1 insensitivity toward the classical scorpion toxin ChTX. Interestingly, further residue mutant experiments showed that a single basic residue in the filter region determined the insensitivity of KCNQ1 channels toward scorpion toxins. Our present work showed that amino acid residue diversification at common sites controls the sensitivity and insensitivity of potassium channels toward scorpion toxins. The unique insensitivity mechanism of KCNQ1 toward natural scorpion toxins will accelerate the rational design of potent peptide inhibitors toward this channel.",

Lysosome/plasma membrane juxtaposition facilitates invasion by allowing for the release of lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin B, which contribute to matrix degradation. In this study we identified the sirtuin 1/sirtuin 2 (SIRT1/2) inhibitor cambinol acts as a drug that inhibits lysosome redistribution and tumor invasion. Treatment of cells with cambinol resulted in a juxtanuclear lysosome aggregation (JLA) similar to that seen upon treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist, troglitazone (Tro). Like Tro, cambinol required the activity of ERK1/2 in order to induce this lysosome clustering phenotype. However, cambinol did not require the activity of Rab7, suggesting that this drug causes JLA by a mechanism different from what is known for Tro. Additionally, cambinol-induced JLA was not a result of autophagy induction. Further investigation revealed that cambinol triggered JLA independently of its activity as a SIRT1/2 inhibitor, suggesting that this drug could have effects in addition to SIRT1/2 inhibition that could be developed into a novel anti-cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Aggregation of A\u03b2 peptides into amyloid plaques is considered to trigger the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), however the mechanism behind the AD onset has remained elusive. It is assumed that the insoluble A\u03b2 aggregates enhance oxidative stress (OS) by generating free radicals with the assistance of bound copper ions. The aim of our study was to establish the role of Met35 residue in the oxidation and peptide aggregation processes. Met35 can be readily oxidized by H2O2. The fibrillization of A\u03b2 with Met35 oxidized to sulfoxide was three times slower compared to that of the regular peptide. The fibrils of regular and oxidized peptides looked similar under transmission electron microscopy. The relatively small inhibitory effect of methionine oxidation on the fibrillization suggests that the possible variation in the Met oxidation state should not affect the in vivo plaque formation. The peptide oxidation pattern was more complex when copper ions were present: addition of one oxygen atom was still the fastest process, however, it was accompanied by multiple unspecific modifications of peptide residues. Addition of copper ions to the A\u03b2 with oxidized Met35 in the presence of H2O2, resulted a similar pattern of nonspecific modifications, suggesting that the one-electron oxidation processes in the peptide molecule do not depend on the oxidation state of Met35 residue. Thus, it can be concluded that Met35 residue is not a part of the radical generating mechanism of A\u03b2\u2013Cu(II) complex.",

In this paper, we show that the intronic region of Fbxl12 gene acts as an alternative promoter and induces expression of a short form of Fbl12 that lacks F-box domain (Fbl12\u0394F). We also found that UV irradiation increases Fbl12\u0394F mRNA in cells. Finally, Fbl12\u0394F may promote the subcellular localization of Fbl12 from nucleus to cytoplasm through their binding.

The catalytic domain is a shallow-grooved TIM-barrel. Heat-induced denaturation experiments of the wild-type and mutants resulting from the deletions of the two-Ig-like domains and the chitin binding domain reveal calorimetric profiles that are consistent with non-collaborative thermal unfolding of the individual domains, a property that must be associated to the \u201chinge-regions\u201d. The calorimetric measurements of the (\u03b2/\u03b1)8 catalytic domain reveal that the thermal unfolding is a slow-relaxation transition exhibiting a stable, partially structured intermediate state. Circular dichroism provides evidence that the intermediate exhibits features of a molten globule i.e., loss of tertiary structure while maintaining the secondary structural elements of the native. GdnHCl-induced denaturation studies of the TIM-barrel demonstrate an extraordinarily high resistance to the denaturant. Slow-relaxation kinetics characterize the unfolding with equilibration times exceeding six days, a property that is for the first time observed for a psychrophilic TIM barrel. On the other hand, the thermodynamic stability is \u0394G=6.75\u00b11.3\u00a0kcal/mol, considerably lower than for structural-insertions-containing barrels.

Currently, other physiological and pharmacological functions of EA are not well known. We examined the cytotoxicity of EA to murine colon carcinoma (colon-26) cells and the antitumor activity of EA in tumor-bearing mice. Cytotoxic activity of EA to colon-26 cells was evaluated by using the calcein-AM assay. EA showed the same cytotoxic activity to colon-26 cells as that of AA. The cytotoxicity of EA was shown to be caused by oxidative stress. Next, colon-26 tumor-bearing mice were iv administered EA and AA on alternate days for 4 times, and tumor growth rates were measured. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by administration of high-dose EA in vivo as well as AA. Finally, the in vivo biodistribution and clearance of EA and AA were investigated in tumor-bearing mice. Endogenous AA in the tumor was consumed to resist oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species that was generated by administered EA. These results indicated that the oxidative stress-mediated antitumor activity is one of the pharmacological functions of high-dose iv EA.",

TTR aggregation was studied, in vitro, by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in cell culture, through cytotoxicity assays.Tested flavonoids bound to TTR and stabilized the TTR tetramer, with different potencies. The flavonoids also inhibited in vitro formation of TTR small oligomeric species and in cell culture inhibited pathways involving caspase-3 activation and ER stress that are induced by TTR oligomers. In all assays performed the galloyl esters presented higher potency to inhibit aggregation than the non-gallated flavonoids tested.Our results highlight the presence of gallate ester moiety as key structural feature of flavonoids in chemical chaperoning of TTR aggregation. Upon binding to the native tetramer, gallated flavonoids redirect the TTR amyloidogenic pathway into unstructured nontoxic aggregation assemblies more efficiently than their non-gallated forms.Our findings suggest that galloyl moieties greatly enhance flavonoid anti-amyloid chaperone activity and this should be taken into consideration in therapeutic candidate drug discovery.",

To understand the ubiquity and diversity of the c-FLIP protein subfamily during evolution, c-FLIP orthologs were identified from a comprehensive range of vertebrates, including birds, amphibians, and fish, and were characterized by combining experimental and computational analysis. Predictions of three-dimensional protein structures and molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated that the conserved structural features of c-FLIP proteins are all derived from an ancestral caspase-8, although they rapidly diverged from the subfamily consisting of caspases-8, -10, and -18. The functional role of the c-FLIP subfamily members is nearly ubiquitous throughout vertebrates. Exogenous expression of non-mammalian c-FLIP proteins in cultured mammalian cells suppressed death receptor-mediated apoptosis, implying that all of these proteins possess anti-apoptotic activity. Furthermore, non-mammalian c-FLIP proteins induced NF-\u03baB activation much like their mammalian counterparts. The CFLAR mRNAs were synthesized during frog and fish embryogenesis. Overexpression of a truncated mutant of c-FLIP in the Xenopus laevis embryos by mRNA microinjection caused thorax edema and abnormal constriction of the abdomen. Depletion of cflar transcripts in zebrafish resulted in developmental abnormalities accompanied by edema and irregular red blood cell flow.

GABAergic signalling also plays a role during development, by promoting neural stem cell maintenance and renewal. To investigate the role of gabra2 in CNS development, gabra2 deficient zebrafish were generated. The pattern of proliferation during the embryonic development was disrupted in morphant embryos, which also displayed an increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei mainly at the mid- and hindbrain regions. The expression of several genes (notch1, pax2, fgf8 and wnt1) known to contribute to the development of the central nervous system was also affected in gabra2 morpholino-injected embryos, although no changes were found for pax6a and shh a expression. The transcriptional activity of neuroD (a proneural gene involved in early neuronal determination) was down-regulated in gabra2 deficient embryos, and the expression pattern of gad1b (GABA-synthesising enzyme GAD67) was clearly reduced in injected fish. I propose that gabra2 might be interacting with those signalling pathways that regulate proliferation, differentiation and neurogenesis during the embryonic development; thus, gabra2 might be playing a role in the differentiation of the mesencephalon and cerebellum. Given that changes in GABAergic circuits during development have been related to several psychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, this work might be helpful to understand the role of neurotransmitter systems during CNS development and to assess the developmental effects of several GABAergic drugs.",

The A\u03b2(16\u201322) sequence which has FF at the 19th and 20th positions would be a good model to investigate peptide self-assembly in the context of aromatic interactions.

We observe the formation of amyloid fibrils and other self-assembled structures such as spheres, rings and beads. Our results indicate that 20% HFIP is more favourable for amyloid fibril formation as compared to 20% TFE, when F is replaced with Y or W. The dissolution of peptides in DMSO followed by evaporation of solvent and dissolution in water appears to greatly influence peptide conformation, morphology and cross-\u03b2 content of self-assembled structures.

Pseudo-first order kinetic analyses show DTBA to be ~213 times faster than DTT and ~71 times faster than MEA in the formation of Fab\u05f3 antibody fragments from polyclonal rabbit antibodies. Monoclonal mouse antibodies were also used to show the feasibility of the reduction process on antibodies from a different species and with a different clonality. DTBA cleaved the monoclonal mouse F(ab)2 units most efficiently, ~2 times faster than DTT ~10 times faster than MEA. Due to the extremely quick reactivity of all the reducing agents in the first five minutes of monoclonal antibody reductions as well as for the DTBA reductions of the polyclonal rabbit antibodies, the pseudo-first order kinetic analyses should be interpreted qualitatively for these results. Nucleophilic sulfides on Fab\u05f3 fragments are preserved in the DTBA reduction process, demonstrated by their reactivity with Ellman\u05f3s reagent. Degradation of the Fab\u05f3 fragments was observed with the monoclonal mouse antibodies after reduction with DTBA or DTT. In conclusion, DTBA is the more efficient reducing agent compared to DTT and MEA, however, the reduction process should be optimized as degradation of the Fab\u05f3 fragments is possible.",

However, the contribution of each Hoogsteen base-pair at different positions to whole stability of the G-quadruplex has not been known. In this study, the effect of a deficiency of the Hoogsteen type hydrogen bond in the G-quadruplex stability was investigated. Spectral properties of meso-tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin (TMPyP) associated with various G-quadruplexes were also examined.The thermal stability of the thrombin-binding DNA aptamer 5\u2032G1G2TTG5G6TG8TG10G11TTG14G15 G-quadruplex, in which the guanine (G) base at 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8th positions was replaced with an inosine (I) base, one at a time, was investigated by circular dichroism (CD). The absorption, CD and fluorescence decay curve for the G-quadruplex associated TMPyP were also measured.The transition from the G-quadruplex to a single stranded form was endothermic and induced by an increase in entropy. The order in stability was 0>8>6>2>5>1, where the numbers denote the position of the replacement and 0 represents no replacements of the G base, suggesting the significant contribution of the G1 base in the stability of the G-quadruplex. Alteration in the spectral property of TMPyP briefly followed the order in thermal stability.Replacement of a G base with an I base resulted in destabilization of the G-quadruplex. The missing hydrogen bond at position 1 destabilized the G-quadruplex most efficiently. TMPyP binds near the I base-replaced location namely, the side of the G-quadruplex.The Hoogsteen base-pairing is confirmed to be essential in stabilization of G-quadruplex. When G is replaced with I, the latter base is mobile to interact with cationic porphyrin.",

The best-fit binding mode of \u03b1Glc 1-P dianion had the phosphate group placed anti relative to the glucosyl moiety (adopting a relaxed 4C1 chair conformation) and was stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds from residues of the enzyme\u05f3s catalytic triad (Asp196, Glu237 and Asp295) and from Arg137. Additional feature of the \u03b1Glc 1-P docking pose was an intramolecular hydrogen bond (2.7\u00a0\u00c5) between the glucosyl C2-hydroxyl and the phosphate oxygen. An inactive phosphonate analog of \u03b1Glc 1-P did not show binding to sucrose phosphorylase in different experimental assays (saturation transfer difference NMR, steady-state reversible inhibition), consistent with evidence from molecular docking study that also suggested a completely different and strongly disfavored binding mode of the analog as compared to \u03b1Glc 1-P. Molecular docking results also support kinetic data in showing that mutation of Phe52, a key residue at the catalytic subsite involved in transition state stabilization, had little effect on the ground-state binding of \u03b1Glc 1-P by the phosphorylase. However, when combined with a second mutation involving one of the catalytic triad residues, the mutation of Phe52 by Ala caused complete (F52A_D196A; F52A_E237A) or very large (F52A_D295A) disruption of the proposed productive binding mode of \u03b1Glc 1-P with consequent effects on the enzyme activity. Effects of positioning of \u03b1Glc 1-P for efficient glucosyl transfer from phosphate to the catalytic nucleophile of the enzyme (Asp196) are suggested.

During the exercise bout, dogs ran 5 miles at approximately 90% of VO2 max. PMBC were collected before exercise (baseline), immediately after exercise and after 24\u00a0h recovery.GLUT4 was measured via ELISA. Acute exercise resulted in a significant increase on surface GLUT4 content on PBMC. GLUT4 was increased significantly immediately after exercise (~50%; p<0.05) and reduced slightly by 24\u00a0h post-exercise as compared to baseline (~22%; p>0.05). An effect of acute exercise on GLUT4 levels translocated to the cell membrane was observed, with GLUT4 levels not yet returned to baseline after 24\u00a0h post-exercise. In conclusion, the present investigation demonstrated that acute high-intensity exercise increased GLUT4 content at the surface of PBMC of sled dogs as it has been reported in skeletal muscle in other species. Our findings underline the potential use of peripheral blood mononuclear cell GLUT4 protein content as minimally invasive proxy to investigate relationships between insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance, GLUT4 expression and glucose metabolism.",

Pathogenic mutations of hLADH cause severe metabolic diseases (atypical forms of E3 deficiency) that often escalate to cardiological or neurological presentations and even premature death; the pathologies are generally accompanied by lactic acidosis. hLADH presents a distinct conformation under acidosis (pH 5.5\u20136.8) with lower physiological activity and the capacity of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been shown by our laboratory that selected pathogenic mutations, besides lowering the physiological activity of hLADH, significantly stimulate ROS generation by hLADH, especially at lower pH, which might play a role in the pathogenesis of E3-deficiency in respective cases. Previously, we generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation the low-pH hLADH structure and analyzed the structural changes induced in this structure by eight of the pathogenic mutations of hLADH. In the absence of high resolution mutant structures these pieces of information are crucial for the mechanistic investigation of the molecular pathogeneses of the hLADH protein.

Interactions of these metals with biomembranes are important to understand their effects on our living cells. Here, we describe the membrane perturbations induced by these metals in human erythrocytes. Of these metals, Zn2+ ions only induced the erythrocyte agglutination. Histidine residues in extracellular domains of band 3 participated in Zn2+-induced agglutination. Interestingly, it was found that band 3-cytoskeleton interactions play an important role in Zn2+-induced agglutination. In contrast with Hg2+ and Cd2+ ions, Zn2+ ions greatly suppressed pressure-induced hemolysis by cell agglutination. Such a suppression was removed upon dissociation of agglutinated erythrocytes by washing, indicating the reversible interactions of Zn2+ ions with erythrocyte membranes. Excimer fluorescence of pyrene indicated that spectrin is denatured by a pressure of 200\u00a0MPa irrespective of hemolysis suppression. Taken together, these results suggest that the agglutination of erythrocytes due to the interactions of Zn2+ ions with band 3 is stable under pressure, but spectrin, cytoskeletal protein, is denatured by pressure",

Recently, we reported that REG I\u03b1 mRNA as well as its product were overexpressed in ductal epithelial cells in the minor salivary glands of Sj\u00f6gren\u05f3s syndrome (SS) patients. This study was undertaken to elucidate the role of cytokines and the subsequent intracellular mechanism for induction of REG I\u03b1 in the salivary glands of SS patients. We prepared a reporter plasmid containing REG I\u03b1 promoter (\u22121190/+26) upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The promoter plasmid was introduced by lipofection into human NS-SV-DC and rat A5 salivary ductal cells. The cells were treated with interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and a combination of the two. Thereafter transcriptional activity of REG I\u03b1 was measured by luciferase assay. We found that IL-6 stimulation, but not IL-8, significantly enhanced the REG I\u03b1 promoter activity in salivary ductal cells. Deletion analysis revealed that the region of \u2212141 to \u2212117 of the REG I\u03b1 gene was responsible for the promoter activation by IL-6, which contains a consensus sequence for signal transduction and activation of transcription (STAT). The introduction of siRNA for human STAT3 abolished IL-6-induced REG I\u03b1 transcription. These results showed that IL-6 stimulation induced REG I\u03b1 transcription through STAT3 activation and binding to the consensus sequence of REG I\u03b1 promoter in salivary ductal cells.

Signaling proteins preferably interact with PI(4,5)P2 through its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Efforts are underway to design small molecule-based antagonist, which can specifically inhibit the PI(4,5)P2/PH-domain interaction to establish an alternate strategy for the development of drug(s) for phosphoinositide signaling pathways.Surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, circular dichroism, competitive F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer, isothermal titration calorimetric analyses and liposome pull down assay were used.In this study, we employed 1,2,3-triazol-4-yl methanol containing small molecule (CIPs) as antagonists for PI(4,5)P2/PH-domain interaction and determined their inhibitory effect by using competitive-surface plasmon resonance analysis (IC50 ranges from 53 to 159\u00a0nM for PI(4,5)P2/PLC\u03b41-PH domain binding assay). We also used phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P3], phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate [PI(3,4)P2], PI(4,5)P2 specific PH-domains to determine binding selectivity of the compounds. Various physicochemical analyses showed that the compounds have weak affect on fluidity of the model membrane but, strongly interact with the phospholipase C \u03b41 (PLC\u03b41)-PH domains. The 1,2,3-triazol-4-yl methanol moiety and nitro group of the compounds are essential for their exothermic interaction with the PH-domains. Potent compound can efficiently displace PLC\u03b41-PH domain from plasma membrane to cytosol in A549 cells.Overall, our studies demonstrate that these compounds interact with the PIP-binding PH-domains and inhibit their membrane recruitment.These results suggest specific but differential binding of these compounds to the PLC\u03b41-PH domain and emphasize the role of their structural differences in binding parameters.

Thus, anchorage-independent growth and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which are features associated to anoikis-resistance, are vital steps in cancer progression and metastatic colonization. Cell attachment loss may induce intracellular oxidative stress, which triggers DNA damage as methylation changes. HaCaT lineage cells were submitted to periods of 1, 3, 5 and 24\u00a0h of anchorage blockage with the purpose of study of oxidative stress effect on changes in the DNA methylation pattern, derived from attachment blockade. Through this study, HaCaT anchorage blockage-induced oxidative stress was reported to mediate alterations in global DNA methylation changes and into TP53 gene promoter pattern during anoikis-resistance acquisition. Furthermore, at the first experimental time-periods (1, 3 and 5\u00a0h), genome hypermethylation was found; however, genome hypomethylation was observed in later time-periods (24\u00a0h) of attachment impediment. The TP 53 methylation analyses were performed after 24\u00a0h of replated anoikis-resistance cells and same methylation pattern was observed, occurring an early (1 and 3\u00a0h) hypermethylation that was followed by late (5 and 24\u00a0h) hypomethylation. However, LINE-1, a marker of genomic instability, was perceived in time-dependent hypomethylation. The mRNA levels of the DNMTs enzymes were influenced by cell attachment blockage, but non-conclusive results were obtained in order to match DNMTs transcription to pattern methylation results. In conclusion, DNA damage was found, leaded by oxidative stress that has come up from HaCaT anchorage blockade, which rises a global genome hypomethylation tendency as consequence, which might denote genomic instability.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of AGE and HQ on changes of human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell numbers and found that the viable cell numbers were markedly reduced by HQ by apoptosis and that AGE prevented the decreases of HQ-treated cell numbers by increased replicative DNA synthesis of RPE cells without changing apoptosis. Real-time RT-PCR revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A mRNA was increased by HQ treatment and the addition of HQ+AGE resulted in a further increment. The increase of VEGF secretion was confirmed by ELISA, and inhibition of VEGF signaling by chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA decreased the HQ+AGE-induced increases in RPE cell numbers. The deletion analysis demonstrated that \u2212102 to \u221243 region was essential for the VEGF-A promoter activation. Site-directed mutaions of specificity protein 1 (SP1) binding sequences in the VEGF-A promoter and RNA interference of SP1 revealed that SP1 is an essential transcription factor for VEGF-A expression.

The absence of microbial organisms as potential causal agents has given rise to the hypothesis that the inflammation is due to an autoimmune reaction. The defined inflamed areas of the skin lesions argue for an immunological disease with a local production of a causal antigen. Pso p27 is a protein generated in mast cells in psoriatic plaques, but not in uninvolved skin. We recently demonstrated that the Pso p27 is generated by cleavage of SerpinB3 (SCCA1) in the presence of mast cell associated chymase.In this communication we demonstrate by X-ray crystallographic analysis that the cleavage products associate into a complex similar to SCCA1, but with the reactive centre loop inserted into a 5-stranded central \u03b2-sheet.Native gel electrophoresis show that these Pso p27 complexes form large aggregates which may be of significance with respect to an immunogenic role of Pso p27.",

Cilostazol was incorporated into liposomes prepared from dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC). Liposome-delivery of cilostazol restored ATP release from DM2 erythrocytes to levels which were not different from that released from non-cilostazol treated healthy erythrocytes under the same conditions. There were no observed adverse effects of the liposomes on either healthy or DM2 erythrocytes. The directed liposomal delivery of PDE inhibitors to erythrocytes may help prevent or slow the development of peripheral vascular disease in individuals with DM2 by restoring an important physiological controller of microvascular perfusion while minimizing side effects associated with systemic delivery of some of these inhibitors.",

Development of accurate methods for the detection of GMOs is a prerequisite for the identification and control of authorized and unauthorized release of these engineered organisms into the environment and into the food chain. Current detection methods are unable to detect uncharacterized GMOs, since either the DNA sequence of the transgene or the amino acid sequence of the protein must be known for DNA-based or immunological-based detection, respectively.Here we describe the application of an epigenetics-based approach for the detection of mammalian GMOs via analysis of chromatin structural changes occurring in the host nucleus upon the insertion of foreign or endogenous DNA.Immunological methods combined with DNA next generation sequencing enabled direct interrogation of chromatin structure and identification of insertions of various size foreign (human or viral) DNA sequences, DNA sequences often used as genome modification tools (e.g. viral sequences, transposon elements), or endogenous DNA sequences into the nuclear genome of a model animal organism.The results provide a proof-of-concept that epigenetic approaches can be used to detect the insertion of endogenous and exogenous sequences into the genome of higher organisms where the method of genetic modification, the sequence of inserted DNA, and the exact genomic insertion site(s) are unknown.Measurement of chromatin dynamics as a sensor for detection of genomic manipulation and, more broadly, organism exposure to environmental or other factors affecting the epigenomic landscape are discussed.",

Glycyrrhizae radix has been widely used as a sweetener and a traditional medicine. A Glycyrrhizae radix extract contains many constituents and has antispasmodic, antitussive, anti-ulcer, and anti-inflammatory effects. However, reports comparing the anti-inflammatory effects of these constituents are very few. Here, we purified several constituents from the roots and stolons of G. uralensis and examined and compared their anti-inflammatory effects by monitoring the levels of the inflammatory mediator, nitric oxide (NO), in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-treated rat hepatocytes. From the G. uralensis extract, we purified the main constituent glycyrrhizin and the constituents that are characteristic of G. uralensis (chalcones and flavanones). These constituents suppressed NO production in IL-1\u03b2-treated rat hepatocytes, and isoliquiritigenin showed the greatest suppression activity. Isoliquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin significantly decreased both protein and mRNA for the inducible nitric oxide synthase. These constituents reduced the levels of mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and IL-6. In contrast, although glycyrrhizin is abundant, it showed a 100-fold lower potency in NO suppression. Therefore, both glycyrrhizin and the minor constituents (isoliquiritigenin, isoliquiritin, and liquiritigenin) may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of G. uralensis. It is also implied that these constituents may have a therapeutic potential for inflammatory hepatic disorders.",

Drug resistance mutations in PR that are selected during antiretroviral therapy lead to reduced efficacy of protease inhibitors (PI) including darunavir (DRV). To identify the structural mechanisms associated with the DRV resistance mutation L33F, we performed X-ray crystallographic studies with a multi-drug resistant HIV-1 protease isolate that contains the L33F mutation (MDR769 L33F). In contrast to other PR L33F DRV complexes, the structure of MDR769 L33F complexed with DRV reported here displays the protease flaps in an open conformation. The L33F mutation increases noncovalent interactions in the hydrophobic pocket of the PR compared to the wild-type (WT) structure. As a result, L33F appears to act as a molecular anchor, reducing the flexibility of the 30s loop (residues 29\u201335) and the 80s loop (residues 79\u201384). Molecular anchoring of the 30s and 80s loops leaves an open S1/S1\u2032 subsite and distorts the conserved hydrogen-bonding network of DRV.

     "abstract": "Atenolol, a \u03b21-adrenergic receptor blocker, is administered orally and its intestinal absorption has recently been indicated to be mediated by carrier protein and reduced markedly by ingestion of some fruit juices, such as apple and orange juices. This could be postulated to be a problem arising from the interaction of some components of fruit juices with atenolol at a transporter involved in its intestinal uptake, but the responsible transporter and its interacting components have not been identified yet. In an attempt to examine that possibility, we could successfully find that human organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1/SLC22A1), which is suggested to be expressed at the brush border membrane of enterocytes, is highly capable of transporting atenolol. In this attempt, OCT1 was stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells and the specific uptake of atenolol by the transporter was found to be saturable, conforming to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with the maximum transport rate (Vmax) of 4.00 nmol/min/mg protein and the Michaelis constant (Km) of 3.08\u00a0mM. Furthermore, the OCT1-specific uptake was found to be inhibited by various flavonoids, including those contained in fruit juices that have been suggested to interfere with intestinal atenolol absorption. Particularly, phloretin and quercetin, which are major components of apple juice, were potent in inhibiting OCT1-mediated atenolol transport with the inhibition constants of 38.0 and 48.0\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. It is also notable that the inhibition by these flavonoids was of the noncompetitive type. These results indicate that OCT1 is an atenolol transporter that may be involved in intestinal atenolol uptake and sensitive to fruit juices, although its physiological and clinical relevance remains to be further examined.",

Given that key elements of the energy pathway are evolutionary conserved, invertebrate research is an attractive alternative that overcomes the many legislative, financial and experimental hurdles typical of research with higher metazoan animals. Recent studies have suggested that some members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily are involved in lipid metabolism in addition to the traditional xenobiotic activity. To investigate this notion in more detail, the present study aimed to pinpoint phenotypic, genetic and genomic-level responses of Caenorhabditis elegans using selected deletion mutants including fat-5 (a member of the \u03949 desaturases) and cyp-35A2 (a member of the cytochrome P450 family). The creation of a fat-5(tm420);cyp-35A2(gk317) mutant uncovered that the deletion of both genes resulted in a strain which is marked by an extended lifespan. Furthermore, it diminished the overall level of Nile Red positive compartments, which is indicative of a change in lipid metabolism. Comprehensive transcriptomics revealed that several genes involved in aging and lipid transport/homeostasis were modulated following the double deletion of fat-5 and cyp-35A2. Taken together, the results suggest the presence of a putative correlation between longevity and lipid regulation and given that both genes have human homologs, this finding may offer a new lead to investigate in higher organisms.",

Current methods utilise non-covalent (physisorbtion) of tAK to surfaces, but this can be relatively easily removed. In this study, the covalent binding of tAK to surfaces was studied to provide an alternative model for surface contamination. Kinetic analysis showed that the efficiency of the enzyme expressed as the catalytic rate over the Michaelis constant (kcat/KM) increased from 8.45\u00b13.04\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 in solution to 32.23\u00b13.20 or 24.46\u00b14.41\u00a0mM\u22121\u00a0s\u22121 when the enzyme was immobilised onto polypropylene or plasma activated polypropylene respectively. Maleic anhydride plasma activated polypropylene showed potential to provide a more robust challenge for washing processes as it retained significantly higher amounts of tAK enzyme than polypropylene in simple washing experiments.

Measuring real-time oxygen consumption in siRNA-transfected INS-1E cells, we show that deleterious effects of palmitate on the glucose sensitivity of mitochondrial respiration and on the coupling efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation are independent of UCP2. Consistently, palmitate impairs GSIS to the same extent in cells with and without UCP2. Furthermore, we knocked down UCP2 in spheroid INS-1E cell clusters (pseudoislets) to test whether or not UCP2 regulates insulin secretion during prolonged glucose exposure. We demonstrate that there are no differences in temporal GSIS kinetics between perifused pseudoislets with and without UCP2. We conclude that UCP2 is not involved in palmitate-induced impairment of GSIS in INS-1E insulinoma cells and is not needed for the amplification of insulin release.

The expression of the AQP10 mRNA was examined by RT-PCR in the small intestine where human AQP10 is highly expressed.The genomic database of some mammals had insertions and deletions in the exons of the AQP10 gene, including cattle (Bos taurus), sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus). In the bovine AQP10 gene, exon 1 and 5 had deletions resulting in a frame-shift or a premature termination, respectively, which were confirmed by the direct exon sequencing of the genomic DNA. In the RT-PCR experiments, the PCR primer sets for exon 1/2 and exon 4/5 failed to detect the bands for AQP10 mRNA in the duodenum and jejunum. Similar AQP10 gene mutations were also confirmed in the genomic DNA from sheep and goats. Although these animals were derived from porcine ancestors, the exons of the swine (Sus scrofa) AQP10 gene were complete without mutations. Therefore, AQP10 gene might have turned to a pseudogene around 65 million years before when cattle evolved from porcine ancestors.AQP10 of ruminantia which regurgitate and rechew their food may have lost its role possibly due to the redundant expression of other aquaglyceroporins.",

EmrE confers resistance to a wide variety of quaternary cation compounds (QCCs) as an efflux transporter driven by proton motive force. The purification yield of most membrane proteins are challenging because of difficulties in over expressing, isolating and solubilizing them and the addition of an affinity tag often improves purification. The purpose of this study is to compare the structure and function of hexahistidinyl (His6) tagged (T-EmrE) and untagged (UT-EmrE) versions of EmrE. In vivo QCC resistance assays determined that T-EmrE demonstrated reduced resistance as compared to UT-EmrE. We isolated EmrE using the two different purification methods, an organic solvent extraction method used to isolate UT-EmrE and nickel affinity chromatography of T-EmrE. All proteins were solubilized in the same buffered n-dodecyl-\u03b2-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) detergent and their conformations were examined in the presence/absence of different QCCs. In vitro analysis of protein multimerization using SDS-Tricine PAGE and dynamic light scattering analysis revealed that both proteins predominated as monomers, but the formation of dimers was more constant and uniform in T-EmrE compared to UT-EmrE. The aromatic residue conformations of both proteins indicate that T-EmrE form is more aqueous exposed than UT-EmrE, but UT-EmrE appeared to have a more dynamic environment surrounding its aromatic residues. Using fluorescence to obtain QCC ligand-binding curves indicated that the two forms had differences in dissociation constants (Kd) and maximum specific one-site binding (Bmax) values for particular QCCs. In vitro analyses of both proteins demonstrated subtle but significant differences in multimerization and QCC binding. In vivo analysis indicates differences caused by the addition of the tag, we also observed differences in vitro that could be a result of the tag and/or the different purification methods.",

MM-1\u03b1 is also PDF5, a subunit of prefoldin that is chaperon comprised of six subunits and prevents misfolding of newly synthesized nascent polypeptides. Prefoldin also plays a role in quality control against protein aggregation. It has been reported that mice harboring the missense mutation L110R of MM-1\u03b1/PFD5 exhibit neurodegeneration in the cerebellum and also male infertility, but the phenotype of infertility has not been fully characterized. In this study, we first analyzed morphology of the testis and epididymis of L110R of MM-1\u03b1 mice. During differentiation of spermatogenesis, spermatogonia, spermatocytes and round spermatids were formed, but formation of elongated spermatids was compromised in L110R MM-1\u03b1 mice. Furthermore, reduced number/concentration of sperm in the epididymis was observed. MM-1\u03b1 was strongly expressed in the round spermatids and sperms with round spermatids, suggesting that MM-1\u03b1 affects the differentiation and maturation of germ cells. Changes in expression levels of spermatogenesis-related genes in mice testes were then examined. The fatty-acid-binding protein (fabp4) gene was up-regulated and three genes, including sperm-associated glutamate (E)-rich protein 4d (speer-4d), phospholipase A2-Group 3 (pla2g3) and phospholipase A2-Group 10 (pla2g10), were down-regulated in L110R MM-1\u03b1 mice. L110R MM-1\u03b1 and wild-type MM-1\u03b1 bound to regions of up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively.

With the exception of demetallated LF (apoLF) in urea, unfolding, as monitored by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, was found to follow a two-state (native to unfolded) mechanism. Analysis of the metal status of LF with 4-(2-pyridylazoresorcinol) (PAR) following urea or GdnHCl exposure suggests the enzyme to be capable of maintaining its metal ion passed the observed unfolding transition in a chelator-inaccessible form. Although an increase in the concentration of the denaturants eventually allowed the chelator access to the protein\u05f3s zinc ion, such process is not correlated with the release of the metal ion. Indeed, significant dissociation of the zinc ion from LF was not observed even at 6\u00a0M urea, and only high concentrations of GdnHCl (>3\u00a0M) were capable of inducing the release of the metal ion from the protein. Hence, the current study demonstrates not only the propensity of LF to tightly bind its zinc ion beyond the spectroscopically determined unfolding transition, but also the utility of PAR as a structural probe.",

     "abstract": "Phospholipases A2 (PLA2) are a group of enzymes that hydrolyze phospholipids at the sn-2 position, being present in all nature. In venomous animals, these proteins assume a special role, being able to exert diverse pharmacological effects. In this work, authors identified a new isoform of PLA2 in the venom of Porthidium hyoprora, which was isolated through sequential chromatographic steps and named PhTX-III. The enzyme was characterized biochemically and structurally. Structural studies using mass spectrometry confirmed an acidic secretory PLA2, family IIA, with molecular mass of 13,620.9\u00a0Da and identification of 86% of its primary sequence. PhTX-III did not exhibit myotoxic, anticoagulant or antibacterial effects, often present in this class of enzymes. Although, it was capable of initiate inflammatory response, with local edema and release of cytokines IL-1\u03b1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, probably due to mast cell degranulation.",

     "abstract": "C5a receptor (C5aR) is one of the major chemoattractant receptors of the druggable proteome that binds C5a, the proinflammatory polypeptide of complement cascade, triggering inflammation and SEPSIS. Here, we report the model structures of C5aR in both inactive and peptide agonist (YSFKPMPLaR; a=D-Ala) bound meta-active state. Assembled in CYANA and evolved over molecular dynamics (MD) in POPC bilayer, the inactive C5aR demonstrates a topologically unique compact heptahelical bundle topology harboring a \u03b2-hairpin in extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), derived from the atomistic folding simulations. The peptide agonist bound meta-active C5aR deciphers the \u201csite2\u201d at an atomistic resolution in the extracellular surface (ECS), in contrast to the previously hypothesized inter-helical crevice. With estimated Ki\u22482.75\u00a0\u03bcM, the meta-active C5aR excellently rationalizes the IC50 (0.1\u201313\u00a0\u03bcM) and EC50 (0.01\u20136\u00a0\u03bcM) values, displayed by the peptide agonist in several signaling studies. Moreover, with Ki\u22485.3\u00d7105\u00a0\u03bcM, the \u201csite2\u201d also illustrates selectivity, by discriminating the stereochemical mutant peptide (YSFkPMPLaR; k=D-Lys), known to be inert toward C5aR, up to 1\u00a0mM concentration. Topologically juxtaposed between the structures of rhodopsin and CXCR1, the C5aR models also display excellent structural correlations with the other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). The models elaborated in the current study unravel many important structural insights previously not known for regulating the agonist binding and activation mechanism of C5aR.",

     "abstract": "The P2 protein in Plasmodium falciparum has a high tendency to oligomerize, which seems to drive many of its non-ribosomal functions. During nuclear division of the parasite inside RBC, P2 translocates to the RBC surface as a tetramer. From a systematic study using variety of biophysical techniques, NMR spectral characteristics and relaxation dispersion measurements under different conditions of pH and/or urea concentrations, we deduce that (i) PfP2, an almost entirely helical protein, forms a molten globule monomer at low pH, (ii) at physiological pH, and at micro-molar concentrations, PfP2 is a stable tetramer wherein two dimmers associate sideways with close packing of helices at the interface, and (iii) the molten globule characteristic of the monomer is preserved in the tetramer. This dynamism in the structure of PfP2 may have functional implications since it is known that different kinds of oligomers are transiently formed in the parasite.",
